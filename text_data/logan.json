    "text": "Thank you for the introduction, Anil [Kashyap], and thank you for organizing this workshop and bringing focus to this important topic. I’m looking forward to sharing perspectives with Andrew [Hauser], drawing on our unique experiences in recent years as well as work that we led together for the Markets Committee at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).[1]\n\nI’m pleased that so many experts have joined us today to discuss central bank responses to financial market dysfunction. The repeated severe stresses in core markets around the world in recent years emphasize the need for two types of change. The public and private sectors must work together to enhance market resilience so that these episodes will be far less frequent going forward. And, to be prepared for those rare occasions when extreme stresses in core markets threaten financial stability or the macroeconomy, central banks must continue to develop the toolkit for mitigating dysfunction. Finding the best approaches will require a wide range of perspectives, and I’m looking forward to today’s conversations. Before I proceed, let me note that these views are mine and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nCore bond markets, such as those for government debt, are crucial to the economy—not only because national governments obtain financing in these markets, but also because these markets are used for implementing monetary policy, provide a safe source of collateral and establish a benchmark yield curve that underpins financing for households, businesses, and state and local governments.[2]\n\nBreakdowns of trading and price discovery in core markets thus put a vast array of economic activity at risk. But I would emphasize that the type of dysfunction I have in mind is more extreme than merely low liquidity. I am referring, rather, to fundamental failures in the process of intermediating between buyers and sellers, or lenders and borrowers, and identifying a market-clearing price for their transactions.\n\nThe U.S. financial system has become increasingly vulnerable to core market dysfunction because the supply of intermediation has not kept pace with demand as the Treasury market’s size and complexity have grown.[3] Treasury debt held by the public rose from 35 percent of GDP at the end of 2007 to about 95 percent of GDP in late 2022. And a growing share of the debt is held by investors such as hedge funds and mutual funds that trade more frequently or rely on the ability to quickly monetize assets when needed. Meanwhile, primary dealers, which are major intermediaries in these markets, have not increased the balance sheet devoted to Treasury holdings and Treasury repurchase agreements (repos) since 2007—even in nominal terms. The rise of electronic trading has also shifted intermediation toward principal trading firms, which typically hold less capital with which to absorb shocks, and increased the pace at which market developments unfold.\n\nThese themes are similar globally, and core markets around the world have repeatedly experienced dysfunction that posed risks to the broader economy.[4] The source of each stress episode has been unique, and each central bank intervention has been crafted to address the specific problems of the day. Yet, despite the varied initial shocks, central banks have faced a common problem: how to support market functioning without undermining the features that make these markets so important in the first place.\n\nThat central problem is the first of three topics I’ll address today. I’ll then offer three guideposts that I believe should shape central bank interventions given this problem: transparency, backstop pricing and distinguishing support for market functioning from monetary accommodation. And finally, I’ll assess our March 2020 operations in light of these guideposts and draw out some implications for market regulation and infrastructure and for the central bank toolkit.\n\nThe central problem\nCentral banks should rarely intervene to support the functioning of core markets, but when such interventions are needed, they must be effective. At one level, intervening effectively should be straightforward. Central banks have powerful tools and, in principle, need only deploy them in sufficient size. But at another level, it is not at all straightforward to intervene in a way that ensures core markets continue to serve their crucial roles in the financial system.\n\nAs the Inter-Agency Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) indicated in its 2021 principles for the Treasury market, good market functioning is multifaceted.[5] In a well-functioning market, participants can efficiently buy, sell and borrow against assets. These transactions take place at prices that reflect economic and financial fundamentals. And there are minimal price distortions due to technical factors, externalities or frictions between closely related markets.\n\nIf, say, a rush of sales in the government bond market overwhelms intermediaries’ capacity to absorb the sales and find buyers, it is straightforward in principle for the central bank to step in and purchase some of the assets. But such an intervention may create risks and spillovers that would undermine other aspects of market functioning. Excessive purchases might crowd out private buyers. Poorly calibrated purchases could also push prices—of the specific securities purchased or of other securities—to a different level than would prevail in a well-functioning market. By removing duration from the market, the central bank’s purchases could reduce term premia and create a degree of monetary accommodation that policymakers might view as inappropriate given the macroeconomic fundamentals. And the mere potential for central bank intervention may create distortions, especially if market participants become overconfident and do not appropriately manage their own risks.\n\nIn the end, an intervention that substitutes one form of dysfunction for another may not represent an improvement. The problem is simply that avoiding this is easier said than done, because an intervention that improves the market’s functioning in one respect may change incentives in ways that impede the market’s functioning in other respects. Yet, in severe circumstances, refusing entirely to intervene would put the central bank’s fundamental macroeconomic and financial stability objectives at risk.\n\nGuideposts\nCentral banking is an imperfect art, often practiced under great time pressure and with incomplete information. So it is useful to have some guideposts to aim for in designing interventions in those rare instances when they are needed—though I do not view these guideposts as rigid rules that can or must be achieved in every instance.\n\nThe accumulated knowledge of central bankers and scholars provides a wealth of such guideposts. From my own experience, three stand out as particularly important for mitigating the side effects of market functioning interventions:\n\nTransparency.\nBackstop pricing.\nDistinguishing support for market functioning from monetary accommodation.\nTransparency is fundamental across many central bank activities. We must be transparent about how we carry out our responsibilities so that we remain accountable to the public we serve.\n\nAnd transparency has special importance for promoting smooth market functioning. By clearly explaining how it is designing and carrying out its operations, a central bank can help ensure that all market participants have an equal opportunity to trade and have equal information about how the operations will influence the market. This is a matter of basic fairness. It promotes diversity in the market ecosystem. And by reducing uncertainty about the central bank’s activities, transparency helps ensure that prices reflect economic and financial fundamentals.\n\nThe second guidepost, backstop pricing, is one that we also emphasized in the report Andrew and I led for the Markets Committee. If a central bank’s operations are out of the money relative to normal market prices, then, when the market is functioning normally, no one will transact with the central bank. And when the market is not functioning normally, transactions with the central bank will generally push prices back toward the normal level. Thus, the risks of distorting prices or crowding out private activity are mitigated. Operations at a backstop price will naturally wind down when market functioning recovers. And pricing an operation as a backstop helps to make it transparent and distinguish it from monetary accommodation.\n\nThe third guidepost, distinguishing support for market functioning from monetary accommodation, recognizes that central banks have multiple goals. A central bank’s tools for supporting market functioning involve lending against assets or buying them. These are the same operations that are used to provide monetary accommodation. But, while smooth market functioning is critical to good macroeconomic outcomes, the scale of lending or asset purchases that is appropriate to support market functioning may not be the same as the scale appropriate to support aggregate demand.\n\nThe need to distinguish support for market functioning from monetary accommodation is most obvious when monetary policymakers are trying to tighten financial conditions to reduce inflation. However, even when policymakers are trying to ease financial conditions to boost economic growth, they may benefit from the ability to adjust the amount of monetary accommodation separately from actions to support market functioning.\n\nImplications\nThree years ago this month, the Federal Reserve took forceful steps to respond to disruptions in core markets at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other actions, we offered up to $1 trillion per day in overnight repos with primary dealers, plus additional term repos. And we purchased Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at an unprecedented speed and scale.\n\nThe scope and purpose of our operations evolved. In March 2020, with purchases peaking at more than $100 billion per day, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said the program’s goal was to support smooth market functioning and the transmission of monetary policy. By June, as market functioning improved, we reduced the pace of purchases to $80 billion per month in Treasuries and $40 billion per month in MBS. The FOMC also changed its statement in June 2020 to say the purchases were meant to “sustain” rather than “support” smooth market functioning, and in September 2020, the FOMC added a second goal: to foster accommodative financial conditions.\n\nHaving led the Fed’s trading desk during this period, I may not have an unbiased perspective, but I don’t think there is any doubt that our actions succeeded in restoring smooth functioning of core markets. Still, it is appropriate to reflect on what the experience teaches us about how to better support market functioning in the future. The guideposts I just described provide a helpful framework for this reflection.\n\nRepos measure up nicely, in part because their duration is short and in part because they can be priced as a backstop to the monetary policy target. The offering of practically unlimited repos was also straightforward to communicate transparently. These characteristics minimize the potential negative side effects of repos. In fact, the side effects of repos can be so well mitigated that the FOMC decided in 2021 to make backstop repos a standing part of our operations through the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) and the Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) Repo Facility.[6]\n\nHowever, repos do not solve all problems. Smooth market functioning requires both funding liquidity, or the ability to borrow against an asset, and market liquidity, or the ability to easily buy and sell the asset. Repos directly support only funding liquidity. Moreover, repos directly provide funding only to the central bank’s counterparties. A central bank’s ability to support funding liquidity for the broader market depends on its counterparties’ willingness and ability to serve as intermediaries, which may be particularly limited during stress episodes.\n\nThus, as we saw in March 2020, purchase operations can be necessary both to directly support market liquidity and to influence market conditions for participants beyond the central bank’s counterparties. But purchases can pose challenges relative to all three guideposts.\n\nMonetary policy does not provide a benchmark for backstop prices on longer-term securities, unless a central bank is engaged in yield curve control. In addition, the deterioration of market functioning in March 2020 reduced the reliability of market indicators that could have helped derive a backstop price.\n\nIn consequence, we offered to buy fixed quantities of securities, evaluating the offers received in a multiple-price auction against both market prices and measures of relative value. While this approach was extremely effective in addressing dysfunction, it was not easy to provide a transparent link between the operation sizes and the degree of dysfunction.\n\nMoreover, while our market functioning purchases aimed to affect the flow of transactions, we could not avoid also changing the amount of duration risk held by the private sector and thus having some effect on term premia through a portfolio balance channel. The resulting monetary accommodation was appropriate following the large negative shock from the pandemic. But it did blur the signals about how we calibrated the size of our purchases.\n\nTo me, this experience has three implications.\n\nFirst, because both actual interventions and the potential to intervene can have side effects, central banks and other authorities should strive to reduce the need for intervention.\n\nI’m pleased by the relevant authorities’ ongoing focus on enhancing Treasury market resilience. Importantly, the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed to expand the scope of central clearing of Treasury transactions.[7] Research by the Dallas Fed’s staff highlights that expanded central clearing would have four key benefits: uniform risk management standards, reduced balance sheet intensity of repo intermediation, reduced settlement risks and improvements in transparency.[8] In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority last month began releasing daily statistics on Treasury trading volume and average prices, while the Office of Financial Research has proposed to close gaps in the collection of data on bilateral repos—both steps that will enhance transparency in the market—and the Federal Reserve Board’s holistic review of bank capital standards is evaluating, among other factors, the effects of leverage ratio requirements on Treasury market liquidity.[9], [10]\n\nI am optimistic that with continued reforms, we can make core markets resilient enough that interventions to support market functioning will be extraordinarily rare.\n\nSecond, because repos typically have far fewer drawbacks than outright purchases, central banks should work to enhance the efficacy of repo tools. While repos directly provide only funding liquidity, improvements in funding liquidity can enhance market liquidity as long as the funding liquidity reaches the right market participants, whether as direct counterparties of the central bank or through onward lending from direct counterparties.\n\nFor example, in March 2020, some foreign official holders sold Treasury securities for precautionary reasons to ensure they would have cash if needed. Only at the end of that month did the Fed establish a temporary FIMA Repo Facility—since made into a standing facility—to provide funding to foreign and international monetary authorities.[11] Had the facility been available sooner, it could have reduced precautionary sales and thereby improved the balance between the supply of and the demand for market liquidity. Transparency about the availability of the FIMA Repo Facility makes our repo operations more effective and should reduce the likelihood of needing to employ purchases to support market functioning in the future. The SRF does the same for domestic counterparties.\n\nCentral banks can also enhance the reach of repo operations by reducing existing counterparties’ cost of intermediating to the broader market. For example, the FOMC could further consider the potential benefits of centrally clearing SRF operations, as several committee participants suggested in a 2021 meeting.[12] Central clearing would reduce our counterparties’ balance sheet costs by allowing them to net funding received from the facility against onward lending to other market participants.\n\nFinally, when purchase operations are appropriate to support market functioning, it would be desirable to have options for clearly distinguishing these operations from monetary accommodation.\n\nOne approach, following the recent example of the Bank of England, could be for a central bank to separately track assets purchased to support market functioning and sell these holdings in a timely way once market functioning has normalized—independent of the direction of monetary policy at that time. The expectation of timely sales would limit the asset purchases’ effect on term premia.\n\nBut this approach could be complicated if the central bank were simultaneously buying assets to provide accommodation. And even if assets purchased to support market functioning are held in a separate portfolio, there remains the difficult question of what price to offer for them—both to ensure purchases take place at a backstop price and to distinguish market functioning interventions from operations to provide monetary accommodation.\n\nTo see why this question is difficult, it’s helpful to start with some cases where it is less difficult. MBS are typically priced at a spread to comparable-duration Treasuries, for example, using option-adjusted models. Option-adjusted spreads vary within a relatively limited range when the market is functioning smoothly. It would therefore be possible in theory—though even this would be operationally complex, so I mean this only as a thought experiment and not as a policy proposal—to support the functioning of the MBS market by offering to purchase MBS at a much higher spread to Treasuries than the range that normally prevails. Such a backstop price for MBS would avoid crowding out normal private transactions in MBS and allow monetary policy and private market trading to continue to influence the Treasury yield curve. Similarly, if severe market dysfunction caused large deviations between the prices of economically similar instruments, such as two Treasury securities of similar durations, it would be possible in theory to establish a backstop price for one of those securities by reference to the market price of the other.\n\nBut this process cannot go on forever. Eventually, we will run out of other securities to refer to. There will be one last security, or one last core group of securities, for which we have no other reference price. As the philosophers say, it can’t be turtles all the way down.\n\nThere is, as I alluded to earlier, one case where the central bank has a price to use as a reference even for those very last securities. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Japan have at times implemented monetary policy through yield curve control. In that case, the yield caps established by monetary policy provide a natural reference point for backstop market functioning purchases. But this example simply shows why choosing the reference price is so consequential. At least in some circumstances, it may require determining where the yield curve belongs, which is the opposite of distinguishing market functioning from monetary accommodation and of letting the private market discover the price based on fundamentals.\n\nSo, in the spirit of a research workshop, let me conclude with some questions for further investigation. How should central banks establish prices when they buy securities to support market functioning? What methods can be employed to establish a backstop price for some core securities by referring to market prices of other securities? How effective would this be? And are there ways to establish backstop prices across the entire yield curve while still distinguishing that operation from monetary accommodation? Turning to broader topics, what further innovations can make central banks’ lending tools more effective? And what additional reforms, besides the ambitious road map that the U.S. authorities have laid out, can further enhance market resilience?\n\nThank you.\n\nNotes\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\n“Market dysfunction and central bank tools,” by the Bank for International Settlements Markets Committee, 2022.\nCentral banks typically view core markets as including, at minimum, cash and repo markets for government securities as well as short-term money markets.\nSee, for example, “Still the World’s Safe Haven: Redesigning the U.S. Treasury Market After the COVID-19 Crisis,” by Darrell Duffie, Hutchins Center Working Paper no. 62, Brookings Institution, 2020; “Enhancing Liquidity of the U.S. Treasury Market Under Stress,” by Nellie Liang and Pat Parkinson, Hutchins Center Working Paper no. 72, Brookings Institution, 2020; “U.S. Treasury Markets: Steps Toward Increased Resilience,” by G30 Working Group on Treasury Market Liquidity, 2021; “Task Force on Financial Stability,” by Glenn Hubbard et al., Brookings Institution and University of Chicago Booth School of Business, 2021; “Recent Disruptions and Potential Reforms in the U.S. Treasury Market: A Staff Progress Report,” by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2021.\nSee, for example, “Holistic Review of the March Market Turmoil,” by the Financial Stability Board, 2020; “Open Market Operations During 2019,” by the Markets Group of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, report prepared for the Federal Open Market Committee, 2020; “Understanding Recent Fluctuations in Short-Term Interest Rates,” by Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, Chicago Fed Letter no. 423, 2019; “The Federal Reserve’s Market Functioning Purchases: From Supporting to Sustaining,” by Lorie K.

    "text": "Dallas Fed President Lorie K. Logan delivered these remarks at the ninth joint energy conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Kansas City.\nThank you, Kunal [Patel], for the kind introduction. And welcome, everyone, to the Dallas Fed. I am so excited to be here today, to welcome my colleague Jeff Schmid, president of the Kansas City Fed, back to Dallas, and to welcome all of you to the Dallas and Kansas City Feds’ ninth joint energy conference. Thank you, as well, to the dedicated teams from Dallas and Kansas City who have worked so hard to make this event possible and to all of today’s speakers for sharing your expertise with us.\n\nBoth the Dallas and Kansas City banks have invested deeply in understanding the energy economy. Together, our districts empower the nation, contributing nearly 40 percent of the U.S. energy sector’s GDP. At the Dallas Fed, we’re committed to leading the energy conversation through our research at the intersection of energy and economics. That research includes academic publications, analysis, surveys and extensive engagement with industry leaders through our Energy Advisory Council, individual outreach and conferences like this one.\n\nOur research teaches us that the energy landscape is constantly evolving. This year’s conference, for example, will focus on how the industry is meeting rising power demand from users such as artificial intelligence data centers that were hardly on the radar just a few years ago. Dialogue with experts like you is crucial to helping us stay abreast of these changes in real time, and I’m so grateful to all of you who share your insights. As the energy industry evolves, the topics we study cover an increasingly wide range. Just this year, the Dallas Fed’s energy team has published analysis on topics from oil sanctions against Russia to the potential for new nuclear generation in Texas. I encourage you to check out our website to access our research, view our survey findings and even sign up to participate in our energy survey panel if your firm is eligible.\n\nBesides energy itself , we’re devoting more attention to the wires, pipes and pumps that move energy from its sources to wherever it’s needed. There is an enormous amount of energy in West Texas, for example—in the hydrocarbons under the ground, in the wind and in the sun’s rays. But whether that energy can move out of West Texas to meet the world’s demand depends on the capacity and resilience of infrastructure such as ports, pipelines, electric grids and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities.\n\nAs part of my own learning about energy infrastructure, I recently visited some of our Texas ports and got to observe oil tankers and LNG carriers up close. Seeing these enormous ships in person brought to mind an essay I once read about how captains train to safely and effectively pilot them. [1] A key lesson was that the right way to maneuver a ship depends on the depth of the water. In shallow harbors, water becomes trapped between the ship bottom and the seafloor and drags along with the ship as it moves, making the vessel more difficult to steer. The faster the ship goes, the more water it displaces and the greater this difficulty becomes. Moreover, captains can’t always be sure precisely how deep the water is, because sometimes the depth finder registers mud on the seafloor as water. And so in water that’s shallow, or that might be shallow, captains learn to slow down, take their time and maneuver carefully.\n\nI may never have the opportunity to pilot a VLCC [2]—though if anyone here today can help me out with that, please see me afterward—but reading about this topic i sn’t purely recreational for me. These lessons also have relevance for me as a central banker.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has made a great deal of progress bringing down inflation and restoring balance to the economy. In light of that progress, I’ve supported the FOMC’s decisions at recent meetings to reduce interest rates toward a more neutral level—to dock the ship. But as the economy nears the harbor, it becomes more important to understand just how deep the water is. And with less room to maneuver, monetary policymakers need to be more prepared for winds and waves that could push us off course. Just like a ship captain, I think it behooves us to proceed cautiously at this point.\n\nIn the rest of my remarks, I’ll review the economic and monetary policy outlook, with an emphasis on how maneuvering cautiously and taking time to learn can help manage some key risks. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\n\nThe economic outlook\nThe first time I spoke at this conference was two years ago, and as I’m sure you recall, inflation back then was much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. But as of mid-2022, prices had risen more than 7 percent since a year earlier. Soaring prices strained the budgets of families and businesses and had the potential to destabilize our economy over time.\n\nAt the same time, the labor market was incredibly strong—by many measures, unsustainably so. With companies adding jobs faster than the labor force was adding workers, wages surged. While those higher wages weren’t enough for many workers to keep pace with the cost of living, the wage pressures threatened to cause businesses to raise prices even more.\n\nThe FOMC responded by rapidly tightening monetary policy. We raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 5.25 percentage points from early 2022 through mid-2023. We also began running off securities holdings that we had accumulated to support the economy during the pandemic.\n\nThese measures helped bring the economy into much better balance. The most recent annual PCE inflation reading was 2.1 percent. Progress on inflation has been broad based; it’s not just a few outlying price categories that have cooled. You can see that in the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate, which removes outliers and has fallen from a peak of 5 percent two years ago to 2.65 percent on an annual basis in September. At the same time, that 2.65 percent reading suggests we’re not quite back to price stability yet. While the Fed’s inflation target covers the prices of all consumer goods and services, measures like the trimmed mean that exclude volatile outliers can provide a better read than the headline number on where overall inflation will head in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, economic activity remains resilient, according to both national statistics and more timely but less formal reports from business and community leaders. The Dallas Fed’s contacts overwhelmingly describe a strong economy with robust consumer demand and fading downside risks. And the labor market has been cooling gradually, not weakening materially. Unemployment held steady in October, and although strikes and hurricanes brought payroll job growth to a temporary halt that month, job gains from July through September averaged close to estimates of the amount needed to keep pace with population growth.\n\nAfter a voyage through rough waters, we’re in sight of the shore: the FOMC’s Congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices. But we haven’t tied up yet, and risks remain that could push us back out to sea or slam the economy into the dock too hard.\n\nThe economy, of course, is subject to a wide range of risks. But I am paying particular attention to three that, in my view, pose the largest potential challenges for monetary policy in the months ahead.\n\nOne, unexpectedly strong demand or negative supply shocks could keep inflation above the FOMC’s 2 percent goal.\nTwo, tightening financial conditions could trigger a rapid deterioration in the labor market.\nOr, three, financial conditions could ease too much if the neutral interest rate, the theoretical level that would neither slow nor accelerate the economy, proves to be higher than expected.\nI’ll discuss each of these risks in turn.\nUpside risk to inflation\nFirst, returning inflation to target requires keeping aggregate demand in balance with aggregate supply. Yet strong demand persistently pushed real activity above forecasters’ projections in 2024. And the supply side of the economy, though currently healthy, has experienced unusually disruptive shocks in recent years. Both dynamics pose upside risks to inflation.\n\nIn late September, the Bureau of Economic Analysis issued its annual revision of the National Economic Accounts. Personal income turned out to be significantly higher than previously estimated. This finding helped explain why spending has been strong, and it resolved a mystery about the savings rate, which the data now show is at a relatively normal level rather than historically low. But higher incomes could also push consumption above current forecasts. The implications aren’t entirely clear-cut, however. If higher incomes and spending result from stronger productivity growth, they may not mean demand is moving out of balance with supply.\n\nI also keep hearing about a possible post-election surge in business investment. All fall, companies said they knew they were going to invest, but they were waiting to see the contours of fiscal and regulatory policies before deciding how to invest. With the election complete, some of that uncertainty is resolved. Just like consumption, a rise in investment could push upward on inflation.\n\nOn the supply side, I remain attentive to inflation risks from potential supply chain disruptions and geopolitical developments. The recent port strike was too short to leave a lasting mark, but workers and port operators have agreed to revisit their contract in January, so risks remain. Strains on electric grids represent another potential source of supply bottlenecks. I am also closely watching the conflict in the Middle East. As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said, while the human toll is devastating, the Federal Reserve’s institutional role is a limited one: to monitor the economic implications. U.S. and global energy markets are somewhat slack, which has held down risk premiums in oil prices. But the potential for more significant disruptions cannot be ruled out.\n\nKeeping inflation under control also requires well-anchored inflation expectations. Market-based measures of shorter-term inflation compensation have been volatile recently, although longer-term measures remain consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent goal. If inflation expectations were to become unanchored, the upside risks would only increase.\n\nIn coming months, we’ll learn more about how inflation expectations are evolving and how the supply-side risks and consumption and investment are playing out—information that will be valuable for shaping monetary policy.\n\nDownside risk to employment\nA second key risk relates to employment. I’m not taking too much signal from the dismal October payrolls print of just 12,000 net jobs added nationwide. It’s too hard to tell how hurricanes influenced that number.\n\nMy base case is that the labor market is close to balanced and stable or cooling gradually. That judgment reflects the stable unemployment rate in recent months; the slowdown in job openings, quits and compensation; and positive reports from the Dallas Fed’s business contacts. For instance, employment at temporary help services has been sagging in the national statistics. Weak temp employment can sometimes be a leading indicator of a downturn. But when our team called staffing firms to check on the situation, they told us the statistics reflect post-pandemic normalization and competition from gig-work platforms, not a broader deterioration in the labor market.\n\nStill, I’m not ready to rule out more damaging decreases in employment. Some labor market indicators still show a bit of underlying weakness. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised down its estimates of payroll job growth for August and September, and you can’t wave off those revisions as the results of hurricanes and strikes that hadn’t yet happened.\n\nFinancial conditions represent another source of concern about the employment outlook. Monetary policy influences economic activity only indirectly, because while the FOMC controls the overnight fed funds rate, most households and businesses pay longer-term interest rates that also reflect their creditworthiness. So I closely monitor the evolution of those longer-term rates and other financial market indicators.\n\nSince the FOMC began cutting the fed funds target in September, the 10-year Treasury yield has actually risen by roughly three-quarters of a percentage point. Some of that rise reflects expectations for a higher path of policy rates. And, so far, higher equity valuations and tighter credit spreads have offset the tightening in financial conditions from higher Treasury yields. But a substantial fraction of the increase in long-term yields appears to reflect a rise in term premiums. Term premiums compensate investors for bearing the risk of future interest rate fluctuations. Higher term premiums can tighten financial conditions for any given setting of monetary policy and thereby slow the economy more than the FOMC intends. If term premiums continue to rise, the FOMC may need less restrictive policy, all else equal, to accomplish its goals.\n\nUncertainty about the neutral interest rate\nUncertainty about the neutral interest rate presents the opposite risk. Besides examining broad financial conditions, economists often consider whether monetary policy is boosting or slowing growth and inflation by comparing the policy rate to a theoretical level, the neutral rate or r-star, that would represent neither a headwind nor a tailwind. That neutral rate is notoriously uncertain and difficult to measure. But you can get a sense for it from economic fundamentals, models, surveys and market prices.\n\nA strategy of repeatedly lowering the fed funds target range toward a more neutral level relies on confidence that the neutral level is materially lower than where rates are now. When I look at the available evidence, though, I see substantial signs that the neutral rate has increased in recent years, and some hints that it could be very close to where the fed funds rate is now.\n\nStructural changes in the economy, such as the energy transition and advances in artificial intelligence, are prime drivers. These developments are fueling strong investment demand and potential increases in productivity. When you all, as energy experts, see a new LNG plant, a solar farm or a data center under construction, you perhaps see sources of energy supply and demand. As a monetary policymaker, I certainly see how these projects change the energy landscape, but what I also see—what you’ll perhaps see after today—is higher investment and a higher neutral rate.\n\nImportantly, uncertainty about the neutral rate has also risen, perhaps because the structural changes in the economy are relatively recent and will take time to fully assess. The FOMC’s own projections display the uncertainty. Four times a year, we release our projections for the fed funds rate as well as unemployment, inflation and GDP growth. Around the FOMC table, participants’ projections for the longer-run fed funds rate now vary by more than 1 percentage point, compared with a spread about half as wide two years ago.\n\nEconomists employ a range of models to try to estimate the neutral rate. Like estimates from policymakers and from market participants who fill out surveys, the output of these models ranges widely. Among widely consulted models, point estimates of the neutral real interest rate currently range from 0.74 percent to 2.60 percent. Adding in the 2 percent inflation target, those figures correspond to a neutral fed funds rate of 2.74 to 4.60 percent. Following last week’s rate cut, the fed funds rate stands today at 4.58 percent, right at the top of that range.\n\nNow, I don’t know which estimate is right. Time will tell as the economy evolves and we see how much of a headwind or tailwind the policy stance generates. But when policymakers look at mid-range estimates that suggest there’s meaningful room to cut before reaching neutral, I think we should recall the technique of a ship captain whose depth finder might mistake mud for water. If we cut too far, past neutral, inflation could reaccelerate and the FOMC could need to reverse direction. In these uncertain but potentially very shallow waters, I believe it’s best to proceed with caution.\n\nConclusion\nLet me conclude. Economic activity is strong, inflation is coming down and the economy is approaching a point that can sustainably deliver both maximum employment and stable prices. I anticipate the FOMC will most likely need more rate cuts to finish the journey. But it’s difficult to be sure how many cuts may be needed and how soon they may need to happen. I am keeping an open mind, scrutinizing economic data and financial conditions, and listening carefully to business and community contacts as I assess what next steps may be appropriate for monetary policy.\n\nThank you for your attention and for joining us today. I look forward to learning from all of you during today’s discussions and to continued engagement with you about both energy topics and the broader economy.\n\nNotes\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and Rebecca Zarutskie for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\nJohn McPhee, “The Ships of Port Revel,” The Atlantic Monthly 282(4), October 1998, pages 67–80.\nVery large crude carrier, a type of tanker that typically carries about 2 million barrels of crude oil."

    "text": "Remarks at the 2021 Financial Crisis Forum, Panel on Lessons for Emergency Lending (delivered via videoconference)As prepared for delivery\nThank you to the Yale Program on Financial Stability and to the Bank for International Settlements for the invitation to speak at today’s forum.1  Financial crises can have deep and lasting effects on the economy.  They disrupt the vital flow of credit, damage business and household balance sheets, and result in lost jobs and income for the American public.  Given these costs, it is critical that we learn the lessons of past crises and continue to build knowledge about the tools and interventions that will help us respond effectively in the future.  Discussions like the one we’ll have today are valuable opportunities to evolve our thinking on policy implementation and crisis management.        \n\nToday, I’ll share some lessons I’ve taken from two crises that occurred during my time implementing monetary policy: the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the coronavirus pandemic shock.  I’ll discuss liquidity shocks and how central bank actions address them.  In particular, I’ll focus on a recent decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to establish two standing repo facilities to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning: the Standing Repo Facility and the FIMA Repo Facility.\n\nBefore I begin, let me say that my comments today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Crises: Divergent Shocks; Similar Hallmarks\n\nFinancial crises emanate from shocks, which often are amplified by vulnerabilities or imbalances in the financial system.  Each crisis unfolds in its own way, challenging policymakers to respond to evolving conditions.  Still, there are recurring elements to most crises.  And in these similarities we can find valuable lessons that help us better prepare for the future.   \n\nThe GFC and the pandemic crisis resulted from very different events.  The GFC was precipitated by a housing market shock that was amplified by weak underwriting standards and highly leveraged financial intermediaries—in particular, in subprime mortgage finance.  The crisis unfolded over an extended timeline, punctuated by events that revealed significant vulnerabilities among financial institutions, including in the banking sector.  In contrast, the pandemic crisis was caused by an extraordinary exogenous shock to the economic outlook as measures taken to control the coronavirus pandemic threatened to disrupt activity worldwide and raised concern about the ability of financial markets to operate smoothly.  The sudden and unprecedented uncertainty resulted in a “dash for cash” that began in the markets for the most liquid and safe investments and unfolded with astonishing speed.2  Although banks were a source of strength during the pandemic, the event still revealed vulnerabilities in market structure and among some financial firms.\n\nEven with these very divergent origins, the GFC and pandemic crisis impacted financial markets in some similar ways. \n\nFirst, both resulted in an extraordinary increase in the demand for dollar liquidity.  The demand arose out of both immediate funding needs and the desire to raise precautionary liquidity.3  The supply of liquidity was also curtailed as firms that normally lend instead stockpiled liquidity to meet potential future payment needs.  During both crises, this surge in demand for U.S. dollars was global in nature and had significant spillovers to domestic funding conditions. \n\nSecond, each crisis revealed vulnerabilities in short-term funding markets—notably among prime money market funds—in which maturity transformation created an unstable source of liquidity during periods of stress, propagating funding strains.4   \n\nThird, as a result of strained liquidity conditions, credit markets became severely disrupted, threatening the flow of credit to the economy.  In both crises, extreme stress in credit markets resulted in elevated risk premia and reduced access to credit, with the potential for harmful effects on aggregate demand and output.  \n\nEven with the divergent shocks precipitating each crisis, these common elements resulted in negative feedback loops that led to sharply deteriorating conditions.  As funding conditions worsened and volatility increased, investors divested assets to increase liquidity, which in turn resulted in declining prices and a further need to deleverage or raise liquidity. \n\nThe Response: Some Things Old; Some Things New\n\nAs I’ve discussed in previous remarks, the Federal Reserve responded to dislocations from the pandemic crisis with swift and decisive actions—many in coordination with the U.S. Treasury—to support smooth market functioning and the flow of credit to the U.S. economy.  Bearing in mind lessons from the GFC, policymakers announced actions to address conditions quickly in order to restore confidence.  Fortunately, many tools used during the GFC—including expanded U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines, enhanced terms of Discount Window lending, and 13(3) facilities—were able to be revived, with good results. Indeed, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF), Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), and Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) were all substantively similar to facilities employed during the GFC.5  And, during the pandemic, the CPFF and MMLF in particular were highly effective at stabilizing money funds and short-term funding markets. \n\nHowever, we also developed new approaches and tools to address the unique circumstances associated with the pandemic.  The Desk conducted large-scale and effectively full-allotment repo operations to stabilize short term funding markets.6  Purchases of U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were initiated with unprecedented speed and scale to address severe dysfunction in the markets for these securities.7  The Federal Reserve also introduced a temporary FIMA repo facility to support global dollar funding conditions and to stem sales of Treasury securities.8  New lending facilities were established, in coordination with the U.S. Treasury, to directly support the flow of credit to small- and medium-sized businesses and nonprofit organizations, corporations, and state and local governments.9\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s actions—many in close coordination with the U.S. Treasury, and alongside a forceful fiscal response from the U.S. government and the temporary adjustment of regulations to encourage lending—brought confidence back in financial markets.10  I believe it was this broadly integrated approach, the swift and agile response, and the unwavering commitment by policymakers to using their full range of tools that ultimately helped restore market functioning.\n\nLessons for the Future: Announcement Effects and Liquidity Needs\n\nAs I look back, one thing I reflect on is the notable differences across the various tools in terms of the scale needed to achieve success.  In some cases, the announcement of a program or facility was sufficient to inspire a strong positive response in the target markets.  Meanwhile, other tools required large-scale usage to achieve desired results.  In particular, repo operations, swap lines, and asset purchases all expanded the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet on a large scale.  \n\nWhat were the factors that gave rise to these differences, and how can we apply the lessons from this experience? \n\nAnnouncement effects are a critical element of most central bank actions.  Asset prices are forward-looking, and a credible commitment to lend or to purchase assets alleviates strains in the present by shifting expectations about future financial conditions.  In financial crises, announcements that central bank liquidity will be available soon can temper asset sales and other actions to raise liquidity.  Announcements can also enhance the supply of funding and market liquidity.  If intermediaries or end investors are confident that liquidity will be available in the future, either in the form of funding or asset purchases, they may perceive market-making and investing as less risky today—restoring the flow of transactions before any central bank operations are conducted.\n\nAs an example, the announcements of credit facilities during the pandemic, including the Corporate Credit Facilities (CCFs) and Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF), were generally effective at reducing risk premia and restoring the flow of credit in private markets.11  The success of facilities despite limited actual take-up demonstrates that when announcement effects are powerful, take-up is not the best measure of a central bank program’s impact.12 During the GFC, the announcement of the first large-scale asset purchase program in November 2008 substantially improved conditions in MBS markets even before asset purchases began in January 2009.13   \n\nOn the other hand, in my experience, policy announcements are less effective when market dysfunction arises from an immediate demand for U.S. dollars.  For example, a firm that needs to meet margin calls or an investor that faces redemptions today must actually obtain the cash; the prospect of cash at some future date is not enough. In these circumstances, the underlying demand for liquidity may not be satisfied by enhancing confidence and limiting negative feedback loops with expectations for future central bank interventions.  When this is the case, it is only actually delivering liquidity—through asset purchases or lending—that calms conditions. \n\nAt the onset of the pandemic crisis, the immediate and intense demand for cash required substantial interventions.  We were fortunate to have repo operations in place at the time that helped limit the intensity of potential pressures.  However, it took successive increases in the size of those operations to stabilize repo market conditions.  Similarly, initial announcements establishing large-scale Treasury and agency MBS purchases did little to quell pressures, and it was not until actual purchases were increased in size that conditions slowly began to improve.14,15     \n\nTo summarize, shocks can create rapid shifts in the demand for liquidity that lead to severe financial market dysfunction.  To the extent that announcements of central bank actions can reduce that liquidity demand and encourage a return to normal investing and market-making activity, they can significantly improve conditions even with little or no actual activity.  However, the most immediate liquidity needs are unlikely to be resolved by announcements alone and thus require active operations to address them.  In both of these crises—as well as during other liquidity shocks, such as the one that occurred in September 2019—we learned that when immediate liquidity needs arise, the time needed to put in place a response, even one that is fairly ready for deployment, risks worsening a fragile situation.  Central banks should maintain a comprehensive set of tools, some of which are available to meet the most immediate needs, to address these circumstances.  \n\nTwo New Standing Facilities\n\nSo, what does this mean for the future?  Certainly, these events will continue to be studied by academics and practitioners for years to come, and the lessons will be many and varied.  Today, however, I would like to highlight a few recent decisions by the FOMC.\n\nAs many of you may be aware, the FOMC has discussed standing repo facilities for a number of years in the context of its monetary implementation framework.16  Based on recent experience with repo operations and their ability to support policy implementation, particularly during periods of stress in overnight markets, the FOMC renewed its deliberations in recent meetings.17 \n\nAt its July meeting, the FOMC established two standing repo facilities as tools in the Fed’s policy implementation framework: a domestic standing repo facility (SRF) and a repo facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facility).18  These facilities will serve as backstops in money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning.\n\nThe SRF enhances control over the federal funds rate by limiting pressures in the repo markets that could spill into other overnight money markets.19  The facility is positioned and priced as a backstop with a minimum bid rate of 25 basis points, corresponding to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate.  This pricing allows for robust private activity to occur under most market conditions, but limits the potential for spikes in repo rates to move the effective federal funds rate outside of the target range.  SRF counterparties include primary dealers and will be expanded to include depository institutions that will be able to access liquidity through this facility and at the discount window.20  Treasuries, agency debt, and agency MBS will be accepted to ensure the facility can effectively address pressures that arise in markets for repo backed by high-quality liquid collateral.21\n\nThe FIMA Repo Facility establishes a standing facility to address global dollar funding pressures that may affect U.S. financial conditions.  The facility provides foreign official accounts with a temporary source of liquidity against their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities held in custody at the New York Fed, presenting an alternative to outright sales of those securities.  This facility complements the existing U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines by extending access to dollar funding to a broader range of central banks and foreign official institutions.  The rate is the same as on the SRF to create alignment across facilities to support effective policy implementation.\n\nThe presence of these facilities should create confidence that liquidity at a backstop rate will be available in overnight money markets as needed, potentially limiting the demand for precautionary liquidity and the run-like dynamics that can occur.  Equally important, they will be available on a standing basis to meet immediate liquidity needs should they arise. \n\nConclusion\n\nWhile I hope we can avoid future shocks to the financial system and the disruptions to the economy that they cause, history teaches us that unpredictable events will challenge financial markets from time to time.  Central banks will need to respond to new environments and new shocks.  Nonetheless, there are some recurring elements of liquidity shocks from which we can learn.  The SRF and FIMA Repo Facility will provide backstops in overnight money markets that help address immediate demand for dollar liquidity, both domestically and internationally, when shocks occur. \n\nI hope that the continued study of crisis events will yield further lessons for central bankers looking to shield economies from the effects of shocks to the financial system. \n\n\n1 I would like to thank Linsey Molloy, Matt Raskin, and Patricia Zobel for their assistance in preparing these remarks, and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for valuable comments and suggestions.\n\n2 Mark E.

    "text": "Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan delivered this address to open the conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Kansas City in Houston.\nThank you for that introduction, Daron.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to open today’s event. This is the Dallas and Kansas City Feds’ seventh joint conference on energy, and the topic is more vital than ever. As a newcomer to this region, where energy is so central to the economy, I’m eager to learn and delighted to participate in this conference for the first time.\n\nI’d like to thank everyone who has worked so hard to bring this event together, and particularly thank Esther George, president of the Kansas City Fed, for her partnership on this effort over the years. President George has been an extraordinarily impactful leader across all aspects of the Federal Reserve’s mission during 40 years of service. She is a wise voice in our monetary policy discussions; she has brought about a leap forward in our nation’s payments system as executive sponsor of the forthcoming FedNow service; and she has been a strong advocate for effective and efficient regulation of banks, especially community banks, throughout her career. President George is retiring this January—but before that, she is going to do us the honor of giving today’s keynote address. Esther, I’m so grateful for everything I’ve learned from you, and I know I’m not alone when I say we will miss you deeply.\n\nToday’s conference theme is “Energy and the Economy: The New Energy Landscape.” I’d like to share a few thoughts on energy and on the economy to begin our discussions. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nEnergy prices have been extremely volatile this year. The front-month futures price of West Texas Intermediate oil was up more than 52 percent at points during the year, though it has since retraced, while natural gas is up 20 percent since a year ago at the Henry Hub and 61 percent in continental Europe. Significant pressures and volatility in energy prices have stemmed from Russia’s war against Ukraine and Russia’s weaponization of energy exports. Although European nations have worked hard to build natural gas inventories and make plans to conserve energy, Europe still faces a difficult winter under even the best scenarios. This context provides daily reminders that energy plays a critical role in economic life and national security.\n\nEnergy is especially important here in the Tenth and Eleventh Federal Reserve Districts, which together produce almost half of the nation’s energy. Texas leads the nation in the production of oil, natural gas and wind power, and is second in utility-scale solar installations. Our region also leads the nation in refinery capacity and petrochemical production. In Texas, oil and gas production is a significant employer and makes up 11 percent of state GDP and almost half of exports. Adding in chemical products, the energy share of state exports rises to more than 60 percent.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is deeply committed to advancing the understanding of energy’s influence on the regional, national and global economies. We do so through our public outreach and research, including our quarterly energy survey of 200 oil and gas firms in Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Louisiana. We are grateful to those of you who participate in the survey.\n\nWe also bring people together, at events like today’s conference, our Energy Advisory Council meetings and other important gatherings, to work through the issues and identify constructive paths forward.\n\nAs Daron said, my years of experience in finance have given me a deep understanding of the criticality of energy markets and how events in these markets can reverberate through the broader financial system. But I am relatively new to the real side of the energy economy—namely, how energy is produced, distributed and consumed. So, although I’m fortunate to have an expert energy team at the Dallas Fed and have learned a great deal from visiting with some key energy leaders around the Eleventh District, I look forward to listening and learning more. I am particularly looking forward to today’s discussions and to connecting with all of you.\n\nA deep understanding of the energy ecosystem is critical so the Federal Reserve can best accomplish core elements of our mission: setting monetary policy to promote maximum employment and stable prices, promoting the stability and efficiency of the financial system, and supporting community development. Energy sector developments affect economic output, employment, inflation, investment and credit markets. In turn, the Federal Reserve’s policies significantly affect the energy sector, through both changes in macroeconomic conditions and changes in financial conditions that influence investment.\n\nToday’s economic conditions are complex, but they can be summarized in five words: Inflation is much too high.\n\nNot only is inflation far above the FOMC’s 2 percent target, but with aggregate demand continuing to outstrip supply, inflation has repeatedly come in higher than forecasters expected. This morning’s CPI [Consumer Price Index] data were a welcome relief, but there is still a long way to go.\n\nPrice stability is foundational for a healthy labor market and economy over time.\n\nWhen inflation is high, it is difficult for families and companies to plan for the future and difficult for financial markets to allocate capital to the most productive uses.\nHigh inflation leaves many workers falling further and further behind, as their wages fail to keep pace with the cost of food, gas and other necessities.\nHigh inflation makes the business cycle more volatile, undermining the long and stable expansions that particularly benefit the most vulnerable in society.\nIn short, high inflation is a drag on our economy. The longer it continues, the worse the drag gets, the greater the risk that high inflation becomes entrenched and the greater the cost that must be paid to bring inflation down. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate for monetary policy—maximum employment and price stability—but to achieve the maximum employment part of the mandate in a sustainable way, I believe monetary policy must focus now on promptly restoring price stability.\n\nThe FOMC has raised its target range for the federal funds rate by 3.75 percentage points since the start of the year, including with historically large 75-basis-point hikes at each of the past four meetings. Financial markets are pricing in the expectation of substantial further increases, and the FOMC is also removing monetary accommodation by reducing our asset holdings as described in the plans that the FOMC issued in May. As a result, broad financial conditions have tightened significantly. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen to more than 4 percent, compared with 1.51 percent at the start of the year, and option-adjusted yields have reached nearly 6 percent on investment-grade corporate debt and about 9 percent on high-yield debt. Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates have climbed to 7.32 percent from 3.27 percent. Importantly, real—or inflation-adjusted—interest rates, as measured by yields on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, are significantly above zero across the yield curve.\n\nThese tighter financial conditions are beginning to bring demand back into balance with supply, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as housing.\n\nSufficient cooling of the economy will eventually bring inflation back to our target. But this process is just getting started. The labor market remains very tight, and wages continue to grow considerably faster than the rate that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation.\n\nYou may have heard debate about whether tighter policy will imperil the financial system. It’s important to remember that higher interest rates should cause pressures. As you are likely well aware, some investments that had a positive net present value at last year’s interest rates do not make sense at today’s higher rates. Some projects will have to shut down. Financial markets, businesses and the economy will have to adjust after so many years of near-zero rates. Such adjustments are expected and appropriate to moderate demand and reduce inflation.\n\nSo far, I believe we are seeing a normal financial market response to tighter monetary policy. Although the cost of credit continues to rise and issuance continues to slow, credit markets remain open for most borrowers. And while liquidity conditions in key financial markets have been strained, those strains appear so far to result primarily from high economic uncertainty and volatility that raises the costs of market-making, rather than the other way around.\n\nAlthough inflation poses hardships in the near term and damages the economy’s long-run strength, falling house prices, a cooling labor market and tighter financial conditions create hardships of their own.\n\nI believe that the FOMC must do everything we can to restore the price stability that will support a healthy economy in the long run, but we should also try, if we can, to avoid incurring costs that are higher than necessary.\n\nIn my career in financial markets, I’ve learned that financial conditions usually evolve smoothly but sometimes deteriorate abruptly, with severe consequences for the economic well-being of households and businesses. As financial conditions become more restrictive, I am attentive to the potential for nonlinear and unexpected responses to further policy tightening.\n\nWhile I believe it may soon be appropriate to slow the pace of rate increases so we can better assess how financial and economic conditions are evolving, I also believe a slower pace should not be taken to represent easier policy. I don’t see the decision about slowing the pace as being particularly closely related to the incoming data. The restrictiveness of policy comes from the entire policy strategy—not just how fast rates rise, but the level they reach, the time spent at that level, and, importantly, the factors that determine further increases or decreases. The FOMC can and should adjust other elements of policy to deliver appropriately tight conditions even as the pace slows. We must remain firmly committed to our 2 percent inflation goal.\n\nI will look to a wide range of information to assess whether policy is sufficiently restrictive. For example, I’ll be watching the evolution of the labor market and economy, as well as thinking about real yields and about the accuracy of inflation forecasts, among other factors. Real interest rates remaining significantly above zero would contribute to the slowing of demand that I expect will reduce inflation. By contrast, inflation forecasts that consistently miss on the low side do not foster confidence that we understand the inflation process well enough to predict success.\n\nThat is a lot of words to explain a five-word economic situation. So let me sum up. Inflation is much too high. The FOMC must restore price stability—but must also proceed in a way that allows us to better assess how financial and economic conditions are evolving. That is how we can deliver the healthier economy, with stable prices and maximum employment, which is the Federal Reserve’s responsibility.\n\nThank you. I look forward to learning from all of you today, and especially to hearing President George’s keynote remarks over lunch."

    "text": "Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan delivered these remarks before the 65th National Association for Business Economics annual meeting.\nThank you, Greg, for that introduction, and thank you, Julia, for inviting me to speak today. Good morning and welcome to Dallas and the Eleventh Federal Reserve District. It was great to see so many of you at last night’s reception and personally welcome you to the region.\n\nAs some of you may know, I am proud to have Pia Orrenius, who is just completing her service as a NABE director, and Roberto Coronado, who is starting his term as a director, on my leadership team at the Dallas Fed. Two of our former research directors, Harvey Rosenblum and Mine Yücel, have served as president of NABE. Together with my colleagues, I am working to continue the Bank’s thought leadership in economics. And we greatly value our collaboration and partnership with NABE.\n\nThe Eleventh District in 2023 is a highly diversified and globally connected economy—transformed from the heavy concentrations in cotton, cattle and oil as recently as the 1980s. The region has grown to include a sizable high-tech industry in Austin, solid manufacturing in Fort Worth and Arlington, a global energy capital in Houston, and a vibrant finance and professional services sector here in Dallas.\n\nIt’s been a little over a year since I came here as president and CEO of the Dallas Fed. In that time, I have visited with business owners and community leaders from small towns, oil drillers and solar farm operators in the Permian Basin, tech executives in Austin, and CEOs of some of the biggest companies in our largest metro areas. These conversations are so important because they provide a deeper understanding of the region’s economic landscape as we work to advance an economy where everyone has opportunities to thrive.\n\nIn diversifying its economic base, the Eleventh District has in many ways become more similar to the nation over time. The oil booms and busts that once ruled the region have diminished in impact, and the region’s business cycle looks more similar to the nation’s. But the region still has many unique features that set it apart from the rest of the country. The dynamism here is visible every day, driven by in-migration of people and businesses and adding to the economic growth that consistently outperforms the national average.\n\nUnderstanding the trajectory of our regional economy and connecting with regional businesses have been particularly valuable to me in my role contributing to the formulation of monetary policy on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Aggregate statistics can get us only so far in understanding the economy. They are often backward looking and subject to revision. Information from business contacts provides context on the reasons underlying economic developments. And reports from these contacts can be more timely than aggregate statistics, especially when the economy is near turning points. So, the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys and my conversations with business leaders provide a critical complement to the hard data. This has never been more true than in recent months as the economic picture has become more complex.\n\nToday, I’d like to share how I’m seeing the economic outlook and how financial conditions are influencing my perspective on monetary policy. As always, the views I share are not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\n\nThe economic outlook\nI remain focused on returning inflation to our 2 percent target. People count on the Federal Reserve to keep our commitment to price stability. When inflation is high, people’s incomes fall short of the rising cost of living. Businesses can’t plan well because they don’t know what they’ll pay for materials or be able to charge their customers. And, over time, high inflation tends to undermine the long and stable expansions that particularly benefit the most vulnerable in society.\n\nOver the summer, we saw welcome progress on inflation. However, the monthly inflation data have been somewhat uneven. Smoothing through the monthly fluctuations can give a more accurate picture. Of course, waiting to declare victory until 12-month inflation rates get all the way back to target would be a recipe for undershooting our inflation target. So, I see averages over three or six months as a sensible middle ground to watch.\n\nIn formulating my inflation outlook, I also focus on measures like core and trimmed mean that drop volatile categories and one-off factors. These measures typically give a more reliable sense of where headline inflation will trend.\n\nThe most recent release of the FOMC’s preferred inflation gauge, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, showed some further improvement. Through August, the three-month PCE inflation rate excluding food and energy, or core PCE inflation, was 2.2 percent. The three-month Dallas Fed trimmed mean was 2.6 percent. Measured over six months, core has fallen to 3 percent and trimmed mean to 3.1 percent. These developments are encouraging, but it is still too soon to say with confidence that inflation is headed to 2 percent in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nThe labor market is also an important input to my assessment of the economic outlook. Employment is important in its own right as one leg of the FOMC’s dual mandate. And restoring balance in the labor market after the pressures of recent years will be important to restoring price stability and sustaining it over time.\n\nWhile the job market isn’t as hot as it was a year ago, it remains very strong overall. The U.S. economy has been adding more than 250,000 jobs per month. That’s significantly more than enough to keep pace with trend growth in the labor force. My Eleventh District business contacts continue to report tight hiring conditions. Of those seeking more workers, more than half still say a lack of applicants impedes hiring. Data such as the quits rate, the ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers, and surveys of consumers and businesses show progress toward better balance. Many of these measures are near or at 2019 levels. However, 2019 was a very strong labor market. Conditions like those of 2019 don’t necessarily mean labor supply and demand are in balance.\n\nAnd wage growth remains solid. Many national and regional statistics continue to show that wages are rising faster than would be consistent with 2 percent inflation in the long run, given typical estimates of trend productivity growth. In the Dallas Fed’s latest regional survey on labor costs, Texas businesses penciled in 5 percent wage growth for this year. That’s down slightly from the last time we asked the question. But higher labor costs are now tied with higher input costs as our survey respondents’ top reason for raising their selling prices.\n\nOutput and spending have come in surprisingly strong in 2023. GDP growth has been at or above 2 percent for the past year. Growth in the third quarter is tracking to be even stronger. The strength is broad based. Consumption is robust, business investment is solid, the drag from the housing sector has declined, and recession fears have faded.\n\nSome of my contacts highlight a significant increase in manufacturing and nonbuilding construction, both nationally and in this region. The number of manufacturing construction projects in Texas is the highest in 22 years. With so many projects in the pipeline, construction contract values are also at record highs. Some of this activity appears related to initiatives to spur clean energy, infrastructure and the domestic semiconductor industry.\n\nBut my business contacts do report mixed outlooks for the consumer. Some anticipate continued strength, while others are finding it difficult to pass through cost increases or are noticing softer growth.\n\nPutting all this information together, I expect that continued restrictive financial conditions will be necessary to restore price stability in a sustainable and timely way. I remain attentive to risks on both sides of our mandate. In my view, high inflation remains the most important risk. We cannot allow it to become entrenched or reignite.\n\nThe role of financial conditions\nYou’ll note that I referred to restrictive financial conditions rather than to the setting of the federal funds rate. That’s because, while the FOMC controls the overnight fed funds rate, households and businesses usually borrow at longer tenors. Longer-term rates therefore influence economic activity more directly than does the fed funds rate. Yet the relationship between the fed funds rate and longer-term rates is not fixed. So, in setting the stance of monetary policy, the FOMC needs to account for how that stance will translate to the broader financial conditions, including long-term rates as well as credit spreads and other factors, that influence economic activity. In addition, broader financial conditions can contain important information about how market participants are seeing the economic outlook.\n\nFinancial conditions tightened substantially in recent months. Much of the tightening came from movements in longer-term interest rates. Higher long-term interest rates have also contributed to equity price declines and dollar appreciation over recent months. In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll discuss how I interpret the rate moves and what they might mean for monetary policy.\n\nSince the July meeting, the yield curve has steepened notably. The market-implied peak fed funds rate is little changed, and policy-sensitive rates through 2025 are 60 basis points higher. But the 10-year Treasury yield is up roughly 90 basis points, and the five-year yield, five years forward, is almost 130 basis points higher.\n\nImportantly, the rise in rates has come almost entirely in real interest rates. Inflation compensation has hardly moved. Market participants remain confident, as they should, that the FOMC will achieve the inflation target.\n\nInterpreting the rate increases\nA term interest rate can be broadly decomposed into the expected average level of overnight rates plus a term premium that compensates for the risk of interest rate fluctuations.\n\nConceptually, therefore, there are several reasons why longer-term rates may have risen. First, market participants may anticipate that the economic data will call for a higher fed funds rate target in the next few months or years. Second, market participants may judge that overnight rates will be higher, on average, over the long term, as a result of lasting changes in the structure of the economy or financial system. And, third, term premiums may have increased.\n\nA rise in term premiums can itself have many drivers, including increases in the stock of debt relative to investors’ demand for debt, changing correlations between the returns on different asset classes—which can influence the portfolio diversification properties of long-term bonds—and reductions in expectations for the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings.\n\nThe July FOMC minutes indicated that runoff of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet “need not end when the Committee eventually begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate.” In my view, while it is far too soon to think about rate cuts in our monetary policy strategy, there will presumably come a time when we are returning the fed funds rate to a neutral level from above. Normalizing the fed funds rate in that way would be entirely consistent with continuing to normalize our asset holdings. Additionally, the more than $1 trillion of balances in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility leave plenty of room to reduce our balance sheet without making bank reserves scarce. As market participants have taken on board these perspectives on the balance sheet, market expectations for the end of runoff have shifted out. In turn, the expectation of lower Federal Reserve asset holdings over time implies that other investors will need to hold more long-duration securities, which appears to be one factor among the many contributing to higher term premiums.\n\nThe decomposition of changes in yields into near-term rate expectations, long-term rate expectations and term premiums matters for monetary policy.\n\nNear-term policy-sensitive rates rose on a number of occasions in recent months in response to strong economic data. Market participants understand that, to the extent stronger economic growth poses risks to inflation, the FOMC may need to offset that strength with higher interest rates.\n\nEconomic data can also lead market participants to reassess their outlooks for the average level of overnight rates that will be consistent with achieving the FOMC’s goals over the long run. For example, the economy has shown surprising resilience over the past year in the face of sustained real interest rates north of 1.5 percent. I’m starting to take some signal from that resilience, not only about the rates needed to restore price stability in the next few years, but also about the rates that will need to prevail to sustain price stability and maximum employment over a much longer horizon.\n\nAnd higher term premiums have a different implication altogether. Higher term premiums result in higher term interest rates for the same setting of the fed funds rate, all else equal. Thus, if term premiums rise, they could do some of the work of cooling the economy for us, leaving less need for additional monetary policy tightening to achieve the FOMC’s objectives.\n\nThe persistence of all these changes also matters. If technical factors are temporarily raising term premiums, for example, monetary policy shouldn’t overreact.\n\nDecomposing yield changes\nAlthough the decomposition of yield curve moves is an important input into appropriate monetary policy, calculating this decomposition is anything but straightforward. Surveys, term structure models, event studies and anecdotal information from market participants can all shed light on the decomposition. But each of these techniques requires critical assumptions, and they ultimately deliver mixed results.\n\nSurvey-based decompositions suggest a limited rise in expected overnight rates and a large role for term premiums. The simplest way to identify the expected overnight rate is to survey informed professionals. In fact, the New York Fed’s surveys of primary dealers and market participants ask this very question. A term premium can then be estimated by subtracting the surveyed expectation of overnight rates from a zero-coupon Treasury yield. In July, the median modal primary dealer expectation for the average fed funds rate over the next 10 years was just under 3 percent, implying a 10-year term premium of 80 basis points based on market rates at the time of the survey. The September survey has not yet been publicly released. But market contacts mostly say their expectations for the average fed funds rate changed little over the summer, suggesting a good share of the rise in longer-dated yields reflects increased term premiums.\n\nOf course, the survey-based approach has shortcomings. Modal expectations don’t reflect the distribution of risks. If that distribution skews up or down, the expected value of the overnight rate could differ from median modal expectations. Respondents to the Open Market Trading Desk’s surveys may not be representative of the market more broadly. And survey results tend to be inertial. Respondents may be disinclined to adjust their reported expectations until they have high conviction that a change is warranted. \n\nTerm structure models can overcome some of these drawbacks, but estimates can vary dramatically depending on model specification and inputs. Two commonly cited models were built by current and former Fed economists: the Kim-Wright model and the Adrian, Crump and Moench, or ACM, model. The Kim-Wright model estimates that about one-third of the increase in 10-year Treasury yields since the July FOMC meeting is from a higher expected policy rate path, with the other two-thirds reflecting higher term premiums. The ACM model, on the other hand, estimates a decline in the expected path of future short-term rates and an increase in the 10-year term premium of 115 basis points. That includes a roughly 55-basis-point increase since the September meeting. The marked divergence in signals provided by these two models underscores just how sensitive model-based results are to modeling decisions, especially over short windows. In this case, the key difference is that the KW model incorporates Blue Chip surveys of short rate expectations in the data used for estimation.\n\nA third approach is to evaluate whether yield moves on specific days or in specific time intervals were driven primarily by changes in the expected path of short rates or by shifts in the price of duration risk. Yield changes in response to economic data surprises or to Fed communications on rate policy might reasonably be assigned to changes in interest rate expectations. Yield moves on news unrelated to Fed rate policy might be chalked up to term premiums. This approach is subject to a great degree of judgment but can deliver ballpark results. My back-of-the-envelope estimates using this approach suggest that more than half of the total increase in long-dated yields since the July FOMC reflects rising term premiums.\n\nMarket participants’ perspectives can supplement these calculations. My staff and I are in frequent touch with contacts including investors and traders at pension funds, leveraged funds and other firms that are part of Texas’ growing financial market industry.\n\nPutting together analytic estimates with the information I have gathered through these channels, I see a mixed story. There is a clear role for increased term premiums in recent yield curve moves. But the size and persistence of the contribution are subject to uncertainty.\n\nConclusion\nSo, what does this mean for monetary policy? As I said earlier, inflation remains too high, the labor market is still very strong, and output, spending and job growth are beating expectations. I anticipate that we will need continued restrictive financial conditions to return inflation to 2 percent in a timely way and sustainably achieve our goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nFinancial conditions have tightened notably in recent months. But the reasons for the tightening matter. If long-term interest rates remain elevated because of higher term premiums, there may be less need to raise the fed funds rate. However, to the extent that strength in the economy is behind the increase in long-term interest rates, the FOMC may need to do more. So, I will be carefully evaluating both economic and financial developments to assess the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to deliver on the FOMC’s mandate.\n\nThank you.\n\n"

    "text": "Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan delivered these remarks April 20, 2023, at the Fed Listens event at Odessa College in Odessa, Texas.\nThank you to Odessa College and President Gregory Williams for hosting this gathering. And welcome, everyone. Let me note that the views I share are mine and not necessarily those of others at the Federal Reserve.\n\nWe Federal Reserve officials are famous, or perhaps infamous, for giving a lot of disclaimers, and a lot of speeches—but today we are here to do something much more important: to listen.\n\nI’m very grateful to our panelists for taking the time to join us, and I’m really looking forward to the insights they’ll share.\n\nListening to people in communities throughout the country is so important because the Federal Reserve’s work is all about advancing an economy where everyone has opportunities to thrive. To do that, we need a nuanced and granular understanding of economic issues, and we need to understand how everyone is experiencing the economy.\n\nMy colleagues and I at the Dallas Fed travel frequently throughout the Eleventh District to engage directly with a wide variety of business and community leaders. These conversations add color and insight to the economic statistics.\n\nBy combining perspectives from our contacts with rigorous quantitative analysis, we can develop a deeper and more-inclusive understanding of the economy and make the best decisions to serve the public. That was true when I led the Fed’s trading desk on Wall Street, and it’s even more true in my role here leading the Fed’s activities in Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.\n\nThe Dallas Fed has done extensive research, for example, on the nearly 5 million young people in the United States who are disconnected from both work and school, the loss of potential this represents for our economy and the policies that can help opportunity youths reengage.\n\nBut I gained an even deeper appreciation of those issues after I met with city and business leaders in San Antonio who are working to solve them and with a young woman who had dropped out of high school but got support from a city center for opportunity youths and is now on track to graduate from college.\n\nHere in the Permian Basin, I’ve been meeting for the past couple of days with energy, business and community leaders. This morning, I visited an elementary school where a community partnership called the ConnEctor Task Force is working to provide better internet access. The statistics on the 39 percent of Ector County households that lack broadband access are clear enough. But the importance of closing the digital divide is even more clear to me after hearing from students how hot spots from the task force made such a difference in their ability to prepare for class. The Dallas Fed is providing capacity-building support and technical assistance to the task force through our digital inclusion initiative. While the scale of this challenge is large, I am inspired by community leaders’ collaboration to address it.\n\nIndeed, promoting the economic resilience and mobility of low- and moderate-income communities is a top priority for the Fed. So, in our conversations this afternoon, I’m looking forward to learning more about efforts to advance economic opportunity in the Permian through education and career readiness programs.\n\nI’ll also be listening closely to your perspectives on the economy. As you surely know, inflation has been much too high. The Fed has raised interest rates by 4.5 percentage points over the past year to bring the economy into better balance.\n\nTo assess whether we have made enough progress, I’ve been watching three markers:\n\nWhether there is further and sustained improvement in the inflation statistics.\nWhether the economy is evolving more or less as forecasts predict.\nWhether there is a clear change in the underlying factors—like the imbalance of supply and demand and the resulting very tight labor market—that have produced high inflation.\nOver the past six weeks, I’ve also been closely watching the effects of stresses in the banking system—both on the macroeconomy and on local communities, especially here in Texas where small and midsize banks are so important. Smaller banks are particularly significant in small business, rural, middle-market, and commercial real estate lending. And to have a strong economy, we need a diverse, vibrant banking ecosystem.\n\nYour views on these economic and financial considerations will be a great help in interpreting the quantitative data we receive.\n\nThank you again for joining us for this important conversation."

    "text": "Thank you for the invitation to speak at this SIFMA event.1 It is a pleasure to be back with you to discuss financial markets and monetary policy implementation. When I last spoke with this group in July of last year, I shared my views on the marked deterioration in conditions in the U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Federal Reserve's asset purchases undertaken to support market functioning.\n\nAsset purchases are ongoing and continue to help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. This expansion in the Federal Reserve's assets also has the effect of increasing Federal Reserve liabilities—particularly reserve balances—which can have important implications for money markets. Today, I would like to discuss the recent rapid expansion in reserves, and its influence on money market conditions. I plan to share some perspective on how, in this environment, the Federal Reserve's tools will help maintain the federal funds rate well within the target range and support effective policy implementation.\n\nBefore I continue, let me note that the views I express today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nReserves Rise to Historically High Levels\n\nI'd like to start with some context on the historic nature of the changes in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet over the past year. Since the beginning of March 2020, the Federal Reserve's assets have grown from $4.2 trillion to $7.7 trillion, as shown in Figure 1, representing the largest increase over a similar timeframe in the Federal Reserve's history. This expansion reflects the FOMC's swift and decisive actions to address deteriorating conditions in financial markets and the severe economic downturn associated with the pandemic. As part of those measures, increases in holdings of U.S. Treasury securities, shown in dark blue, and agency MBS, shown in red, have supported smooth market functioning and helped to foster accommodative financial conditions.\n\nAn increase in Federal Reserve assets is naturally accompanied by an increase in liabilities. As Figure 2 shows, the expansion in assets over the past year was primarily supported by increases in two types of liabilities: bank reserves, shown in red, and the Treasury General Account (TGA), shown in light blue.\n\nThe TGA is the U.S. Treasury's cash account with the Federal Reserve, and the U.S. government uses this account to make and receive payments. As the pandemic unfolded in 2020, the Treasury built up precautionary balances in this account to prepare for outflows associated with fiscal spending to address the economic downturn. This increase in the TGA limited growth in reserves that would have otherwise resulted from the Federal Reserve's balance sheet expansion. However, more recently, the Treasury began drawing down these precautionary balances and the TGA declined by over $600 billion in the first quarter. This reduction in the TGA, combined with ongoing asset purchases, has lifted reserves at an extraordinary pace in recent months; aggregate reserves reached an all-time high of $3.9 trillion on April 7, an increase of about $800 billion since the beginning of the year.\n\nAs of December, reserves held by domestic banks as a share of their total assets were at the highest level that we have observed, as shown by the dark blue line in Figure 3, and reserves have risen since then. As aggregate reserves grow, banks may perceive increasing costs associated with higher reserve balances and the resulting growth in their balance sheets. If so, individual banks may take actions to limit or manage these impacts, such as reducing wholesale funding, discouraging deposit inflows, or purchasing securities to reduce reserve holdings.2\n\nTo date, reserve increases among domestic banks have been broadly distributed across firms of all sizes, as shown on the right-hand side of Figure 4. Some banks—global systemically important banks (GSIBs) and other large domestic banks, in particular—appear to be reducing reliance on certain types of wholesale funding and purchasing high quality securities to manage their balance sheets. However, much of the recent growth in reserves has been driven by deposit inflows that may be more challenging to moderate.\n\nAlthough individual banks can take steps to limit growth in their own reserve balances, reserves in aggregate cannot fall unless they are absorbed by other Federal Reserve liabilities or Federal Reserve assets decline. The actions banks take to limit or manage reserve balances instead put downward pressure on money market rates relative to the interest paid on excess reserves (IOER) until the banking system is content to hold the aggregate supply of reserves.\n\nOvernight Rates Have Fallen, but to Different Degrees\n\nEven as reserves have risen to historic levels, the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) has remained relatively stable at around seven basis points, three basis points below IOER, as shown by the dark blue line in Figure 5. At the same time, overnight secured rates have fallen and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), shown in red, has declined to around one basis point.\n\nWhat might account for this growing difference between unsecured and secured rates?\n\nThe resilience to date in overnight unsecured borrowing rates reflects, in part, foreign banking organizations' (FBOs) robust borrowing at rates relatively close to IOER. As shown in Figure 6, FBOs account for almost all activity that makes up the Overnight Bank Funding Rate (OBFR)—a broad measure of wholesale overnight unsecured rates—and their volumes have increased considerably in recent months. Alongside this growth in wholesale liabilities, FBO reserve balances have grown by roughly 45 percent since the beginning of the year, as shown in Figure 7. Our understanding is that these FBOs value their relationships with wholesale lenders and may face lower balance sheet costs than many domestic banks, and therefore have not demanded a wider spread below IOER to take on this funding.\n\nIn contrast, reductions in U.S. Treasury bill supply and robust growth among secured money market investors has resulted in more pronounced downward pressure in overnight secured rates. In the year to date, the publicly available supply of Treasury bills has declined by around $300 billion. Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 8, government money market fund (MMF) assets under management (AUM), which are markedly higher since the pandemic began, have grown significantly since the start of the year. Investors view government MMFs as safe and highly liquid investments, and they become increasingly attractive as banks lower deposit rates or limit deposit growth.3\n\nHistorically, when significant differences emerge between secured and unsecured rates, we have seen investors—most notably prime MMFs—reallocate between these markets, moderating the rate spread. 4 However, prime MMFs have become much less prominent in recent years, as shown in Figure 9. It may be that, with investors somewhat more cautious after the stresses in money markets last spring, the yield earned on unsecured investments does not currently offer a sufficient premium to attract new investments into prime MMFs or for prime fund managers to take on additional liquidity risk with existing AUM.5 These factors may also be contributing to a slightly wider spread than we have observed in recent years.\n\nWhere might rates go from here?\n\nUltimately, the evolution of overnight rates will depend on the adjustment to higher reserve levels, and the supply and demand for overnight investments. As aggregate reserves continue to grow, banks may take additional actions to manage growth in their individual reserve balances.6 In previous periods of elevated reserves, FBOs absorbed a significant share of reserves through wholesale borrowing and, as I noted, recently we have seen growth in FBO balances. However, it remains to be seen if some FBOs will be comfortable taking additional reserve balances, and if so, whether it will require a wider spread below IOER for them to do so.\n\nIn an environment where banks are seeking to moderate growth in reserve balances, MMFs are also likely to see ongoing inflows, increasing the demand for short-term investments. To the extent that these inflows continue to go to government MMFs, secured rates may experience more downward pressure. The supply of government investments, including Treasury bills, will be an important factor influencing money market rates.\n\nAs rates adjust to rising reserves and changes in the supply and demand for overnight investments, we will be monitoring markets closely. We are confident that the Federal Reserve has the tools to maintain control over the federal funds rate and support effective policy implementation, a discussion I will turn to now.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Tools Support Rate Control, with the ON RRP Facility Becoming More Central in the Framework\n\nIn January 2019, the FOMC communicated its intention to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates.7,8 The payment of IOER sets a benchmark against which banks evaluate their lending and borrowing opportunities. In addition, the Federal Reserve offers a fixed-rate investment to a broad base of money market investors, known as the overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility, which establishes a floor for overnight rates below IOER. The availability of this facility as an investment option improves money market lenders' bargaining power in private markets. When investors use the facility, the reverse repo transactions and corresponding reduction in reserves broadens the liability base that supports asset purchases and alleviates the pressures on bank balance sheets that lower money market rates.\n\nIn an abundant reserves environment when overnight rates trade sufficiently below IOER, the ON RRP facility becomes a more central part of the implementation framework. Since its introduction, the ON RRP facility has been effective at providing a floor for the federal funds rate and limiting downward pressure on other overnight rates, as shown in Figure 10.9 Meanwhile, concerns about possible repercussions of the ON RRP facility that were discussed when it was established—such as the potential for investments to shift towards the facility in times of stress or for it to reshape the financial industry in unanticipated ways—have not materialized in the intervening years, even through various periods of market stress.10,11 Overall, the ON RRP facility has proven to be a highly effective tool for monetary policy implementation.\n\nThe availability of the ON RRP facility may be particularly important in the U.S. context. This is because the U.S. banking system is smaller relative to the overall size of the economy than in other advanced economies, as shown in Figure 11, and because non-bank entities represent a relatively larger proportion of the U.S. financial system. As a result, a given amount of asset purchases relative to gross domestic product may have a more significant impact on the U.S. banking system than it would on the banking systems in other countries. The ON RRP facility can continue to provide a floor on rates and broaden the set of holders of Federal Reserve liabilities beyond reserves held by banks.\n\nUltimately, it is the price adjustments in money markets that will determine the mix of liabilities between reserves and the ON RRP facility.12 These price adjustments could also affect the mix of other Federal Reserve liabilities, although likely to a lesser degree. The Federal Reserve offers accounts and investments to certain official institutions and financial market utilities (FMUs). As money market rates decline, these entities may also increase their balances. As shown in Figure 12, some of these other liabilities have grown notably over the past year. For example, although still lower than in earlier years, Foreign Official and International Monetary Authority (FIMA) accounts have recently increased their reverse repo pool investments and unremunerated balances with the New York Fed, shown in dark blue and red, respectively.13 Other deposits with Reserve Banks, which primarily comprise accounts for Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) and FMUs designated systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, have also increased materially.\n\nAn Update of ON RRP Terms Ensures it Supports Effective Policy Implementation\n\nAs a measure of prudent planning, the Open Market Trading Desk (\"Desk\") recently conducted a review of key design features of the ON RRP facility to ensure that the facility's terms continue to support effective policy implementation. We found that the existing ON RRP facility counterparty types—MMFs, GSEs and banks, as well as primary dealers—continue to cover the major investors in the tri-party repo market in which the Desk operates the ON RRP. However, the MMF industry has grown in size and has become more concentrated at the largest funds since the facility's $30 billion per-counterparty limit was set in 2014. In light of this evolution, the FOMC decided to increase the ON RRP facility per-counterparty limit to $80 billion in order to restore the capacity of the facility relative to the aggregate size of money fund counterparties to roughly the level that prevailed when the $30 billion limit was established. This should help ensure that the ON RRP facility maintains a floor for the federal funds rate and supports effective policy implementation. Related to this review, the Desk is planning in coming months to relax certain eligibility criteria that MMFs and GSEs, in particular, must meet in order to be eligible as ON RRP facility counterparties.14 These changes could reduce barriers to entry in the industry for smaller MMFs and promote a more fair and inclusive marketplace.\n\nSince the most recent FOMC meeting, the facility has continued to serve as an effective floor even as greater downward pressure on overnight secured rates has emerged. There has been relatively modest take-up on most days as the ON RRP facility has bolstered money market lenders' bargaining power. Take-up at March quarter-end rose to $134 billion, and the ON RRP facility provided an outlet for investors on this date when financial firms managed their balance sheets more tightly.\n\nSince the facility's inception, we have periodically observed some repo trading at rates below the ON RRP offering rate, as shown in Figure 13 by the first percentiles of the Tri-party General Collateral Rate (TGCR) and SOFR. Recently some activity has occurred at rates below zero in interdealer markets, as captured in the SOFR first percentile. This appears to be technical in nature, driven in part by the value that dealers place on the ability to centrally clear these transactions and net their balance sheet exposures. Given these benefits, we understand that dealers who have access to the ON RRP facility are lending at modestly negative rates. Even as modest volumes occur at rates below the ON RRP rate, the facility continues provide an effective floor. However, we will continue to monitor money markets closely and make adjustments to ON RRP operations as needed.\n\nAdministered Rates Support Effective Policy Implementation\n\nIn addition to ensuring that the ON RRP’s facility's terms continue to support effective policy implementation, it might be appropriate to implement adjustments to administered rates should undue downward pressure on overnight rates emerge, as noted in the minutes of the March FOMC meeting released last week. The Federal Reserve has adjusted administered rates relative to the target range on numerous occasions in recent years as conditions in overnight markets have evolved, as shown in Figure 14. Such adjustments are purely technical steps to support effective policy implementation and to maintain the federal funds rate well within the target range.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the adjustment to higher reserve levels has important implications for money markets. I have been pleased that the FOMC's implementation framework continues to accommodate the adjustment to higher reserve levels resulting from the FOMC's actions to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions.\n\nGiven the significant increase in reserves and reduction in Treasury bill supply since the start of the year, overnight money market rates have softened. With reserves expected to grow further, we will be monitoring money markets closely and will continue to make adjustments as needed.\n\nIn this environment, I am confident that the Federal Reserve's tools will continue to support effective policy implementation. IOER sets a benchmark for bank lending and borrowing activity, and the ON RRP facility establishes a floor for overnight rates. Ultimately, it is these administered rates and the spread between them that will control overnight money market rates in the FOMC's ample reserves regime and will influence the mix of Federal Reserve liabilities.\n\nI would like to thank SIFMA and the organizers of this event for the opportunity to speak here today. I look forward to the Q&A session, as well as the roundtable on Treasury market structure that follows.\n\nFigures PDF\n\n\n1 I would like to thank Yan Chow, Mike Koslow, and Tim Wessel for their assistance in preparing these remarks; Christian Sayers for his assistance with data; and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for valuable comments and suggestions.\n\n2 For more information on bank reserve management practices, see the results of the Federal Reserve Board’s  September 2020 Senior Financial Officer Survey.\n\n3 Another repo investor type that has grown recently is Government Sponsored Enterprises, as mortgage refinancing activity has increased due to lower long-term interest rates. They typically invest large temporary cash inflows from principal and interest (P&I) payments made by homeowners into secured money markets in preparation for monthly MBS P&I payments. The concentration of cash flows within a few calendar days results in additional downward pressure on secured rates.\n\n4 This spread has been wide at times since 2016, following the implementation of money market fund regulatory reforms that resulted in prime MMFs experiencing significant outflows.\n\n5 See the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets’ Overview of Recent Events and Potential Reform Options for Money Market Funds, December 2020.\n\n6 In particular, some banks may perceive costs as their balance sheets grow and leverage ratios become a larger consideration in balance sheet management.\n\n7 See Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, January 30, 2019.\n\n8 Logan, Lorie K. (2019). Observations on Implementing Monetary Policy in an Ample-Reserves Regime, speech delivered at the Money Marketeers, April 17, 2019.\n\n9 The EFFR has printed above the bottom of the target range on all dates since 2014 except for year-end 2015, when it printed 5 basis points below the bottom of the target range. In late 2016, low overnight repo rates were observed relative to the target rate range due to the rapid increase in government MMF AUM following money market fund regulatory reforms and a reduction in Treasury bill supply ahead of the 2017 debt ceiling deadline. Repo rates for this period are indicative as SOFR was not yet published.\n\n10 FOMC Minutes, June and July 2014.\n\n11 Frost, Josh, Lorie Logan, Antoine Martin, Patrick McCabe, Fabio Natalucci, and Julie Remache (2015). “Overnight RRP Operations as a Monetary Policy Tool: Some Design Considerations,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2015-010.

    "text": "Thank you, Kseniya [Benderskaya], for the introduction. And thank you all for joining us this afternoon in-person in El Paso or on the livestream.\n\nI am happy to be back in this important border community as part of my 360 Listening Tour. These ongoing visits to communities throughout the Dallas Fed’s district help me connect with the people we serve. And each person I meet shares insights that deepen my understanding of the local and national economies.\n\nDuring a visit to the Borderplex area last year, I toured a maquiladora in Juarez that specializes in medical equipment. At the time, official data had not yet indicated any increase in foreign direct investment in Mexico as a result of nearshoring. But leading up to the visit, I was hearing a very different story from our contacts in the area. Factories were opening, new business opportunities were arising, and there was a lot of commercial interest in the area. En route to the maquiladora, I saw this growth firsthand: active maquiladoras, new construction and price adjustments on existing properties that clearly signaled growing demand. Although the official statistics didn’t yet show this trend, there was no denying what we could see in real time.\n\nThat direct observation, inspired by what we’d heard from local contacts, is just one example of how on-the-ground insights improve the Fed’s understanding of the economy and our thinking about policy. I bring those perspectives with me to Washington for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings where we set monetary policy for the United States.\n\nOur goal today, as always, is to hear your perspectives on the economy, but today’s event is special in one way. Besides being part of my ongoing listening tour, this gathering is part of the national Fed Listens initiative and will contribute to the ongoing five-year review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools and communications—what we call our monetary policy framework. I’d like to begin with a few thoughts on that framework to frame our discussion. As always, these views are not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\n\nOne of the Fed’s five statutory functions is to carry out monetary policy to pursue two goals established by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. Monetary policy influences the economy gradually, over time, and its effects depend in part on how families and businesses expect monetary policy to evolve in the future. For example, if you’re deciding whether to buy a car or house or invest in a business, your decision probably depends not only on how the economy looks today but also on your expectations for the future. How secure will your job be? How much will it pay? How much demand will there be for your company’s products? And those long-term economic outcomes in turn depend partly on future monetary policy.\n\nSo, to achieve the best long-run outcomes with monetary policy, the FOMC must act for the long term. We must have a clear strategy and follow it over time. We must communicate that strategy effectively, so the public knows what we’re doing and what to expect. And we must use our tools well, so that we can actually implement the strategy. The monetary policy framework allows us to operate strategically in that way.\n\nThe FOMC first formally established its monetary policy framework in a statement issued in 2012. Many elements of the framework have been constant since then, in keeping with our long-run approach to policymaking. For example, the initial framework established our long-run price stability goal of a 2 percent inflation rate as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures. That goal remains firmly established today. Communicating it helps anchor long-run inflation expectations at the 2 percent target and reinforces price stability.\n\nThe initial framework also established that the complex, dynamic nature of the labor market means we can’t specify a fixed, numeric goal for maximum employment. Rather, we must assess labor market conditions in a more nuanced way. And the initial framework emphasized the importance of the FOMC’s firm commitment to our Congressional dual mandate and of communicating clearly with the public—both to make policy effective and to foster transparency and democratic accountability. All of those points, too, remain firmly established.\n\nHowever, while the monetary policy framework is a long-run framework, it is not an immutable framework. The structure of the economy changes over time, and the framework needs to adjust periodically to reflect both those economic changes and the FOMC’s ongoing learning about which policy approaches are most effective. For that reason, we review the framework every five years to consider what updates may be needed.\n\nThe current version of the framework was written in 2019 and 2020, and it reflects the challenges of that time. Following the Global Financial Crisis, the United States experienced close to a decade of low growth, low interest rates, and below-target inflation that responded only weakly to gains in employment. Drawing on that experience, the framework adopted five years ago emphasized judging the labor market based on shortfalls of employment relative to the maximum level and making up for past low inflation by allowing inflation to temporarily overshoot the target.\n\nWe are now in a higher-rate environment, and the postpandemic experience provides ample evidence of the potential for inflation to surge far above target. So while we should remain willing to forcefully use all available tools in scenarios of low rates and low inflation, I believe we should also make the monetary policy framework robust to a wider range of scenarios. Regarding inflation, it seems more appropriate to me to focus on achieving our inflation target going forward, rather than trying to make up for past shortfalls of inflation. In the labor market, I am inclined to pay more attention to increases of employment above the maximum sustainable level, not just shortfalls from that level. And I believe that, to help the public understand how policymakers think about a range of possible environments, the FOMC should consider how our communications can better convey key risks and uncertainties and how monetary policy would respond to them.\n\nThis year’s framework review has three main elements: a research conference held last month at the Federal Reserve Board, ongoing deliberations at FOMC meetings and Fed Listens events such as this one. Public dialogue like today’s is particularly important given the Federal Reserve System’s structure.\n\nIn remarks last week in Waco, I discussed two unique elements of the Fed’s structure that are crucial to how we serve you. The Fed is not one centralized organization but rather a federated system with deep local roots. And in our monetary policy responsibilities, the Fed operates independently while remaining accountable to the public through elected leaders. Let me say more about each of those characteristics and how they relate to the framework review and today’s meeting.\n\nThe Fed consists of a Board of Governors in Washington as well as 12 regional reserve banks, the one I lead in Dallas and 11 others, that serve districts around the United States. As I mentioned at the start, this network of operations gives us insight into communities’ unique economic circumstances. That helps the Fed make the best economic decisions to serve the country as a whole. And because each reserve bank is a separate corporation with its own board of directors representing the public in the district, the people of the region have a direct say in how we do our work and can hold us accountable for ensuring your voices are heard in the national conversation.\n\nTurning to monetary policy, to have a sustainably strong economy, a central bank has to make decisions with the long run in mind. In the short run, a central bank could juice employment by cutting interest rates. People might enjoy that for a little while, but over time, excessive rate cuts would trigger a spiral of inflation. And those rising prices would wipe out whatever temporary benefits people experienced from a hot labor market.\n\nCongress designed the Federal Reserve System to promote that long-term focus while maintaining ultimate accountability to the public. Members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to serve 14-year terms. Reserve bank presidents, like me, are appointed to five-year terms by our local boards of directors, with approval by the Board of Governors. All of us serve together on the FOMC, and the long terms for our roles allow us to think about which policies will best serve the country over time.\n\nBut while the Fed’s leaders aren’t up for election, we remain accountable to the public for achieving our assigned monetary policy goals. That accountability comes through the Fed chair’s regular, semiannual testimony to Congress, our extensive public dialogue and communications, and ultimately through the regular turnover of governors and reserve bank presidents as terms are completed and new leaders are appointed.\n\nToday’s conversation deepens the Fed’s local roots and contributes to our independence coupled with accountability. It is your opportunity to tell us how our monetary policy decisions affect you and your communities, what economic concerns you think we should focus on, how you judge the performance of our strategy over the past five years, and what strategic approach you think we should take in the future. Your experiences and insights will complement the data and models we analyze and help us form a more complete picture of how the economy is working for the people we serve.\n\nOur participants today represent a wide range of critical perspectives: nonprofit service providers, education, workforce development, economic development, local philanthropy and business. Many thanks to all of you who made the time to be here today and share your views."

    "text": "Welcome. Thank you, Mark [Wynne], for the introduction. I’m excited to be here with you all today and to welcome you to the Dallas Fed.\n\nThis week’s conference will focus on how banks fund their activities. Funding is a basic aspect of banking, and it particularly comes into focus during stress episodes, such as the one we experienced last year. Funding models can also influence the diversity and competitiveness of the banking system over time, and in my remarks today, I’m going to spotlight those considerations. \n\nI’m so pleased that our friends at the Atlanta Fed collaborated with us to organize and host this conference, including my colleague President Raphael Bostic, who will speak tomorrow. I’m delighted to be joined by so many distinguished banking and policy leaders, including Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman, who will give keynote remarks at dinner this evening; Agustin Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, who will give tomorrow’s opening keynote; and my colleague Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, who will participate in a fireside chat this afternoon. And I’m thrilled to bring together industry, policymaker and academic perspectives for this important conversation.\n\nThe importance of bank funding\nFunding risk is both one of the oldest challenges in banking and one of the most timely. The most basic activity banks do is transform deposits into longer-term investments. Banks accept deposits, promise to return them whenever depositors want and invest in the meantime in less-liquid assets, such as loans that finance investment and fuel economic growth.\n\nSo, as I’m sure the panelists in our history session this afternoon will discuss, bankers have long understood the importance of being prepared to meet withdrawals—and of maintaining depositors’ confidence so they don’t withdraw money based on unfounded fears.\n\nBut as we saw in 2023, maintaining depositors’ confidence can be challenging in today’s highly networked society that allows bank runs to propagate with unprecedented speed. Now that banking conditions have stabilized and the immediate pressures banks felt last year have passed—though we should always remain watchful for any risks that may emerge—it’s a good time to consider whether adjustments in banks’ liquidity risk management or in related public policies can support a strong and vibrant banking system in the modern environment.\n\nI’m looking forward to the ideas and insights all of you will share today and tomorrow. I’d like to start with a few perspectives of my own, and I’ll note these will be my perspectives and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.  \n\nA framework for the issues\nFrom my standpoint, there are three main ways to ensure sound liquidity risk management in banking. First, regulations can require banks to hold a certain amount of liquid assets, or banks can choose to do so voluntarily. This approach is important, but relying exclusively on it would have a drawback. By limiting the amount of liquidity transformation banks do, this approach limits the amount of banking they do.\n\nSecond, as a complement to holding liquid assets, bankers and regulators can ensure banks have reliable and ready access to contingent funding sources. Contingent funding can come from private markets and from central bank backstops such as the Federal Reserve’s discount window and Standing Repo Facility or from similar facilities that other central banks offer firms in their countries with funding from dollar swap lines. We’ll have a panel on contingent liquidity tomorrow.\n\nAnd third, banks and regulators can work to stabilize the deposit and funding base. For example, diversifying deposit sources can make a bank’s funding more resilient. And deposit insurance can reinforce customers’ confidence that their money is safe, thus preventing bank runs and limiting the potential liquidity outflows that banks may need to meet.\n\nThese three approaches interact. Buffers of liquid assets and sound plans for contingent funding can reassure depositors and prevent runs, accomplishing some of the same goals as deposit insurance. And to the degree deposit insurance succeeds in preventing runs, banks may not need as much access to liquid assets or contingent funding.\n\nExperience over recent years has demonstrated that the discount window and the Fed’s other liquidity tools are effective in supporting the stability of the banking and financial systems and, in turn, the flow of credit to households and businesses. However, the payments and financial systems, the economy, and technology continue to evolve rapidly. That evolution can create new liquidity challenges and needs, as well as new opportunities for the Fed to serve the public efficiently and effectively. \n\nOur last full review of the discount window function took place more than 20 years ago. By examining our approach to discount window lending in the current environment and in light of recent experience, we can ensure the window continues to provide ready access to liquidity going forward. \n\nA critical element, in my view, is enhancing depository institutions’ operational readiness to use the discount window. In my opinion, every bank in America should be fully set up at the window as part of its liquidity toolkit. That means completing legal documents and establishing collateral arrangements well before any funding need arises. And it means testing the plumbing—practicing the steps needed to take out and repay a loan and to move collateral between the Fed and other funding sources. A bank facing a rapid run will not have the luxury of waiting for setup or learning the procedures. \n\nWorking together with bankers, the Federal Reserve System has already made substantial progress toward enhanced operational readiness at the window. More than 5,000 depository institutions have signed the necessary legal documents. They’ve pledged $3 trillion in collateral, up $1 trillion from last year. And we’ve launched Discount Window Direct, an online portal that lets depository institutions more efficiently request loans.\n\nI’m optimistic that through further modernization of our technology and policies, as well as ongoing partnership with banks, we can ensure the discount window remains a powerful tool for providing the banking system ample access to liquidity.\n\nDeposit insurance for a diverse and competitive banking system\nTurning to deposit insurance, the Federal Reserve does not establish those policies. Deposit insurance is the responsibility of Congress, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration. But deposit insurance policies do, as I mentioned, interact with liquidity provisions by the Fed, as well as our work supervising banks and promoting financial stability. So I’d like to offer some thoughts on those interactions and how deposit insurance can best support a banking ecosystem that serves our economy well.\n\nMy starting principle is that deposit insurance policies, like all banking policies, should support a level playing field and fair competition among banks. Fair competition is a fundamental element of our market economy. Across all industries, fair competition promotes innovation, opportunity and diverse business models that can meet the needs of many different customers. And that is just as true in banking as in any other business.\n\nI grew up in Versailles, Kentucky, a small town with a tight-knit community. In Versailles, like so many other small towns in the United States, our community bank catalyzed economic growth. Observing this relationship instilled in me an appreciation for how smaller banks support strong communities and local economies.\n\nMy conversations with business and community leaders as I travel the Eleventh District reinforce that appreciation. We heard from a woman in the Rio Grande Valley who dreamed of expanding her snack stand. She didn’t have financial statements to present to a bank for a loan. But the bankers at a local community bank were regular customers, and they got to talking about her ambitions. They realized she had a checking account at the bank, and the account history of revenue and expenses showed she had a viable business. The bankers worked with the snack stand owner to help her craft a business plan and get a loan to expand. She now has multiple locations and even several franchisees. That type of local knowledge and relationship-based lending is a specialty of smaller banks.\n\nCommunities’ needs vary. To maintain a vibrant banking system that can meet those diverse needs, policies should support a level playing field. That way, the banking models that best serve customers and communities will come out ahead in the marketplace.\n\nIn my view, a level playing field is achievable when it comes to deposit insurance, but that could require some change. Right now, a couple of factors related to deposit insurance come together to give the largest banks a potential advantage in attracting deposits. Federal insurance coverage is limited to $250,000 per depositor. That limit is supposed to give small depositors confidence while creating incentives for larger depositors to investigate their banks’ condition. While large depositors could theoretically provide helpful market discipline, they also often perceive—rightly or wrongly—that some banks are too big to fail and that the government will bail out those banks or their depositors in a crisis. Such perceptions undermine market discipline and tilt the playing field toward big banks.\n\nWhen I checked recently, several of the country’s biggest banks were offering interest rates of just 1 to 6 basis points on a standard savings account. How many community banks can attract deposits at rates like that, when money market rates are over 500 basis points? Of course, there are many reasons why the largest banks may be able to pay lower interest rates than other banks. For example, some customers may value these banks’ wide range of capital markets, settlement, custodial, international and other services or their extensive branch networks. \n\nBut the evidence of a tilt goes beyond interest rates. Amid the severe banking stresses in early 2023, we heard many reports of depositors pulling their funds from smaller banks and moving to the largest ones. Just in the second week of March 2023, deposits at the country’s 25 largest banks rose $113 billion, while deposits at all other domestic banks fell $172 billion. The shift was significant enough that executives at several of the largest banks mentioned it in their quarterly earnings calls. One described “significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows,” while another reported seeing “noticeable flight to safety.” Meanwhile, at regional banks, executives were saying things like “68 percent of our dollars that went out, went out to larger banks, the money center banks,” and certain customers “wanted to pull money out from all regional banks.”\n\nIf you step back and look at how deposit insurance works, these actions by depositors aren’t surprising. And although the flows to larger banks ebbed as banking conditions calmed, the underlying incentives remain.\n\nEspecially when it comes to business accounts, $250,000 isn’t such a large deposit. A small business employing 110 people at the median wage would need $250,000 in its checking account just to cover a biweekly payroll. What small business owner has time to conduct regular, thorough checkups on a bank’s health? So, many depositors prefer to bank at institutions where they don’t have to think hard about whether their funds are safe. \n\nAnd there’s an important exception to the $250,000 limit. If a bank fails and the Treasury secretary and the boards of the FDIC and Federal Reserve agree there’s a serious threat to financial stability, the FDIC can cover all deposits, even those above the limit. The government makes no advance commitments about when it will invoke that systemic risk exception. The exception has sometimes been applied to cover uninsured deposits at relatively small banks, such as when Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank failed in 2023. Still, most depositors didn’t foresee that action. If they had, they probably wouldn’t have run on SVB and Signature in the first place. By contrast, while the government has not provided a formal guarantee to the eight U.S. firms designated as Global Systemically Important Banks, or G-SIBs, most market participants think it’s pretty unlikely the authorities would let those firms’ depositors lose money. After all, these banks are officially systemically important.\n\nThe perception that certain banks are too big to fail tilts the playing field. Some people argue that stringent regulations on big banks counterbalance any too-big-to-fail benefits. But even if the costs and benefits of size are equal most of the time, the equation breaks when stresses emerge and the value of a perceived guarantee is suddenly much larger.\n\nConceptually, there are a couple of possibilities for restoring balance. Regulators could adopt even tougher regulations on the largest banks. But such regulations could put a drag on the economy by raising big banks’ costs for some of the unique and critical intermediation services they provide. Or, authorities could increase the deposit insurance limit so that deposits would be more equally protected at all banks. The FDIC proposed some interesting options along those lines in a report last year. Of course, the benefits of a higher limit have to be weighed against potential costs, such as whether deposit insurance premiums would need to rise or whether a higher limit could increase moral hazard and encourage banks to take excessive risks.\n\nWe have a panel on deposit insurance this afternoon, and I’m eager to hear how the panelists weigh these and other costs and benefits. Ultimately Congress would make any decisions. But I would offer just a few more reasons why the current limit may be too low.\n\nFor starters, the economy has grown substantially since Congress last raised the limit in 2008. If the limit had increased since then in line with nominal gross domestic product, it would be nearly half a million dollars today. \n\nAnother reason is the invocation of the systemic risk exception to cover SVB and Signature in 2023. This was clearly the right decision to protect the economy and financial system once the banks had failed. But the need to provide insurance after the fact to depositors who weren’t supposed to receive it and whose banks had not been regulated as systemically important suggests to me the insurance limit was too low in the first place. \n\nLastly, I’d note the growing use of reciprocal deposit networks, which allow banks to swap deposits in excess of the limit with each other to provide depositors more insurance. Reciprocal deposits reached $379 billion in the first quarter of this year, up from $157 billion at the end of 2022. The vast majority of reciprocal deposits—89 percent—are at banks with less than $100 billion in assets. That reflects both the funding environment for smaller banks and the less-favorable regulatory treatment of very large reciprocal deposits.\n\nReciprocal deposits can cost banks more than 10 basis points in network fees. Smaller banks’ willingness to pay this cost to work around the deposit insurance limit suggests the limit’s too low. As a society, if we’re going to provide the insurance anyway—which is what happens when banks use reciprocal deposits—we may as well increase the limit so we can avoid the costs, operational risks and regulatory mirages involved in passing deposits back and forth between banks.\n\nStill, there is lots to learn here, and I’m eager to hear all of your views.\n\nConclusion\nTurning to our agenda, over the next day and a half, we’ll examine not only the role of deposit insurance in today’s financial system, but also the stressors that led to the events of last spring; lessons from historic financial crises; and the future of the discount window and other contingent liquidity sources. We’ll also have a roundtable discussion on what academics, bankers and regulators see as the key risks and challenges in bank funding.\n\nThese discussions will deepen our understanding of banks’ funding vulnerabilities and help the industry and regulators prepare better for the future.\n\nThank you all for joining us today, and many thanks to the entire team here and at the Atlanta Fed who worked so hard to make this conference happen. \n\nNow, let’s welcome Arthur Lindo, who will chair today’s first session, “A look back at the regional banking stresses of 2023.”"

    "text": "Good morning. Thank you all for joining us again today. Yesterday’s discussions were so enriching, and I’m excited to build on them this morning.\n\nAs you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced interest rates earlier this week and announced it would end the runoff of the Fed’s asset holdings as of Dec. 1. In my remarks this morning, I’ll discuss the stance of monetary policy. I’ll then turn to the topic of this conference and describe how the Fed’s balance sheet fosters a safe and efficient liquidity environment for the U.S. banking system. These are my views and not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\n\nMonetary policy\nI would have preferred to hold interest rates steady at this week’s FOMC meeting. Congress gave the FOMC a dual mandate: to pursue maximum employment and stable prices. The labor market remains balanced and cooling slowly. Inflation remains too high, taxing the budgets of businesses and families, and appears likely to exceed the FOMC’s 2 percent target for too much longer. This economic outlook didn’t call for cutting rates.\n\nWhile the government shutdown has reduced the availability of national statistics, a wide range of alternative data sources continue to provide visibility into the state of the economy. Those sources include private-sector indicators, continuing administrative data such as unemployment claims, regional surveys run by many of the Federal Reserve banks, and the many conversations that my colleagues and I have with business and community contacts every week.\n\nThe labor market remains roughly balanced. At 4.3 percent, the latest reading on the unemployment rate was up only slightly over the past year on net.\n\nPayroll job gains fell markedly in 2025. But slow job gains don’t necessarily mean there’s more slack in the labor market. Labor supply has fallen at the same time as demand, particularly due to changes in immigration policy and labor force participation. In consequence, despite the drop in job growth, we’re not seeing a rapidly widening gap between the number of jobs available and the number of people who want work.\n\nMy staff estimates that break-even payroll growth, the number of net new jobs needed to hold unemployment steady, has fallen to around 30,000 jobs per month. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has delayed its September employment report. However, private-sector data suggest September payroll growth remained near the level that would keep the market in rough balance. Likewise, layoffs and unemployment claims have stayed low, although I’m mindful of recent layoff announcements by some large employers.\n\nResilient consumer and business spending continues to support employment. Consumer spending growth has slowed from last year, but only to a pace that equals or slightly exceeds the longer-run trend. Stock market gains are fueling wealthier households’ demand. Large companies are investing enthusiastically in artificial intelligence and data centers. The picture for lower-income families and smaller businesses is softer than the aggregate, but it remains stable.\n\nThe Dallas Fed Weekly Economic Index combines 10 daily and weekly data series to deliver a rapid signal of the state of the economy. It is averaging 2.4 percent. That’s consistent with strong gross domestic product growth in the third quarter.\n\nThe risks to the labor market do lie mainly to the downside. In this low-hiring environment, the job market could have difficulty absorbing any significant pickup in layoffs from the current low level. Buoyant asset valuations can sometimes snap back without much warning, which might take the wind out of consumer spending. And the federal government shutdown will pose greater risks to economic activity the longer it continues. But these are all risks the FOMC will be able to closely monitor and address promptly if there is evidence they are becoming more likely to materialize.\n\nTurning to the price stability side of the mandate, inflation is still too high and too slow to return to target. The FOMC targets a 2 percent inflation rate as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. Inflation by that measure exceeded the target in each of the past four years. It’s on track to do so again this year. The index rose 1.8 percent just in the first eight months of the year, and forecasters expect it to end the year up about 2.9 percent.\n\nWhile inflation has come down significantly from the postpandemic peak, it’s still not convincingly headed all the way back to 2 percent. The Blue Chip Economic Indicators surveys dozens of private-sector forecasters about their economic outlooks. The Blue Chip consensus outlook is for 2.6 percent PCE inflation in 2026 and around 2.4 percent in 2027, followed by fluctuations between 2.1 and 2.2 percent all the way out to at least 2031—never all the way back to target.\n\nThe FOMC’s 2 percent inflation target is a serious commitment. We’ve reaffirmed it repeatedly, most recently in the “Statement on Longer-run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy” we issued this August. Our obligation to the public is to deliver on this commitment.\n\nTo be sure, inflation persistently running several tenths above the target is not the emergency that inflation persistently several percentage points above the target would be. And we have an equally serious obligation to pursue maximum employment. The FOMC’s long-run strategy calls for a balanced approach to our two objectives. I carefully weigh the potential labor market costs of measures to reduce inflation. But labor demand and supply remain in balance. The FOMC already mitigated downside risks by cutting rates at its previous meeting, in September. The remaining risks to employment are ones we can monitor closely and respond to if they are becoming more likely to materialize, not ones that currently warrant further preemptive action. For those reasons, I did not see a need to cut rates this week. And I’d find it difficult to cut rates again in December unless there is clear evidence that inflation will fall faster than expected or that the labor market will cool more rapidly.\n\nBalance sheet normalization\nThe FOMC also decided to stop reducing the Fed’s asset holdings as of Dec. 1, ending a phase of balance sheet normalization that began in mid-2022. In contrast to the action on interest rates, the decision to end asset runoff was one I supported. Money market conditions indicate the Fed’s balance sheet is now much closer to a normal size, following the expansion in response to economic and financial stresses during the pandemic and the subsequent runoff.\n\nMore than just a return to normal, the reduction in the balance sheet forms part of how the Fed promotes safe and efficient liquidity for our nation’s banks. Of course, the primary responsibility for banks’ funding and liquidity risk management rests with bankers. Still, the Fed’s balance sheet underpins some aspects of bankers’ decisions, and that’s what I’d like to talk with you about today.\n\nEfficient reserve supply\nThe Fed’s single largest liability, nearly half the balance sheet in total, is bank reserves. U.S. dollar reserves are the safest and most liquid asset in the world. Reserves are assets to the banks that hold them and, correspondingly, liabilities for the Fed. A dollar of reserves is always worth exactly one dollar: no more, no less. Reserves are also the only asset a bank can use immediately to meet a withdrawal or send a payment.\n\nIf you’re holding a loan to one of your customers, a corporate bond, or even a Treasury bill, you have to sell that asset or borrow against it to get money before you can make a payment. Reserves, by contrast, already are money. You can make a payment with reserves right away. You never have to monetize them first. In normal times, it’s straightforward for healthy banks to borrow against assets to get cash. But when markets come under stress, or when a bank needs to quickly obtain unusual amounts of liquidity, monetizing assets can be more difficult. Reserves help a bank manage its liquidity risk and serve customers efficiently through thick and thin.\n\nAs authorized by Congress, the Fed pays interest on banks’ reserve holdings. These interest payments have no material cost to taxpayers because, over time, the Fed covers them out of interest earnings on its assets. However, interest on reserves plays a crucial role in the efficiency and safety of the banking system.\n\nWhen the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB) is close to interest rates on other money market instruments, it doesn’t cost banks anything to hold reserves to meet their liquidity needs. If reserves paid less than market rates, on the other hand, or no interest at all, each dollar of reserve holdings would cost a bank the difference between market rates and IORB. Banks would have a strong incentive to avoid holding reserves.\n\nThe Fed didn’t pay interest on reserves until 2008, and the old system was inefficient and risky. Because reserves were costly to hold, banks tried to hold as few reserves as possible. With few reserves on hand, banks often throttled outgoing payments until they received incoming money each day. Banks also arranged their business models to reduce regulatory reserve requirements, and then they tried to minimize their actual reserve holdings by lending anything above the regulatory minimums to other banks.\n\nConsidering that it doesn’t cost the Fed to provide reserves, all those gymnastics represented wasted effort for the economy. And that’s the best case. If costly liquidity held banks back from providing services their customers would have valued, the old system of scarce reserves put a brake on economic growth—for no good reason. Moreover, if banks were taking unnecessary liquidity risk because they avoided holding the safest, most liquid asset in existence, the financial system was more vulnerable to shocks—again, for no good reason.\n\nSince 2008, the Fed has met banks’ demand for reserves with interest on reserves close to market rates. In 2019, the FOMC decided to continue implementing monetary policy in the long run in this framework of ample reserves. This is, quite simply, a better approach: better for banks, better for the households and businesses that are their customers, and better for the U.S. economy. I’m proud the Fed adopted it, and I’m committed to continuing it.\n\nIf reserves are so great, why did the FOMC run off asset holdings from 2022 to 2025 and, consequently, also reduce reserve supply? Like I used to tell my kids when we went to the ice cream shop, it’s possible to have too much of a good thing. The FOMC acquired large quantities of assets during the pandemic to support smooth market functioning, sustain the flow of credit and provide economic stimulus. Those purchases helped keep the public health crisis from turning into a financial crisis or recession. But among their side effects was that the purchases made reserves not just ample but abundant or super-abundant—more plentiful, that is, than the quantity banks wanted to hold with market rates near IORB.\n\nIt’s clear reserve supply exceeded banks’ demand because market interest rates fell significantly below interest on reserves. In 2022, rates on overnight repurchase agreements, or repos, collateralized by Treasury securities ran 10 or more basis points below IORB.\n\nSupplying too many reserves is just as inefficient as supplying too few reserves. When aggregate reserve supply is too high, the banking system holds reserves instead of more productive assets. And liquidity is too expensive for financial institutions other than banks. To best serve the economy in normal times, the Fed needs to strike a balance and supply an efficient quantity of reserves—neither too many nor too few.\n\nThe transition to ample reserves\nThere are many indicators of reserve ampleness, but the most significant one to me is the position of money market rates relative to IORB. In an efficient system, market rates should be close to, but perhaps slightly below, interest on reserves on average over time.\n\n“On average” is key there. Market rates can fluctuate from day to day. Bringing the average level close to IORB also requires some tolerance for modest, temporary moves above IORB.\n\nThose fluctuations should help, in fact, in returning the Fed’s balance sheet to an efficient size. Many banks have adapted their business models to an environment with more-than-ample reserves and market rates consistently below interest on reserves. These adaptations likely increased the aggregate demand for reserves compared with the prepandemic level. There’s a ratchet effect: To meet banks’ reserve demand in the short run, the Fed now must supply more reserves than it would have previously.\n\nSince late summer, market rates have risen significantly relative to IORB. The rise in market rates relative to IORB will likely make many banks want to cut back on reserve holdings. There is only so much a bank can do, though, to reduce its reserve needs from one day or week to the next. It takes time to shed unwanted deposits or to adjust the composition of assets and liabilities so the bank needs less immediate liquidity. By sustaining a period of money market rates averaging close to IORB, including some modest, temporary swings higher, the FOMC can give banks the incentive to make longer-term adjustments. In turn, those adjustments will undo the ratchet effect, allowing the FOMC to meet banks’ long-run demand for reserves, rather than the temporarily higher short-run demand. This will let the Fed operate with a smaller, more efficient balance sheet over time while continuing to foster safe and efficient liquidity for the banking system.\n\nHowever, it is important not to take those incentives too far. Rates averaging above IORB in a sustained way would be inefficient.\n\nThe FOMC has followed a two-part strategy to help banks adapt and bring the financial system to reserve levels that will be ample in the long run.\n\nFirst, we reduced reserve supply gradually. After beginning asset runoff in 2022, we twice slowed the pace of runoff to produce a gentler glide path for aggregate reserves. The gradual decline in reserves gave banks more time to change their business models and their own balance sheets during the transition from abundant to ample reserves.\n\nSecond, the Fed has established strong tools to put a ceiling on money market rates and to provide additional liquidity if needed.\n\nThe Fed’s ceiling tools\nThe discount window is available every business day to healthy banks, with primary credit offered against a wide range of collateral at an interest rate equal to the top of the fed funds target range. The Federal Reserve banks continue to work to make the window more usable. We’re taking on board the public feedback we received from a formal request for information last year. The industry wants transparency about the amount a bank can borrow, prompt approval of loans and seamless movement of collateral. We hear that feedback, and we’re working to modernize our operations. For example, our Discount Window Direct tool now lets bankers request loans online, and we’re working toward allowing firms to manage collateral there, as well. Yesterday’s panel addressed the interactions between the discount window and the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs). We’re collaborating with the FHLBs to streamline those connections.\n\nThe Fed’s Standing Repo Facility (SRF) also offers funding to eligible counterparties at the top of the target range against Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. I was disappointed to see rates on a large share of tri-party repo transactions exceed the SRF rate at times this week. I anticipate that primary dealers will use the facility to obtain repo funding when it is economical to do so. Drawing on the SRF when the rate is economical is a sound way for a primary dealer to serve the market. With rates averaging higher than they were just a few months ago, the likelihood of the SRF rate becoming economical on some days is higher. Dealers may now need to step up their readiness to access the SRF in response to rate moves.\n\nBut the way the Fed implements SRF operations can also affect counterparties’ willingness to use it. This year, the Open Market Trading Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York added morning-settlement SRF operations to provide funding earlier in the day. Counterparties have responded positively to that enhancement. In my view, central clearing would further strengthen the facility’s effectiveness. The Fed’s counterparties could net down centrally cleared SRF borrowing against onward lending to other firms. Netting would reduce counterparties’ costs and risks of intermediating SRF funds to the broader market, helping liquidity to flow efficiently through the financial system. Streamlined SRF borrowing could be particularly helpful in the event of financial stress. Times of stress are the times when it’s most crucial for the Fed to be able to deliver the liquidity the system needs. Yet times of stress are also exactly when market participants try to de-risk their balance sheets by pulling back from intermediation.\n\nMoreover, central clearing of Fed operations would align with the private-sector repo market’s ongoing shift toward central clearing. Broader central clearing of Treasury repos will support financial stability by netting down many risks and providing strong, standardized risk management and transparency for the risks that remain. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has mandated central clearing of many Treasury repos between private sector participants by June 2027. I am pleased by the industry’s progress on the legal, operational and technological work to implement this important change, and I encourage industry leaders to maintain focus on the remaining steps to complete it.\n\nEffective ceiling tools will allow the FOMC to permit modest interest rate fluctuations without risking large upward spikes in rates.\n\nThe outlook for money market conditions and reserves\nIn recent months, money market rates have moved up toward and sometimes above IORB. After averaging 8 to 9 basis points below IORB in the first eight months of 2025, the tri-party general collateral rate (TGCR) averaged slightly above interest on reserves in September and October. TGCR is a rate on overnight repos collateralized by Treasury securities. It’s a safe rate in a liquid and competitive market, and I view it as the cleanest single measure of money market conditions. TGCR is now running at or above where I’d like to see relative to IORB for a long-run environment of ample reserves. That makes it appropriate to end asset runoff, as the FOMC decided to do.\n\nIt is not certain where money market spreads will go from here and how the supply of reserves will need to evolve. Temporary factors including tax payments, Treasury issuance and banks’ quarter-end and month-end balance sheet adjustments have contributed to the upward pressure on repo rates in recent months. If those pressures recede, rates could come down relative to IORB. Banks may also continue to adapt to the new configuration of rates. There might then be room for modest further decreases in reserve supply. Once runoff ends, the Fed can further reduce reserve supply by holding assets constant for a time and allowing decreases in reserves to offset trend growth in other liabilities such as currency. But if the recent rise in repo rates turns out not to be temporary, the Fed in my view would need to begin buying assets to keep reserves from falling further and maintain an ample supply of reserves.\n\nThe size and timing of these reserve management purchases should not be mechanical, in my view. While purchases will need to offset relatively predictable trend growth in currency, reserve demand will likely also change over time in response to economic growth, changes in the banking and payments businesses, and adjustments in regulations. Reserve supply will need to roughly track those developments to remain efficient. I currently view the average spread of TGCR to IORB as the central, though certainly not only, indicator of how reserve supply needs to evolve.\n\nThe FOMC’s operating target\nYou may have noticed that I focused on a repo rate, TGCR, and not the fed funds rate, even though the FOMC targets the fed funds rate in setting monetary policy. That was intentional. In my view, the fed funds operating target is outdated. The fed funds rate measures rates on unsecured, overnight loans between banks and other entities, such as FHLBs, that hold reserves. This rate made sense as an operating target given the way money markets worked in the 1990s, when the FOMC began publicly targeting fed funds. However, the world has changed since then in two crucial ways.\n\nOne change is the move to supplying ample, interest-bearing reserves. Because reserves now earn a competitive interest rate, banks are less motivated to lend out extra reserves at the end of the day to peers whose reserves have fallen short.\n\nSome say the Fed should reduce reserves to the point of scarcity to revive interbank trading. But ample reserves don’t cost anything, and they make the banking system safer and more efficient, as I discussed earlier. Creating artificial scarcity just to force banks to manage it would be wasteful. Although it would be competition of sorts, it wouldn’t be the kind of competition that matters for a vibrant economy. Banks should compete to best serve their customers, not to scrounge for liquidity that the Fed can easily provide.\n\nIn addition, while banks should be prepared to source contingent liquidity when needed, they don’t need to trade every day in the fed funds market to maintain that readiness. I’ve compared this before to building codes and fire drills. Modern building codes prevent many fires. People these days get much less practice escaping burning buildings. But no one suggests returning to old-fashioned, dangerous construction methods so buildings would burn down more often, and firefighters could get more experience. Fire drills work fine! In the same way, ample reserves reduce liquidity risk, and banks can employ drills and other readiness exercises to ensure they’re prepared to address the risk that remains.\n\nThe Global Financial Crisis (GFC) demonstrated the risks to firms on both sides of an unsecured, short-term interbank loan. The lender is at risk because if the borrower defaults, there’s no collateral to fall back on. The borrower is at risk because if lenders become worried, funding can dry up suddenly. The other key change since the 1990s is that post-GFC capital and liquidity regulations recognize these risks and create disincentives for unsecured, short-term interbank lending.\n\nPut it together, and fed funds is no longer a vibrant interbank market that measures the marginal cost of money for a wide range of institutions. Today, the fed funds market is dominated by an arbitrage trade. FHLBs, which don’t receive interest on reserves, lend to foreign banks, which receive interest on reserves but don’t pay for deposit insurance. This concentrated base of lenders and borrowers makes the fed funds market idiosyncratic and fragile. From July 2023 through mid-September of this year, the spread of the fed funds rate to IORB didn’t change by a single basis point even as money market conditions fluctuated meaningfully and other money market rates moved in response. More recently, the fed funds rate has come up only gradually despite large daily swings in repo rates. Fed funds appears to act more like a lagging average of past money market pressures than a timely indicator. In addition, any change in the FHLBs’ incentives or funding demand can cause fed funds volume to drop sharply, as occurred when FHLBs needed to meet higher advance demand during the March 2023 banking stresses.\n\nIf the connection between fed funds and broader money markets ever broke, the FOMC would need to adopt a different target. I don’t think making important changes under time pressure is the best way to promote a strong economy and financial system. As I described in a recent in-depth essay with a colleague, I believe the time has come for the FOMC to modernize the target rate. Proactively changing to a more robust target, such as TGCR, would allow time for a smooth transition so the private sector could adjust.\n\nLet me emphasize that modernizing the target rate would not change the FOMC’s monetary policy strategy. The operating target specifies how the FOMC measures and influences monetary conditions. It’s entirely separate from the question of how restrictive or accommodative those conditions should be to achieve the FOMC’s goals.\n\nTargeting TGCR would not require a larger Fed balance sheet or larger, more frequent or more complex operations than targeting the fed funds rate. For many years, the FOMC has set a target range for the fed funds rate that is 25 basis points wide. The Fed’s existing tools are generally effective at keeping TGCR within that target range. However, as I noted, dealers may need to increase their readiness to draw on the SRF in an environment where it is in the money more often, and the Fed should also continue to enhance the facility’s usability. In my view, the FOMC does not need pinpoint control of the operating target. Still, targeting a repo rate would require more tolerance for volatility within the target range than we have historically seen in the fed funds rate.\n\nThere are important trade-offs between potential replacements for the fed funds rate. Besides TGCR, market participants often mention the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as a candidate. SOFR is a widely adopted reference rate with well-developed derivatives markets, and it includes centrally cleared trades that seem likely to grow in volume in light of the SEC mandate. However, TGCR is a cleaner measure of monetary conditions because it’s not affected by the spread dealers require to intermediate between repo market segments. Although the TGCR market is smaller than the SOFR market, TGCR still incorporates more than $1 trillion in daily transactions among a wide range of counterparties.\n\nTo reiterate, these are only my views. But I believe the FOMC should modernize the target rate.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks."

    "text": "Dallas Fed President Lorie K. Logan delivered these remarks at the Bank of England Agenda for Research Conference in London.\nThank you, Vicky [Saporta], for the kind introduction. And thank you to the Bank of England for inviting me to participate in this important conference.\n\nThe experience of the past two decades profoundly changed how central banks think about both sides of our balance sheets. On the asset side, central banks learned to use asset purchases to provide economic stimulus at the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates, as well as to support smooth market functioning when stresses threatened financial stability. On the opposite side of the ledger, asset purchases drove large increases in central bank liabilities, specifically bank reserves, making liquidity abundant or ample rather than scarce in most financial systems.\n\nExperience has shown that ample liquidity provides ample benefits for financial stability, payments and monetary policy implementation. Central banks are now pursuing strategies to maintain those benefits even as the runoff of pandemic-era assets reduces the size of their balance sheets.\n\nAt times, the diversity of names and tools for these strategies can make it seem as if central banks disagree on the fundamentals of how to proceed. People talk about demand-driven and supply-driven floors, ample and abundant reserves, zero corridors and wider corridors and more. But underneath this cacophony of details, I believe central banks are applying shared and well-founded principles for how their balance sheets should work. The surface differences, to my mind, reflect central banks’ natural adaptation to unique characteristics of the financial systems in which they operate.\n\nIn the rest of my remarks, I’ll lay out the shared principles as I see them and highlight their implications for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. I’ll focus primarily on liabilities before turning to assets at the end. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my Fed colleagues.\n\nTwo principles\nI propose that in employing our balance sheets to accomplish our missions, central banks should adhere to two fundamental principles. We should be efficient. And we should be effective.\n\nYou may recall hearing those ideas from the Fed before. Back in 2014, long before adopting our current implementation framework, the FOMC said it aimed to “hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.”[1] We’ve repeated that idea in subsequent statements.[2] Today, I’ll examine efficiency and effectiveness as broad principles for central banks, beyond the context of any one Fed policy decision.\n\nTo some, the principles I’ve offered may sound so obvious as to mean nothing. Who could want a central bank to be inefficient or ineffective? But I’ll argue that these principles have a great deal of meaning. They provide substantial guidance about the design of central bank balance sheets, and they create a clear framework for understanding central banks’ choices. I’ll consider each principle in turn.\n\nEfficiency\nBy efficiency, I mean allocative or Pareto efficiency. The central bank should design its balance sheet in such a way that no adjustment could make someone better off (in the economy the central bank serves) without simultaneously making someone else worse off (again, in the economy the central bank serves).\n\nAllocative efficiency requires setting the price of resources equal to their social marginal cost. Let’s apply that idea to central bank liabilities, specifically, reserves. From the perspective of a commercial bank considering how many reserves to hold, the price of reserves is the spread between money market interest rates and whatever rate the central bank pays on reserves. That is, when money market rates exceed interest on reserves, the commercial bank pays an opportunity cost in foregone interest to hold reserves.\n\nThe central bank’s marginal cost of supplying reserves is typically small. Reserves are an electronic entry on the central bank’s books. No paper currency needs to be produced.\n\nSo, as I have argued previously, efficiency calls for money market rates to land close to the interest rate on reserves.[3] If money market rates exceed interest on reserves, banks experience inefficient pressure to economize on reserves, the most liquid asset in the financial system. That increases financial stability risks and can gum up the flow of payments. The opposite problem occurs when interest on reserves exceeds market rates. Typically, only a limited set of financial institutions, such as banks, can hold reserves. Other financial institutions must hold their liquidity in other instruments, such as repurchase agreements (repos) or short-dated government securities. When these instruments pay less interest than reserves, the cost of liquidity is inefficiently higher for non-banks.\n\nElsewhere, I’ve described the idea of keeping money market rates near interest on reserves as a Friedman rule for interest-bearing reserves.[4] There’s more than one way to achieve this configuration of rates. A central bank can estimate the quantity of reserves that would meet banks’ demand with market rates near interest on reserves, then acquire sufficient assets to supply that quantity. Or, like the Bank of England, a central bank can offer to lend reserves at the same interest rate it pays on its deposit facility—letting banks take down however many reserves they demand. Likewise, if an excessive supply of reserves pushes money market rates below interest on reserves, a central bank can drain liquidity and bring rates back up by reducing its asset holdings. Or, as with the Fed’s Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement Facility, a central bank can offer to absorb liquidity from market participants ineligible for interest on reserves.\n\nThe optimal choices among these tactics may depend on the specifics of a central bank’s environment, such as its counterparties, how liquidity flows between those counterparties and other firms, the counterparties’ willingness to borrow from central bank facilities, the central bank’s institutional authorities, and the exogenous influences on reserve supply and demand.\n\nBut, again, those choices are tactical. The strategic decision is where to position interest on reserves relative to money market rates. And when I look across major central banks, it seems to me our approaches are fundamentally similar. We all aim to keep money market rates close to interest on reserves, which is the efficient arrangement.\n\nYou may have noticed that I said efficiency calls for money market rates to settle close to interest on reserves, not necessarily equal to interest on reserves. Technical factors can appropriately create small spreads between different money market instruments. For example, the repo market in the U.S. has several segments.[5] Small rate spreads between segments can reflect participants’ market power or transactions’ non-price terms. No amount of reserve supply can compress these spreads to zero, nor could the interest rate on reserves match all the different repo rates at once.\n\nSimilarly, even in an efficient configuration, temporary frictions such as those often seen on statement dates could cause short-lived rate movements. Such fluctuations aren’t necessarily inefficient. Suppressing them could require supplying so many reserves as to push money market rates materially below interest on reserves the rest of the year.\n\nThe cost of supplying reserves also may not be exactly zero. Yesterday’s keynote speaker, Annette Vissing-Jorgensen, has pointed out that if a central bank backs its liabilities with assets that carry a scarcity premium, removing those assets from circulation is costly.[6] I’d note, though, and I’ll return to this later, that the cost depends on whether the supply of such assets can grow.\n\nSome observers have objected to keeping money market rates close to interest on reserves, saying this suppresses trading in the interbank money market. In the face of unexpected payment shocks, an active interbank market helps the private sector redistribute funds across banks. By comparison, without an interbank market, the central bank may intermediate more of that redistribution through its deposit and lending facilities. Policy preferences can differ about the desirability of trading off a smaller central bank footprint against the spread of market rates over interest on reserves, and the resulting inefficiency, that would be needed to incentivize active interbank trading.\n\nWhile that’s an interesting philosophical discussion, I don’t see much of a practical argument for the U.S., at least. When the U.S. banking system has excess reserves, they tend to accumulate at the largest money-center banks. The regulations applicable to such banks disincentivize unsecured lending to other banks. As a result, only very large spreads between money market rates and interest on reserves would likely suffice to revive the U.S. interbank market—and that would be very inefficient.[7]\n\nNor would an active interbank market improve banks’ resilience to liquidity stress. Making liquidity artificially scarce and then giving banks lots of practice managing that scarcity is riskier and less efficient than avoiding scarcity in the first place. And there are plenty of other ways that banks can maintain operational readiness to exercise their liquidity tools.\n\nEffectiveness\nI’ll now turn to my second principle, effectiveness. A central bank’s tools must reliably transmit the stance of policy to money market rates and the economy. Researchers have debated how exactly to define effectiveness.[8] Is it about the dispersion of rates within or across money markets? Volatility over time? Robustness under stress? Transmission to broader markets? The answer to that technical question may differ across financial systems. For purposes of principles, it suffices to say that effective implementation keeps money market rates close to the policy target.\n\nA central bank can influence market rates through its balance sheet in two main ways. One approach supplies a limited quantity of reserves, so that reserves carry a liquidity premium and market rates significantly exceed interest on reserves. The banking system then typically lands on a steep portion of the aggregate demand curve for reserves. The central bank achieves its policy target by increasing or decreasing reserve supply to intersect the appropriate point on the demand curve. In the alternative approach, the central bank makes the supply of reserves ample enough to eliminate the liquidity premium—the efficient configuration I described with my first principle. The banking system then typically lands on a relatively flat portion of the aggregate demand curve for reserves. Small changes in reserves supply don’t substantially move money market rates in that environment. Instead, the central bank moves money market rates primarily by adjusting the interest rate on liabilities such as reserves.\n\nBefore the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), scarce-reserves systems provided effective rate control for the Fed and many other central banks. And systems with ample reserves have proven effective in controlling rates more recently.\n\nWhile it remains conceptually possible to implement monetary policy today with scarce reserves, developments since the GFC would complicate the task of fine-tuning reserve supply to hit a point on the steep portion of the demand curve. Changes in regulations and banks’ own risk management have made reserve demand larger, more volatile and more difficult to predict. In the U.S., fiscal flows also create more reserve volatility than previously.\n\nThe ample-reserves regime simplifies rate control because fluctuations in reserve supply and demand don’t require frequent and precise offsetting central bank actions. You might say this makes the ample-reserves regime efficient for a second reason. Not only does it avoid the inefficiencies associated with a liquidity premium on reserves, but it also saves some forecasting and operational effort. The ample regime requires gradual forecasting and operations to approximately track demand for central bank liabilities over periods of months and years. The scarce-reserves regime requires the much heavier lift of actively managing reserve supply on a daily basis to precisely match demand.\n\nAmple-reserves regimes are sometimes called “floor systems,” because when reserve supply is large enough, the main influence on market rates is the floor established under them by interest on reserves.\n\nBut the “floor system” name can give a misleading impression of how these regimes work. Even in a floor system, central bank lending tools — which put a ceiling on interest rates—retain an important role in policy implementation.\n\nCentral banks’ estimates of the quantity of reserves needed to remain at the floor, though careful, are less than perfectly precise. As a result, unexpected shortfalls of reserves can sometimes generate upward pressure on money market rates. Such events arise much less frequently with ample reserves than scarce reserves—that’s what makes the ample-reserves approach more effective—but the incidence isn’t zero. So even in an ample-reserves regime, reliable ceiling tools remain indispensable, at minimum as a backstop against mistaken estimates, and potentially as a routine source of reserve supply. Indeed, many central banks plan to routinely employ one or more ceiling tools in their long-run implementation frameworks. While these tools’ designs vary in response to local needs, the common principle is that they make policy implementation more effective.\n\nThe Fed’s ceiling tools include the discount window, the Standing Repo Facility (SRF), and the Foreign and International Monetary Authorities Repo Facility, as well as the Open Market Trading Desk’s capacity to conduct discretionary repo operations.\n\nAlthough these tools are time tested and have often worked well, I believe we could further enhance their efficacy.\n\nThe discount window is flexible and robust, capable of lending to banks against a very broad range of collateral throughout the day. For this reason, I believe every bank in the United States should make sure it is operationally ready to access the window. Banks have increased their operational readiness since the 2023 stresses, but readiness should be a continuing effort, not a one-time project. And it needs to be a partnership between borrowers and lenders. At the Federal Reserve Banks, we are considering how we can most efficiently serve our customers when they come to borrow. The Board of Governors recently completed a Request for Information on discount window operations.[9] I’m optimistic that feedback will help us support enhanced readiness, particularly by considering more automation, extended hours of operation, faster communications with depository institutions and interoperability with other secured lending sources.\n\nTurning to the SRF and other open market operations that provide liquidity, the Fed’s tools will function most effectively if they innovate alongside the markets in which we participate. The Desk experimented with morning SRF operations over year end and has announced an upcoming small-value test of capabilities for morning settlements.[10] And as the U.S. repo market continues to shift toward central clearing, I believe the FOMC should consider the merits of centrally clearing the SRF as well as other open market operations. Centrally clearing the Fed’s trades would support the Securities and Exchange Commission clearing mandate for the private sector. It would also decrease our counterparties’ cost of intermediating funding to the broader market.\n\nTrade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness\nI’ve argued that, at a high level, supplying ample reserves and positioning money market rates close to interest on reserves is both efficient and effective. Still, when it comes to the details of implementing such a regime, central banks can face modest trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nThese trade-offs could fill an entire speech, or a book. Today, I’d like to discuss just one of them, the precise positioning of money market rates relative to interest on reserves.\n\nIn the U.S., the volatility of money market rates picks up noticeably as market rates move above interest on reserves.[11] The increase in volatility appears to stem largely from frictions in redistributing liquidity among financial institutions. In this environment, operating with money market rates close to, but perhaps slightly below, interest on reserves is likely to provide more effective rate control. In my view, for the U.S. financial system, bringing market rates all the way up to interest on reserves could reduce effectiveness while delivering only a minimal improvement in efficiency.[12]\n\nSome other central banks are planning for money market rates to converge slightly above interest on reserves. Those central banks operate in different institutional environments and face different frictions, which can change the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness and may support a different configuration of rates than in the U.S.\n\nAssets\nSo far, I have emphasized the central bank’s liabilities. Efficiency and effectiveness also apply to the assets backing those liabilities.\n\nCentral banks vary greatly in the assets they can hold and their relationships to fiscal authorities. Hence, asset choices could differ more than choices about liabilities. I’ll focus my discussion on the U.S. case, but the principles I’ll apply have broad relevance.\n\nThe FOMC has said it intends to hold primarily Treasury securities in the long run.[13] This approach leaves open two questions: Are some Treasury securities more efficient or effective to hold than others? And, against the backdrop of a primarily Treasury portfolio, might efficiency or effectiveness call for holding modest amounts of other assets?\n\nWe can think about the composition of Treasury holdings from the perspective of the Fed’s balance sheet alone or from the perspective of the consolidated government balance sheet.\n\nConsidering only the Fed’s balance sheet, efficiency considerations counsel against holding Treasury securities that are in particularly scarce supply. For example, the Fed has usually limited its holdings of any one security and avoided buying in-demand securities such as those that are newly issued or cheapest to deliver into futures contracts. If long-term Treasury securities have a special liquidity premium, efficiency could also suggest steering away from holding them—but, as I will discuss in a moment, the consolidated government perspective undoes this conclusion.\n\nEffectiveness, meanwhile, suggests the Fed should structure asset holdings so they normally remain in the background and do not distract from our primary monetary policy tool, the overnight rate target. While fluctuations in net income do not affect the Fed’s ability to conduct monetary policy, they can become a communications challenge. Roughly matching the duration of our assets and liabilities would reduce these fluctuations and could, thus, enhance the effectiveness of policy communications. The Fed’s liabilities consist primarily of currency, which pays zero interest and has very long duration, and reserves, which pay a floating rate and have zero duration. Asset-liability matching thus suggests holding a mix of short-term and long-term securities. A portfolio that’s neutral relative to the outstanding Treasury universe would be one way to approximate this.\n\nSome observers argue that tilting the portfolio toward shorter-duration assets would provide flexibility that could enhance effectiveness. Short-dated assets can run off to rapidly reduce reserve supply. Or the central bank can trade them for longer-dated assets to absorb duration and influence term premiums without expanding reserve supply. These forms of flexibility were valuable in the pre-GFC scarce-reserves implementation regime, in which we needed to maintain precise control of reserve supply. And, indeed, we tilted the Fed’s portfolio toward Treasury bills in that regime. But the ample-reserves regime reduces the need for precise control of reserve supply. Our balance sheet has also grown, so even a neutral portfolio would now contain a substantial dollar quantity of Treasury bills. In the current regime, then, I don’t think tilting the steady-state portfolio toward short-dated assets would materially enhance effectiveness.\n\nImportantly, Treasury securities the Fed holds as assets are liabilities for the Treasury Department. They cancel out on the consolidated government balance sheet. As a result, the consolidated perspective can shed a different light on what’s efficient and effective. Let me give a simple example. Suppose securities of a certain duration have a particular liquidity value in the market. You might think it’s inefficient for the Fed to hold such securities, since the market values them highly. However, the Treasury could conceivably issue more such securities to meet the market’s demand. So, from a consolidated perspective, the Fed’s actions aren’t the sole determinant of efficiency.\n\nIn the U.S., the Fed sets monetary policy while Congress and the Treasury determine the fiscal costs taxpayers support. One of those fiscal costs comes from the duration risk associated with potential interest rate fluctuations on government debt. The Treasury determines the maturity structure of the consolidated government debt and the associated duration risk. When certain securities have a particular liquidity value, for example, Treasury decides whether to supply more of them, taking account of how this action would affect taxpayers’ exposure to duration risk.\n\nIf Treasury can offset what the Fed holds, does the consolidated perspective imply anything at all for the Fed’s asset choices? I think it does. In practice, Treasury keeps its issuance regular and predictable to foster an attractive market for investors. Given this approach, I believe the most appropriate strategy for the Fed is to likewise be predictable by purchasing a neutral mix of durations relative to whatever mix Treasury chooses to issue. Then there is nothing for Treasury to offset. The Fed-only perspective also suggested a neutral portfolio. My bottom line, then, is that from both angles, in the U.S., a neutral portfolio would be efficient and effective.\n\nAt present, the Fed’s portfolio is significantly overweight longer-term securities and underweight Treasury bills. Our reinvestments of maturing securities represent a small fraction of the portfolio. And when we eventually reach an efficient level of reserves and need to begin expanding the portfolio in line with growth in demand for our liabilities, those purchases will also be small relative to existing holdings. In this context, it could take many years to reach a neutral mix of holdings by structuring our purchases to be proportional to issuance. So although I view a neutral mix of purchases relative to issuance as appropriate in the long run, it would make sense in the medium term to overweight purchases of shorter-dated securities so as to more promptly return the Fed’s holdings to a neutral allocation.\n\nFinally, while securities represent nearly all the Fed’s assets, we’ve always held small quantities of other assets, such as discount window loans and repos. Loans also feature prominently among the assets of other central banks.\n\nIn the long term, in my view, it could be interesting to consider whether allocating a modest share of the Fed’s long-run balance sheet to loans or repos could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of policy implementation. For example, auctioning a fixed quantity of discount window loans each day could encourage banks’ operational readiness and demonstrate that borrowing is a normal activity for healthy firms.[14]\n\nSuch a facility might also smooth the redistribution of reserves around the banking system. The U.S. has about 9,000 banks and credit unions. Unexpected payment shocks can leave some of them short of reserves at the same time as others have a surplus. Frictions in interbank lending may slow the movement of reserves to whichever banks need them most. But if the Fed held a daily lending auction, the depository institutions most in need of reserves on any given day would likely place the highest bids, automatically redistributing liquidity away from firms with less need.\n\nLet me just strongly emphasize that the FOMC is not considering any changes to its implementation framework, and even beginning to consider such a tool would require substantial conversation, analysis and learning from the experience of other central banks.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, central banks naturally design their balance sheets and policy implementation frameworks to reflect institutional features of the jurisdictions in which they operate. The resulting frameworks vary on the surface, but there are commonalities in the underlying policy principles. I’ve argued today that central bank balance sheets should be efficient and effective. Those twin principles imply keeping money market rates close to the interest rate on reserves, supplying ample reserves and maintaining strong ceiling or lending tools. I find it heartening that central banks around the world have converged on these fundamental approaches, and I hope we will continue to learn from one another, as we have done the past two days.\n\nThank you.\n\nNotes\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee, “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans,” Sept. 16, 2014.\nFederal Open Market Committee, “Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet,” Jan. 26, 2022; Federal Open Market Committee, “Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet,” May 4, 2022.\nLorie K.

The secured overnight financing rate, while an important reference rate, includes some transactions whose rates reflect compensation for intermediating funds from the triparty segment of the repo market to cash borrowers who lack triparty access.

    "text": "Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan delivered this address at The University of Texas at Austin McCombs School of Business as part of her 360° in 365 Listening Tour of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District.\nThank you, Dean [Lillian] Mills, for the kind introduction and the warm welcome to the University of Texas.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been tightening monetary policy for the past year to bring inflation back to our 2 percent target. One of the questions I’m asked most often is: How much more will we do? More specifically, how high will we raise interest rates? Or, as my family used to ask on our road trips back home to Kentucky: Are we there yet?\n\nThose of you who have taken family road trips know that, sometimes, the best way to handle this question is not to answer it.\n\nThe same is true today in monetary policy. Just as I was committed to completing those long drives, the FOMC is committed to reaching our goal of restoring price stability. But considering the uncertainties we face, I don’t find it particularly helpful at this time to lock in on a peak rate or the precise path rates will follow. Rather, we need to keep our eyes on the economic and financial outlook and lay out a strategy that is both flexible and robust so we are best positioned to achieve our goals however the outlook evolves.\n\nI’ll start today’s journey by discussing inflation: where we are today and the outlook from here. I’ll then turn to the outlook for the second, equally important, component of the FOMC’s monetary policy mandate: maximum employment. Finally, I’ll discuss financial conditions and what I see as a flexible and robust monetary policy response. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\nInflation\nInflation over the past two years has been much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, but inflation has averaged 5.8 percent at an annual rate since January 2021.\n\nThis high rate of inflation weakens our economy. People’s incomes fall short of the cost of rent and groceries, and new research at the Dallas Fed finds that the rising cost of living is particularly stressful for lower-income households. Businesses can’t plan well when they don’t know what they’ll pay for materials or be able to charge their customers. And the longer high inflation continues, the greater the risk that prices and wages rise just because people think inflation will remain high—a spiral that would significantly increase the cost of bringing inflation down. In sum, price stability is foundational for a healthy economy and labor market over time.\n\nIn my view, the run-up in inflation has had two sources. Special circumstances, now mostly in the rearview mirror, pushed up prices in particular sectors, like energy, manufactured goods and housing. But inflation then spread to a broad set of services, and this broader inflation is what shapes the outlook today.\n\nThe pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have made energy prices remarkably volatile. In March and April 2020, as global economic activity slowed, the price of oil fell from $60 per barrel to around $20. Then, as the economy recovered while fossil fuel production remained low, the price steadily climbed through mid-2022. Last year, Russia’s war caused additional volatility around this trend. Natural gas prices have fluctuated even more, and in Texas, we’ve also seen enormous spikes in the wholesale price of electricity during some winter storms.\n\nEnergy prices are quite noticeable in our daily lives and quite important to the economy here in Texas, where oil and gas production makes up more than 11 percent of state GDP and half of state exports. But because energy inflation tends not to persist, the recent drop in energy prices doesn’t greatly change the inflation outlook.\n\nTurning to goods, responses to the pandemic disrupted global supply chains just as consumers shifted to consuming more goods and fewer services. The natural result was that prices of goods rose.\n\nStatistical measures suggest that supply-chain pressures peaked in December 2021 and have now recovered substantially, though not fully. Correspondingly, goods prices have started to fall. Continued recovery in supply chains should help hold down goods inflation going forward, although there are risks from China’s transition out of zero-COVID policies and the disruptions resulting from Europe’s energy crisis.\n\nIn the housing market, people fortunate enough to be able to work remotely during the pandemic often wanted bigger homes. They also considered locations far from their offices—in some cases, across the country. And mortgage rates fell to historically low levels in 2020 and 2021. All of this drove up demand for housing.\n\nBut homes can be built only so fast, so in the short run, prices soared. Austin was perhaps the national epicenter of this effect, fueled by domestic migration and the boom in technology jobs. House prices rose 58 percent here, outstripping all other major Texas metros and straining affordability for working-class and middle-class families.\n\nHousing prices nationally and in Austin are now cooling as mortgage rates have risen. However, our research at the Dallas Fed finds that changes in house prices take around 18 months to feed into measures of housing inflation, which are based on average rents. The main reason for the lag is that rents adjust infrequently as leases turn over. Our research suggests it could be mid-2023 or later before year-over-year housing inflation begins to fall. Still, I’m confident relief will come.\n\nWhat’s more concerning is the way inflation has spread to the broader economy. About half of personal consumption consists of what are called core services excluding housing. This category includes everything from health care to transportation to entertainment to dining out. Early in the pandemic, prices of nonhousing services were soft as many consumers stayed home. But as the economy reopened, inflation began to broaden. Core services inflation excluding housing has now been running in a range of 4–5 percent for close to two years, and while headline inflation has softened notably in the last few months, this category has stayed high.\n\nBroad-based and persistent services inflation surprised many forecasters who thought inflation would come down when shocks like supply-chain disruptions had dissipated. Moreover, it’s hard to point to special circumstances that suggest services inflation will go away on its own. Rather, I see elevated services inflation as a symptom of an overheated economy, particularly a tight labor market, which will have to be brought into better balance for the overall inflation rate to return sustainably to 2 percent.\n\nEmployment\nThe labor market is important in its own right for monetary policy, given the FOMC’s mandate to achieve both price stability and maximum employment. But in addition, because the tight labor market appears to be driving the broad-based services inflation we are seeing today, the outlook for inflation hinges in large part on how much and how rapidly the labor market eases.\n\nServices prices depend substantially on labor costs, and wages have been growing at about a 5 percent annual rate by a variety of measures. For that kind of wage growth to be consistent with 2 percent inflation over the long run, productivity would have to rise at a 3 percent annual rate. Yet output per hour worked grew at an annual rate of only 1 and a quarter percent from 2012 through 2019, and there is little indication it has accelerated since then. So, absent a dramatic rise in productivity, it seems likely that returning inflation to 2 percent will require wage growth to slow substantially. That may take time. Respondents to the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys expect more than 5 percent wage growth in 2023, which is down significantly from what they saw in 2022, but still quite elevated.\n\nOther statistics also point to an unsustainably tight labor market. As of November, there were 1.7 job openings for every unemployed person in the United States. This is down from a peak of two openings per unemployed person last March but still well above the ratio of 1.2 openings per unemployed person in 2019—which was thought at the time to be a very strong labor market. Payrolls have been growing by more than 200,000 workers per month. And even without looking at the statistics, you can see how tight the labor market is when your favorite restaurant or store cuts its hours because it doesn’t have enough workers.\n\nBut some other information is starting to point to a slower labor market. While job growth has remained robust in the payroll survey of employers, numbers based on a household survey are significantly lower since last spring. And a much-larger dataset called the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) shows a sharp slowing in employment growth in the second quarter of last year. In fact, when benchmarking Texas jobs data to the QCEW, which the Dallas Fed does regularly, the revisions reduced Texas job growth from 4.7 percent to 3.4 percent, annualized, for the first 10 months of 2022. Some business contacts also tell me their hiring plans are slowing. In addition, wage pressures moderated in the latest national report on average hourly earnings. I’d need to see a lot more data, though, to be convinced the labor market is no longer overheated.\n\nTo achieve better balance, labor supply will have to increase, or labor demand will have to decrease.\n\nLabor supply has been weak coming out of the pandemic. The labor force is several million people below what we would have expected by now based on prepandemic trends. You might be surprised that rapidly rising wages haven’t encouraged more people to look for work, but because wages haven’t risen as fast as inflation for most workers, the incentive to work isn’t necessarily that strong. Labor supply is also held back by a substantial number of early retirements, as well as deaths and lingering illness from the pandemic and structural challenges like the lack of child care for working parents and a decrease in immigration. Beyond that, employers tell me that when workers are available, they often lack the necessary training or skills.\n\nWhile all these constraints are at play in Texas, the state has been a bit of an outlier. The labor force here is 5 percent above its prepandemic level, thanks to accelerating migration from other states.\n\nAddressing the structural challenges is critical for the Texas and U.S. economies in the long run. Developing a larger, higher-skilled workforce will help ensure we have a strong economy for everyone. At the Dallas Fed, we’re committed to partnering with communities in our region and using our research to help advance solutions. But that work takes time. So when it comes to the current elevated inflation, the FOMC has to respond by tightening monetary policy to reduce demand.\n\nInterest rates\nWhat do I mean by tightening monetary policy? The FOMC’s primary tool is the target range for the federal funds rate, an overnight interest rate. Since the start of 2022, we have raised this target by 4.25 percentage points, the largest one-year increase in four decades. In addition, since June 2022, we have been reducing our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nBoth of these tools push up interest rates for consumers and companies throughout the economy. Financial conditions have, therefore, tightened significantly. The 10-year nominal Treasury yield is up nearly 2 percentage points, and mortgage rates are up nearly 3 percentage points, since the start of 2022. Importantly, since the September FOMC meeting, real medium-term interest rates as measured by the yields on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities have averaged above 1.5 percent. That is a significantly restrictive level given that most estimates suggest the neutral real interest rate is below 1 percent.\n\nIn moving forward, we need to manage two risks. And in both cases, the risk is not just that of getting a slightly different outcome than we’d prefer, because the financial system and economy sometimes shift in abrupt and nonlinear ways. The most important risk I see is that if we tighten too little, the economy will remain overheated, and we will fail to keep inflation in check. That could trigger a self-fulfilling spiral of unanchored inflation expectations that would be very costly to stop. We must stay focused on bringing inflation back to target in a timely way. At the same time, if we tighten too much or too fast, the labor market could weaken much more than is necessary to control inflation. Those job losses would be very costly, too, particularly for the most vulnerable in society.\n\nThere is much we don’t know about how 2023 will unfold. There is uncertainty, first of all, about how much and how rapidly the economy will respond to tighter monetary policy—the famous “long and variable lags.” We also could get good news, like an unexpected increase in labor supply or gains in productivity that would allow inflation to fall without as much slowing of economic activity. Wage pressures could ease more rapidly than expected if the labor market proves not to be as overheated as many statistics suggest. Or, less happily, challenges like new geopolitical headwinds or rising inflation expectations could emerge. Financial conditions could ease or tighten for reasons unrelated to U.S. economic developments and monetary policy, and to maintain appropriate conditions to achieve our policy goals, it might be necessary to respond with a different policy path.\n\nIn this environment, I believe we need a strategy that is both flexible and robust.\n\nTo put ourselves in the best position to manage the risks, I believe we shouldn’t lock in on a peak interest rate. Rather, we need to continually and carefully assess what the incoming data imply about the economic outlook and adjust course accordingly.\n\nThat assessment will not be simple. I mentioned some of the mixed messages in the labor market data, and I expect that the data and qualitative reports will become even more mixed as the economy slows.\n\nNow, if you’re on a road trip and you encounter foggy weather or a dangerous highway, it’s a good idea to slow down. Likewise if you’re a policymaker in today’s complex economic and financial environment. That’s why I supported the FOMC’s decision last month to reduce the pace of rate increases. And the same considerations suggest slowing the pace further at the upcoming meeting.\n\nTo be clear, I don’t see the argument for a slower pace as depending very much on the latest data. Nor should a slower pace signal any less commitment to achieving our inflation goal, any more than slowing the car would suggest you don’t want to get back home to Kentucky.\n\nA slower pace is just a way to ensure we make the best possible decisions.\n\nWe can and, if necessary, should adjust our overall policy strategy to keep financial conditions restrictive even as the pace slows. For example, a slower pace could reduce near-term interest rate uncertainty, which would mechanically ease financial conditions. But if that happens, we can offset the effect by gradually raising rates to a higher level than previously expected.\n\nMy own view is that we will likely need to continue gradually raising the fed funds rate until we see convincing evidence that inflation is on track to return to our 2 percent target in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nThe evidence I’m looking for to gain confidence in the inflation outlook includes some further and sustained improvement in the inflation statistics, as well as a clear change in the underlying factors—like the imbalance of aggregate supply and demand and resulting very tight labor market—that have been producing high inflation. And I think we need to see the economy evolving more or less as forecasts predict. When inflation repeatedly comes in higher than the forecasts, as it did last year, it is hard to have confidence in any outlook.\n\nI will also be attentive to how financial conditions respond to the economic data and monetary policy. Ultimately, financial conditions need to be sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability. Even after we have enough evidence to pause rate increases, we’ll need to remain flexible and raise rates further if changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions call for it.\n\nThe Fed’s balance sheet\nWhile the fed funds rate target is our primary tool, the runoff of asset holdings is another important component of tighter policy. We expanded our balance sheet during the pandemic to support economic growth and the flow of credit to households and businesses. Now that the economy has recovered, it is important to allow these assets to mature to help restore price stability.\n\nUnlike with the fed funds rate, we are not adjusting asset runoff in response to the economic outlook. Rather, because our assets back our liabilities, like currency and bank reserves, the path of our assets will depend on the need for those liabilities. As our assets run off, our liabilities also fall. We can continue that process as long as we are providing enough currency and reserves for the payments, banking and financial systems to function smoothly.\n\nJust like with interest rates, you could ask how long that is. Here, too, I think the right answer is more about strategy than numbers. Bank reserves are currently far more than ample. And more than $2 trillion of excess liquidity is parked in our overnight reverse repo facility. If we saw some modest money market rate pressures in this environment, I would not interpret it as a sign that liquidity is scarce. It would simply be an incentive for banks to redistribute liquidity where it’s needed.\n\nThe process of redistribution from the overnight reverse repo facility to banks won’t necessarily be perfectly smooth. Banks can’t perfectly predict deposit outflows. But over time, if a bank sees reserves fall lower than it would prefer, it can attract more funding by increasing the rates it pays on deposits or wholesale borrowing. I think it is important to allow markets to work to redistribute liquidity in this way, so that the FOMC can reduce the balance sheet to an efficient size. In addition, the Fed’s Standing Repo Facility (SRF) provides a backstop against excessive interest rate pressures or shortfalls in reserves. I would be comfortable seeing some temporary usage of the SRF while balances in the overnight reverse repo facility remain high, as part of the process of redistributing liquidity.\n\nWith the SRF as a backstop and the power of market incentives to redistribute liquidity, I am confident that we have room to continue running off our assets for quite some time. Exactly how long that is will depend on a careful assessment of the financial environment. The financial system is constantly evolving. We can’t pinpoint the amount of liquidity that will be needed over time. We’ll need to watch the outlook and adjust our balance sheet strategy appropriately so that liquidity levels don’t fall too low.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the FOMC is committed to delivering a healthier economy, with maximum employment and stable prices. To achieve this, I expect we will need to continue increasing the fed funds rate. In my view, we shouldn’t lock in on a peak interest rate or precise path. Instead, I believe it’s appropriate to gradually raise rates, carefully assess financial conditions and the outlook, and remain flexible to adjust as needed, so we can robustly manage the risks we face.\n\nThank you. I’d be happy to answer some questions."

    "text": "Good morning and thank you all for joining us for the second day of our conference on technology-enabled disruption.\n\nThis conference series started in 2018 as a collaboration between the Atlanta, Dallas and Richmond Federal Reserve Banks. The vision for the conference series was to bring together business leaders, academics, educators and policymakers to explore the implications of technology-enabled disruption for business, labor markets and, ultimately, monetary policy from a variety of angles. This model has proven remarkably effective, and we are delighted to be able to do the event in person again this year.\n\nThe broad theme of the conference series is to consider how technological change—driven primarily by innovations in information technology—is playing a disruptive role in economic life. Past installments, as well as yesterday’s sessions, have focused mainly on how technological change is disrupting existing business models and the broader macroeconomy. We have also made a point of hearing from educators and others involved in workforce development to better understand how education and training infrastructure needs to evolve to meet the needs of the future.\n\nOne theme we explored in the first conferences was the disconnect between the seemingly rapid pace of technological change and the disappointing pace of measured productivity growth. That puzzle has yet to be resolved. Yesterday, we learned that the surge in productivity that we saw during the pandemic did not herald a new age of faster productivity growth but rather was just a temporary deviation. Another topic of conversation at the earlier conferences was the disruptive potential of online education. I think we all learned during the pandemic that although online education has a role to play, it remains a poor substitute for in-class instruction for many students.\n\nToday, we’ll get to look at disruption in an area that’s been a significant focus for me over many years—namely financial services.\n\nAcross a range of areas, technology is allowing the financial system to move faster, to serve new customers, but also to take on some new risks. During the pandemic, there was a big shift from cash to digital payments as more transactions were conducted online.[1] Trading in crypto assets has grown substantially and brought with it a range of new use cases as well as growing operational, crime and other risks. More central banks are experimenting with digital currencies.\n\nThese developments pose important challenges for public policy. Well-designed improvements in financial technology have the potential to reduce frictions and make the financial system work better for all. For example, modernized payments systems can allow people and firms to move money faster, more securely and at lower cost both within the country and across borders. These improvements can have benefits all across the spectrum of income and wealth. Better cross-border payments are obviously useful for multinational corporations and can equally help immigrants send remittances to their families.\n\nBut it’s crucial that technological improvements are, in fact, well-designed. The computer scientist Bruce Schneier published an insightful essay last week in the New York Times about the perverse incentives around security in new technologies.[2] He pointed out that a start-up must focus on growing rapidly by providing the features its potential customers want before funding runs out or a competitor captures the market. As a result, security takes a back seat, and before long, the company may be serving millions of customers but without the security needed to protect them from hacking, fraud or worse. Moreover, once the service is under heavy use, it’s difficult to rebuild it more securely, and there may be little commercial incentive to do so if the security flaws aren’t readily visible.\n\nSchneier’s essay was about technology start-ups in general, but I’d note that these incentive problems are particularly severe in financial services and payments where network externalities increase the pressure on new entrants to quickly gain market share. And while Schneier focused on security, I’d argue that these incentive problems apply just as much to operational resilience.\n\nOf course, innovation does not take place in a vacuum. Regulations establish the playing field on which innovators compete and the standards they must uphold. So there is a crucial role for public policy in creating an environment where technological innovation in finance and payments can thrive, but thrive responsibly.\n\nPresident Biden’s executive order on digital assets earlier this year emphasized the need for responsible innovation, and I was encouraged to see the Treasury Department’s recent release of three reports studying these issues, as well as the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s release of a report yesterday. The reports address the future of money and payments; the implications of digital assets for consumers, investors and businesses; illicit financing risks; financial stability risks and regulatory gaps. Across the reports, there is a recognition that opportunities exist for digital assets to improve the U.S. financial and payments system, but that these opportunities come with significant risks and challenges that public policy must address.\n\nI’d like to talk briefly about the considerations on money and payments in particular. There are three broad strands of innovation in payments globally.\n\nFirst, both the public and private sectors are developing faster payments systems. The Fed will launch our FedNow service between May and July of next year, providing broad access to instant payments and complementing private sector innovations.\n\nSecond, as I mentioned earlier, some central banks are experimenting with CBDCs [central bank digital currency]. In the U.S., no decision has been made on whether to create a CBDC, and the Federal Reserve has indicated that issuance of a CBDC would need clear support from the executive branch and Congress. Treasury’s recent report highlights that extensive further research is needed. Key design choices affect a CBDC’s efficiency as a means of payment; its accessibility to consumers, especially those who currently struggle to access the financial system; its influence on the United States’ role in global finance; and the risks it may pose to national security, such as through illicit transactions, or to financial stability, such as through the potential for destabilizing runs. Additionally, it is important to assess what benefits a CBDC could bring over and above the benefits of faster payments through FedNow.\n\nThird, amid the overall growth of digital assets, the private sector has invented an array of stablecoins. If these assets’ value is indeed safe and stable, they have the potential to serve as a form of private money—that is, a unit of account, store of value and medium of exchange. But safety and stability are not automatic, as the high-profile collapses of some algorithmic stablecoins have demonstrated. Even asset-backed stablecoins may fluctuate significantly in value if the assets backing them are not sufficiently safe or liquid, and the potential for these fluctuations can in turn lead to destabilizing runs and fire sales. Some jurisdictions are considering ways to bring stablecoins inside the regulatory perimeter as banks or other licensed entities, potentially creating the ability to back stablecoins with central bank reserves. But as I’ve discussed elsewhere, this could drive large and variable demand for central bank liabilities or could change the incentives created by the monetary policy implementation framework, and it is important to take a holistic approach to these decisions.[3]\n\nThis morning, we will explore how the fintech industry has adapted and grown in the wake of the pandemic. The shift to remote work, social distancing and online retailing in 2020 accelerated trends in payments that were already in place before the pandemic, as I noted earlier. These changes raise important policy questions. The cash economy is accessible to all, but digital payments are less so. What progress has been made to make digital payments as inclusive as cash, and what further steps need to be taken? Does the shift to digital payments have implications for access to consumer credit, especially among those communities that have not historically had a strong relationship with the traditional financial sector? How should we think about balancing the risks and benefits from digital innovation in payments and finance?\n\nFinally, let me thank our colleagues at the Richmond and Atlanta Feds for working with us on this conference series and the Atlanta Fed for hosting us this year. I look forward to our discussions this morning. Thank you all again for joining us."

    "text": "Thank you all for joining us today for the Eleventh District Banking Conference. I'm disappointed I can't be there in person with you, as I'm in Washington for a Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Nevertheless, I appreciate the opportunity to welcome you all to the Dallas Fed and to open today's conference. As always, the views I share are my own and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nOur banking supervision team collaborated with our partners at the Texas Department of Banking to develop this summit with three goals in mind.\n\nWe'll share information about services the Fed offers to banks.\nAs in all of our work, we want to promote open communication and dialog with you.\nAnd we will talk with you about some key emerging risks, a particular theme this year.\nAs you all know well, effectively managing risk is critical to success in banking, and it's particularly important because of the crucial position of banks in our economy.\n\nThe Eleventh District includes southern New Mexico, northern Louisiana and all of Texas. Our regional economy is one of the fastest growing in the nation. And integral to that growth is a large cohort of community and regional banks that help provide the resources businesses and families need to succeed, from lending to small businesses as they launch, to being among the first to support local communities after disasters such as this year's hurricane and wildfires. So it's essential for banks to effectively manage risk so they can continue providing these important services to their communities and the economy.\n\nI meet regularly with bankers one-on-one and in roundtables to hear what they're experiencing and how the Federal Reserve can continue to foster a strong banking system. The Dallas Fed also conducts the Banking Conditions Survey every six to seven weeks, in which we ask over 100 executives from banks and credit unions headquartered in our district to share their insights on credit and banking developments and the economy more broadly. I also meet regularly with bankers through our Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council. The council's 11 members represent institutions with less than $10 billion in assets from all parts of our district. The members share feedback on areas of focus, including regulations and exam activities. I bring these insights to my colleagues for our conversations about the Fed's approach to supervision and regulation.\n\nRisk management has been top-of-mind in those conversations with colleagues and bankers over the last couple of years, and I'm particularly focused on operational readiness to respond to any shocks that may occur. To maintain a dynamic banking system, we need all banks of all sizes to be resilient. In particular, well-managed banks have access to a diverse set of funding sources. And in my view, every bank in America should be fully set up at the discount window. This means completing legal documents, pledging collateral and practicing the steps needed to borrow well in advance, so the banks are prepared to use the window if needed. Banks need to be proactive about these preparations. An institution facing a rapid run won't have the luxury of waiting for setup or learning the procedures.\n\nWorking together with bankers, the Fed has made substantial progress toward enhanced operational readiness at the window. More than 5,000 depository institutions nationally have signed the necessary legal documents, pledging $3 trillion in collateral. This is up $1 trillion in collateral from a year earlier. And earlier this year, we launched Discount Window Direct, which is an online portal for depository institutions to use to request loans.\n\nIf you'd like to enhance your bank's preparations to borrow from the window, or just share feedback on how the window works, we'll have booths just outside the conference room where you can talk with our staff.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board recently issued a request for information on the operational practices of the discount window. You can submit comments directly through the Federal Reserve's website. We're accepting input through the beginning of December. If you have any questions on how to submit feedback, please reach out to someone from our team for more information.\n\nI'm optimistic that with further modernization of our technology and policies, as well as ongoing partnerships with banks, we can ensure the discount window remains a powerful tool for providing the banking system ample access to liquidity.\n\nIn closing, I hope today's conference provides an opportunity for open and candid conversations about how we can work together to mitigate risks and maintain a safe and sound financial system.\n\nThank you to the Dallas Fed's banking supervision team for your work planning for today's conference, in addition to our partners at the Texas Department of Banking. A special thank-you to Commissioner Charles Cooper for joining.\n\nAnd thank you all again for taking the time to be with us today to discuss these important issues."

    "text": "Remarks at the New York Fed and Columbia SIPA Monetary Policy Implementation Workshop, New York CityAs prepared for delivery\nGood afternoon. It is a pleasure to speak with you today at the New York Fed and Columbia SIPA workshop on monetary policy implementation. Many of you have attended these workshops in the past, and it is great to be together again to talk about issues of essential importance to policy implementation. It is also nice to see so many new participants, reflecting the broad interest and engagement in the topic of digital innovation.\n\nOver the past two days, we heard about faster forms of payments and new, digital forms of money—both private and public—and the effects they might have on money markets, policy implementation frameworks, and the international landscape.\n\nDigital innovation in money and payments is occurring for a reason—consumers, businesses, and financial market participants can benefit from around-the-clock, faster, and possibly programmable payments, both to reduce risk and to simplify financial transactions. Increased competition that results from new forms of money and payments could lower costs, increase service availability, and stimulate further innovation.\n\nHarnessing the benefits of innovation to consumers and businesses, while maintaining a safe and effective monetary system, may require new legislation, changes to regulations and to supervisory approaches, and modernization of traditional payment systems. The specifics of the appropriate initiatives will vary by country. These developments could have significant implications, including for financial stability, national security interests, and international cooperation.\n\nIn my role as manager of the Federal Reserve’s System Open Market Account, I am looking at these issues from the vantage point of monetary policy implementation. And in my remarks today, I will discuss some key issues that digital innovation in money and payments raises for policy implementation. In particular, I will examine how digital currencies might impact interest rate control and central bank balance sheets. In the spirit of this workshop, I won’t speak to the U.S. context specifically, but rather intend to discuss conceptual issues for policy implementation across jurisdictions. And, I won’t take a position on regulation, design choices, or a preference for a private or public solution.\n\nAs always, the views I express today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nPrivate and Public Innovation\n\nI would like to start by describing two types of monetary instruments that could, in the future, be significant for policy implementation. In the private sector, a broad range of digital assets are emerging. A subset of those digital assets, known as stablecoins, could over time be used by consumers and businesses as money, if they serve as a safe means of payment, a store of value, and a unit of account.2 Some jurisdictions are considering bringing these kinds of instruments into the regulatory framework by requiring their issuers to become banks or other licensed entities.3 This could enhance the ability to safely integrate them into the payments system. It could also expand access to central bank accounts and services to new entrants, allowing the stablecoins to be backed by the most liquid and stable of assets: central bank reserves.\n\nTraditional commercial banks are also forming consortiums and partnering with digital innovation firms to increase their offerings of liabilities associated with digital activities, which might entail offering deposits to stablecoin issuers or even direct issuance of stablecoins.\n\nMany are also investing in distributed ledger activities that could transform their businesses. Preliminary analysis of the May 2022 Senior Financial Officer Survey suggests that most U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs) expect growth and development in these areas to be a medium or high priority over the next couple of years, and banks continue to explore these areas to see how they fit into their business strategies.4\n\nCentral banks are also innovating. Many are implementing new forms of payments or experimenting with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to prepare for the future. Currently, over 60 jurisdictions have launched faster payment services.5 In addition, central banks are building expertise and investing in technology to examine the potential applicability of CBDCs.6\n\nMonetary Policy Implementation in An Evolving Monetary System\n\nAs we consider the potential impact of this array of innovations, it is useful to start with a view into the current monetary system.\n\nFor decades, central bank reserve balances have been the safest and most liquid asset, at the core of a smoothly operating financial system. Most economies operate with two-tier monetary systems, in which households and businesses hold and make payments with cash and private money such as bank deposits, while only banks can hold and make payments with central bank reserves. Regulation, supervision, and deposit insurance help keep commercial bank money safe. In turn, deposits fund growth in the economy through loans to households and businesses. And central banks provide liquidity backstops to ensure that the banking system can meet its liquidity obligations to the public.\n\nMost policy implementation frameworks around the world are designed based on this two-tiered system. In these frameworks, central banks control the aggregate supply of their liabilities and the rates at which these liabilities are remunerated, which in turn influences the market interest rates that are transmitted to the economy.7\n\nIn considering the impact on implementation frameworks of an environment including private and public digital currencies, I would like to raise two key questions that central banks might consider. First, what are the implications for the tools of interest rate control? And second, how might the central bank balance sheet adapt?\n\nWhat are the implications for the central bank’s tools of interest rate control?\nMost central banks adjust and communicate their monetary policy stance through an interest rate target, and successful implementation entails supplying central bank liabilities in a manner that promotes conditions in money markets consistent with this stance. Central banks often rely on three pillars to control interest rates: the rates of remuneration on liabilities; the amount of liquidity supplied; and the provision of liquidity backstops.\n\nCertain design choices for the adoption and integration of digital currencies could alter how central banks use these pillars to control short-term interest rates.\n\nPillar 1: Rates of remuneration\nMany advanced economy central banks currently operate in some type of a floor system, in which the administered rate or rates paid on certain central bank liabilities are a core component of interest rate control.8 The development of new digital forms of currency raises questions about how to fit new liabilities into these remuneration frameworks.\n\nIn the case of a CBDC, a central bank can directly determine the instrument’s design and the return that its holder receives. If a CBDC is designed as a substitute for cash, for example, with relatively low maximum holding limits and zero interest, it may have a relatively limited impact on monetary policy implementation.\n\nOn the other hand, a zero-interest CBDC that could be easily employed for large-scale payments may have greater impact. For example, in higher-interest-rate environments, the opportunity cost of holding a CBDC with these design features could be high, resulting in it being used only for modest transactional purposes. Conversely, in lower-interest-rate environments, a zero-interest CBDC without holding limits could compete more strongly with existing money market instruments, and demand for a zero-interest CBDC in lower-interest-rate environments could be hard to predict.\n\nA zero-interest CBDC could also interact with policy rate setting. For central banks that seek to maintain a zero lower bound on interest rates, a zero-interest CBDC could benefit monetary policy implementation, as a widely available zero-interest instrument could help reinforce the lower bound. For other central banks, a zero-interest CBDC could constrain their ability to achieve negative rates.\n\nThe alternative that central banks might consider is an interest-bearing CBDC, for which the natural question is: what rate of interest should be paid? If a central bank decided to remunerate a CBDC, the incentives created within the monetary policy implementation framework would need to be considered. As a broad principle, research suggests that a CBDC should be structured with rates of remuneration at or below rates on central bank reserve balances, as a higher rate could create direct competition for deposits, risking disintermediation of the banking system.9 How much lower would need to be considered in the context of a specific central bank’s policy implementation framework, its policy rate target, and the incentives that an interest-bearing CBDC could create in money markets. Some have suggested tiered remuneration for different holding amounts in order to influence incentives and ensure appropriate integration into the monetary system.10\n\nIn the case of stablecoins, central banks don’t directly control interest that might be paid on these instruments. However, incentives created by remuneration policies could have important influences on the structure and relative demand for private and public digital currencies. Depending on how the regulatory and policy environment for financial innovation evolves, stablecoins could be issued by banks or other regulated entities that could have access to interest-bearing accounts at central banks. In this case, the rate of remuneration stablecoin issuers earn on their accounts might influence the rate paid to stablecoin holders, and the role of the instruments in the broader monetary ecosystem.11\n\nOf course, implementation issues are not the only important consideration for remuneration of digital currencies, but it should be one consideration. Choices about the remuneration of new central bank liabilities, like CBDC, and of the accounts of private stablecoin issuers, could have an important influence on the incentives created by monetary policy implementation frameworks. Given this, central banks should take a holistic approach to considering the impact of their remuneration policies on the ecosystem of both private and public currencies.\n\nPillar 2: Liquidity supply\nThis brings me to the second pillar of interest rate control: liquidity supply. In order for central banks’ remuneration rates to effectively achieve interest rate control, central banks supply reserves in appropriate quantities to achieve the interest rate target. In some environments, this requires central banks to forecast demand for liabilities and execute open market operations to supply needed reserves.\n\nIn recent years, the demand for many central bank liabilities has become higher and less predictable. However, most central banks have been operating with abundant liquidity surpluses, which has limited the impact of this reduced predictability on implementation.12 As central banks embark on balance sheet reduction, however, understanding demand for liabilities may become more important.\n\nThe demand for digital currencies is not well understood, as these are instruments for which there is no precedent or experience. For a CBDC, central banks would have to understand the behavior of the demand for this new liability. If stablecoins were to be issued by commercial banks, it would also be important to understand drivers of growth in these coins and how that growth might affect banks’ demand for reserves. Trend growth in these central bank liabilities could be quite different than it is for other liabilities, such as cash or reserve holdings of traditional banks. And, the variability in demand could potentially be high, driven by shifts in the market environment or in response to geopolitical developments or other exogenous events. This variability could be amplified if digital currencies were available internationally, potentially leading to larger flows. The variability could create new challenges for supplying the appropriate amount of reserves to the banking system to ensure that administered rates continue to control rates, and could lead to a need for larger liquidity surpluses to ensure interest rate control.\n\nOne way to manage growth or variability in demand, and the associated impact on demand for reserves in the banking system, could be to impose limits on how much of a CBDC individuals or institutions could hold. Some central banks are actively considering such limits.13 However, these could also diminish the use cases for CBDC and reduce the potential for consumers and businesses to take advantage of the payment benefits.\n\nStablecoins may not have the same types of holding limitations, which could lead to faster growth or more variability in demand. At least one jurisdiction is considering the potential use of holding limits or transaction limits on stablecoins on a temporary basis, to manage the possible shift from commercial bank deposits during a transition to new forms of digital money.14 Central banks could also contemplate putting some limits on balances at the central bank associated with stablecoin issuance to manage the unpredictability associated with these flows.\n\nI have spent some time discussing the potential need for greater supply of liquidity; however, the direction is not all one-way. As payments become faster, the demand for some central bank liabilities may decline. For example, in some jurisdictions, payment innovations have led to a substantial decline in the amount of currency in circulation.15 Banks may also find that more efficient payment systems bring about liquidity efficiencies, and could reduce their own demand for reserves in response.\n\nFrom my vantage point, the key takeaway for liquidity provision is to consider how, in the context of the remuneration paid on these instruments and other features, demand for central bank liabilities might evolve and how it could shift in different environments. Again, this requires holistic thinking about the ecosystem in which both private and public digital currencies operate.\n\nPillar 3: Liquidity facilities and backstops\nThe third pillar of interest rate control is liquidity backstops. In most frameworks the supply of central bank liabilities and their rates of remuneration are the primary means of interest rate control. However, occasional shocks occur in money markets, and central banks provide liquidity backstops that promote interest rate control and smooth market functioning.\n\nIn an environment with new public and private digital currencies, liquidity backstops for traditional banks may become even more important. As I noted, digital currencies could create competition for commercial bank deposits. This could enhance market efficiency and improve transmission of monetary policy, but it may also lead to swings in deposit flows that could unexpectedly shift a commercial bank’s liquidity position. This could in turn increase the potential for occasional variability in overnight rates and the need for central bank liquidity facilities.\n\nHowever, liquidity risk will also be an important consideration for new entrants, such as stablecoin issuers. Stablecoins backed entirely by central bank reserves would be less susceptible to liquidity risk than those backed with other assets. But this design may not ultimately be the most efficient use of central bank liabilities for the financial system, because an important role for commercial banks in the two-tier monetary system is their ability to support the provision of credit in the economy.16\n\nStablecoins backed by other instruments, such as high-quality liquid assets, could moderate growth in the central bank’s balance sheet relative to a stablecoin backed entirely by central bank reserves. However, this structure would also give rise to liquidity risk for stablecoin issuers, which might in turn give rise to a need for a backstop source of funding.\n\nThese considerations raise important questions for how best to integrate digital currencies and ensure smooth market functioning and interest rate control in times of stress.\n\nHow might the central bank’s balance sheet adapt?\nPossibly the biggest question over time for monetary policy implementation is how much of the central bank balance sheet should be used to support innovation in currencies.\n\nThe current two-tier system of money and payments has central bank balances at its center, but also features an expansive set of private money offered through bank deposit balances. Innovation in payment systems may have clear benefits for consumers and businesses, and private currencies backed by safe central bank balances or other highly liquid safe assets are certainly better than alternatives created by less regulated firms and backed by lower quality or illiquid assets. However, to the extent that stablecoins or CBDCs supplant private bank money or expand overall demand for central bank liabilities, they could also increase the size and potentially change the nature of central bank assets.\n\nA larger balance sheet could cause some central banks to adapt approaches to asset composition to manage the influence of a larger balance sheet on the policy stance. For example, a central bank could buy short-duration assets to support the new demand for central bank liabilities and differentiate these asset purchases from those intended to foster accommodative financial conditions.\n\nThese issues may also require new operational approaches for central banks. In some circumstances, the balance sheet could need to adjust rapidly because of unexpected large shifts in liability demand. This could require new thinking by central banks on the appropriate approaches to implementation with potentially a different mix of assets or tools to add liquidity to the system. Short-duration assets or temporary liquidity providing operations would also allow flexibility if an increase in liability demand is expected to be short term.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe innovation occurring in money and payments has the potential to alter the existing two-tier monetary system upon which current monetary policy implementation frameworks are designed. How things evolve from here is uncertain, and the impact of these innovations could be revolutionary, or more evolutionary. But imagining an environment in which new forms of private and public money and payments could coexist is helpful in adapting implementation frameworks that will enable central banks to continue to achieve their desired policy stance in the future.\n\nExpanding central bank liabilities in an incremental way to support new forms of money could create a safer payment system—one that promotes innovation, mitigates potential risks, and ensures money continues to function well in an increasingly digital economy. Adapting the implementation framework to incorporate new private forms of money and potentially central bank digital currencies is complex and will require substantial further study of key issues, some of which I have raised today.\n\nThis calls for an integrated approach, one that considers each instrument and its role in the monetary ecosystem. Central banks must draw on broad expertise within their institutions so that payments experts, monetary policy practitioners, financial stability and supervision colleagues explore and understand important intersections. We will also need to continue to engage a broad range of market participants, academics, and colleagues across the international central banking community as we adapt to be prepared for the road ahead. Workshops like this one help us learn from one another. Thank you all for your participation in such a rich and important set of discussions.\n\n\n1 I would like to thank Julia Gouny, Antoine Martin, Matthew Raskin, Samuel Schulhofer-Wohl, and Patricia Zobel for their assistance in preparing these remarks and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for valuable comments and suggestions.\n\n2 Various digital assets have emerged that are described as stablecoins, although some do not have the characteristics of money described here.\n\n3 See President’s Working Group on Financial Markets Report on Stablecoins (November 2021), Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on Markets in Crypto-assets, and amending Directive (September 2020), UK regulatory approach to cryptoassets and stablecoins: Consultation and call for evidence (January 2021) and Progress of Research & Development of E-CNY in China (July 2021).\n\n4 Based on preliminary review of results from the May 2022 Senior Financial Officer Survey.

    "text": "Thank you for that kind introduction, Trish [Mosser]. It’s great to be back at the School of International and Public Affairs and to have the opportunity to discuss current policy challenges with you, Don [Kohn] and Guillermo [Ortiz].\n\nI’d like to begin with some thoughts on the economic outlook and the monetary policy response. These views are mine and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nTo put it concisely, I remain very concerned about whether inflation will return to target in a sustainable and timely way. And I think more-restrictive monetary policy will be needed to achieve the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) goals of stable prices and maximum employment.\n\nThe economic outlook\nBoth inflation and the labor market came in hotter than expected over the first half of 2023. As of December, professional forecasters expected year-over-year core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation to slow to 4.3 percent in the first quarter of 2023, and the unemployment rate to rise to 3.9 percent. In actuality, core PCE inflation for the first quarter was 4.7 percent, and the unemployment rate averaged 3.5 percent.\n\nWhile the final data for the second quarter aren’t in yet, it was clearly pretty hot, too. Core and trimmed mean inflation measures continued to run around 4 percent—twice our target. Statistics like these that filter out especially volatile prices give an important signal of where overall inflation is headed. And while labor market indicators have eased, the overall pace of rebalancing remains slower than previously expected.\n\nThe economy has added an average of 314,000 jobs per month this year. Job openings remain far above the 2019 level. Layoffs remain low. There is no indication of an abrupt deterioration in labor market conditions.\n\nWage growth remains around 4.5 to 5 percent. The Dallas Fed’s business survey respondents expect roughly 5 percent wage growth over the next year, similar to what they expected at the end of last year. And they cite labor costs as a key driver of higher selling prices.\n\nSome people say a lot of further cooling is in store from lagged consequences of the rate increases the FOMC has already made over the past year and a half. I’m skeptical about the potential for large additional effects from this channel.\n\nThe lags have to be measured from the right starting point. Broad financial conditions matter more for economic activity than the policy rate itself. Of course, financial conditions respond to the policy rate and, in particular, to market participants’ expectations for the future path of the policy rate. And so, in the current cycle, financial conditions began to tighten in early 2022—a year and a half ago, and a few months before the FOMC began actually raising rates—as soon as market participants started to expect rate increases. The last major tightening in financial conditions came around the FOMC meeting last September, more than nine months ago. So, although some sectors of the economy will be slower to respond, we have already had a fair amount of time to see the overall effects of monetary tightening.\n\nMoreover, the housing market even looks like it may have bottomed out. Housing starts and home prices have trended up since January. Market rents had been roughly flat at the end of last year but rose at around a 4 percent annual rate in the first four months of this year. While housing inflation will likely continue to soften in the near term as a result of progress on rents last year, a rebound in housing would pose an upside risk to inflation down the road.\n\nMonetary policy\nThe continuing outlook for above-target inflation and a stronger-than-expected labor market calls for more-restrictive monetary policy.\n\nCredit conditions are continuing to evolve, but based on what we’ve seen so far, tighter credit conditions don’t seem likely to fully offset the need for a higher policy rate. While banking stresses captured headlines this spring, bankers have been cutting back on credit availability since the fall. And the Dallas Fed’s banking contacts say the main reason is tighter monetary policy, not banking stresses. So, at this point, I view credit conditions mainly as the result of the FOMC’s policy stance, not as a separate factor to adjust for. Moreover, banking stresses have calmed since March. Commercial real estate remains a risk, but not uniformly; the challenges are concentrated at some banks and some types of properties, especially office.\n\nWhile the Fed must remain ready to respond if banking stresses reignite, we have strong liquidity tools, and we know how to use them. Our actions in March showed that. These liquidity tools give us the space to continue setting monetary policy appropriately for our dual-mandate goals.\n\nI also don’t expect the near-term dynamics of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to create liquidity pressures that would call for a change in monetary policy strategy. Following the resolution of the debt ceiling, some market participants argued that the rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) balance—coming on top of the ongoing runoff of the Fed’s asset holdings as we return to a more normal level of monetary accommodation—would drain regional banks’ reserves, pose a new risk to financial stability and meaningfully tighten financial conditions. But that wasn’t my expectation, and it hasn’t happened so far. In the weeks since the debt ceiling was resolved, Treasury has issued more than $450 billion in net new marketable debt—mainly Treasury bills—to rebuild the TGA and finance government spending. As investors such as money market funds and foreign central banks buy that debt or lend against it in repo markets, they have pulled a net $340 billion out of the Fed’s overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility and foreign and international monetary authorities’ reverse repo pool. Those shifts have largely offset the $360 billion growth in the TGA through last week and, in combination with other balance sheet components, left reserve balances little changed.[1]\n\nMy base case is that most of the TGA rebuild will continue to come from ON RRP balances or from reserves at very large banks. We’ve seen over time that even modest yield differentials are enough to encourage money market funds to move balances from the ON RRP facility to T-bills or private sector repos. And large banks have excess reserves that they’ll likely be comfortable allowing to run off as the TGA grows. So, while I’ll be vigilant in case the balance sheet dynamics play out differently, a large drain of reserves from regional banks doesn’t seem like the most likely scenario.\n\nWe could still see some temporary upward pressures on money market rates over time as the TGA grows and the Fed’s balance sheet normalization continues. Banks can’t perfectly predict deposit flows. They may have to pay more for short-term funding at times as liquidity redistributes through the financial system. As long as significant balances remain in the ON RRP facility, I wouldn’t see such rate pressures as a sign that liquidity was becoming scarce. Rather, the rate pressures would provide the incentive for funds to leave the facility and move to banks. And the Fed would have plenty of tools for maintaining interest rate control in such a scenario, including the standing repo facility, discount window lending or a technical adjustment in the ON RRP rate. The balance sheet outlook should not affect decisions about monetary policy at this stage.\n\nAnd history has shown the dangers of central banks easing off too soon on inflation. We are all familiar with the consequences of the Federal Reserve’s insufficiently resolute response to inflation in the 1970s. And recently, a number of central banks have had to resume or accelerate rate increases after pausing or slowing. The example of the Bank of Canada is instructive. The Canadian mortgage market uses more flexible rates that result in faster transmission of monetary policy to the economy. So, uncertainty about lags isn’t complicating the economic picture as much there. As an open economy, Canada appears to be getting a read on the persistence of global inflation. And what they’re seeing, in the Bank of Canada’s words , is that inflation is “stubbornly high.”\n\nIn this environment, the FOMC needs to make policy more restrictive so we can return inflation to target in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nIn my view, it would have been entirely appropriate to raise the federal funds target range at the FOMC’s June meeting, consistent with the data we had seen in recent months and the Fed’s dual-mandate goals.\n\nBut in casting my vote, I was mindful of several factors. In a challenging and uncertain environment, it can make sense to skip a meeting and move more gradually. And as I said earlier, financial conditions matter more for the economy than the precise path of the policy rate. Financial conditions depend not only on how fast rates rise but also on the level they reach, the time spent at that level, and, importantly, the factors that determine further increases or decreases. So, my hope was that the overall package of communications coming out of the June meeting would deliver a strong signal to financial markets and meaningfully tighten financial conditions.\n\nAt this point, it is important for the FOMC to follow through on the signal we sent in June. Two-thirds of FOMC participants projected at least two more rate increases this year. Significant unexpected events could always provide a reason to change course. But inflation and the labor market evolving more or less as expected wouldn’t really change the outlook. To have confidence that inflation will return to target on an appropriate timetable, we need to see more than some continued very modest rebalancing.\n\nIf we lose ground in our effort to restore price stability, we will need to do more later to catch up. The rate increases we’d need to keep inflation expectations anchored in that scenario would be far worse for workers, communities, households, businesses and banks than more modest increases now.\n\nThank you. I look forward to our conversation."

    "text": "Thank you for that kind introduction, Dom [Haskett].\n\nI was just at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, where the Kansas City Fed gathers central bankers and researchers at Grand Teton National Park to discuss the latest global economic issues.\n\nVisiting the Wyoming mountains reminded me of being in the Girl Scouts growing up. I cherished evenings around the campfire with my friends. But you can stay up only so late and eat only so many s’mores. Eventually, you have to put the fire out.\n\nNow, as every Scout knows, when you put out your campfire, you must make sure it is “cold out”—so completely extinguished that you feel no heat when you touch the ashes with your bare hands. Any warm embers could reignite later.\n\nThe traditional way to make sure a fire is cold out is to pour water on it—lots of water—until you have eliminated every last bit of heat.\n\nThat is a good way to put out campfires, but I will argue today that it is not a good way to put out inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation target. After the unacceptably rapid price increases of the past several years, I’m not yet convinced that we’ve extinguished excess inflation. But in today’s complex economic environment, returning inflation to 2 percent will require a carefully calibrated approach—not endless buckets of cold water.\n\nBefore I go any further, I’ll just note that the views I express are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the FOMC.\n\nThe inflation outlook\nLet me start with why we need to put out inflation. Congress has charged the FOMC with setting monetary policy to pursue maximum employment and stable prices.\n\nWhile the labor market is very strong, inflation over the past several years has been much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. But prices rose 6 percent in 2021 and 5.3 percent in 2022 and continued to rise, at a 3.2 percent annual rate, in the first seven months of this year.\n\nPeople count on the Federal Reserve to keep our commitment to price stability. When inflation is high, people’s incomes fall short of the rising cost of living. Businesses can’t plan well because they don’t know what they’ll pay for materials or be able to charge their customers. And, over time, high inflation tends to make the business cycle more volatile, undermining the long and stable expansions that particularly benefit the most vulnerable in society.\n\nTo help bring the economy into better balance, the FOMC has raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 5.25 percentage points since early 2022. We’re also reducing our asset holdings. The significantly lower inflation in recent months is encouraging. But lower inflation isn’t necessarily low-enough inflation. We have to ask whether monetary policy is now sufficiently restrictive to return inflation all the way to 2 percent in a sustainable and timely way or whether the FOMC still needs to do more.\n\nForecasts are inherently uncertain. My base case, though, is that there is work left to do.\n\nThe monthly inflation rate has been around 2.5 percent for the past couple of months. But monthly inflation data can be volatile, and extreme changes in prices for one good or another can also push the numbers around. To get a clearer signal of where overall inflation is headed, it’s helpful to filter out some of the more volatile prices. For example, we can take out the prices of food and energy and look at the core inflation rate. Over the past three months, it was 2.9 percent. And the Dallas Fed trimmed mean inflation rate was 2.8 percent over that period. These numbers indicate it is too soon to confidently say inflation will trend to 2 percent in a timely way.\n\nLabor market conditions also suggest we haven’t finished the job of restoring price stability. To sustain low inflation, supply and demand need to be in balance. Last year, labor demand greatly outpaced supply. Payroll growth and job openings soared. The unemployment rate fell to a half-century low. Today, some indicators, like job openings and the percentage of workers quitting their jobs each month, show substantial progress toward better balance. Yet, overall, the labor market remains very strong. For example, the U.S. economy is adding an average of about 150,000 jobs per month. That’s more than enough to keep pace with trend growth in the labor force.\n\nWage data show that many employers still have to compete hard to attract and retain workers. Wages nationally have been growing at an annual rate of more than 4 percent by a variety of measures, compared with 3 percent in 2019. Respondents to the Dallas Fed’s business surveys tell us significant wage pressures remain, though they’re less severe than a year ago. To sustain 2 percent inflation over time, wage growth will need to fall, or trend productivity growth will need to rise.\n\nMoreover, the early data for the current quarter suggest economic activity is picking up—contrary to expectations all year that the economy would slow down. Retail sales and real consumption both came in high in July. Residential construction seems to be rebounding from the effects of higher interest rates.\n\nThe initial data on a quarter can be noisy. The picture could change. But if stronger economic activity continues, it could lead to a resurgence of inflation.\n\nMonetary policy strategy\nSo, if the job doesn't appear to be done, why do we need to proceed carefully? The economic outlook isn’t certain. Tighter financial conditions might slow the economy without much further action by the FOMC. And there are risks to doing both too little and too much.\n\nThe strong July data might be a blip. If the economy cools, inflation would be more likely to fall. The economy’s strength might not even be a bad sign for inflation if that strength reflects improvements in labor supply or increases in productivity.\n\nFinancial conditions also tightened noticeably in the weeks after the July FOMC meeting. The 10-year Treasury yield rose by nearly 50 basis points before retracing partway. And the average 30-year mortgage rate at one point was up 42 basis points, reaching the highest level since 2001.\n\nPart of these moves came in response to strong economic data. Market participants understand that the FOMC may need to offset economic strength with higher interest rates. If, as in my base case, stronger growth poses risks to inflation, the FOMC will need to follow through on that expectation.\n\nBut news unrelated to monetary policy also pushed market rates up. That means households and businesses face more-restrictive financial conditions for the same setting of the federal funds rate. To the extent that tighter conditions from this source persist, they should slow the economy and, potentially, require less additional tightening of monetary policy.\n\nIn this environment, the stance of policy needs to be calibrated carefully. Tightening too little would allow above-target inflation to persist. If high inflation becomes entrenched, restoring price stability could require much larger and more costly rate increases. However, excessively restrictive policy would also hurt households and businesses and might even lead inflation to undershoot our 2 percent target.\n\nA year ago, we were raising interest rates very rapidly—by 75 basis points at each of four consecutive FOMC meetings—to catch up after inflation had surged far too high. But the FOMC cannot safely throw bucket after bucket of cold water on the economy just in case inflation catches fire again. If we did that, not only inflation but economic activity itself would soon be “cold out”—which is not an outcome we want.\n\nSo, at this stage, I believe we must proceed gradually, weighing the risk that inflation will be too high against the risk of dampening the economy too much. You might say we need to drizzle water on the firepit and watch closely for signs that the coals are heating up again.\n\nLast fall and winter, we slowed the pace of rate increases to 50 and then 25 basis points per meeting. The slower pace allowed us to carefully assess the data and reduce the risk of an abrupt and nonlinear deterioration in the economy.\n\nWe further slowed the pace by skipping a rate increase at our June meeting before increasing again in July. And another skip could be appropriate when we meet later this month.\n\nBut skipping does not imply stopping. In coming months, further evaluation of the data and outlook could confirm that we need to do more to extinguish inflation. The FOMC will need to keep the water bucket close at hand, and we must not hesitate to use it as necessary. But we must also gather the necessary information to use our tools well. This carefully calibrated approach can help us to sustainably achieve our goal of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nThank you."

    "text": "Remarks at New York University’s Stern School of Business (delivered via videoconference)As prepared for delivery\nThanks very much for that kind introduction.  I would like to thank Dick Berner and Venky Venkateswaran for organizing this event.1 As Dick would likely recall, I was supposed to give a talk about implementing policy here at NYU Stern two years ago, almost to the day. We had to cancel that speech as it became clear that the emerging pandemic and the efforts to contain it would disrupt the global economy and lead to unprecedented strains in financial markets. Today, the world faces an extraordinary new challenge.  I would like to acknowledge the tragic events in Ukraine and the terrible hardship this places on the Ukrainian people. The economic and financial impact of these events will take time to become clear.  On the Desk, we are monitoring global developments carefully.\n\nMy remarks today will begin by looking back at the pandemic crisis and the historic policy response.  Starting in March 2020, the Federal Reserve took a set of extraordinary measures in response to the extreme economic stresses and dislocations in the global financial system that were triggered by the pandemic.  These actions—many taken in close coordination with the U.S. Treasury, and alongside a forceful fiscal response from the U.S. government—were successful in providing accommodation to the U.S. economy during a very vulnerable and uncertain period.2\n\nIn light of recent strength in the labor market and elevated inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to end net purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in early March.  The Committee also stated that it expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, and released principles for significantly reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.3\n\nWith net asset purchases coming to an end, it is an opportune time for reflection.  In my remarks today, I’ll first review the asset purchases the Fed conducted over the past two years, exploring how the Committee’s evolving objectives for these purchases influenced the Desk’s implementation approach. I’ll then highlight how these purchases shaped the SOMA portfolio today and discuss some considerations ahead for policy implementation, in the context of the FOMC’s recently issued Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet.\n\nAs always, the views I express today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Fed’s Asset Purchases: Objectives and Implementation\n\nNext week, the FOMC’s net purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS will come to an end, marking the conclusion of this historic program, in which net purchases totaled roughly $4.6 trillion, as shown in Figure 1. These purchases were instrumental in supporting the flow of credit to the U.S. economy and fostering accommodative financial conditions—and, along with other significant policy measures, prevented a much deeper economic downturn.\n\nThe onset of the pandemic resulted in an unprecedented “dash for cash” as heightened uncertainty in the outlook and shifts to a remote trading posture prompted extreme price volatility, sudden portfolio de-risking, and strains in market functioning.  In this environment, even the most liquid securities, like Treasuries, were being sold broadly and in large quantities, overwhelming the market’s intermediation capacity.4 \n\nBy mid-March 2020, Treasury and agency MBS market functioning had deteriorated to levels not seen since the Global Financial Crisis.  In this truly exceptional environment, the Fed stepped in to buy securities at an unprecedented scale and speed to restore market functioning and maintain the vital flow of credit to the U.S. economy.  This entailed purchasing record amounts of securities to address one-way selling flows and meet the immediate demand for liquidity.\n\nThe flow of these purchases helped to alleviate private sector balance sheet constraints and meet this demand for market liquidity.  Over time, purchases restored two-way trading and more normal market functioning. The FOMC’s full commitment to purchase Treasuries and agency MBS “in the amounts needed” to support smooth market functioning also had the effect of stabilizing precautionary sales and forestalling a spiral in liquidity demand.5\n\nDuring this period, flexibility was a hallmark of our implementation approach.  The Desk adjusted purchases in response to shifting market conditions and sized them to address dysfunction.  We closely monitored and assessed market functioning metrics and targeted sectors in which conditions were especially strained.  In the MBS market, operational adjustments included purchasing a broad range of securities that came under intense selling pressure and purchasing for near-term settlement, which helped ease pressures on dealer balance sheets. This differed from the Desk’s typical practice of purchasing recently produced coupons in the to-be-announced (TBA) market for forward settlement.\n\nGiven the depth of the strains, market functioning improved only gradually at first.  However, with the Committee’s full commitment to supporting market functioning and the Desk’s continuous operational adjustments, market functioning metrics improved considerably over the course of several weeks, and the Desk reduced purchase amounts commensurately.6  In the Treasury market, bid-ask spreads narrowed and market depth rebounded, as shown in Figure 2.  Similarly, agency MBS market liquidity conditions, as represented by the effective bid-ask spread shown in Figure 3, improved markedly.\n\nAs market functioning improved and conditions stabilized, the Committee shifted its focus to fostering accommodative financial conditions to support the economy as it recovered from the pandemic shock, and to sustaining the gains made in market functioning. While asset purchases conducted to support market functioning were used during the pandemic to address extraordinary and acute stresses, asset purchases aimed at fostering accommodative financial conditions are a standard part of the Committee’s monetary policy toolkit, employed when the federal funds rate is constrained by its effective lower bound (ELB). \n\nBy reducing the stock of securities and duration risk held by private investors, Fed asset purchases lower term premiums and longer-term interest rates, easing financial conditions broadly.  In addition, purchases of agency MBS reduce the amount of prepayment risk held by investors, leading MBS spreads to fall and resulting in lower mortgage interest rates for homeowners.  Asset purchases can also convey information about the FOMC’s policy intentions, as market participants believe the Committee would be unlikely to raise its policy rate while conducting asset purchases. \n\nAs the FOMC’s objectives for asset purchases evolved, so too did the operational approach.  Purchase amounts were quickly scaled back as conditions improved, dropping from a daily average of over $100 billion in late March 2020 to around $10 billion by the summer, as shown in Figure 4.  Without the need for high-frequency adjustments to address market strains, the Desk extended the horizon for purchase calendars to provide more predictability in planned operations.  Purchase allocations also became more standard and were distributed relatively neutrally to the universe of securities outstanding. In this case, Treasury purchases were allocated proportionally to the amounts outstanding across the nominal Treasury coupon and TIPS coupon curves.7 In the MBS market, the composition of purchases was adjusted to be roughly in line with recently produced coupons in the TBA market.\n\nOverall, the asset purchases, and the operational approach used to implement them, were effective at achieving the Committee’s objectives. The flow of purchases substantially improved market functioning by meeting immediate demands for market liquidity in strained conditions.  The total stock of Fed asset holdings—resulting from both purchases initiated to address market functioning and those conducted with a focus on providing accommodation—worked to put downward pressure on longer-term yields and ease financial conditions.  And, the Committee’s communications about asset purchases had important signaling effects about its commitment to supporting the economy.   \n\nWhat I take away from this experience is that the FOMC’s toolkit for addressing both severe market functioning disruptions and economic downturns is comprehensive and effective.  Nonetheless, while asset purchases used to support market functioning and those employed to foster accommodative financial conditions may be broadly similar in nature, I do not view them as equal parts of the monetary policy toolkit.  I expect circumstances warranting sizable intervention to support market functioning to be extraordinarily rare.  In this respect, the ongoing work to better understand vulnerabilities in the U.S. Treasury market and to develop potential reforms to further enhance its resiliency is critical.8 In contrast, the Committee has indicated that asset purchases to provide accommodation are a standard tool when the federal funds rate is constrained by the ELB.9\n\nConsiderations for Policy Implementation Ahead\n\nLooking ahead, as I noted, with a strong labor market and elevated inflation, the FOMC has stated that it expects it will soon be appropriate to raise its target range for the federal funds rate, and has indicated that it intends to significantly reduce the size of the balance sheet.10 \n\nFor now, the FOMC has directed the Desk to continue to reinvest all principal payments from the Fed’s Treasury and agency MBS holdings following the conclusion of net purchases, which will maintain the size and broad composition of the SOMA portfolio.11 However, in recent meetings, the FOMC began deliberations on its approach to reducing the balance sheet, and following its January meeting the Committee issued principles to provide information on its planned approach.12 These principles are high-level tenets, and not specific plans. They build on the experience gained from reducing monetary policy accommodation over 2014 to 2019, and, importantly, also reflect the Committee’s assessment of the current environment.\n\nThe principles start by affirming that the FOMC sees changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy, and that reducing the balance sheet will occur after the process of raising the target range has begun.  The principles further state that when the Committee decides to begin reducing its securities holdings, it intends to do so over time in a predictable manner, primarily through adjustments to reinvestments, so that securities holdings decline with principal payments.  In addition, the principles affirm the FOMC’s choice of an ample reserves operating regime, and an intention, in the longer run, to hold primarily Treasury securities.\n\nLet me turn to a couple of considerations ahead for policy implementation, in the context of these principles and the current contours of the SOMA portfolio. \n\nSOMA Portfolio Contours\n\nFirst, the SOMA portfolio is substantially larger than it was at the end of the last round of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs), reflecting the extraordinary pandemic shock and the purchases needed to support market functioning and the economic recovery.  As shown in Figure 5, at about $8.5 trillion and 35 percent of nominal GDP, the SOMA portfolio is roughly double the size in dollar terms and about 10 percentage points higher as a share of GDP than in late 2014.  Given the large size of the SOMA, the Committee has suggested that a significant reduction in the balance sheet would likely be appropriate.13  This assessment reflects the view that, with the overall elevated size of the balance sheet, SOMA securities holdings have more room to decline than during the prior period of runoff before reaching levels consistent with efficient and effective implementation in an ample reserves regime.\n\nIn addition to the much larger size of the SOMA, the weighted average maturity (WAM) of Treasury holdings is about two years shorter than in late 2014.  This is because asset purchases over the past two years have been conducted across the Treasury curve, whereas purchases under previous LSAP programs and the maturity extension program (MEP) targeted longer-dated Treasuries.  It also reflects the effect of sales of shorter-dated securities conducted during the MEP.14\n\nAs shown in Figure 6, the portfolio will have sizable principal payments from Treasury holdings over the next few years, ranging from $40 billion to $150 billion per month, and averaging around $80 billion.  These could be rolled over or allowed to mature, depending on the Committee’s decisions.  During the prior period of balance sheet reduction, shown in Figure 6b, the Committee directed the Desk to phase in a cap for monthly Treasury redemptions of $30 billion per month, to limit the pace and variability of redemption amounts, particularly around the middle month of each quarter when maturities are greater.15  Often, principal payments were below the caps, and the average pace of Treasury redemptions was less than $20 billion per month.    \n\nAgency MBS principal payments, shown in Figure 7a, are also expected to be modestly larger than those experienced during the prior runoff period and could average nearly $25 billion per month over the next few years. However, there is considerable uncertainty around mortgage prepayments; a downward shift in mortgage interest rates could increase prepayments substantially, as indicated by the gray bars.16  During the prior reduction period, shown in Figure 7b, the Committee phased in a monthly redemption cap of $20 billion for MBS.  This made the decrease in agency MBS holdings more predictable, and also limited the possibility of procyclical reductions in SOMA holdings during periods when interest rates fell in response to a worsening economic outlook.  In 2019, as the Committee eased policy, the cap did limit the pace of agency MBS redemptions.\n\nIn summary, Treasury principal payments in coming years will be much larger and more variable than they were following the LSAP programs.  MBS principal payments will likely be modestly larger and are subject to considerable uncertainty.  The FOMC has not decided on its plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet.  However, the minutes from the December FOMC meeting noted that many Committee participants judged that monthly caps on redemption amounts could help ensure that the pace of reduction in the SOMA portfolio would be predictable over time.17\n\nAmple Reserves Regime\n\nA second observation is that the Committee’s affirmation of its ample reserves operating framework provides broad insight into the longer-run supply of reserves, a key determinant of the longer-run size of the balance sheet. \n\nDuring the prior period of balance sheet reduction after the LSAPs, the Committee had not yet decided on its operating framework.  Even after the Committee announced the ample reserves regime, heightened uncertainty existed about the underlying demand for reserves given the substantial changes in banks’ liquidity management practices since the Global Financial Crisis.\n\nToday, the operating framework is well established, and we can draw on the prior experience with balance sheet reduction in assessing the demand for reserves.  That said, the underlying demand for reserves is still uncertain and varies over time.  Most large reserve holders assess their need for reserve balances based on intraday payment flows and projected outflows under stressed market conditions, and each bank has a different profile based on the composition of its liabilities and the outflow assumptions it makes.18  Moreover, the supply of reserves needed to maintain ample conditions is not just the sum of individual banks’ demand, due to frictions that limit the rapid redistribution of reserves.\n\nAs the Committee reduces the balance sheet, staff will carefully monitor developments in money markets to understand changes in reserve conditions and inform the Committee's assessment of the appropriate path for the balance sheet in the longer run.  Importantly, the prior experience with balance sheet reduction offers a useful guide to money market conditions that reflect ample reserves.  The FOMC is committed to maintaining sufficient reserves to ensure that administered rates—the interest on reserve balances (IORB) and overnight reverse repo facility (ON RRP) rates—exercise control over the federal funds rate.  However, should pressures in overnight markets unexpectedly emerge, the new Standing Repo Facility (SRF) that the Committee established last year is also available, providing an important backstop to support effective policy implementation and smooth market functioning.\n\nFlexibility in Implementation\n\nAs the Committee turns toward reducing the high level of accommodation provided during the pandemic, the Desk will focus on implementing the Committee’s plans as they develop.  Overall, the FOMC’s principles provide helpful guidance on the approach to reducing the balance sheet; similar principles communicated in advance of decisions or actions during the prior episode enhanced understanding of the Committee’s approach, supporting effective policy implementation.19 This time around, FOMC participants generally noted that current conditions likely warrant a faster pace of balance sheet runoff than during the previous period.20  \n\nGiven the experience implementing the last balance sheet reduction, it seems likely that redemptions could proceed smoothly at a somewhat faster pace than before.  However, a significant reduction in SOMA holdings will require meaningful adjustments to private-sector balance sheets—as investors absorb the net increase in Treasury and agency MBS issuance and money markets transition to lower levels of liquidity—and these adjustments could take time.  And while the Fed has some experience shrinking its balance sheet, this process is still relatively novel.  So, the Desk will continue to monitor markets closely to inform the FOMC’s policy deliberations.  The Committee is prepared to adjust its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet, should economic and financial developments warrant.\n\nPotential for Liftoff is Near-Term Focus\n\nFinally, as the principles note, the FOMC will first increase the target range for the federal funds rate before it begins reducing the size of the balance sheet.  And, at its January meeting, the Committee stated that it expects it will soon be appropriate to increase the target range.  So, I am also focused on liftoff and adjustments in money markets that might occur.  Let me offer some concluding thoughts on that.\n\nThe Committee last lifted the target range off of the zero lower bound in 2015.  At that time, the Fed had no experience lifting short-term interest rates in an environment with abundant reserves, and there was significant uncertainty about the dynamics we’d see in money markets.  Ultimately, the policy implementation framework—including the administered rates and associated operations—was very successful in managing the federal funds rate within the target range and lifting the constellation of overnight rates.  And as we’ve seen over the past several years, the framework has continued to support effective policy implementation across a range of environments.\n\nEven as the current environment is characterized by higher levels of liquidity than in 2015, I am confident that administered rates will again be effective at lifting the federal funds rate when the Committee increases the target range.  Administered rates create strong incentives in overnight markets, and the ON RRP provides a broad range of money market investors an alternative investment to support the federal funds rate and other overnight rates.  My sense is that the current setting of administered rates relative to the target range has been working well and that it could continue to support effective policy implementation following any increase in the target range in coming months, although adjustments could be warranted over time.\n\nWith the high levels of liquidity in money markets, take-up at the ON RRP facility could increase as rates rise.  Flows between bank reserves and ON RRP balances depend, in part, on relative levels of interest rates on bank deposits versus other money market investments, such as money market mutual funds (money funds).  Some banks may use rising rates as an opportunity to reduce reserve holdings by shedding deposits.21  If, when the FOMC increases the target range, banks raise deposit rates by less than money funds increase net yields to investors, funds could flow from banks into money funds, which could in turn increase take-up at the ON RRP.\n\nThat said, while many expected an increase in the ON RRP in 2015, this did not come to pass, and it could be that ON RRP balances remain relatively steady following liftoff or even decline.  Regardless of what happens following liftoff, over time, as the Committee reduces the size of the balance sheet, I expect usage in the ON RRP to decline.\n\nIn sum, the administered rates working together should maintain the federal funds rate within the FOMC’s target range.  I am confident our tools will promote smooth implementation of the Committee’s policy stance.  But as always, we will monitor conditions closely and consider adjustments to our approach as appropriate.\n\nFigures PDF\nData for Figures 6 and 7 EXCEL\n\n\n1 I would like to thank Linsey Molloy, Matt Raskin, and Patricia Zobel for their assistance in preparing these remarks, Kathleena Inchoco and Linmei Amaya for their research support, and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for valuable comments and suggestions.\n\n2 The Federal Reserve also took supervisory and regulatory measures to respond to the pandemic and associated crisis, including the reduction of reserve requirement ratios to zero, the temporary exclusion of reserves and Treasuries from the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR), and the increased availability of daylight credit.\n\n3 See Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet.\n\n4 For additional discussion of Treasury market intermediation during the onset of the pandemic, see Logan, Lorie, 2020, “Treasury Market Liquidity and Early Lessons from the Pandemic Shock,” remarks at Brookings-Chicago Booth Task Force on Financial Stability meeting, October 23.\n\n5 While announcements of central bank actions can also reduce liquidity demand and encourage a return to normal investing and market-making activity, the most immediate liquidity needs are unlikely to be resolved by announcements alone and require active operations to address them.  For additional discussion, see Logan (2020).  For additional discussion of the impact of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases during the onset of the pandemic and related crisis, see Vissing-Jorgensen, Annette, 2021, “The Treasury Market in Spring 2020 and the Response of the Federal Reserve,” Working Paper 29128, National Bureau of Economic Research, August; Fleming, Michael, Haoyang Liu, Rich Podjasek, and Jake Schurmeier, 2021, “The Federal Reserve’s Market Functioning Purchases,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, No. 998, December; and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2020, “Financial Stability Report,” November 16.\n\n6 A variety of market functioning metrics informed the Desk’s decision to reduce purchases during this period.  The Desk routinely monitors direct measures of liquidity and relative value, as well as indirect measures of trading pressures and positioning preferences in the Federal Reserve’s open market operations.  For more discussion of the asset purchases to support market functioning, see Logan, Lorie, 2020, “The Federal Reserve’s Market Functioning Purchases: From Supporting to Sustaining,” remarks at SIFMA Webinar, July 15.\n\n7 There were sectors of the curve that the Desk refrained from purchasing. For example, the Desk generally has avoided purchasing bills in this program, both to avoid increasing scarcity value in these securities arising from strong investor demand and because bill purchases have relatively little impact on financial conditions.  Floating-rate notes (FRNs) have also not been purchased in operations since March 2020 due to the limited impact these purchases would have on financial conditions.\n\n8 For additional discussion of measures to enhance U.S. Treasury market liquidity and resiliency, see: “Recent Disruptions and Potential Reforms in the US Treasury Market: A Staff Progress Report,” November 8, 2021.\n\n9 See 2020 Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.\n\n10 See Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement, January 26, 2022, and Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet.\n\n11 The FOMC directs the Desk to reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasuries, agency debt and agency MBS; principal payments from holdings of agency CMBS are not reinvested.\n\n12 See Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet.\n\n13 See Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, January 25–26, 2022.\n\n14 The shorter WAM of SOMA Treasury holdings also reflects the effect of U.S. Treasury’s debt issuance decisions, and that for most of the program purchases have been proportional to outstanding Treasury coupons.\n\n15 Maturities of SOMA Treasury securities spike in the mid-month of each quarter, reflecting Treasury issuance patterns and SOMA purchases of 10- and 30-year Treasury securities, including those that were purchased during the MEP and LSAP3.\n\n16 In addition to the uncertainty associated with the level of interest rates, estimates of agency MBS paydowns can vary substantially across paydown models.\n\n17 See Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 14-15, 2021.\n\n18 See the August 2019 Senior Financial Officer Survey.\n\n19 See Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, December 14-15, 2021.\n\n20 See Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, January 25–26, 2022.\n\n21 The most recent Senior Financial Officer Survey asked respondents whether they expect their bank to take actions to reduce or increase the level or growth in its reserve balances in the next six months. About 40 percent of respondents (a vast majority of which were domestic banks) reported that they expect their bank to take actions to reduce the level or growth in its reserve balances.  Over 50 percent of the respondents reported that they expect their bank to not take specific actions to adjust the level or growth in its reserve balances, while the remaining reported that they expect their bank to take actions to increase the level or growth of its reserve balances.

    "text": "Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Lorie Logan, and I serve as the president and CEO of the Dallas Fed.\n\nI’d like to thank Governor [Michelle] Bowman for kicking off our celebration and sharing her insights on the Federal Reserve’s role in community development. And thank you to everyone here, including external partners and Dallas Fed staff, for joining us today.\n\nIn particular, I’d like to recognize our guests of honor, leaders from our four Advance Together communities:\n\nThe Education Partnership of the Permian Basin.\nThe Big Country Manufacturing Alliance in the rural regions of West Central Texas.\nThe Family Pathways 2-Gen Coalition in Travis County.\nThe Deep East Texas College and Career Alliance.\nCommunity development is one of the key functions of the Federal Reserve. And here at the Dallas Fed, we are working to build a strong economy where everyone has the opportunity to participate and thrive.\n\nThe Dallas Fed saw an opportunity to address institutional challenges at the heart of K-12 education and workforce development ecosystems here in the state by convening dedicated professionals from an array of backgrounds including:\n\nPublic and private education professionals.\nSocial service providers.\nRepresentatives from institutions of higher education.\nWorkforce training providers.\nEmployers.\nThe diverse perspectives offered by our partners are integral to the initiative’s work. Thank you all for your hard work over the last four years, and congratulations on the substantial progress you’ve achieved. Your commitment to building a brighter future for everyone in Texas is inspiring, and it has been an honor for us to be a part of these efforts.\n\nThe development of Advance Together\nI’d like to share some background on why the Advance Together initiative was developed and how it came to life.\n\nAlthough Texas continues to stand out as one of the fastest-growing economies in the country, it also has the 10th-highest poverty rate in the nation. Across the state, many lower-income and historically underserved communities face barriers that hinder economic mobility and resilience. We see substantial disparities on indicators such as kindergarten readiness rates, grade-based reading levels, high school graduation rates and post-secondary-degree completion. At the Dallas Fed, we focus a large portfolio of our community development work on educational attainment and workforce development in hopes of closing gaps in these areas. In developing the Advance Together initiative, we decided to keep these areas at the forefront of our focus.\n\nOur place-based community development efforts, like Advance Together, are built from research and conversations with practitioners that show cross-sector collaboration is key to the economic growth of communities. These efforts support local cross-sectoral partnerships working to improve educational and employment opportunities and outcomes for lower-income communities, thus boosting long-term economic resilience and mobility for individuals and families. This work reinforces our mission to build a strong economy for all.\n\nEffective solutions to complex local problems in areas like education or workforce development often rely on champions from across the public, nonprofit and business sectors working together toward shared goals over a sustained period of time. Advance Together is a catalyst for this collaborative effort, coordinated by the Dallas Fed in the communities we partner with. We provide customized guidance, technical assistance, and trainings to our partners through our staff and external consultants. I would like to note that the Dallas Fed does not raise funds, provide funding for grants or participate in the selection of grantees. Rather, fundraising and grant funding is coordinated by our external philanthropic partners to provide grants to participating communities.\n\nThe Advance Together steering committee selects grantees and manages program funding. Members of this committee include state- and national-level workforce and education experts from the business, nonprofit, philanthropic and public sectors.\n\nBefore we launched Advance Together’s pilot round, the Dallas Fed and the steering committee explored existing cross-sector partnerships in the state that were addressing acute education and workforce development challenges. We identified nearly 90 coalitions during this search. While many of these coalitions articulated ambitious goals and aligned strategies, they [the coalitions] shared with us that their biggest challenges include a lack of infrastructure and dedicated capacity to manage and coordinate this work. This is where a targeted initiative like Advance Together can make a difference.\n\nAdvance Together strengthens local and regional partnerships, builds collective capacity for this work, and capitalizes on the expertise and experiences of local leaders to drive change. Through our support and in our role as impartial, neutral conveners and researchers, we have helped close institutional silos and elevate the work of these community partnerships beyond individual-level impact. Our application of technical assistance at the local level provides opportunities for communities to rally around improving long-term economic objectives that are inclusive of lower-income people.\n\nCommunity impact\nWe’ve seen meaningful impact from our pilot-round sites and substantial progress toward their shared goals.\n\nA few highlights include:\n\nNew engagement and leadership from anchor institutions like local hospital networks, school districts, higher education partners and employers, which opens the door for further meaningful collaboration in the future and opportunity for system-level changes.\nSignificant progress in data-driven decision-making, specifically in terms of collecting data, sharing data across partners to inform collaborative work, and developing collective goals in alignment with the information available and a data-driven strategy and approach.\nFinally, Advance Together pilot-round teams have attracted over $8 million total in follow-on investment, recognizing the successful collaborative work thus far and the value of these coordinated efforts in their respective regions.\nI look forward to the Advance Together team leaders sharing more about the site-level progress during their panel discussion later this afternoon.\n\nConclusion/acknowledgements\nThe Dallas Fed’s district covers Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Louisiana. Texas was selected as the focus for this pilot round due to its role as the primary driver of our district’s economy and our goal to generate state-level impact with this initiative.\n\nWe aspire to have Advance Together’s approach serve as a model for communities across our district and nationwide.\n\nYou will hear this afternoon from an array of leaders, including representatives from the four communities in Advance Together’s pilot round, as well as partners who contributed to the design and development of this initiative. I would like to thank these leaders for their service to the community and their dedication to the next generation. I hope their words will encourage many of you to apply for the next round of this initiative.\n\nI’d also like to thank our pilot-round partners including:\n\nThe experts on our steering committee who made sure we at the Dallas Fed, as well as local leaders spearheading efforts on the ground, were well-coordinated with state and local policy work already in place, allowing Advance Together to build on this progress.\nOur fiscal sponsor, the Dallas Foundation, and the funding partners who have made the pilot round possible, including:\nThe Doris Duke Foundation.\nThe Kresge Foundation.\nTexas Mutual.\nThe Meadows Foundation.\nThe Communities Foundation of Texas.\nAdvance Together’s evaluator, Mt. Auburn Associates, and the external consultants and trainers who directly supported our Advance Together communities.\nI would also like to recognize Dallas Fed staff members who have contributed to the development and execution of Advance Together:\n\nAlfreda Norman, who recently retired from the Dallas Fed.\nRoberto Coronado.\nKseniya Benderskaya.\nMolly Hubbert Doyle.\nJane Santa Cruz.\nMarycruz De Leon.\nCurnelius Arnick.\nScott Wilkes.\nThis initiative would not have been possible without strategic support and guidance from our communications, legal and procurement departments.\n\nFinally, I want to thank our Dallas Fed board of directors for their support of this impactful work.\n\nIn closing, I’d like to thank you all for being here today in celebration of this tremendous effort and the accomplishments of this team and our community partners.\n\nI’m happy to turn the mic over to Kseniya Benderskaya now, who will share more about our Advance Together pilot-round teams."

    "text": "Thank you, Diana [Hancock]. It’s great to be at this important annual gathering and have the opportunity to discuss the policy outlook with you, Viral [Acharya] and Markus [Brunnermeier]. I’ll begin with some thoughts on the state of the economy and monetary policy and then turn more specifically to the Fed’s balance sheet and how we are implementing policy in money markets. As always, the views I express are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAs we look back over the past year, inflation today is in a much better place than last January. But the job of restoring price stability is not yet complete. Our challenge now is to finish the work of bringing inflation sustainably back to the 2 percent target.\n\nInflation data have generally been coming in cooler than expected, which is good news. The price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) was nearly flat for November and up 2.6 percent over the past year. The Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE inflation rate, which drops outliers, is 2.6 percent for the past three and six months. And core PCE increased at only around a 2 percent pace over the past three and six months, an improvement from the middle of 2023 when inflation appeared to be getting stuck at a higher level.\n\nAnd there’s clear evidence that the economy is moving into better balance. While GDP grew at an unsustainably strong 4.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, preliminary readings suggest the fourth quarter will be substantially slower. My business and community contacts consistently report that growth is settling down—not collapsing, not heading toward recession, but settling down.\n\nThe labor market, while still tight, also continues to rebalance. The pace of payroll job gains over the past several months has remained strong but is well below the pace at the start of 2023. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has fallen, as has the rate of workers quitting their jobs. And wage growth appears to be somewhat more consistent with our 2 percent inflation target. Contacts tell me that applicant pools are growing, and job candidates’ salary expectations are moderating. This is a more consistent picture than we had earlier in 2023. It gives me confidence that we have made a lot of progress toward a more sustainable path for the economy.\n\nSo, what could derail this benign outlook of inflation returning sustainably to our target as the economy gradually rebalances? There are, as always, plenty of risks: geopolitical threats to supply chains, financial fragilities in sectors such as commercial real estate and just the simple possibility that our forecasts are once again wrong, as they’ve been too many times in recent years. A key risk related to the topic of this panel is that a premature easing of financial conditions could allow demand to pick back up. Restrictive financial conditions have played an important role in bringing demand into line with supply and keeping inflation expectations well-anchored. Yet over the past few months, long-term yields have given back most of the tightening that we saw over the summer. We can’t count on sustaining price stability if we don’t maintain sufficiently restrictive financial conditions.\n\nMuch of the easing in long-term yields since October came in response to softer economic data or policy communications. Ordinarily, that pattern would suggest that markets expect the FOMC won’t need as restrictive a setting of the federal funds rate to accomplish our goals. But the magnitude of the reactions to data was much greater than normal. Part of what appears to be happening is that when the data are strong, as occurred over the summer, market participants perceive a wider range of potential rate outcomes and require compensation for that risk in the form of higher term premiums. And when the data soften, as happened recently, that term premium comes out because market participants perceive more of an upper bound on policy rates. Some model-based term premium estimates remain higher than levels seen last summer, but I’m mindful that all else equal, a lower term premium leaves more work to be done with the fed funds target.\n\nFinancial conditions indexes (FCIs) can provide a guide to how much restraint there is on the economy. I’ll talk today about four indexes that I find particularly informative. Three of the indexes are helpful because they weight financial variables based on their relationship to economic activity in macroeconomic models. These are the Goldman Sachs FCI and two FCIs published by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board: a baseline index that allows financial conditions to affect the economy with a lag of up to three years and an alternate index that allows lags of at most one year. The fourth index, published by the Chicago Fed, is more statistical in nature and doesn’t translate directly to an effect on economic activity, but it includes a much wider range of financial variables.\n\nThe Board staff’s baseline index shows a drag on GDP growth from tight financial conditions in the coming year. But that’s because the index assumes long lags. My staff produced an updated calculation of the Board staff’s alternative index with one-year lags, and it shows a tailwind to growth. The Goldman Sachs FCI shows something similar. My own view is that the right answer is somewhere in between. These indexes include only a subset of asset prices. Looking across the financial system as a whole, we’re still seeing tightening from bank credit and refinancing of term corporate debt. But a lot of the effects of higher rates are already behind us, and the recent easing in conditions could start to push up on aggregate demand. The Chicago Fed’s FCI, which statistically combines 105 different financial variables, shows that conditions are modestly less restrictive than a year ago and than their average over the past half century.\n\nAs I said earlier, if we don’t maintain sufficiently tight financial conditions, there is a risk that inflation will pick back up and reverse the progress we’ve made. In light of the easing in financial conditions in recent months, we shouldn’t take the possibility of another rate increase off the table just yet.\n\nTurning to the Fed’s balance sheet and policy implementation, we have reduced our securities holdings since mid-2022 at a brisk pace consistent with the principles and plans that the FOMC announced earlier that year. While securities holdings have declined by $1.3 trillion, bank reserve balances have actually risen by $350 billion dollars to around $3.5 trillion. That’s because reduced balances in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility have more than offset the decline in securities holdings. Increased Treasury issuance and a less uncertain interest rate path have contributed to the rapid ON RRP runoff by motivating money market funds to invest more in Treasury bills.\n\nMoney markets and policy implementation are continuing to function smoothly. As we did in 2018 and early 2019, we are likely to see modest, temporary rate pressures as our balance sheet shrinks and our liabilities redistribute. These rate pressures can be a price signal that helps market participants redistribute liquidity to the places where it’s needed. Experience shows that these pressures tend to emerge first on dates when liquidity is unusually encumbered or is draining out of the system especially rapidly, like tax-payment dates, Treasury settlements and month-ends. And indeed, we saw small, temporary rises in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) over the November–December and year-end turns. But on nearly all days, broad money market rates have remained well below the interest rate on reserves.\n\nThe emergence of typical month-end pressures suggests we’re no longer in a regime where liquidity is super abundant and always in excess supply for everyone. In the aggregate, though, as rate conditions demonstrate, the financial system almost certainly still has more than ample bank reserves and more than ample liquidity overall. The most recent Senior Financial Officer Survey shows that most banks in the sample have reserves well in excess of their lowest comfortable levels and desired buffers. ON RRP balances remain around $700 billion. And the Federal Reserve’s Standing Repo Facility (SRF) provides a backstop against any unexpected pressures.\n\nStill, individual banks can approach scarcity before the system as a whole. In this environment, the system needs to redistribute liquidity from the institutions that happen to have it to those that need it most. The faster our balance sheet shrinks, the faster that redistribution needs to happen. I’d note that the current pace of asset runoff is around twice what it was in the first half of 2019. And while the current level of ON RRP balances provides comfort that liquidity is ample in aggregate, there will be more uncertainty about aggregate liquidity conditions as ON RRP balances approach zero.\n\nSo, given the rapid decline of the ON RRP, I think it’s appropriate to consider the parameters that will guide a decision to slow the runoff of our assets. In my view, we should slow the pace of runoff as ON RRP balances approach a low level. Normalizing the balance sheet more slowly can actually help get to a more efficient balance sheet in the long run by smoothing redistribution and reducing the likelihood that we’d have to stop prematurely.\n\nLastly, I want to take note of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s adoption last month of a requirement for broader central clearing for cash and repo transactions in the Treasury market. While broader central clearing won’t cure all of the market’s vulnerabilities, our research at the Dallas Fed finds that it will have significant benefits. Related to my previous comments, broader central clearing should make repo markets more elastic as multilateral netting can reduce intermediaries’ balance sheet costs. That will help smooth the redistribution of liquidity when balance sheets are constrained, such as during stress episodes and at period ends. Broader central clearing should also meaningfully improve risk management, in particular by mitigating risks at interdealer brokers in the cash market and by addressing the 74 percent of noncentrally cleared bilateral repos that are currently transacted with zero haircuts. Of course, careful implementation by the industry and regulators will be important. The SEC has established a phased timeline, with full compliance in 2026. As the market moves toward broader clearing, I think the FOMC should also consider the benefits of central clearing of the Federal Reserve’s own Treasury market operations. The SEC regulation exempts central banks, but in my view, it’s typically most efficient and effective for us to operate in the same way as the main market participants. And, as I’ve discussed previously, central clearing of the SRF could make that facility more effective in providing backstop liquidity to the broad market.\n\nThank you."

    "text": "Thank you for the kind introduction, Chris [Furlow], and for inviting me to join you for this year’s conference.\n\nI understand the Texas Bankers Association is the oldest and largest association of bankers in the United States. This is very fitting for a state that has more community banks than any other, as well as regional and large banks that combine to form a diverse, vibrant banking ecosystem.\n\nI grew up in Versailles, Kentucky, a small town that really revolved around our community bank. Its loans were an engine for economic and community growth. But more than that, it’s where our soccer carpool gathered before going to games—and the bank’s name was on the soccer jerseys. The bank also invested in the town in so many other ways, like supporting our personal finance classes in school. The bank served the community and was part of the community. That early experience gave me a strong appreciation for how important banks are in our economy and how important it is to have a strong and diverse banking system.\n\nToday, I would like to speak with you about two topics. As a Federal Reserve Bank president and member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I’m often asked for my views on the economy and monetary policy. I promise you I’ll get to that subject in a few minutes. But first I want to discuss the Federal Reserve’s role in providing liquidity to the financial system, particularly during periods of market stress, and what this means for your banks. Let me note that the views I share today are mine and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nLiquidity provision\nLiquidity provision is one of the oldest roles of central banks around the world and an original purpose of the Federal Reserve System. One of the first lessons we are taught as central bankers is that to prevent stress and address crises should they arise, a central bank should stand ready to lend freely against good collateral.\n\nWhen a central bank offers a liquidity backstop, it supports financial stability in two ways: by reassuring the public and by actually adding liquidity to the system.\n\nIn many cases, the mere availability of ample liquidity can reassure depositors, calm stresses and help private funding markets continue to function smoothly. The central bank may not even need to make any loans.\n\nAnd when reassurance is not enough, the central bank can relieve pressures by delivering more funding. Over the years, across many episodes of financial stress, loans from central banks have helped bankers meet the needs of their customers—Main Street businesses and households—when other funding sources were unavailable. For this mechanism to work, the funds have to get out the door of the central bank and in the doors of commercial banks. Practical operational details become critically important, and all the more so in an era when liquidity needs can arise faster than ever.\n\nA banker I know told me how his great-grandfather managed a run on their family’s bank in 1932. He got in the car, drove to Dallas, borrowed $40,000, brought it back to the bank, showed customers the cash, and the run stopped. The world moves a lot faster these days. And I am pretty sure you couldn’t fit enough money in the car, either.\n\nThe events this year at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) are only the latest example of how liquidity needs are speeding up. We also saw an astonishingly rapid dash for cash in financial markets at the onset of the pandemic. Liquidity needs surged so rapidly that the Fed’s trading desk, which I led at the time, had to respond by buying more than $100 billion of securities on some days. And the rise of electronic trading has contributed to fast-moving shocks in securities markets.\n\nMany people have spoken about lessons learned from the recent banking stresses for banks’ risk management, supervision and regulation. If you haven’t yet read [Federal Reserve] Vice Chair [for Supervision] Michael Barr’s report on SVB, I encourage you to do so. It’s a careful examination of the bank’s failings and a transparent, candid and self-critical look at the Federal Reserve’s own role in the matter.[1]\n\nToday, I will look at lessons learned through a different lens: operational readiness. Operational readiness was a focus of my work leading the Fed’s trading desk for many years, and I believe it should be a priority for banks of all sizes in this era of fast-moving stress. I’ll share some thoughts on implications for banks, for bank supervision and regulation, and—in the spirit of a candid look in the mirror—for our own operations at the Federal Reserve.\n\nWhen phones can move money, and bank names can trend on apps on those same phones, bankers must look at contingent liquidity sources in a new light. The traditional ways to mitigate deposit flight, such as face-to-face conversations and phone calls to answer questions from depositors, may not be available in all instances. If you can’t borrow from a funding source with almost as much speed as your depositors can push buttons on their phones, it might not help you meet withdrawals.\n\nOne important funding source for many banks is the Federal Reserve’s discount window. The ability to borrow at the window can be particularly critical for smaller banks that lack access to broader capital markets, as well as for larger banks that could need funding late in the day when other borrowing relationships may not be available.\n\nWhen banks establish access to the discount window, they can also gain access to the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which we set up in March to respond to the recent stresses. With backing from the Treasury Department, the program allows banks to borrow for up to one year against Treasury and agency securities.[2] We lend through the BTFP based on the collateral’s par value, even if rising interest rates have reduced its market value. This additional funding, beyond what’s available at the discount window, helps ensure banks can meet their customers’ needs.\n\nDiscount window loans are priced a bit above prevailing market rates—we call this a backstop rate—because we don’t want to crowd out private funding. For that reason, banks generally do most of their borrowing elsewhere. But nevertheless, I strongly believe that every bank in Texas and every bank in our country should be fully set up at the discount window as part of its liquidity toolkit.\n\nLegal documents and collateral arrangements for the discount window should be in place well before any funding need arises. A bank facing today’s potential liquidity challenges may not have the luxury of waiting for setup.\n\nAnd banks should test the plumbing. Take out and repay a small-dollar loan. Practice moving collateral between the Fed and other funding sources that you use, such as the Federal Home Loan Banks. Evaluate how the lendable value of collateral varies across funding sources. These steps sound simple, and they usually are. But you want to have the muscle memory, so they’ll be easy even on a challenging day.\n\nThe same need for readiness applies to other contingent funding. Well-managed banks maintain access to a diverse set of funding sources. Maintaining access means more than a general idea that you could access funding from some source. The paperwork needs to be in place, and the operations need to be tested.\n\nAs the authorities continue to learn from the recent episode, it will be valuable to examine how supervision and regulation can best take operational readiness into consideration. For example, an expectation that depository institutions establish and periodically test access to the discount window could help make individual firms and the financial system more resilient. Unlike requirements for banks to hold more liquid assets, an expectation for discount window readiness would allow banks to engage as much as always in the traditional business of banking—taking deposits and making loans—that is so critical to our economy. Also, if all depository institutions regularly tested their discount window access, the traditional stigmas associated with borrowing from the Fed would be further reduced. To be clear, healthy banks borrow from our programs all the time. In the first quarter of 2021, the most recent period for which data have been released, 388 depository institutions took a total of 818 loans from the discount window.[3] Periodic borrowing by every bank would make it even more clear that borrowing is not in any way a negative signal.\n\nIf we are going to expect more of banks, we must also expect more of ourselves as the central bank. Liquidity tools that are not ready to get money out the door right away might not help us fulfill our responsibility to provide a liquidity backstop for the financial system. To be sure, the Federal Reserve has taken important steps to increase our operational readiness.[4] For example, the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) and Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) Repo Facility, which we established in 2021, automatically add liquidity to the financial system when needed.[5] That eliminates the need to decide whether to provide liquidity and, if so, how much, a step that slowed us down in the past. Banks are eligible to access the SRF, and I’d encourage you to consider whether this would be another helpful funding source for your bank.\n\nBut there is more the Fed can do. Some bankers have expressed concerns that our setup process for discount window access can move slowly. We hear you. Senior executives at the Dallas Fed are collaborating with our counterparts at other Reserve Banks to accelerate the setup process.\n\nLooking forward, the Federal Reserve should also consider expanding the hours of operation for critical services like the discount window. Our liquidity backstop should be available whenever banks might need it. As liquidity increasingly becomes a 24/7/365 business, that could come to include nights, weekends and holidays.\n\nAnd while I’ve focused mainly on banks today, we should examine our readiness to provide liquidity broadly in the financial system. Besides the recent banking stresses, we should consider experiences from the pandemic, the repo market pressures in September 2019 and other episodes since the Global Financial Crisis. And we should think about potential risks not yet experienced. We should consider how we can employ the full range of the Federal Reserve’s tools, including emergency lending authority, support for financial market infrastructures and open market operations. For example, the FOMC could further consider the potential benefits of centrally clearing SRF operations.[6] Maximizing the effectiveness of our liquidity tools is essential so we can maintain financial stability while also taking the appropriate monetary policy actions in today’s macroeconomic environment.\n\nEconomic outlook\nIn the rest of my remarks, I’ll assess the economic outlook and describe how I think monetary policy needs to respond.\n\nInflation remains much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, but prices rose over the past year by 4.2 percent—more than twice our goal.\n\nThis high rate of inflation challenges families and businesses in the short run, and it weakens our economy in the long run. So, restoring price stability remains a critical priority.\n\nNow, inflation in recent months has been lower than the worst peaks last year. The labor market has cooled somewhat. And activity in some sectors, such as housing, has slowed dramatically. The economy is not nearly as far out of balance as when the FOMC began raising rates 14 months ago.\n\nBut the question for monetary policy is not whether there has been some progress. It’s whether inflation is on track to return all the way to our 2 percent target and to do so in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nThe closer we get to a turning point in the economy, the more difficult it becomes to answer that question. The economy doesn’t cool uniformly. Some sectors can continue to boom even as others slow. And inflation may not fall in lockstep with hiring or output. So, we have to parse the statistics and qualitative information with even more care and humility than usual.\n\nI’m keeping an open mind and a close watch on economic developments as we head toward the next FOMC meeting in mid-June.\n\nAs of today, though, I remain concerned about whether inflation is falling fast enough.\n\nPart of the slowdown in inflation in recent months has been due to lower prices of oil and other commodities. But while it’s a relief to see lower prices at the gas pump, energy prices can’t keep falling forever.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has historically been a better guide to where overall inflation will go in the future. And core PCE inflation was 4.9 percent annualized for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThat is higher than overall inflation over the past year, higher than core inflation in the previous quarter and much higher than the inflation rate the public is counting on us to deliver.\n\nThe picture is the same with other statistics that filter out especially volatile prices to get a better signal of where overall inflation is headed. For example, the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate is higher than headline inflation, and the 12-month rate has leveled off above 4.5 percent in recent months.\n\nWe haven’t yet made the progress we need to make. And it’s a long way from here to 2 percent inflation.\n\nThe labor market’s continued strength appears to be contributing to high inflation. To be sure, some labor indicators are no longer boiling over the way they were last year. But the job market is still very strong. If it isn’t boiling over, it hasn’t cooled to a gentle simmer, either.\n\nLast month, the U.S. economy added 253,000 jobs. That’s down significantly from the rate late last year. But it’s still more than twice what’s needed to keep pace with the growth of the labor force over time. And the unemployment rate last month ticked down to 3.4 percent, tied for the lowest unemployment rate since 1969.\n\nLast year and early this year, job openings were another red-hot indicator. At one point, there were two openings for every unemployed person in the United States—a historic high. Today, the ratio has fallen to 1.6 openings per unemployed person. That shows some progress toward better balance, but it’s still well above the 1.2 openings per unemployed person in the very strong labor market of 2019.\n\nAnd while wage growth has moderated, there are hints that it might be leveling off at a relatively high pace. The Employment Cost Index and average hourly earnings accelerated a bit in the latest readings. And the Dallas Fed’s regional surveys show no clear signs of deceleration in wages.\n\nIf labor productivity tracks historical trends, wage growth of 4.5–5 percent just isn’t sustainable, because it isn’t consistent with keeping inflation at 2 percent over time. And without price stability, high wage growth may not even make workers better off. Taking home more dollars doesn’t do much good if your budget is stretched thinner and thinner.\n\nThis complex environment calls for watching the data closely, interpreting the data carefully and remaining flexible.\n\nI recognize the arguments that if we tighten monetary policy too much or too fast, we risk seeing the labor market weaken more than is necessary to control inflation. Those job losses would be very costly, particularly for lower-income households.\n\nI am also attentive to the potential for nonlinear and unexpected deterioration in financial conditions. We are still learning how much the stresses at some banks will affect lending and economic growth in the aggregate. The Dallas Fed’s latest Banking Conditions Survey, which was released on Monday, found that 48 percent of responding bankers tightened credit standards and terms over the preceding six weeks. That’s the most since we started the survey in 2017. But it is not a huge surprise. Bankers have been telling us since last fall that higher interest rates are causing credit conditions to tighten. And, even now, they say the main reason for the latest tightening is restrictive monetary policy, not stress in the banking system.\n\nAnalytical models that try to calculate the incremental effect of banking stresses predict only a modest further drag on the economy. Most calculations so far suggest an effect comparable to raising the federal funds rate by 25 or 50 basis points. And it’s worth noting that other aspects of financial conditions have eased since March. Still, the estimates from these models are highly uncertain. We have to be prepared to respond to a range of outcomes.\n\nFiscal negotiations and geopolitics could slow the economy, too.\n\nBut all of these downside possibilities are risks, not likelihoods or certainties. And there are upside risks as well: The data could come in hotter than expected, or other lenders could substitute more for bank credit.\n\nMoreover, if the FOMC doesn’t stay committed to restoring price stability, the public could come to expect persistently high inflation. A self-fulfilling spiral of unanchored inflation expectations would require much larger rate increases to stop. Ultimately, that scenario would be worse for workers, households, businesses and banks than the costs of tighter monetary policy today.\n\nSo, even as we consider how best to manage the risks, they must not stop us from doing what’s necessary to achieve 2 percent inflation.\n\nConcluding remarks\nThe FOMC is committed to delivering a healthier economy, with maximum employment and stable prices. To me, because of the potential costs of unanchored expectations, the path to that goal runs through bringing inflation back to 2 percent in a sustainable and timely way. After raising the target range for the federal funds rate at each of the last 10 FOMC meetings, we have made some progress. The data in coming weeks could yet show that it is appropriate to skip a meeting. As of today, though, we aren’t there yet.\n\nThank you.\n\nNotes\n\n“Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank,” by Michael S.

    "text": "Thank you for the kind introduction. While preparing these remarks, I learned that the Money Marketeers organization was founded by Dr. Marcus Nadler, a gifted educator who challenged market participants to deepen their understanding of the forces that move markets, and that it was born out of a popular lecture series he regularly held at NYU. This spirit of continual learning is a core value at the Federal Reserve, and that has been particularly important in recent years as the Fed has been operating in a new monetary policy implementation regime.1\n\nI last had the pleasure of speaking about monetary policy implementation at this forum two years ago. At that time, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had yet to make a decision on what the long run operating regime would look like. Substantial progress has been made since then. My intention tonight is to share some thoughts on what the FOMC’s recent decisions could mean for the manner in which the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) implements policy. In particular, I would like to discuss the Federal Reserve’s ongoing process for learning about the banking system’s demand for reserves and money market dynamics more broadly. I will also outline how the Desk could supply reserves through open market operations as the Federal Reserve transitions from implementing policy in an ample-reserves regime driven by the asset side of the balance sheet to one driven by demand for liabilities.\n\nI will bring an operational perspective to these topics, given my position as head of the Desk and Deputy Manager of the Federal Reserve System Open Market Account. I should also say now that the views I express tonight are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAn Operational Framework for an Ample-Reserves Regime\n\nLet me begin by reviewing the FOMC’s recent decisions about the operating regime. In January, the FOMC communicated its intention to continue implementing policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the Federal Reserve’s administered rates and in which the active management of the supply of reserves is not required.2 This type of regime is often referred to as a “floor system” because the administered rates—including IOER (the rate of interest paid on excess reserves) and the ON RRP rate (the offered rate at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility)—place a floor under the rates at which banks and other market participants will lend.3 I’ve illustrated this framework in the stylized graphs showing the relationship between the interest rate and banks’ demand for reserves in Figure 1. Before the crisis, the Desk operated along the steep part of the demand curve to achieve its directive from the FOMC, whereas in an ample-reserves regime, like the one we’ve used in recent years, we operate along the flatter part of the curve.4\n\nOver the past decade, the Federal Reserve has learned a great deal about operating in the current regime, and during recent deliberations about the long-run implementation framework the FOMC highlighted several key benefits of the current regime as supporting its decision.5\n\nFirst, the ample-reserves regime has been very effective at controlling short-term interest rates because the Federal Reserve’s administered rates provide strong incentives in money markets. As shown in Figure 2, overnight interest rates moved in line with changes in these administered rates, even as the FOMC lifted rates from near zero in late 2015 to over 2 percent more recently. During this same period, there were sweeping changes in banks’ liquidity management practices and in money market fund regulation that transformed the structure of money markets, and the floor system proved resilient to those changes.6 Looking forward, this regime should provide stable interest rate control if unexpected situations arise in which large amounts of liquidity need to be added to relieve stress in the financial system or large-scale asset purchases are needed to provide macroeconomic stimulus because short-term rates are at their effective lower bound.7\n\nSecond, from an operational perspective, an ample-reserves regime achieves this effectiveness in a simple and efficient manner. For example, it reduces the need for active management of reserve supply because shocks to the supply of or demand for reserves can be absorbed without the need for sizable daily interventions by the central bank. In the U.S., the ability to accommodate variability in non-reserve liabilities is particularly important because those liabilities—such as the Treasury General Account (TGA), Foreign Repo Pool, and balances held by Designated Financial Market Utilities—provide benefits for the economy and the global financial system.8\n\nAlthough reserves will continue to be ample going forward, the level will be significantly lower than has prevailed in recent years. In March, the FOMC issued an updated “Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans” in which it stated that the longer-run level of reserves will be a level consistent with “efficient and effective” implementation of monetary policy.9 To support a smooth transition to the longer-run level of reserves, the FOMC also stated that the reduction in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings will slow this spring and then stop in September. When balance sheet runoff stops in September, the FOMC expects the level of reserves to be somewhat higher than necessary for efficient and effective monetary policy implementation. If so, the total balance sheet will be held constant for a time, and trend increases in non-reserve liabilities, such as those shown in Figure 3, will gradually reduce the average level of reserves until it reaches a level consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.\n\nAs Chair Powell noted in his January press conference, the level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy will be principally determined by financial institutions’ demand for reserves, and an additional buffer so that interest rate control continues to be exercised through administered rates.10 The stylized framework I showed earlier in Figure 1 illustrates that banks demand different levels of reserves depending on the prevailing levels of interest rates. However, for purposes of the discussion today, I will define the banking system’s demand for reserves as a level that is just to the right of the steeper portion of the demand curve, representing the lowest quantity of reserves that banks demand in aggregate at rates near IOER. This corresponds to the minimum level of reserves needed to continue operating in a floor system, and supplying reserves at or above this level would be consistent with a floor system.\n\nIn practice, assessing banks’ demand for reserves will be a continual process because the factors determining that demand are complex and may change over time. Federal Reserve staff survey banks, analyze vast amounts of data, and gather intelligence across the market to better understand this demand. Slowing the runoff in securities holdings this spring and stopping in September will reduce the pace of reserve decline, allowing this detailed assessment to adapt appropriately as reserves decline to levels that were last seen almost a decade ago. The behavior of money markets with this lower—albeit still ample—level of reserves will feed back into the Desk’s thinking about the design of operations. And being operationally flexible will allow the Desk to adapt to changing economic and market conditions, as well as to the FOMC’s assessment of the appropriate level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective implementation.\n\nThe Banking System’s Demand for Reserves in an Ample-Reserves Regime\n\nLet me take a step back and provide some observations on the banking system’s demand for reserves. Banks engage in a variety of activities that create uncertainty about their liquidity positions. These uncertainties include a risk that depositors will want their money back sooner than expected. To manage this liquidity risk, banks need access to cash, which can come from several sources, including reserves already held at the Federal Reserve, money borrowed either in the private market or from the Federal Reserve’s lending facilities, or proceeds from asset sales or maturities.\n\nReserves are the most reliable and safest source of liquidity because they are immediately available for payments and do not have a changing market value. Nevertheless, before the crisis, banks typically tried to minimize reserve balances because reserves earned zero interest, whereas other highly liquid assets, such as Treasury bills, earned a sizable positive yield. Given this high opportunity cost, demand for reserves was relatively close to reserve balance requirements prior to the crisis.11\n\nToday, reserves are less expensive to hold than they were before the crisis because the Federal Reserve now pays IOER, which is the principal tool used to control short-term interest rates.12 However, demand for reserves has also shifted in other important ways. In particular, there are new factors driving reserve demand, and that demand is, and will likely continue to be, much higher than it was before the crisis. To start, the crisis appropriately changed attitudes toward risk and increased focus on managing liquidity risk. The subsequent creation of a liquidity regulatory framework for larger banks reinforced the benefits of holding unencumbered liquid assets for both domestic and foreign banks. While these liquidity regulations do not themselves impose any specific requirements to hold central bank reserves, many banks now use internal models that also estimate the very short-term liquidity they need to hold in order to be prepared for a stress scenario.13 These models make assumptions about a bank’s reduced access to funding and ability to sell securities during earlier stages of a stressed period. The bank may therefore decide to hold a portion of its liquidity buffer as reserves on an ongoing basis as a precautionary measure. Through our outreach to banks, we also hear that some are more reluctant to borrow from the Federal Reserve than they were prior to the financial crisis. For some banks, this reluctance increases the precautionary demand for reserves to meet large intraday payment obligations and manage unexpected volatility in deposits.\n\nTo get a more systematic reading of the factors driving reserve demand as well as the size of this demand, the Federal Reserve conducted a Senior Financial Officer Survey (SFOS) in September 2018 and again this February.14 The respondents to the September 2018 survey held two thirds of all reserves and about 60 percent of assets in the banking system, and they encompassed a diverse set of business models, including foreign banks and domestic banks of different sizes.\n\nThe survey results revealed that a number of important sources of reserve demand are present. As shown in Figure 4, which presents September 2018 survey responses, the majority of both domestic and foreign banks cited internal liquidity stress tests and meeting intraday payment flows as important or very important drivers of reserve demand. In addition, meeting potential deposit outflows specifically was important or very important for almost three quarters of domestic banks, compared to around a third of foreign banks.15 In addition, it is worth highlighting the considerable variation in survey responses, which reinforces my earlier point that the pre-crisis framework in which all banks had similar reserve management strategies no longer applies. The diversity of drivers also highlights how demand for reserves could change if banks move from one strategy to another or refine an existing one over time.\n\nThe survey can also be used as an input for quantifying the banking system’s demand for reserves. The surveys asked each bank to report the level of reserves it would hold (at the prevailing constellation of rates) before taking active steps to maintain or increase its reserve balances.16 This lowest comfortable level of reserves, or “LCLoR,” corresponds, conceptually, to the part of a bank’s demand curve where the slope could start to steepen. In the September 2018 survey, total LCLoR of all the respondents was $617 billion, and extrapolating the survey responses to the banking system as a whole resulted in estimates of U.S. banking system demand for reserves ranging from $800 billion to $900 billion.17 When we surveyed banks again in February, those results yielded estimates in the same range. Figure 5 shows total LCLoRs for foreign respondents and domestic respondents, and the extrapolated demand for the rest of the banking system. As you can see, each group has considerable demand for reserves, although this demand is still well below current reserve levels and far below the peak reserve levels reached in 2014.\n\nTo connect this back to the stylized framework, in a world with perfect information and no financial market frictions, an estimate of aggregate reserve demand derived from summing and scaling the reported demand of individual institutions might correspond to a level just to the right of the steeper portion of the demand curve. However, there are reasons why the amount of reserves a central bank needs to supply to remain in a floor system could deviate from such an estimate. First, an estimate of demand for reserves is simply an estimate; the true amount could be higher or lower. Second, an individual bank’s demand curve could change over time, both for reasons specific to the bank and because of changes in the economic or market environment. Third, the banking system’s demand for reserves could be higher than the sum of each bank’s individual demand if reserves are not distributed efficiently. This scenario could occur if there are financial market frictions to redistributing reserves that result in some banks persistently holding a surplus of reserves above their LCLoR. For example, banks now suggest that they face higher balance sheet costs to lend in federal funds, making it possible that this market would not be as efficient at redistributing reserves late in the day as it was prior to the crisis.18\n\nIn practice, assessing the lowest level of reserves necessary to remain on the flat, or flatter, part of the demand curve will entail not only periodically conducting the SFOS in collaboration with the Board of Governors, but also broader monitoring and analytical efforts in order to continuously inform our assessment of the demand for reserves and reserve conditions. The Desk’s current assessment is that reserves remain ample overall. Transacted rates in the federal funds market are relatively stable, and the vast majority of trades are within the target range. Additional monitoring of bank microdata also suggests that reserves are well supplied.19\n\nLet me walk through some observations based on the Desk’s ongoing monitoring and analysis. Though rates transacted in the federal funds market are relatively stable, the EFFR has risen one basis point relative to IOER in recent weeks and is now above IOER. Since mid-March, overnight repo rates have generally traded above federal funds rates, providing an attractive investment opportunity for the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) that invest a portion of their liquidity portfolios in both markets. As the dominant lenders in the federal funds market, FHLBs may have been able to negotiate higher overnight lending rates with banks that regularly use federal funds to fund non-reserve assets or meet payments, and on occasion with banks that borrow to improve their Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR) by borrowing from government sponsored enterprises.20\n\nIn line with a slightly higher EFFR, the overall share of above-IOER borrowing in markets underlying the overnight bank funding rate has been growing somewhat, as shown in Figure 6, although a large majority of activity is still transacted within a couple of basis points of IOER. As long as these rates remain relatively stable and at modest spreads above IOER, we don't see this as indicating that reserves are not well supplied.\n\nIndeed, an examination of daily reserve levels of individual banks shows that currently most banks remain well above their reported LCLoRs, suggesting that reserves remain ample. In fact, some banks with surplus reserves have been redistributing these reserves by shifting the composition of their HQLA (high quality liquid assets) by lending in repo markets when rates are attractive, suggesting secured markets are providing a means to redistribute reserves.\n\nIf competition for reserves were to increase, we might expect to see a more meaningful day-to-day relationship between changes in the level of reserves and overnight rates. Figure 7 shows a scatterplot of daily changes in reserve balances against daily changes in the spread between EFFR and the IOER rate. There continues to be no discernable relationship.\n\nIn sum, a wide range of information contributes to the Federal Reserve’s assessment of reserve demand and reserve conditions. The Desk’s current view is that reserves remain ample and well above the level the banking system demands at rates near IOER at this time. Our assessment of reserve demand is likely to change over time as we continue learning, and could move higher or lower based on new information from analysis of data, surveys, and outreach.\n\nSupplying Reserves in an Ample-Reserves Regime\n\nI will now look ahead and turn to how the Desk could supply reserves through open market operations to maintain an ample-reserves regime. After balance sheet runoff ends in September, the average level of reserves will decline more slowly, although there will be some meaningful transitory swings in reserve levels because of normal variability in the Federal Reserve’s other liabilities. As the level of reserves declines, the Desk will monitor medium-term forecasts of reserves and other indicators of reserve conditions. At some point, the FOMC will decide that the system has reached a level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective implementation.\n\nOnce this determination has been made by the FOMC, the Desk will need to conduct outright purchases of Treasury securities to supply reserves in order to offset the general decline in reserves from trend growth in non-reserve liabilities and ensure that reserves remain ample.21 In this regard, these purchases will have the same purpose as they did prior to the financial crisis—expanding the size of the SOMA portfolio to accommodate growth in currency and other liabilities. However, the size of these purchases will likely be larger in nominal terms because the growth of non-reserve liabilities is larger. For example, in 2018, currency increased by almost $100 billion, as shown back in Figure 3, compared to average increases of $40 billion a year in the early 2000s before the crisis.\n\nThese purchases could also be structured in size and timing to supply a sufficient amount of reserves so that normal variability in non-reserve liabilities would not require predictable repo market operations to offset the corresponding reserve level changes.22 The size of this “buffer” of reserves would depend on the Desk’s forward-looking assessment of the expected volatility in non-reserve liabilities. A buffer of reserves executed through Treasury purchases would diminish the need for the Desk to conduct frequent, sizable repo operations, which might be difficult to implement given reduced elasticity of primary dealer balance sheets for tri-party repo in the post-crisis era.2 Nonetheless, even with this type of approach to managing a buffer, there might be some occasions in which unanticipated changes in reserve conditions would still require the Desk to conduct repo operations to maintain reserve levels or keep the effective federal funds rate in the target range consistent with the directive from the FOMC.\n\nLet me make the discussion of the buffer more concrete by focusing on the TGA. The TGA is an account the Federal Reserve provides to the U.S. Treasury which, similar to a checking account, allows Treasury to deposit or withdraw cash every day. When Treasury takes in cash (for example, tax receipts), money is withdrawn from a private bank account that in turn comes out of that bank’s reserves holdings. So, when the TGA increases—and assuming there are no other changes on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet—this corresponds to a decrease in the level of reserves. Figure 8 shows a scatterplot of weekly changes in the TGA against weekly changes in reserves over the past two years. There have been times when the TGA has increased by around $100 billion over the course of a week and there has been a similarly large decline in reserves.24 Figure 9 shows the distribution of weekly changes across all non-reserve liabilities. These changes have grown since the crisis and last year were as large as $100 billion. Managing a buffer of reserves above the banking system’s demand for reserves would help absorb these fluctuations in non-reserve liabilities.\n\nAs the level of reserves falls, the Federal Reserve will continue to learn and enhance its thinking about an efficient approach to open market operations that could incorporate both the trend growth and transitory volatility in non-reserve liabilities to maintain the excellent interest rate control experienced with higher levels of reserves.\n\nWhile my discussion tonight has focused on the structure of open market operations from the perspective of supplying sufficient reserves in an ample-reserves regime, the FOMC also announced in its March Principles and Plans that the Desk will be conducting Treasury purchases in the secondary market to reinvest mortgage-backed securities (MBS) principal payments starting in October (subject to a maximum of $20 billion per month). The size of these purchases will vary over time based upon MBS prepayments. Of course, these purchases will be altering the composition but not the overall size of the System Open Market Account portfolio and Federal Reserve balance sheet. At least initially, the FOMC will direct the Desk to conduct these MBS reinvestment purchases across a range of Treasury maturities to roughly match the maturity composition of securities outstanding. The Desk will provide more details on these operations in May.25\n\nClosing Thoughts on Continually Learning and Remaining Flexible\n\nIn conclusion, the FOMC made an important decision in January to continue to implement policy in an ample-reserves regime. Whereas the size of the balance sheet and the level of reserves have, for many years, been driven by Federal Reserve asset policies, at some point they will be determined by the demand for Federal Reserve liabilities, taking into account both the banking system’s demand for reserves and volatility in non-reserve liabilities.\n\nThrough outreach, surveys, and regular monitoring we have increased our understanding of the banking system’s demand for reserves. This learning is ongoing, and we expect the factors driving reserve demand to evolve over time. The Desk’s current assessment is that reserves are ample, and we will continue to monitor conditions closely to further enhance our understanding of reserve conditions and reserve demand.26\n\nLooking ahead, after balance sheet runoff ends in September, average reserve levels will likely continue to gradually decline. When the FOMC judges that reserves have reached a level consistent with efficient and effective implementation, the Desk will begin to execute gradual and mechanical purchases of Treasury securities in order to ensure that reserves remain ample. The size of these purchases will need to be larger than similar pre-crisis operations simply because trend growth in non-reserve liabilities is larger in nominal terms, and because proceeds from maturing MBS also will be reinvested.\n\nThese are unprecedented times, so active learning and maintaining operational flexibility will continue to be core principles that guide the implementation of monetary policy. The ample-reserves operating framework I have described today has auxiliary mechanisms, such as an ongoing process for assessing reserve demand, that allow for flexibility and adaptation for continued successful control of interest rates going forward.\n\nThank you. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\nFigures PDF\n\n\n1 I would like to thank Marcus Petersen, Jacqueline Yen, and Patricia Zobel for their assistance in preparing these remarks, Ashley Rhodes for her assistance with data, and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for valuable comments and suggestions.\n\n2 See Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, January 30, 2019.\n\n3 The Federal Reserve Banks pay interest on required reserve balances (IORR) and on excess reserve balances (IOER) under authority in Section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act. The Board of Governors has prescribed rules governing the payment of interest by Federal Reserve Banks in Regulation D. Since 2008, these two rates have been set at the same value.\n\n4 For a review of these frameworks please see Monetary Policy 101: A Primer on the Fed’s Changing Approach to Policy Implementation, Jane E.

The magnitude of these non-reserve liabilities as well as the flows affecting their variability is not closely related to monetary policy decisions. Many of the Federal Reserve’s liabilities arise from statutory responsibilities, such as supplying currency and serving as the U.S. Treasury’s fiscal agent. Each liability provides social benefits to the economy and plays an important role as a safe and liquid asset for the public, the banking system, the U.S. government, or other institutions. For further information, please see the box “The Role of Liabilities in Determining the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet” in Part 2 of the Monetary Policy Report submitted to the Congress on February 22, 2019, pursuant to section 2B of the Federal Reserve Act and “Explaining Changes in the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet”, Box 3, Open Market Operations During 2018 Report, April 2019.\n\n9  See the FOMC’s Communications related to Policy Normalization.

Reserve requirements are calculated as a proportion of an institution’s transaction deposits during a 14-day computation period. Institutions satisfy their requirement by maintaining an average level of vault cash or balances in their account at a Federal Reserve Bank equal to the reserve requirement over a lagged, two-week maintenance period. The portion of the reserve requirement that is not satisfied by vault cash is called the reserve balance requirement.\n\n12 For further information, please see the box “Interest on Reserves and Its Importance for Monetary Policy” in Part 2 of the Monetary Policy Report submitted to the Congress on July 13, 2018, pursuant to section 2B of the Federal Reserve Act.\n\n13 See Randal K.

Quarles (2018), Liquidity Regulation and the Size of the Fed's Balance Sheet, remarks at \"Currencies, Capital, and Central Bank Balances: A Policy Conference,\" a Hoover Institution Monetary Policy Conference, Stanford University, Stanford, Calif., May 4, 2018.\n\n14 The Board of Governors, under delegated authority from the Office of Management and Budget, is authorized to conduct the Senior Financial Officer Surveys. The survey was conducted jointly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in September 2018 and for the second time in February 2019. The purpose of the surveys was to gather views systematically from a number of banks concerning their reserve balance management strategies and practices. Survey questions asked senior financial officers from each responding bank to identify the approximate lowest level of their institutions’ reserve balances that they would feel comfortable holding before taking actions to increase their reserve balance levels. The surveys also asked about the various factors that drive this determination, how a shift in short-term interest rates would change this level, and the likelihood of choosing different liabilities to rebuild a reserve position. The surveys are voluntary. All answers are used solely for internal analytical, not supervisory, purposes.\n\n15 The exact question respondents were asked was “Please rate the importance to your bank of the following considerations in determining the amount you indicated in question 1 on a scale of 1 (not important), 2 (somewhat important), 3 (important), or 4 (very important), or, if the factor is not applicable to your bank (for example, your bank is not subject to the regulatory requirement or does not engage in the described activity), please select ‘N/A.’” Factors included: a) Meeting routine intraday payment flows, b) Meeting potential deposit outflows, c) Satisfying internal liquidity stress metrics, d) Satisfying the bank’s reserve requirements, e) Seeking to earn the IOER rate instead of the return on other high-quality liquid assets, f) Managing liquidity portfolio based on monetization assumptions for high-quality liquid assets. For further information, see the September 2018 Senior Financial Officer Survey results.\n\n16 The exact question respondents were asked was “Given the constellation of short-term interest rates relative to the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate over the past month, what is the approximate lowest dollar level of reserve balances that your bank would be comfortable holding before it began taking active steps to maintain or increase its reserve balance position?” For further information, see the September 2018 Senior Financial Officer Survey results.\n\n17 For additional detail on how these estimates were constructed see Thomas Keating, et al. (2019). Estimating System Demand for Reserve Balances Using the 2018 Senior Financial Officer Survey, FEDS Notes. Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April 9, 2019.\n\n18 These balance sheet costs can manifest themselves in less federal funds activity later in the day at rates near IOER. Prior to the crisis the federal funds market was liquid until late in the day. Banks could experience unanticipated late day outflows and still be confident in their ability to borrow from other banks holding excess reserves. Today, there is little late day activity in the federal funds market. As reserves decline and there is greater need to redistribute reserves, it is unclear if this activity will return as the opportunity cost of holding reserves is now lower. In the post-crisis era of super abundant reserves, bank lenders have largely left the federal funds market and today almost all lending is done by the Federal Home Loan Banks. In Desk outreach and the SFOS responses, many banks have indicated that rates would need to be well above IOER before the economics would be attractive enough to offset balance sheet costs that lending in the federal funds market incurs.\n\n19 For an overview of bank microdata collected by the Federal Reserve see the Micro Data Reference Manual.\n\n20 Borrowing in overnight unsecured markets from public-sector entities (such as the FHLBs), foreign central banks, and nonfinancial corporations and—all else equal—keeping those funds as reserves in a bank’s Federal Reserve account improves the bank’s LCR ratio. For a full description of the U.S. LCR, including which banks are covered, see Regulation WW--Liquidity Risk Management Standards, 12 C.F.R. pt. 249 (2017).\n\n21 Purchases of Treasury securities increase the quantity of reserve balances in the banking system; sales or maturities of Treasury securities reduce those balances. These transactions, which are conducted by the New York Fed's Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk), are executed with primary dealers. Repo transactions temporarily increase the quantity of reserve balances in the banking system. In a repo transaction, the Desk purchases Treasury, agency debt, or agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) from a counterparty subject to an agreement to resell the securities at a later date. It is economically similar to a loan collateralized by securities having a value higher than the loan to protect the Desk against market and credit risk.\n\n22 I discuss these issues related to non-reserve liabilities in more detail in Operational Perspectives on Monetary Policy Implementation: Panel Remarks on \"The Future of the Central Bank Balance Sheet\" remarks at the Policy Conference on Currencies, Capital, and Central Bank Balances, Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, May 4, 2018 and Implementing Monetary Policy: Perspective from the Open Market Trading Desk, remarks before the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York City, May 18, 2017.\n\n23 See BIS Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) Paper No. 59, Repo Market Functioning, April 2017.\n\n24 The relationship is not one-to-one because typically there are other changes to the balance sheet that also impact the level of reserves.\n\n25 See Statement Regarding Reinvestment in Treasury Securities and Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, March 20, 2019.\n\n26 See discussion in Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 19-20, 2019."

    "text": "Dallas Fed President Lorie K. Logan delivered these remarks at an event for the Greater Waco Chamber of Commerce.\nThank you, Matthew [Meadors]. I’m excited to be here with you all, and I look forward to seeing the area’s continued success.\n\nI have the privilege of leading the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. The Dallas Fed serves all of you, and people throughout Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico, by promoting a strong economy and financial system for everyone. Before we dive into today’s conversation, I’d like to start with some background on the work we do at the Fed, why that work matters for you, and how I’m thinking about the economy right now. I’ll note that, as always, these are my views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, make up the Federal Reserve System. We are the nation’s central bank, and we perform five functions to support a strong economy for everyone in the United States:\n\nWe supervise banks to ensure they are safe and sound.\nWe promote the stability of the financial system as a whole.\nWe operate parts of the payments system, which lets you get cash from your bank or send money electronically to pay a bill.\nWe promote consumer protection and community development.\nAnd we carry out monetary policy to pursue two goals established by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices.\nRelative to other public institutions, the Federal Reserve has two aspects of its structure that are unique and crucial to how we serve you. The Fed is not one centralized organization but rather a federated system with deep local roots. And in our monetary policy responsibilities, the Fed operates independently while remaining accountable to the public through elected leaders.\n\nLet me say more about each of those unique characteristics.\n\nAs I mentioned, the Federal Reserve System has 12 regional reserve banks, the one I lead in Dallas and 11 others, that serve districts around the United States. Our network of operations gives us insight into communities’ unique economic circumstances. And in our country’s wonderfully varied economy, those local insights help us make the best decisions to serve the country as a whole.\n\nBut it’s more than that. The 12 reserve banks are not just branch offices of a centralized agency. Each reserve bank is a separate corporation with its own board of directors. Our directors represent the public in the district, including the interests of agriculture, business, workers, consumers and banks. Directors share their perspectives with us on conditions in the district, but just as important, they hold us accountable for serving the district well. This governance gives the public of our region a say—a strong say—in how we do our work, in addition to the oversight provided by the Board of Governors in Washington.\n\nTo be clear, in most of our work, the Federal Reserve ultimately must act in a unified way to best serve the country as a whole. For example, in monetary policy, we have to set the same interest rate target for Texas as for Tennessee. And in bank supervision, we can’t be any more or less stringent when we examine banks in Dallas than we are in Denver.\n\nBut our local roots and structure keep us accountable for ensuring your voices and concerns are heard in reaching those national decisions and for delivering services effectively and efficiently to the people, banks and businesses of this region.\n\nI’m very proud of the work the people of the Dallas Fed do to hear your voices and gather your insights. Our network of branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso gives us a foundation to reach communities throughout the region. Each branch has a board of directors that, like the board of the head office in Dallas, keeps us accountable to the local community and updated on how the economy is evolving.\n\nIn 2024, our team also hosted dozens of business and community roundtables, conducted more than 800 formal outreach calls with leaders in the district, and spoke at more than 200 regional events. This two-way dialogue with people throughout the region keeps the information flowing as we work to serve you.\n\nAnd, we gather information systematically through our Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey, Texas Service Sector Outlook Survey, Texas Retail Outlook Survey, Energy Survey, Agricultural Survey and Banking Conditions Survey. More than a thousand business and banking executives in the region respond to these monthly and quarterly surveys, giving us a picture of economic trends that enriches the official national statistics. We share all the survey findings on our website so businesses and local leaders can use the results to inform their own decisions. In fact, the data are so useful they regularly get coverage from the national media, and the surveys even got a mention on Saturday Night Live.\n\nI hope those of you who lead businesses and banks are already responding to our surveys. If not, we’d welcome you to sign up by visiting dallasfed.org.\n\nSo what do we do with all that information? It informs how we carry out all our work, but it’s especially important for monetary policy, which brings me to the Fed’s second unique characteristic, monetary policy independence.\n\nMonetary policy means adjusting interest rates to influence the macroeconomy. As assigned by Congress, the Fed works to achieve both maximum employment and stable prices, meaning a 2 percent inflation rate. When we raise interest rates, that tends to slow the economy, typically reducing both inflation and employment. And when we lower interest rates, that tends to stimulate the economy, typically increasing both inflation and employment.\n\nDeciding what to do is easier at some times than others. When inflation is too high and the labor market is overheated, as was the case a few years ago, or when inflation is too low and the labor market is weak, as happened after the Global Financial Crisis, it’s clear which way we need to move rates to achieve our goals. At other times, inflation and employment can miss our goals in opposite directions, and then we take a balanced approach to setting policy. Regardless, the effects of rate changes take time to play out. So to get the balance right, we always have to think about where the economy is headed, not just where it is now. Regional and local insights are very helpful in that process because they’re timely and help us understand the nuances and reasons behind what we can see in national data.\n\nWe make monetary policy to do the best job for the country over time, in the long term, not just for the moment. This is incredibly important. In the short run, a central bank could always juice employment by cutting interest rates. People might enjoy that for a little while. But over time, excessive rate cuts would trigger a spiral of inflation. And those rising prices would wipe out whatever temporary benefits people experienced from a hot labor market. To have a sustainably strong economy, a central bank has to make decisions with the long run in mind.\n\nCongress designed the Federal Reserve System to promote that long-term focus while maintaining ultimate accountability to the public. Members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to serve 14-year terms. Reserve bank presidents, like me, are appointed to five-year terms by our local boards of directors, with approval by the Board of Governors. All of us serve together on the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, which meets every six to seven weeks to set monetary policy. The long terms for these roles allow us to think about which policies will best serve the country over time.\n\nBut while the Fed’s leaders aren’t up for election, we remain accountable to the public for achieving our assigned monetary policy goals. That accountability comes through the Fed chair’s regular, semiannual testimony to Congress; our extensive public dialogue and communications, which provide transparency into how we serve the public; and ultimately through the regular turnover of governors and reserve bank presidents as terms are completed and new leaders are appointed.\n\nResearch shows that central banks perform better on inflation when they are independent from short-term political considerations. The pattern is clear around the world and over history. And in my experience, the Fed’s combination of independence and accountability enables us to make thoughtful, objective, technical decisions while keeping the public interest at the center of all we do.\n\nNow that I’ve described how the Fed’s local roots and accountable independence help us make monetary policy to serve the nation most effectively for the long run, let me share my thinking on monetary policy in the current moment.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Congress has assigned the FOMC to pursue two goals in monetary policy: maximum employment and stable prices. At present, the labor market is strong, with unemployment hovering just above 4 percent for most of the past year. Inflation has fallen significantly from the postpandemic peak but remains somewhat above our 2 percent goal.\n\nBecause monetary policy takes time to influence the economy, though, the question isn’t just where the economy is today but also where it’s headed. Such forecasts are never certain. And the wide array of ongoing changes in federal policies makes the current outlook even more difficult to pinpoint.\n\nBut just as all of you must make decisions every day to lead your organizations without knowing the future for certain, my job as a policymaker is to make the best monetary policy decisions I can in light of the current data and the uncertainty we face. When I look ahead, I see a balance of risks. Tariffs could push up inflation, at least temporarily. And if expectations of higher inflation became entrenched, inflationary pressures could persist and become very costly to reverse. Stimulative federal fiscal policy or changes in regulations could also boost investment and consumer demand. On the other hand, economic uncertainty and financial market volatility could prompt consumers and businesses to pull back, slowing the economy. And tariffs could weigh on employment in sectors that rely heavily on imported materials.\n\nFor now, with the labor market holding strong, inflation trending gradually back to target, and risks to the FOMC’s objectives roughly balanced, I believe monetary policy is in a good place. It could take quite some time to know whether the balance of risks is shifting in one direction or another. But if the balance shifts, we’ll be well prepared to respond.\n\nThat’s an overview of how I’m thinking about the national economy, but many factors go into my outlook, so I’d be happy to take your questions."

    "text": "It is an honor to participate in this conference commemorating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Banco de México. Gov. [Victoria] Rodriguez Ceja, thank you very much for inviting me. Let me note at the outset that the views I share are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Banco de México is a leader in the global central banking community. In 1994, the bank gained policy independence, which strengthened its ability to contain inflation. For the people of Mexico, that outcome has supported economic and financial stability. And for the world, it’s provided a strong example of the value of independent, objective monetary policymaking.\n\nThe bank’s thought leadership receives worldwide recognition. Banxico is a driving force behind both CEMLA, the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies, and the Bank for International Settlements Representative Office for the Americas, both based here in Mexico City.\n\nI greatly appreciate the warm relationship between Banxico and the Dallas Fed. The economic ties between Mexico and the Eleventh Federal Reserve District are deep and longstanding. Our two banks co-host an annual conference on international economics, along with the University of Houston. And I and our entire research and leadership teams learn a great deal from the ongoing dialogue between our institutions.\n\nIt is a true pleasure to celebrate your centennial with you here today and to have the opportunity to discuss the challenges of monetary policy implementation after the pandemic. This is an excellent topic for a centennial conference examining the most crucial questions in central banking. Implementing a central bank’s monetary policy efficiently and effectively is vital to the credibility of that policy and to public trust in the central bank. Yet there is no obvious single right way to implement policy. Every central bank’s operating framework reflects its history, its unique institutional context and the market environment it faces. And we learn over time. In light of both the extraordinary policy implementation actions many central banks undertook in response to the pandemic, and the changes in financial markets in recent years, now is a fitting time to take stock.\n\nBalance sheet normalization\nIn my view, a key current challenge of monetary policy implementation is how to return central bank balance sheets to more normal sizes and compositions following the expansions undertaken in response to the pandemic. I’ll focus my discussion on G7 central banks such as the Fed, European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of England (BoE) and Bank of Canada (BoC), which have similar approaches to monetary policy implementation and operate in broadly similar financial systems. But the challenge of balance sheet normalization applies much more broadly, as central banks across a wide range of economies expanded their balance sheets earlier this decade. I hope our conversation today will tackle approaches to normalization around the world.\n\nNormalization affects both sides of a central bank’s balance sheet. Let’s start with liabilities.\n\nMost central banks’ main liabilities are currency and bank reserves. Currency demand moves slowly, so shrinking the balance sheet typically involves reducing the quantity of reserves. The trick is how to do so without creating undue upward movement in overnight interest rates, which are the price of reserves.\n\nThe Fed, ECB, BoE and BoC all pay interest on reserves, and all intend to operate in the long run in a framework in which money market rates are close to the interest rate on reserves. That arrangement implements what’s known as the Friedman rule, because it minimizes banks’ opportunity cost of holding reserves. As I’ve argued elsewhere, following the Friedman rule enhances the efficiency of the banking and payments systems and supports both financial stability and effective rate control. I will refer to this type of arrangement as a regime of ample reserves. I want to emphasize that I’m intentionally not calling it a floor system, even though market rates will typically be close to the floor established by the interest rate on reserves. The central banks I’ve mentioned all also maintain lending or funding facilities that help put a ceiling on rates, such as, in the United States, the discount window and the Standing Repo Facility (SRF). Ceiling tools can play an important role in policy implementation both during and after balance sheet normalization. What defines these systems is a supply of reserves ample enough to keep market rates near interest on reserves—not that rates are necessarily pushed to the floor.\n\nTo keep money market rates close to interest on reserves, the central bank must supply at least as many reserves as commercial banks demand with that configuration of rates. Otherwise, money market rates will rise above the central bank’s policy target.\n\nThat sounds simple, but it raises several questions. How should the central bank supply the reserves? How should the central bank know how many reserves to supply? And what do we even mean by the quantity of reserves that commercial banks demand?\n\nThe last question holds the key to the other two.\n\nOn any given day, any given commercial bank has some quantity of reserves it would like to hold as a function of the spread between market interest rates and interest on reserves. When market rates rise, the bank will want to hold fewer reserves and invest more in market instruments. But a bank has limited options for adjusting its reserve holdings on any given day. It must maintain enough reserves to manage whatever liquidity risks are inherent in its current business model. If it has more than enough reserves for its liquidity needs, it could sell or lend funds to another market participant, but some of those reserves might boomerang back in the form of deposits.\n\nThe bank has more options for reducing its reserve demand in the long run. It can cut the interest rates it pays on deposits, so some depositors may take their funds elsewhere. And it can reconfigure its business to require less liquidity.\n\nMoreover, there can be distributional frictions in the banking system. When reserves drop sharply on a single day, the banks that initially lose reserves aren’t necessarily those that value reserves the least. Until the reserves redistribute, there’s a temporary increase in aggregate reserve demand.\n\nBottom line: as aggregate reserve levels come down, commercial banks’ short-run demand for reserves will likely be higher and less responsive to interest rate spreads than the long-run demand. When a central bank seeks to meet commercial banks’ demand for reserves, it must decide whether that means the short-run demand or the likely lower long-run demand.\n\nIn my view, it is preferable to aim in the long run to meet the long-run demand. Otherwise, there can be a ratchet effect.\n\nSince the Global Financial Crisis, central banks have repeatedly bought assets to support financial stability or stimulate the economy when overnight rates were at the effective lower bound. Particularly when stimulus is the goal, those newly acquired assets need to stay on the central bank balance sheet for some time to generate the intended benefits. But the additional reserves that fund the assets also stick around for some time. Those additional reserves tend to push market rates meaningfully below the interest rate on reserves, creating an environment where reserves are more than ample—perhaps abundant or super-abundant. And commercial banks can get used to that environment. They find it profitable to expand their deposit bases or develop business models that rely on abundant liquidity. The short-run demand curve for reserves shifts outward. Unless the central bank finds a way to return to the old long-run demand for reserves, the elevated short-run demand will become the new long-run demand. And instead of the balance sheet expansion being a temporary response to economic or financial stress, it will become permanent. Repeat that over multiple stress episodes, and you’d have a recipe for ever-expanding central bank balance sheets and no route back to normal.\n\nTo get back to the long-run demand curve for reserves, central banks need to bring the average level of market rates up closer to interest on reserves in a sustained way. That will give commercial banks an incentive to make the long-term adjustments that can bring reserve demand down. Importantly, market rates can fluctuate from day to day. U.S. repo rates, for example, have recently varied in a range of 10 or so basis points. So, moving the average level up closer to interest on reserves also requires some tolerance for temporary, modest moves above interest on reserves.\n\nWith a sustained shift up in market rates as the goal, there are two basic ways a central bank can identify how far to reduce reserves: ceiling tools and glide paths.\n\nIf the central bank has confidence that market participants are willing and able to access its ceiling tools, it can simply reduce reserves until the point that ceiling tools see routine use. This is basically the approach that I interpret the ECB and BoE to be following. If the economic cost of funding from the ceiling tools modestly exceeds the interest rate on reserves, banks will have an incentive to bring reserve demand back down to the long-run level. The spread between interest on reserves and the cost of funds from ceiling tools can come either from a spread between official interest rates or from other costs such as collateral haircuts.\n\nLet me emphasize two necessary conditions for this approach to maintain rate control. Market participants must be willing and able to access the ceiling tools when market rates exceed the ceiling tool rates. If ceiling tools are stigmatized or operationally difficult to access, market rates could spike too high. Additionally, the ceiling rates must not exceed interest on reserves by too much. Otherwise, market rates will have too much room to rise before firms will borrow from the ceiling tools.\n\nA complementary strategy is for the central bank to come in for a gradual landing on reserves: a glide path. By laying out a smooth path to lower reserve levels, the central bank gives market participants time to adjust to an environment of lower reserves. Along that path, ceiling tools can still contribute to rate control. And, to reach the long-run level of reserve demand, the central bank must still have some tolerance for modest, temporary rate pressures that can occur as the average level of rates moves toward interest on reserves and creates an incentive for banks to shed reserves. But the evolution of money market rates will provide important signals about when reserves are approaching the right level. The Fed and Bank of Canada have both employed what I see as variants of this strategy, and it is working well.\n\nThe glide path does not rely as much as the first strategy on confidence in the efficacy of ceiling tools. At the Fed, while we have made strides in enhancing the effectiveness of the discount window and Standing Repo Facility, it would be worthwhile to consider further steps, such as increasing or removing limits on the SRF’s size or centrally clearing those transactions. So, I believe bringing reserves down gradually, while also making our ceiling tools available and encouraging market participants to use them when they are economically attractive, will be an effective strategy in the United States.\n\nIn the U.S., repo rates have averaged about 8 basis points below interest on reserves in recent months. That tells me we have more room to reduce reserves. We could see some temporary pressure around the tax date and quarter-end in September. I was encouraged to see market participants using the SRF over the June quarter-end, and I anticipate they will similarly use our ceiling tools if necessary in September. That will allow us to continue gradually bringing reserves to a more efficient level with market rates close to, but perhaps slightly below, interest on reserves on average over time.\n\nLong-run reserve supply\nOnce the central bank completes the normalization process and reaches the long-run level of reserves, it must decide how to supply reserves in steady state. What fraction of reserves should be backed by outright asset holdings, and what fraction should come from ceiling tools? The Friedman rule doesn’t answer this question, because either approach can, in principle, keep market rates close to interest on reserves. Rather, one might turn to considerations of footprint and rate control.\n\nIt’s often asserted that a central bank should avoid having too large a footprint in financial markets. At a high level, that makes sense to me. A market economy should rely mainly on private-sector activity. But what does footprint mean? One view is that a central bank’s footprint relates to the volume of its transactions with the private sector or the number of counterparties it transacts with. In that case, the central bank can minimize its footprint by backing reserves with relatively stable outright holdings of government securities, while making relatively few loans to market participants through its ceiling tools and conducting relatively few operations to offset changes in autonomous factors that add or drain reserves. But another view is that a central bank’s footprint relates to the size of its balance sheet. If a central bank wants to minimize transactions and loans through ceiling tools, it will need to supply a buffer of extra reserves to account for uncertainty in estimates of reserve demand and absorb variability in autonomous factors. So, if you think footprint relates to balance sheet size, the central bank should supply more reserves through ceiling tools (potentially to a broader range of direct counterparties) and temporary operations and less from outright holdings.\n\nHow best to define footprint depends on a country’s economic, financial and institutional context. I don’t think there are universal answers that apply to all central banks. Forums like this one present valuable opportunities to learn from each other.\n\nRate control is a second consideration. Just as in the balance sheet normalization process, a central bank can support rate control in the long run both by offering ceiling tools and by smoothly providing enough outright reserves to reliably meet banks’ demand. If market participants are willing and able to access ceiling tools, and if the spread between interest on reserves and lending rates is not too wide, the ceiling tools will effectively cap money market rates. If the central bank prefers a wider rate spread, or if there are concerns about the usability of ceiling tools, it becomes more important to smooth reserve supply. That can require forecasting large swings in autonomous factors that add or drain reserves and preplanning purchase operations to offset them, as described in a 2019 staff memo to the FOMC. I don’t view such operations as fine-tuning reserve supply to control money market rates the way the Fed did before the Global Financial Crisis. They simply ensure a smooth and ample supply of reserves that provides a predictable operating environment for banks.\n\nEven if the aggregate supply of reserves is stable, payment shocks can shift substantial amounts of reserves from one bank to another on any given day. Unless the banking system efficiently redistributes reserves among banks, those shocks can temporarily raise the aggregate demand for reserves, because some reserves will be trapped at banks that don’t particularly value them. A central bank could reduce the long-run demand for reserves and enhance rate control by providing ceiling tools that help redistribute reserves. For example, if the central bank held a daily auction of a fixed quantity of discount window loans, those reserves would naturally flow to the banks that value them most.\n\nAssets\nLet me conclude by briefly discussing the asset side of the balance sheet. I’ve already mentioned some trade-offs between backing reserves with outright asset holdings versus loans through ceiling tools. For whatever part of its balance sheet consists of outright assets, a central bank faces additional choices about which assets to hold. While the details of these choices will necessarily depend on the specifics of a central bank’s institutional structure and market environment, a couple of principles seem to me to be relevant more universally.\n\nFirst, I believe a central bank’s outright asset holdings should primarily comprise whatever serves as the reference asset class in its economy. In that way, the central bank’s holdings will primarily influence broad, baseline financial conditions, rather than spreads between different markets. Treasury securities are the reference asset class in the United States. The Treasury yield curve is an economy-wide benchmark, and the market for Treasuries is as deep and liquid as they come. So it makes sense for the FOMC to hold primarily Treasuries in the long run, as we’ve repeatedly said we intend to do. (Currently, on a par basis, the Fed’s securities holdings consist of about 63 percent long-term Treasury securities, 3 percent Treasury bills and 34 percent agency mortgage-backed securities that are effectively guaranteed by the U.S. government.) In economies where the supply of government debt is smaller, or for a multinational central bank like the ECB, the reference asset could be different.\n\nA second principle is that, in selecting its core asset holdings, a central bank should respect the boundary between fiscal policy and monetary policy. The nature of that boundary varies across institutions, and the relevant considerations will also depend on what type of assets the central bank primarily holds. For the Fed, the question here is which Treasury securities to hold—in particular, which durations.\n\nThe Fed remits its net income to the Treasury. From an income perspective, while our choice about which Treasury securities to hold as assets can change our remittances, it’s a wash for taxpayers because the interest income we receive on Treasury holdings represents an interest expense for the Treasury Department.\n\nHowever, to the extent that Treasury doesn’t adjust its issuance to offset the Fed’s holdings, changes in the maturity composition of the Fed’s assets can change the maturity structure of the consolidated public debt. In turn, that maturity structure influences the amount of duration risk that taxpayers bear from potential interest rate fluctuations on government debt. In my view, and as I’ve said before, the maturity structure of the consolidated government debt in the U.S. is a choice for the Treasury Department, not the Fed. There are many conceivable ways to maintain that division of responsibilities. But a simple and easily communicated one would be for the Fed, in the long run, to simply make its asset purchases proportional to Treasury issuance. In the medium term, overweighting Treasury bills in our purchases could more expeditiously move our current mix of holdings closer to matching the market. The FOMC has made no decisions on the long-run composition of its Treasury holdings, and I look forward to continuing to discuss this topic with my colleagues.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks."

    "text": "I’m grateful to Anil Kashyap for inviting me to participate in this U.S. Monetary Policy Forum and to discuss this year’s paper by a distinguished set of authors on a very timely topic. The paper assesses the recent experience with quantitative tightening (QT) across seven advanced economies. After cataloging central banks’ QT strategies, the paper assesses the effects of QT on asset markets and money markets across several dimensions—including prices, liquidity and portfolio holdings of different types of market participants. There’s a wealth of valuable information here. I highly recommend reading the entire paper.\n\nI’ll focus on a few aspects that I see as particularly relevant to policy decisions facing the Federal Reserve in coming months and years. As always, these remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nA central theme of the paper is that the effects of quantitative easing (QE) and QT appear asymmetric. For example, while QT announcements tend to increase government bond yields, the effect as measured in this paper is significantly smaller in magnitude than the typical decrease in yields associated with QE announcements. And while large-scale asset purchases have at times contributed to dramatic improvements in market functioning during stress episodes, QT episodes do not appear to have significantly reduced the liquidity of government bonds.\n\nThe paper mainly emphasizes an asymmetry in magnitude: by and large, the effects of QE as measured in the simple framework of this paper are notably larger than those of QT. This finding aligns with my own perspective on what we’ve seen in markets. Today, I’ll lay out the framework that I use to think about the effects of QE and QT. I’ll then draw on that framework to consider why the magnitudes of QE and QT effects as measured here are so different and how what we measure relates to the underlying mechanisms. Finally, I’ll turn to a second asymmetry, between effects on asset markets and funding markets, that’s important for understanding the path forward on QT in the United States.\n\nFramework\nResearch and practical experience suggest that changes in central bank asset holdings influence financial conditions through a variety of mechanisms. For purposes of today’s discussion, I’ll categorize those mechanisms into three broad channels: portfolio balance, signaling and liquidity.[1] For each channel, we can distinguish announcement effects, which happen when the central bank communicates a plan to change its asset holdings, from implementation effects, which happen when the asset holdings actually change.\n\nWhen the central bank holds more of a given asset, private sector portfolios hold less of that asset, all else equal. To the extent that assets are not perfect substitutes, for example because they embody different risks or serve different purposes in investors’ portfolios, asset prices must move to induce private sector investors to change their holdings. The most prominent example of this portfolio balance channel is the duration risk effect. If the central bank holds more duration risk by acquiring long-term securities, term premiums are likely to fall, all else equal. Conversely, if the central bank reduces its holdings of duration risk, term premiums are likely to rise. Because financial markets are forward looking, the portfolio-balance channel operates mostly through announcement effects, as formal statements or informal communications shift market expectations about upcoming changes in the central bank’s assets. However, the portfolio-balance channel can also have implementation effects, as prices may adjust when the central bank actually changes its holdings to induce market participants to change their holdings at that time.\n\nSecond is the signaling channel, which fundamentally operates through announcement effects. For instance, when the policy rate is at the effective lower bound (ELB), a central bank’s plans to buy assets can send a signal that policymakers intend to keep the policy rate at the lower bound for some time. This signal can reinforce other forward guidance and move market expectations of the policy rate path.\n\nFinally, the liquidity channel refers to the effect of the central bank’s transactions on trading conditions in the asset market and the resulting liquidity risk premia. The liquidity channel can narrowly affect the specific securities the central bank acquires or sells, or it can affect a broader set of securities if these transactions change general pressures on intermediaries. Although the liquidity channel often operates through implementation effects, a central bank’s purchase plans can also reassure market participants and support market liquidity upon announcement, as we observed, for example, with the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility.[2]\n\nAsymmetry in magnitudes\nDistinguishing these channels is helpful in making sense of the asymmetric magnitudes of measured QE and QT effects.\n\nAt first glance, the asymmetry could seem puzzling. If it’s true, as the paper says, that the effects of QT are “far less than simply reversing the effects of quantitative easing,” doesn’t that violate some kind of law of nature? What if what goes up does not come down? Could cycles of QE and QT be some kind of economic perpetual motion machine?\n\nBut the puzzle goes away when we recognize that any empirical study of the effects of QE or QT faces two fundamental challenges.\n\nThe first challenge arises because financial markets are forward looking. It’s difficult to measure the effect of a well-anticipated policy action. Mostly, what we can measure is the effect of unanticipated actions. And, as the paper acknowledges, QT tends to be much better anticipated than QE, in part because central banks tend to telegraph that QE is temporary.\n\nImagine a hypothetical central bank that announced it would buy assets at a fixed monthly pace for two years and then allow those assets to mature without reinvesting, and that it would not reconsider this plan under any circumstances. Term premiums would move when the central bank made this announcement, reflecting market anticipation of the entire path of asset purchases and maturities. If the central bank then happened to announce at the two-year mark that purchases had ended and runoff had begun, that “QT” announcement would convey no new information and, as an announcement, should have no effect on term premiums. Nevertheless, in this hypothetical program, QT would eventually fully unwind the term premium effects of QE. Part of the unwind would actually happen up front: the effect of the QE announcement would be dampened by the certainty that assets would start to run off in two years. The QE announcement would contain the seeds of its own undoing. And the rest of the unwind would happen gradually as the assets ran off and market prices shifted to accommodate larger private sector holdings.\n\nOf course, real-world QT isn’t preplanned in such a rigid way, but its onset still tends to be better anticipated than QE. QT typically starts when the economic recovery is clearly underway and usually isn’t a big surprise. In the current cycle, the Bank of England even provided a nearly mechanical rule relating the start of QT to the policy rate.[3]\n\nBy contrast, central banks typically launch QE in unusual circumstances—an economic crisis or financial stress episode when adjusting the policy rate isn’t adequate or isn’t possible. I don’t like to call QE “unconventional” policy because it’s now a firmly established part of the central bank toolkit. Nevertheless, QE is used infrequently enough and in unusual-enough circumstances that there is no simple and predictable pattern to how it’s used. Even when market participants expect a central bank to deploy QE in some form, they typically have a broadly dispersed distribution of expectations about the size and timing of the program. QE announcements collapse that uncertainty. Thus, the measured effect of QE announcements tends to be larger than the measured effect of the widely anticipated onset of QT.\n\nThis brings me to the second challenge facing studies like today’s and the second explanation for the asymmetry in magnitudes: QE and QT are the result of central banks’ deliberate policy choices. Central banks deploy QE when they believe QE will have desirable effects and QT when they believe QT will have desirable effects. The circumstances are different, and intentionally so.\n\nCentral banks usually launch QE programs when markets are under severe stress or policy rates are at the ELB. By contrast, QT announcements typically come when markets are calm and policy rates are above the lower bound. The liquidity channel operates very differently in these two types of environments, and to some degree, so do the signaling and portfolio-balance channels. In other words, the asymmetry in measured effects is at least partly an asymmetry in the contexts where QE and QT are announced—not simply an asymmetry in the effects that QE and QT would have if they were counterfactually announced in identical contexts.[4]\n\nIt’s easiest to see the asymmetry across environments in the case of the liquidity channel. Some programs under the broad umbrella of QE have specifically aimed to address dysfunction in asset markets. Consider, for example, the Fed’s purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) during our first QE program amid the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) or our historically large and rapid purchases of Treasury securities and MBS at the onset of the pandemic. In the stressed trading conditions that prevailed at the start of both of these episodes, the Fed’s purchases restored normal market liquidity. I suspect that if a central bank were to announce QT during a severe stress episode, the liquidity effects would be at least as large as those usually observed for QE (though with the opposite sign). But since central banks generally wait to initiate QT until the underlying sources of market dysfunction have been mitigated, QT doesn’t typically trigger new rounds of dysfunction that would reverse the liquidity gains from QE.[5] To summarize, the main reason we measure larger liquidity effects on average from QE than QT is because central banks don’t use QT when it would have large liquidity effects.\n\nThe asymmetry across environments also applies, to a degree, to the signaling and portfolio-balance channels. Forward guidance about the policy rate becomes more important when the policy rate is at the lower bound and can’t be lowered further. Correspondingly, the signaling channel’s ability to reinforce forward guidance is more powerful at the lower bound. Additionally, central banks often state explicitly that QT actions convey no signal about the future path of the policy rate, being motivated instead by a desire to normalize the balance sheet.[6]\n\nAs for the portfolio-balance channel, remember that the term premium is the compensation investors require to bear duration risk. All else equal, that compensation is higher when there is more uncertainty about future interest rates. This implies central bank asset holdings are likely to have a larger effect on term premiums at times of relatively higher interest rate uncertainty. The key question is when those times are, and in contrast to the asymmetry that the conference paper emphasizes, research has found that such times often include the start of QT. That may be because QT tends to occur when rates are away from the ELB and front-end rate volatility is mechanically higher.[7] But measuring these effects can require controlling in a detailed way for interest rate uncertainty and the magnitude of the surprise in a central bank’s QE or QT announcement, which could be challenging in a broad cross-country analysis of the type the conference paper undertakes.[8]\n\nUnpacking the asymmetry that the paper describes goes some way toward understanding why QE is such a powerful element of the central bank toolkit at critical moments and yet is possible to unwind later without undoing the benefits that QE provided. When the economy suffers a severe negative shock, or when markets experience severe dysfunction, central bank asset holdings can have a large influence on financial conditions through the portfolio-balance, signaling and liquidity channels. Deploying QE at such times can support the economy and market functioning. As the economic and market stressors diminish, the relevance of the central bank’s asset holdings for financial conditions will moderate on its own, even before the central bank begins normalizing its balance sheet. And that means the eventual initiation of QT typically has much less impact than the onset of QE.\n\nAsymmetry across asset and funding markets\nSo far, I’ve focused on asymmetries in how QE and QT affect asset markets. Now, let me turn to an asymmetry on the other side of the balance sheet, one that receives less attention in the paper but that I see as important to the continued success of the Fed’s ongoing balance sheet normalization.\n\nBecause changes in central bank assets also change the central bank’s liabilities—such as reserves—QE and QT also affect funding markets. I’d argue, and we see some evidence for this in the paper, that the effects on asset markets are more prominent during QE, while the effects on funding markets are more prominent during QT. One reason is that the measured asset market effects are typically larger for QE than QT. But in addition, the funding market implications of QE and QT differ, especially in the floor system that the FOMC began using to implement monetary policy post-GFC.\n\nIn a floor system, the Fed controls money market rates primarily by adjusting the administered rates that we pay on liabilities such as reserves and the overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility. These administered rates create a floor under market rates regardless of the quantity of reserves we supply. One significant benefit of a floor system is that it allows us to maintain rate control while acquiring assets when necessary to achieve our economic and financial stability objectives. By contrast, at the onset of the GFC, we operated with scarce reserves and controlled money market rates primarily by adjusting the supply of reserves to move up and down the demand curve. That meant the reserve growth resulting from our initial asset purchases in the GFC generated significant money market volatility.[9] In a floor system, reserve growth during QE can produce some modest downward pressure on money market rates, but that pressure is limited.\n\nThe flip side of a floor system’s ability to absorb reserve growth, though, is that the regime works only when reserves are sufficient to meet banks’ demand at close to market rates. If reserves drop too far, we would fall out of the floor system and see substantial upward pressure on money market rates. While our ceiling tools such as the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) and discount window provide significant backstops against such a scenario, the response of money market conditions to reserve levels in the floor system is fundamentally asymmetric. There’s more upside rate risk from reserves falling too low than downside rate risk from reserves rising too high.\n\nThe challenge today is knowing how far to go in normalizing the balance sheet. In 2019, the FOMC decided that it would operate in the long run with a version of the floor system where reserves are “ample.”[10] The word “ample” suggests comfortably but efficiently meeting banks’ demand. As I’ve argued elsewhere, the Friedman rule provides a guide to the efficient supply of reserves in the ample-reserves regime.[11] Banks’ opportunity cost of holding reserves should be approximately equal to the central bank’s cost of supplying reserves.\n\nMost analysts view the cost of supplying reserves as small. So, since banks’ opportunity cost of holding reserves is the spread between money market rates and the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB), the ample level of reserves is one where spreads of money market rates to IORB are generally small. Comfortably meeting banks’ reserve demand at close to market rates also puts them on the flat part of the demand curve for reserves. Hence, when reserves are ample, money market rates should not move much with fluctuations in reserve supply due to changes in autonomous factors such as the Treasury General Account.[12] In light of the substantial volatility of autonomous factors, this implies the ample level includes a buffer of reserves above the minimum needed to meet banks’ demand.\n\nWhen money market spreads to IORB are small, banks will avoid economizing excessively on reserves and taking inappropriate liquidity risk. By contrast, when reserves are below ample and money market rates are meaningfully above IORB, banks face an implicit tax on liquidity. This can make the financial system less safe and less efficient. More-than-ample reserve levels are also inefficient. Currently, for example, money market rates are running as much as 10 basis points below IORB, tilting the liquidity playing field away from nonbanks that can’t hold reserves. While it was necessary and appropriate to temporarily expand the Fed’s balance sheet in response to the economic and financial stresses of the pandemic, it’s important to normalize the balance sheet and remove these inefficiencies now that the stresses have passed.\n\nI know that everyone is really hoping I’ll go one step further and say what level of reserves corresponds to the ample level. I’m going to disappoint you. Banks’ demand for reserves varies significantly over time as the economy and financial system evolve. For example, the liquidity stresses last March inspired many banks to reevaluate how they manage reserves, and supervisory or regulatory developments could lead to further changes in reserve demand. So, I don’t think we can identify the ample level in advance. We’ll need to feel our way to it by observing money market spreads and volatility.\n\nTo me, the need to feel our way means that when ON RRP balances approach a low level, it will be appropriate to slow the pace of asset runoff. As long as there are significant balances in the ON RRP facility, we can be confident that liquidity is more than ample in the aggregate. But once the ON RRP is empty, there will be more uncertainty about how much excess liquidity remains. Moreover, the current pace of runoff is about twice what it was in the first half of 2019. This hasn’t yet reduced reserves because funds have come out of the ON RRP facility instead. After the ON RRP is drained, asset runoff will reduce reserves 1-for-1, all else equal. In this environment, moving more slowly can reduce the risk of an accident that would require us to stop too soon.\n\nReserves don’t necessarily come out of all banks equally. Some firms can approach scarcity well before others. So, as reserves fall, the system has to redistribute them. And banks can’t perfectly anticipate their outflows. The faster the Fed’s balance sheet shrinks, the larger are the outflow surprises that banks confront, the more challenging the redistribution becomes, and the greater the risk that we go too far and see undue money market pressures.\n\nSlower runoff, therefore, is a way to approach the ample point more gradually, allowing banks to redistribute funds and the FOMC to carefully judge when we have gone far enough. This strategy will mitigate the risk of undesired liquidity stresses from QT.\n\nI want to emphasize that slowing, to me, doesn’t mean stopping. In fact, I believe that proceeding more gradually may allow the Fed to eventually get to a smaller balance sheet by providing banks with more time to adjust. As I said earlier, the eventual stopping point should depend on what we observe in money market volatility and spreads.\n\nIn that regard, I’d emphasize that ample reserves doesn’t mean eliminating all rate volatility or collapsing all money market spreads to precisely zero. Money markets and their participants are real-world institutions, not a theoretical ideal. It’s not the role of monetary policy to eliminate the various small frictions that arise in reality, and I expect we’ll continue to see minor spreads and rate fluctuations even when we operate with ample reserves in the long run.\n\nI also want to note that while the ample level of reserves is unknown, I see considerably less uncertainty about the appropriate long-run level of ON RRP balances in the ample-reserves regime. The Fed’s operating regime is intended to supply ample reserves to banks—but only ample reserves and not more than that. In an environment with persistent and meaningful ON RRP balances, money market rates would tend to fall well below IORB, meaning that liquidity would be more than ample. While some observers have argued that maintaining significant ON RRP balances in the long run could provide a buffer against money market volatility, that buffer would come at the expense of supplying more than the efficient level of reserves and creating an unlevel liquidity playing field between banks and nonbanks.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, I would like to again thank the authors for this informative paper and the organizers for the opportunity to comment on it. Not only is the topic fascinating in its own right, but this discussion provides an important public service. To achieve the Fed’s goals of maximum employment and stable prices, we must continuously deepen our understanding of how our tools affect financial conditions and the broader economy. I am grateful to the authors and all of you involved in this conference for your contributions to this knowledge.\n\nThank you.\n\nNotes\n\nThese channels each incorporate several more specific mechanisms.

    "text": "Thank you, Ken [Bentsen]. It’s great to be back at SIFMA.\n\nThe last time I spoke at a SIFMA event, in April 2021, I was serving as manager of the Federal Reserve’s System Open Market Account. I discussed how the expansion of our balance sheet to support the economy amid the pandemic was influencing money market conditions and policy implementation.\n\nToday, I will return to the topics of money markets and the Fed’s balance sheet, but from a new perspective as a policymaker and in a very different economic environment.\n\nThe economy\nLet me start by reviewing the economic situation. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe FOMC held the fed funds target range at the effective lower bound from March 2020 through March 2022 to support the economy during the pandemic, then raised the target range rapidly in 2022 and 2023 in response to surging inflation. Last month, with inflation and employment both in striking distance of the FOMC’s goals rather than seriously overheated, we decided to lower the target range.\n\nLess-restrictive policy will help avoid cooling the labor market by more than is necessary to bring inflation back to target in a sustainable and timely way. In thinking about the policy choices ahead, I continue to apply the same foundational considerations I’ve applied since I became president of the Dallas Fed two years ago. First and foremost, I’m committed to sustainably achieving both of the FOMC’s dual-mandate goals: maximum employment and stable prices. I’m also carefully considering how the risk environment affects our strategy. The appropriate policy strategy depends on whether the path ahead is clear or cloudy. And I continue to pay close attention to financial conditions and to the information I receive from the Dallas Fed’s surveys, from business and community contacts, and from market participants like you.\n\nTwo takeaways stand out to me from the current economic and financial picture. First, the economy is strong and stable. But second, meaningful uncertainties remain in the outlook. Downside risks to the labor market have increased, balanced against diminished but still real upside risks to inflation. And many of these risks are complex to assess and measure.\n\nIf the economy evolves as I currently expect, a strategy of gradually lowering the policy rate toward a more normal or neutral level can help manage the risks and achieve our goals. However, any number of shocks could influence what that path to normal will look like, how fast policy should move and where rates should settle. In my view, the FOMC will need to remain nimble and willing to adjust if appropriate.\n\nBalance sheet normalization\nAs we begin to normalize the fed funds target range, we are also continuing the process we began in 2022 of normalizing our balance sheet by allowing longer-term asset holdings to mature.\n\nChanges in the fed funds target range are, as the FOMC has stated, our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. With the target range well away from the effective lower bound, at this time we can accomplish our inflation and employment goals by adjusting the target range, while allowing balance sheet runoff to continue smoothly in the background as we move toward an efficient balance sheet size.\n\nIt's sometimes suggested that the reduction in asset holdings works at cross purposes to the strategy of reducing policy restriction by lowering the fed funds target range. I don’t see it that way, for two reasons. First, we are moving the target range toward neutral from above. The policy rate remains restrictive, which is consistent with also creating restriction by reducing asset holdings. Second, we are now normalizing both of our policy tools. Normalizing the fed funds rate means bringing it down from the elevated levels that were needed to restore price stability and returning to a level that will be consistent with sustaining maximum employment and price stability over time. Normalizing our balance sheet means bringing our asset holdings down from the elevated quantity that was necessary to support the economy during the pandemic and returning to a balance sheet size that will be consistent with implementing monetary policy efficiently and effectively. Those two normalization processes work in tandem and are consistent in my view. A number of other central banks are similarly reducing their asset holdings while lowering their policy rates in response to the changing economic outlook.\n\nThe normalization process will affect both sides of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. In the rest of my remarks, I will describe key policy considerations that I expect to affect the path of the Federal Reserve’s liabilities and assets in the long term, as well as some relatively near-term considerations that may arise along the way.\n\nLiabilities\nLet me start with liabilities. In 2019, the FOMC decided to implement monetary policy in the long run in a regime of ample reserves. In this regime, the Fed supplies sufficient liquidity to meet banks’ demand with money market rates close to the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB). The ample reserves regime has three main benefits. It provides robust interest rate control in an environment where both banks’ reserve demand and the autonomous factors that drain reserves are less predictable than in the past. The ample reserves regime also continues to effectively control interest rates when the central bank expands its balance sheet to provide macroeconomic stimulus or support financial stability. And, by remunerating reserves in line with other money-like assets, the ample reserves regime ensures banks don’t pay a penalty for appropriately managing their liquidity risk by holding reserves, the most liquid asset there is.\n\nAt present, liquidity appears to be more than ample. Reserve balances are around $3.2 trillion, compared with around $1.7 trillion in early 2020. The economy and financial system have grown, and the dash for cash at the start of the pandemic as well as the banking stresses in March 2023 may have led banks to increase their demand for liquidity. Still, I think it’s unlikely banks’ liquidity demand has nearly doubled in half a decade.\n\nOne sign liquidity remains in abundant supply, and not merely ample, is that money market rates continue to generally run well below IORB. The tri-party general collateral rate (TGCR) on repos secured by Treasury securities has been averaging 8 basis points below IORB. Because reserves and Treasury repos are both essentially risk-free overnight assets – and reserves are, if anything, more liquid – the spread of IORB over TGCR indicates reserves remain in relatively excess supply compared with other liquid assets.\n\nThe spread between IORB and the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), which includes a broader set of Treasury repo transactions than TGCR, has recently been slightly tighter than the IORB-TGCR spread. However, some SOFR transactions include compensation for intermediating funds from the triparty segment of the repo market to cash borrowers who lack direct access to that segment. For this reason, I am watching TGCR for a cleaner read on liquidity conditions in secured markets.\n\nUnsecured funding conditions also continue to reflect abundant liquidity. The effective federal funds rate has been running 7 basis points below IORB and remains insensitive to short-term fluctuations in reserve levels.\n\nAnd the continuing substantial balances in the Fed’s overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility provide another sign that liquidity remains more than ample. The ON RRP facility accepts overnight investments from money market funds and certain other market participants at a rate currently 10 basis points below IORB. Thus, the facility reinforces the floor on money market rates created by IORB. Institutional and market frictions can influence investors’ choices to place funds in the ON RRP facility versus other instruments. However, should liquidity shortfalls emerge that create meaningful upward pressure on money market rates, I would expect market participants to move cash out of the facility in search of higher returns. For now, the remaining ON RRP balances provide a buffer of additional excess liquidity.\n\nWe have started to see some temporary money market fluctuations on statement dates such as the recent quarter end. As the supply of liquidity declines, the financial system needs to redistribute liquidity to the firms that need it most. That process isn’t always frictionless. The emergence of month-end and quarter-end pressures appears to reflect temporary intermediation frictions rather than shortfalls in aggregate reserve supply. For example, on September 30 and October 1, the spread between SOFR and TGCR widened by 7 to 12 basis points. This widening reportedly resulted from limited balance sheet availability at dealers that intermediate between the triparty and centrally cleared market segments.\n\nAs in the previous episode of balance sheet normalization in 2018 and early 2019, we are likely to continue to see occasional, modest rate pressures as our balance sheet shrinks. Such temporary rate pressures can be price signals that help market participants redistribute liquidity to the places where it’s needed most. And from a policy perspective, I think it’s important to tolerate normal, modest, temporary pressures of this type so we can get to an efficient balance sheet size.\n\nIn the long run, I believe it will be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to operate with money market rates close to, but perhaps slightly below, IORB. As I have discussed elsewhere, operating with money market rates close to IORB is consistent with the Friedman rule. In an environment where the central bank pays interest on reserves, the Friedman rule calls for making the cost of liquidity similar across markets and institutions by having roughly equal interest rates on reserves and comparable instruments such as repos. I say rates should be roughly equal because technical differences and minor competitive frictions between money markets can justify small spreads. The last time we normalized our balance sheet, in 2016 through 2019, money market rates became notably more volatile as they moved above the interest rate on reserves. A configuration of rates close to, but perhaps slightly below, IORB may provide the best combination of efficiency and effective rate control.[1]\n\nI also believe it will be appropriate in the long run to operate with only negligible balances in the ON RRP facility. The facility is a backstop tool to reinforce the floor on money market rates created by paying interest on reserves. The lower interest rate on ON RRP balances than reserves reflects the facility’s backstop nature. As such, meaningful ON RRP balances should not form a permanent fixture on the Fed’s balance sheet, in my view.\n\nON RRP balances came down rapidly in 2022 and 2023, but the pace of decline has slowed more recently. It is not particularly surprising that the most elastic balances would leave the facility first. The remaining balances may be stickier as some participants particularly value overnight assets or face counterparty risk limits for repos in the private market. I anticipate the remaining balances will move out of the facility as repo rates rise closer to IORB, but if they do not, reducing the ON RRP interest rate could incentivize participants to return funds to private markets.\n\nAssets\nTurning to the other side of the ledger, balance sheet normalization also has implications for our policy choices about the composition of the Federal Reserve’s assets and the design of our lending facilities.\n\nThe FOMC has said repeatedly, most recently in 2022, that we intend to hold primarily Treasury securities in the long run. At present, however, we are rather far from that benchmark and not moving appreciably closer. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are running off slowly because homeowners have little incentive to refinance with mortgage rates higher than they were when we acquired most of the securities. Agency debt and MBS currently represent 34.4 percent of the par value of our securities holdings. That is actually up half a percentage point from the start of 2024.\n\nIn its most recent annual report, the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk projected that the share of MBS in the portfolio would not decline materially until balance sheet normalization is complete and the Desk begins purchasing Treasuries to keep pace with growth in reserve demand. MBS would remain more than 15 percent of the portfolio through the end of the decade in those projections. As indicated in the minutes of the May 2022 FOMC meeting, a number of FOMC participants have suggested it could be appropriate at some point to sell MBS to move the mix of assets closer to our goal. But that’s not a near-term issue in my view.\n\nEven with a portfolio consisting primarily of Treasuries, the FOMC will face choices about which Treasuries to hold. I believe the two most plausible options in the long run are for the FOMC to hold a roughly neutral Treasury portfolio, meaning one with a maturity composition similar to that of the Treasury universe, or to tilt toward shorter maturities. A neutral portfolio would leave long-run decisions about the maturity composition of government debt to the Treasury Department, as is appropriate under our institutional separation of monetary and fiscal policy. A tilt toward shorter maturities would allow more flexibility. Either way, the System Open Market Account portfolio is significantly underweight Treasury bills, and its weighted average maturity remains significantly longer than that of marketable debt outstanding. The tradeoffs around how to move toward a more neutral portfolio are complex and will require thoughtful policy deliberations.\n\nLending and funding transactions\nThe Federal Reserve’s assets also include loans we make to depository institutions at the discount window and repo operations that deliver liquidity to our various counterparties. Balance sheet runoff will influence the policy choices on this component of our balance sheet as well.\n\nWhen reserve supply is closer to ample, individual banks will be more likely to face payment outflows that leave them temporarily below their desired liquidity levels. Money markets generally work well to redistribute liquidity in those circumstances, but frictions can arise. All banks should have strong contingency liquidity plans for addressing liquidity shortfalls, including those that private markets cannot meet.\n\nIn particular, as I have said before, I believe every bank in the United States should be operationally ready to access the discount window. That means completing the legal documents, making collateral arrangements and testing the plumbing. As a longtime market practitioner who has worked extensively on readiness for potential stress, I am convinced banks should practice using the window before a need arises. Take out and repay small-dollar test loans. And practice moving collateral between the window and other collateralized funding sources, in case a scenario arises where you can’t get the funding you want from those sources. The window is an important tool for healthy banks to meet their liquidity needs, but it works only when banks are ready to use it. Banks should also consider the potential benefits of establishing access to the Standing Repo Facility (SRF).\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s discount window policies have been largely unchanged for two decades, yet the structure of money markets and the banking and financial systems has changed dramatically over that time. The FOMC has moved from a scarce-reserves policy implementation regime, in which liquidity was costly and banks routinely experienced small liquidity shocks, to an ample-reserves regime, with much less costly liquidity and less frequent shocks. Regulations, especially for large banks, changed significantly after the Global Financial Crisis, calling for banks to manage liquidity risk much more carefully. Reforms adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reshaped the money market fund landscape, effectively requiring much more use of secured transactions and shrinking the market for unsecured short-term lending to banks. And in parallel with these policy changes, markets are moving faster than ever before, culminating in the unprecedented speed of bank runs that we saw in 2023.\n\nIn light of these environmental changes, it is important to consider whether our discount window operations and policies should adjust to ensure the window remains an effective tool for meeting depository institutions’ liquidity needs and mitigating liquidity shocks that could lead to broader financial and economic stress. Last month, the Federal Reserve Board issued a formal Request for Information seeking public views on how best to strengthen discount window operations. I hope all market participants will consider commenting. Your views are important and help us do the best job of serving the public.\n\nIn addition to the discount window, the SRF, the Foreign and International Monetary Authorities Repo Facility and international dollar liquidity swap lines are important tools for providing liquidity to the financial system when temporary needs arise. As with the discount window, it is important to ensure the continued effectiveness of these facilities as we move toward ample reserves. I was pleased to see the SRF drawn on over the quarter-end turn as market participants worked through frictions in the redistribution of liquidity. To further enhance the effectiveness of our tools, the FOMC could consider the benefits of centrally clearing SRF and other open market operations. Central clearing would reduce our counterparties’ cost of intermediating funding to the broader market. The SEC also adopted a central clearing mandate earlier this year for many private-sector participants in the Treasury market. While that mandate does not apply to the Fed, centrally clearing our operations on a voluntary basis could reinforce this important market transition.\n\nThe primary benefit of the clearing mandate, in my view, will be to strengthen risk management by applying the strong and uniform requirements of central counterparties, instead of leaving risk management up to individual firms. Broader central clearing in the private sector will also enhance transparency. And it may reduce balance sheet costs for some intermediaries, which could help mitigate the statement-date repo market frictions I discussed earlier. As the industry works to implement the clearing mandate, it will be important to design access models and operations to allow efficient central clearing by a wide range of market participants so that the mandate’s benefits can be fully realized. SIFMA’s work developing master clearing agreements is an important step to support the clearing transition, alongside the work under way at many other organizations. With the first clearing deadline at the end of 2025, it is crucial for all market participants to prepare.\n\nThank you. I would be happy to answer your questions.\n\nNote\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.\n\nRates that include returns to intermediation could be slightly higher."

The insights you share help me form my assessment of our region’s economy and shape my overall outlook.\n\nThe U.S. economy is at a key moment for monetary policy. More than four years after the postpandemic inflation surge began, inflation remains above the 2 percent target set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). At the same time, payroll job growth slowed markedly this year. Against this backdrop, the FOMC recently voted to cut interest rates for the first time in nine months, and FOMC participants’ economic projections reflected a divergence of views on where policy should go from here.\n\nCongress gave the FOMC a dual mandate: to set monetary policy to deliver both price stability and maximum employment. I supported the FOMC’s rate cut earlier this month because it helped better balance the risk of slowing the labor market too much against the ongoing imperative to bring inflation back to the 2 percent target. However, I am also committed to finishing the job of sustainably restoring price stability.\n\nAs I consider the path ahead, three features of the economy stand out to me at this time.\n\nFirst, even setting aside temporary effects of this year’s increases in tariff rates, inflation is not convincingly on track to return all the way to 2 percent.\nSecond, aggregate demand remains resilient, supported by consumption, business investment and buoyant financial conditions.\nThird, while the labor market has undeniably slowed, with meaningful costs to workers, not all of the weakness represents economic slack that less-restrictive monetary policy can ameliorate.\nThe combination of persistent inflation, resilient demand and modest labor market slack indicates to me that policy is likely only modestly restrictive. There may be relatively little room to make additional rate cuts without inadvertently moving to an inappropriately accommodative stance.\n\nOf course, economic outlooks are inherently uncertain, and the outlook now is more uncertain than usual. In these remarks, I will lay out the key elements of my economic outlook and why they lead me to conclude that the FOMC should proceed cautiously on further rate cuts. As always, these are my views and not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\n\nInflationary pressures persist\nInflation remains too high. The FOMC measures price stability by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. Headline PCE inflation was 2.7 percent for the 12 months through August.\n\nInflation can be volatile. Measures that remove outliers or volatile categories historically have given better signals of where headline inflation is likely to go. But the signals from these measures are currently disappointing. The Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE inflation rate, which removes categories of goods or services with unusually large price changes, was also 2.7 percent in the 12 months through August. Core PCE inflation, which removes the volatile food and energy categories, was higher than headline, at 2.9 percent. Both measures are little changed from their readings a year ago.\n\nTariff rate increases have contributed to inflation this year. But, in standard economic theories, an increase in tariffs, all else equal, produces a one-time upward shift in the price level rather than sustained inflationary pressures. Therefore, to judge whether inflation is on track to return all the way to 2 percent, it is important to assess the underlying drivers beyond tariffs.\n\nMy staff investigated what has been keeping inflation elevated. They separated core inflation into three components: goods, housing services and non-housing services. When overall inflation is running at 2 percent, each of these three components tends to run at a somewhat different rate because long-run trends change the relative prices of different goods and services. However, my staff found that inflation for all three components is elevated relative to the respective levels that would be consistent with 2 percent overall inflation.\n\nMost worrisome for the medium-term inflation outlook, non-housing services inflation should be relatively unaffected by tariffs, yet it has hovered near 3.4 percent over the past year. Non-housing services represents more than half of Americans’ aggregate consumption. My staff estimates that the current rate of inflation in this category is high enough to keep overall inflation above 2 percent by 30 to 40 basis points. Housing services inflation should come down some as rents reset. Core goods inflation has been elevated in part due to tariffs, an effect that should also dissipate. But even then, the persistence visible in non-housing services inflation would keep overall inflation from returning all the way to the 2 percent target.\n\nThere are both downside and upside risks to that outlook. If the labor market slows more sharply than I anticipate, or if labor productivity growth strengthens, we could see more disinflation. On the other hand, shifting global supply chains and the re-shoring of manufacturing could continue to push up goods prices even after tariff effects are fully incorporated.\n\nTariffs also pose upside risk to inflation because of the way they tend to feed into prices over time. Although tariffs should produce a one-time shift up in prices, in practice that upward shift takes time to occur. The resulting lags have the potential to generate more persistent inflation. Many business leaders tell me they have not yet fully passed through higher tariff costs because they are uncertain where tariff rates will settle and fear losing market share. Other firms held the line on prices while they worked through inventories built up before tariffs took effect. But if tariff costs remain high, my business contacts tell me they will pass on more of these costs to their customers. Responses to special questions in the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Survey in August indicate a significant fraction of firms affected by tariffs had not yet passed on tariff costs but plan to do so in coming months.\n\nSurveys indicate that consumers’ and business economists’ inflation expectations remain elevated over the next year, as do market-based measures of inflation compensation. Measures of longer-run inflation expectations and inflation compensation have generally remained broadly consistent with 2 percent inflation. Well-anchored inflation expectations help return inflation to target and give the FOMC room to take a balanced approach to the two legs of the mandate. However, policymakers cannot take well-anchored expectations for granted. The longer tariffs take to show through into prices and the longer inflation remains above 2 percent, the greater the risk that above-target inflation becomes entrenched.\n\nDemand is holding up in the face of challenges\nAggregate demand has remained resilient despite an elevated monetary policy target rate and cross-currents from shifts in national economic policies. Adjusting for inflation, GDP increased at a 1.6 percent annualized rate in the first half of the year, slower than its 2.4 percent pace in 2024 but not much below its trend growth rate. As with inflation, GDP measures that exclude volatile categories often give more reliable signals than the total GDP data on the underlying momentum in overall spending and demand. Final sales to private domestic purchasers, which excludes government spending and the more volatile net exports and inventories categories, increased at a 2.4 percent annualized pace in the first half of 2025. Corporate earnings reports for the second quarter also underscored economic resilience.\n\nMoreover, GDP growth in the third quarter looks solid. Consumption has increased at around a 3 percent annualized pace for the quarter, and new orders suggest equipment investment remained strong in July and August.\n\nConsumer and business sentiment appear to be rebounding after having weakened in the spring in the face of uncertainty regarding trade and fiscal policies. The Dallas Fed’s August Texas Business Outlook and Banking Conditions Surveys found that business output, wages and loan volumes picked up since the middle of the summer, which is consistent with surveys at the national level. New orders in the Institute for Supply Management’s surveys for both manufacturing and services jumped into positive territory in August. In the Dallas Fed’s September surveys, respondents also expect manufacturing and service sector activity to continue to increase six months from now, consistent with findings in other regions.\n\nThe outlook for business investment in some sectors is particularly strong. Investment in data centers for both traditional cloud services and artificial intelligence continues to boom. My business contacts also cite changes in tax policy, the prospect of less restrictive regulation in banking and other sectors and, perhaps more speculatively, permitting reform that could unlock energy development and housing construction. These developments may well eventually increase productivity and aggregate supply, but the timing of those effects is uncertain. Meanwhile, the boost to demand is already here. That raises uncertainty about the balance between demand and supply in the near term.\n\nIncreasingly accommodative financial conditions are supporting aggregate demand, primarily through equity valuations that continue to reach new highs, but also through narrowing credit spreads and a weaker dollar. Indexes that estimate the economic impact of changes in a broad range of asset prices point to financial conditions prompting a meaningful boost to growth ahead. For example, the Federal Reserve Board’s baseline methodology implies that current financial conditions will provide about a 1 percentage point boost to real GDP growth over the next year. More than half of the effect comes from higher equity valuations. This is largely because rising financial wealth tends to support aggregate consumption, and the last year alone saw an estimated increase in U.S.-held public equity wealth of more than $7 trillion. Of course, not everyone benefits equally or at all from increases in stock prices, and financial conditions are less supportive in certain sectors. High mortgage rates, for example, are weighing on house prices, which have been edging lower in recent months from high levels. But, overall, financial conditions are providing a tailwind to aggregate growth.\n\nDistinguishing labor market slowing from labor market slack\nDespite the resilience in aggregate demand, the labor market has been slowing. Payroll job growth has decreased markedly this year. The economy added an average of 111,000 jobs per month in 2024 after accounting for preliminary benchmark revisions recently published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By contrast, payrolls grew by an average of 29,000 jobs per month from June to August 2025, a number that could eventually be revised downward as well.\n\nYet employers are not laying off markedly more workers than before. The layoff rate in August was 1.1 percent, below the average of 1.2 in 2019, when the labor market was considered healthy. Initial claims for unemployment insurance remained around the 2019 level through mid September.\n\nInstead, the labor market is characterized by both low hiring and low firing. Firms are reluctant to hire, and workers seeking jobs (including those who have been laid off, those who would like to change roles and new entrants to the labor force) are having more difficulty finding positions. Although layoffs are painful in any environment, if hiring is robust, workers can find new jobs relatively quickly. The current low hiring rate makes the economy more vulnerable than usual to any increase in layoffs or weakening in demand.\n\nBut I’m also mindful of the difference between a slowing labor market and a slack labor market. By slack, I mean underutilization of economic resources, such as a gap between the number of people wanting to work and the number of available jobs. Monetary policy can ameliorate slack by lowering the policy rate to support demand. But not all changes in economic activity represent changes in slack, and monetary policy can do little to change supply factors. Stimulating demand when it is already in balance with supply will create price pressures without sustainably adding to employment. For example, in the 1970s, the FOMC misinterpreted slowing productivity growth and GDP growth as increasing slack, and it lowered rates only to stoke inflation.\n\nWhile payroll gains have slowed considerably, so has labor force growth. At the Dallas Fed, we estimate that the break-even level of monthly job gains needed to keep the unemployment rate constant fell from a peak of approximately 250,000 in 2023 to about 30,000 in mid-2025. Declines in immigration account for roughly half of the decline in the break-even estimate, and a lower labor force participation accounts for the rest. Research by my staff shows that a decline in immigration can also reduce demand, which offsets the reduced labor supply and leaves the economy smaller but overall balanced with little effect on inflation.\n\nUnemployment has drifted up only slowly, consistent with payroll gains only modestly below breakeven. The unemployment rate registered 4.3 percent in August, after hovering in a range of 4 to 4.2 percent from mid-2024 through July of this year. Other labor market indicators, such as job openings and wage growth, also point to continued gradual cooling but not a rapidly weakening labor market. As of August, there was one job opening per unemployed worker, just a bit lower than the average ratio of 1.1 from 2017 to 2019. Over the past year, employee compensation growth has been close to 3.5 percent, which is lower than during the peak inflation surge but higher than before the pandemic.\n\nThat said, while the increase in labor market slack to date has been incremental, I am mindful that the unemployment rate has rarely moved so gradually. Modest increases have often turned into large increases. As the labor market has cooled, its vulnerability to a very damaging, nonlinear deterioration has increased.\n\nHow restrictive is the policy stance?\nThe degree of restriction coming from monetary policy is difficult to measure precisely, especially in real time. On the whole, however, the state of the economy and financial conditions indicate to me the stance of monetary policy is only modestly restrictive. Quantitative economic models also support that view.\n\nInflation, though down substantially from the postpandemic peak, has not made meaningful further progress toward our target for the past year. That persistence is driven, in part, by core non-housing services inflation, which is linked to wage growth and the labor market. The labor market, while slowing, does not appear to have a large or rapidly increasing amount of slack. Consumption and business investment also remain resilient. More qualitatively, my contacts tell me of growing optimism, and they expect business activity to increase. Recent surveys also reflect improving sentiment. None of this is what I would expect to see if the stance of policy were more than modestly restrictive.\n\nIt is true that monetary policy works with a lag, so economic conditions today do not reflect the full impact of the current policy setting. But if substantially more cooling of the economy were in train, I would not have expected progress on underlying inflation to stall.\n\nFinancial conditions tell a similar story. Overall, rising asset prices and solid credit flows are supporting economic activity and signaling investor optimism for future economic growth. There is meaningful financial restraint in some sectors, especially housing. On the whole, though, these financial conditions do not indicate that monetary policy stance is exerting a lot of restraint on economic activity.\n\nAnother way to assess the restrictiveness of policy is to compare the fed funds target range to estimates of the neutral interest rate, the theoretical interest rate that would act as neither a headwind nor a tailwind to growth. The neutral rate is notoriously uncertain and difficult to measure, but you can get a sense for it from economic fundamentals, models, surveys and market prices.\n\nEconomists employ a range of models to try to estimate the neutral rate. Among widely consulted models, point estimates of the neutral real interest rate currently range from 0.84 percent to 2.15 percent. Adding in the 2 percent inflation target, those figures correspond to a neutral fed funds rate of 2.84 to 4.15 percent. Following the rate cut at the September FOMC meeting, the fed funds rate stands today at 4.13 percent, right at the top of that range.\n\nModel-based estimates can be slow to respond to structural changes in the economy. Market prices provide a helpful complement to the models because market prices should incorporate all available information and reflect whatever can be known about those structural changes as of today. The real interest rate on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities five to 10 years from now is currently around 2.3 percent, equivalent to a 4.3 percent nominal interest rate after adding in the 2 percent inflation target. Five to 10 years from now is far enough in the future to limit price impacts from the current monetary policy cycle and give an indication of where market participants expect the neutral rate to settle in the future. (Importantly, though, the neutral rate could be different today than in the future, and risk premiums and technical factors can also influence market measures.) Real five-year, five-year forward yields derived from interest rate and inflation swaps currently trade at around 1.4 percent, equivalent to a 3.4 percent nominal rate after adding 2 percent inflation. The market proxies from TIPS and swaps thus both suggest expectations for long-run neutral real interest rates that are comparable to model-based estimates and not far from the current policy rate.\n\nImportantly, the range of estimates of the neutral rate is quite large, as are the uncertainty bands around some of the individual estimates. In considering the appropriate stance of monetary policy, I believe it is important not to lean too heavily on any one estimate, and to formulate a plan that is robust to the uncertainty.\n\nThe FOMC’s recent action and the policy path ahead\nI supported the FOMC’s decision to lower the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at our September meeting. Moving the rate one notch closer to neutral provides some insurance against the downside risks to the labor market. At the same time, the stance of policy remains modestly restrictive and capable of continuing to reduce inflation to the 2 percent target.\n\nHowever, I will be cautious about further rate cuts. It is critical for the FOMC to keep its commitment to deliver 2 percent inflation. Achieving this will require carefully calibrating the stance of policy.\n\nThe gradual increase in labor market slack to date is what I expected and what is necessary to bring inflation down. Non-housing services inflation, in particular, is tightly correlated with wage growth and, ultimately, labor market tightness. With non-housing-services inflation running above the rate consistent with overall 2-percent inflation, a modest further increase in labor market slack is likely necessary to finish restoring price stability.\n\nIn turn, that requires maintaining at least a modestly restrictive policy stance. Yet the neutral rate is uncertain. Lowering the policy target too much would risk moving to a neutral or even accommodative stance that would prevent further progress on price stability. It will take time to observe how the economy is evolving and learn how much room there is for further cuts. We will also learn more over time about the persistence of underlying inflation and the degree of downside risk to the labor market. A cautious approach to policy will enable that learning and help balance both of the FOMC’s dual mandate goals and the risks to each of them.\n\nI approach the economic outlook and policy strategy with humility. Any number of economic or financial developments could require a more expeditious change in the course of policy or a fundamental rethink of the outlook. Handling those possibilities, too, calls for a learning mindset. I will continue to closely watch the economic data, financial conditions, economic models and what our surveys and contacts tell me as I assess appropriate monetary policy."

    "text": "It is my pleasure to welcome you to this conference on the outlook for North American trade and immigration, which the Dallas Fed is hosting in collaboration with the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nToday’s conversation comes at a pivotal time as the new governments both here in the United States and in Mexico adjust trade, immigration and other policies. These policies will affect the national and global economies, international relations and communities throughout the district the Dallas Fed serves. The goal of today’s conference is to discuss economic relationships across the U.S., Mexico and North America and bring forth perspectives that can help inform the public about these timely issues.\n\nThe Dallas Fed values the opportunity to hear from and engage with people from an assortment of backgrounds including subject matter experts, business leaders, community leaders and more. By bringing multidisciplinary views together, we deepen our collective understanding of these quickly evolving topics. Let me note that the views I share are mine and not necessarily those of my Federal Open Market Committee colleagues.\n\nGiven our close proximity to Mexico, the Dallas Fed has the unique opportunity to engage in collaborative research, analysis and conversations on cross-border issues. Our long-standing relationships with our neighbors in Mexico help us to effectively gather insights on the ground and engage in conversations that inform and guide research and analysis. These interactions enhance our understanding of the U.S.–Mexico relationship and allow us to better serve the public, and these conversations allow us to hear how policy changes transmit into daily life.\n\nLast year, the Dallas Fed launched the Global Institute. The institute builds on the foundation of our previous Center for Latin American Economics, which played a pivotal role in enhancing public understanding of economic policy in Latin America, and of the Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, which examined how economic integration affected monetary policy. With the Global Institute, we plan to grow the Dallas Fed’s concentration and influence in the field of international economic research and to be a center of policy-related research on global trade, international capital flows and migration, with a particular interest in linkages with Mexico.\n\nOne way we accomplish this is by collaborating with leading economists in the field and organizations such as the Peterson Institute to produce impactful research and provide timely insights on the U.S.–Mexico relationship and broader global contexts. I encourage you to visit the Global Institute web site, where you can read our research on migration patterns, the pass-through of trade costs to consumer prices and more.\n\nChanges in trade and other policies will have substantial effects on the U.S. and global economies. Financial market prices have been volatile as market participants digest those implications, as well as uncertainties about the specifics of policies and about how policies will work their way through the economy.\n\nRegarding the economic outlook, higher-than-expected tariffs would very likely raise both unemployment and inflation. The persistence of the effect on inflation would depend on how quickly companies pass through cost increases and whether long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. A sustained burst of inflation could lead households and businesses to expect further price increases, especially following the persistently elevated inflation in recent years.\n\nAs mandated by Congress, the FOMC pursues both maximum employment and price stability. Both of those objectives benefit American families, businesses and communities, and missing on either dimension is costly. History teaches that when higher inflation expectations become entrenched, the road back to price stability is longer, the labor market is weaker and the economic scars are deeper. To sustainably achieve both of our dual-mandate goals, it will be important to keep any tariff-related price increases from fostering more persistent inflation. For now, I believe the stance of monetary policy is well positioned.\n\nI look forward to robust discussions today that can deepen our collective understanding of the U.S.–Mexico relationship, the North American economy and the implications of recent policy changes. And I look forward to continuing this conversation in the fall when we hold the second installment of this dialogue in Washington.\n\nThank you all for joining us here today. We are especially pleased to have community and business leaders here with us, and we look forward to hearing from you about how trade and immigration policies directly affect your companies, organizations and communities.\n\nNow, I’d like to introduce Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies for the Peterson Institute. Marcus has been associated with the Peterson Institute since 1985 and served as deputy director from 2009 to 2012. He is currently a senior fellow at the East-West Center, and he was previously a senior economist at the Council of Economic Advisers. He has held research and teaching positions at universities including Yale, Johns Hopkins and the University of Southern California. Marcus, thank you for joining us. And thank you to the Peterson Institute for partnering with us to develop today’s conference."

    "text": "\nThe below transcript has been republished from Macro Musings, a podcast hosted by David Beckworth of the Mercatus Center. Listen to the podcast episode.\n\nDavid Beckworth: Lorie, welcome to the show.\n\nLorie Logan: David, thanks for having me. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nBeckworth: Well, it's a real treat for me, and I know my listeners will also really enjoy having you on the program today. We are recording this January 5th, and as it turns out, Lorie, the minutes from the December FOMC meeting just came out, and I was reading them before I got on the show here with you.  And I read a paragraph that was all about you. I'm reading a paragraph that says, \"In discussing recently established backstop facilities, the manager noted continued progress.\" And it goes on to talk about the standard repo facility and the FEMA repo facility. I'm like, \"Hey, that's Lorie. I'm going to be speaking to Lorie today.\"\n\nBeckworth: So, it's a real honor for me, and I know many of my listeners as well, to get you on this show. Because we talk about this stuff a lot, but to get someone who's actually on the front lines, who's actually doing it. Wow. What a real treat for us. So, thank you for coming on the show. Okay. Lorie, maybe you can tell us a little bit about yourself. How did you get to where you are? What is your career journey like? Any lessons learned along the way?\n\nLogan: Well, thanks. And again, David, it's great to be here. I've had a strong interest in public service and public policy from a young age, which I think was inspired by my family's involvement in local politics, growing up in a small town in Kentucky. And then later fostered by experiences studying political science at Davidson College and later at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.  And it was at Columbia that I was first introduced to global economic policy issues and opportunities at the Fed. And since then, I spent over 20 years, nearly my entire career, in the Markets Group at the New York Fed, deepening my own understanding of the financial system and working to make monetary policy implementation more effective.\n\nLogan: I started off in 2000 as a trader analyst, reporting on financial market developments and executing domestic operations on the government securities desk. And it was this real-time interaction of analysis and trading that provided an incredible opportunity to learn and to work at the intersection of public policy and financial markets. And I still love those aspects of what I do today. My time in the Markets Group has been marked with periods of accelerated learning. I was on the desk and involved with the historic lending in the securities lending program on September 11th. I crafted plans for liquidity facilities and the large scale asset purchases during the global financial crisis, and led development of the overnight RRP facility to support interest rate control after the GFC. And these experiences deepened my perspective, and over time I grew into increasing leadership positions.\n\nLogan: Two years ago, I was appointed to the SOMA manager role, where I'm now responsible for implementing the FOMCs policy directives and managing the system's $8 trillion securities portfolio. And this involves overseeing open market operations and reporting on financial markets at each of the FOMC meeting minutes. And you heard about that in the minutes that were released today. And working at the Fed has just been an incredible experience. I've had the privilege of serving in a mission-driven organization, one that's focused on making the economy stronger and the financial system more stable for all. And to me, that's especially grounding each day. And I get to do it with an amazing group of people.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. I want to talk about that group of people in a minute, but just going back to your experience, you were there from 2000 to the present. So, you've seen a lot, as you mentioned. You have a lot of institutional knowledge inside of yourself, a lot of human capital for the New York Fed, and you were there for 9/11. And I'm just wondering, what was it like to go through that? Did you have to shut down the office? Were you there working through it? What was it like at that time? Because you're pretty close to the location of the Twin Towers.\n\nLogan: That was just an incredibly difficult experience, and very early on in my tenure at the New York Fed. We were very close to the towers and it was both a difficult time personally and professionally for me and for all those that I was working with. I was there that day, and it was a difficult day to participate in the operations that we did to support market function, and was difficult in the days after. But at that time, I really learned what it means to be a part of the central bank and the role and responsibility of the central bank to be open and available to provide liquidity when the financial market needs it most.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. Very harrowing experience for sure. Well, let's talk about your group at the New York Fed. You oversee a lot, and I'm just looking off your bio here. I see four different roles and this may understate what you actually do, but let me list them off and you can correct me if I'm wrong or add to the list.  But one of your roles is, and you mentioned this already, but the execution of monetary policy for the FOMC. Number two, provision of fiscal agent services to the US Treasury Department and support of its debt issuance and foreign exchange operations. Three, analysis of global financial market developments. And four, production of the New York Fed's reference rates, including the SOFR. So, you do a lot. And in each of those, I guess bullet points, you have a lot of things you could unpack underneath that. Is that list a comprehensive list or is there more you would add to that?\n\nDay-to-Day Operations at the New York Fed\n\nLogan: Well, those are all the things that we do on the trading desk, which is a part of the Markets Group at the New York Fed. In addition to those activities, the Markets Group also, like each of the reserve banks, executes the discount window and also provides financial services for other or central banks. But as the SOMA manager, I'm responsible for overseeing policy implementation analysis. And to do that, I lead a large team of traders and analysts and policy advisors with a real range of backgrounds in finance, economics and policy. So, maybe I'd to share a little bit about my day-to-day and how that looks, most days, and also how that changes over time.\n\nLogan: In terms of my day-to-day, I think my kids, who've had just a really unique and front row seat as we've been working remotely during the pandemic, describe it best. They say my day starts very early and is jam-packed with meetings. And I think that's pretty accurate. My day does begin early. Often starting on an international call before 7:00 AM, but some staff come in even earlier around 4:00 to begin monitoring overseas markets. And then we all come together each morning at 9:05 to discuss our operations and how we're interpreting markets.\n\nLogan: It's an important meeting for me, and it's a meeting that's been held at that time for decades. At that meeting, I typically have my eye on how effectively our operations are working. And I'm also thinking broadly about markets, trying to put what the team is seeing in the context of the FOMCs goals. And then the rest of my day is typically spent in meetings geared toward helping the group achieve on its mission. We run a big operation to manage the portfolio. There's a lot of deliberation and planning to ensure the operations run smoothly and that we communicate about them clearly. And I also spend a significant amount of time with our board colleagues in DC, and then with policymakers, about bigger picture implementation strategy decisions.\n\nLogan: We also to maintain a broad range of external relationships. And a lot of my time is focused on those relationships, and with other central bank colleagues, to share implementation experiences and to really learn from each other.  The most important part of my time though is spent on our people and what they need to be successful. I manage a large team, as I said, and work to ensure that we understand our evolving priorities and that the team's working well. We certainly faced some tough challenges recently, as we've shifted to a remote virtual environment, and that's going to be a continued focus as we develop new ways of doing our work after the pandemic.\n\nBeckworth: Well, let's say there's a crisis emerging, let's say for example, repo panic 2019. You see things unfolding, do you have the power to go ahead and do something, or do you have to call the FOMC first and get authority from them? Are you empowered at some level to respond to market developments?\n\nLogan: As you noted, there are definitely periods when we have to organize our time to be more responsive to these evolving developments. And in those times, the structure of the day is quite similar, but we're in this crisis management mode, and the pace accelerates. The decisions that we're making are more complex and made with less information, but we do make them with an eye to flexibility so we can learn and adapt quickly. And really depends on the environment that we're in at the time, which decisions we make directly on the desk and which we are making at the direction of the FOMC. In each FOMC meeting, the committee issues a directive to the desk, which gives us instructions on how to implement monetary policy, so some of those decisions are ones that we make be at the direction from that particular directive for the intermediate period. And then there's others that might be unusual that we may want to recommend. And those may require a change in the directive or an actual committee vote in between meetings. So it really depends on the environment we're in.\n\nBeckworth: Okay. I want to move on to actual developments and what you have done over the past few years, particularly what happened in March, 2020. Before we do that, go one last question about the New York Fed. And this is a less serious question. But I'm sure you've seen Die Hard with a Vengeance, the movie where the Die Hard character ends up at the New York Fed. And these people try to steal gold from the New York Fed. Is the gold still there? Have you visited the gold down in the basement of the New York Fed?\n\nLogan: Well, I'm certain the gold's still there. I haven't actually been in the building in a bit of time, David.\n\nBeckworth: Okay.\n\nLogan: Given the pandemic, but I know it's still there and it is a really interesting tour to do. My middle son actually is the one who's been able to do that tour with me. And it's been a real highlight for him. And hopefully we'll be back in the building and my other kids will get the chance to do the tour, too.\n\nBeckworth: Very nice. All right. So you've given a lot of talks on what happened in March 2020. The “Dash For Cash” as it's called. A number of talks. You were a part of the Fed's response to it. And I was hoping you could summarize for us your view of what happened during that period.\n\nThe \"Dash for Cash\" and Subsequent Policy Response\n\nLogan: So perhaps I'll take a step back and first talk about what we observed at the time. And then turn to how we responded. So in first, in terms of what we observed, we first saw changes in financial markets early in 2020. Equity markets globally were volatile, responding to the virus that was spreading quickly. By late February, as more cases were confirmed in the US, conditions began to decline quite rapidly. I think it's really important to first emphasize the magnitude of the shock that financial markets were absorbing in early 2020. At the time, the economy had been experiencing relatively steady economic growth. And over the course of just a few weeks, market participants became concerned that large parts of the economy could completely shut down, potentially creating a historic recession. And additionally, market participants were also highly concerned that the financial system itself might not function properly in a remote environment.\n\nLogan: The infrastructure of the global financial system is complex. It's interconnected. There are dependencies all over along the chain of the transactions. So while the financial system itself ultimately made that transition relatively smoothly, that was not an outcome, I think, many thought possible at the time. So the result was just extreme volatility as financial assets repriced to reflect these developments. And there was also a broad base dash for cash as investors sought the safety of cash. Even Treasury securities, which are usually seen as the most liquid of financial assets, were being sold broadly to raise dollars. And so this shift was really unprecedented. Unprecedented in its scale and in its scope, and resulted in severe disruptions across financial markets and had the potential to make economic conditions even worse by cutting off the flow of credit to households and businesses that were most vulnerable.\n\nLogan: So how did we respond? Well, over the first few weeks in March, our operations transitioned from business as usual to managing an unprecedented pandemic. By early March, we had already put the staff in a heightened monitoring stance, and had taken steps to increase the size and lengthen the tenor of repo operations. And you'd asked earlier, are there decisions that you can make directly on the desk? And those are two examples of ones that we can make directly. However, the conditions continue to worsen and to broaden. And so, to me, the turning point was March 12th. And it was on that day where we took more aggressive action. First, we offered almost unlimited amounts of funding through the repos. And then later that day, to help alleviate the strains in Treasury cash markets, we announced a shift in our purchases of Treasury bills to purchase across the Treasury coupon curve.\n\nLogan: And that's an example where we actually needed approval from the chair to make that type of decision. So right there, just that one day, you can see the different types of decisions that we make and the authorities that we have. My own sense was that these moves would help stem the dysfunction. But by the end of the day, we were already seeing significant one way flows and conditions continue to worsen. And we could see that in just a broad set of metrics that we were monitoring. So very late that night, we conferenced again with the team to assess whether more aggressive actions were needed, what options we could put on the table, and then whether we could make those options operationally feasible within such a short window of time because we needed to implement whatever recommendation we'd be putting forward that next morning.\n\nLogan: So after a very lengthy call, we decided to recommend that we pull forward an entire month's worth of Treasury purchases into a single day. Such an aggressive option we hoped would signal that we were prepared to take the actions needed to maintain functioning. And so that discussion was really when I realized we were in an unprecedented environment. Just the extraordinary demand for cash was creating conditions that required us to respond with unmatched size and speed. And ultimately, the FOMC announced an unbounded commitment to support market function. And we met daily from that point on about how many and which Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities to buy. And of course, the Fed also took a broad range of other actions to stem dysfunction across markets, including the FX swap lines with foreign central banks, and also a broad range of liquidity and credit facilities. And it was the combination of these actions, I think, that were successful at supporting the flow of credit in such an uncertain time. And I just want to emphasize that all of this was done by staff working from home.\n\nLogan: Many of them amazing working at home for the first time. And the conditions were quite challenging. And we're always investing in operational readiness, and we'd had virtual capabilities. But we had never operated from home to this extent. So this was a new experience for us and for all of our counterparties. And I'm still in awe of what the team was really able to achieve in those early days.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. A very amazing story there. And I think it's important for us to do the counterfactual. What if the New York Fed hadn't stepped in? I mean the global dollar funding markets are so large, they're global, as you mentioned. And if you hadn't stepped in, it could have been a really horrible outcome, another financial crisis like we saw in 2008, or worse. And so the demands on your staff, I imagine, just are going to grow over time as global dollar funding markets grow as well. I also want to come back to this, maybe an idea of what was this crisis? And from my perspective, and correct me if I'm wrong, the dash for cash was more of a plumbing issue than a fundamental fiscal solvency issue of the US government. It was just people trying to liquidate positions or get into some of their asset and they couldn't. The plumbing was constrained, maybe even cracked or broken. Is that a fair way to analogize what happened?\n\nLogan: I think the experience really underscored the fact that, while the Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid in the world, there are some underlying fragilities. So I think that's what you're referring to. Of course, the pandemic represented as shock of such magnitude that I think even the most resilient market likely would've experienced disruptions. But we've also seen disruptions to Treasury market functioning in more benign environments. And here I'm thinking back to October, 2014 or September, 2019. And sometimes, with those, there was a seemingly little trigger. So I do think, given the importance of this [Treasury] market, financing the government and in supporting the implementation of monetary policy, that it's critical that we take steps to enhance the plumbing and resiliency of the market. So I do think that is a big focus of the work that we're doing on the desk and the inner agency working group on Treasury markets is really focused on.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. I read that report preparing for the show. The inner agency working group for market surveillance from, I guess, November last year. And also, there's been the Brookings Task Force on Financial Stability, Group of Thirty. A lot of great pieces coming out explaining what's going on. And a lot of them have common suggestions for improving. And let me just throw them out there and let me know what you think. So one of them is increased central clearing in the Treasury market. Another is a standing repo facility. And we can kind of check that one off, that's already been adopted. And then several others tweak the supplemental leverage ratio and then better data. But let me just start with the first one, then maybe go one by one. Central clearing, do you see an important role for that moving forward?\n\nThe Role of Central Clearing Moving Forward\n\nLogan: I do. And maybe just before jumping into those potential changes to improve their resiliency. Maybe I could highlight just a couple of themes from my own experience. And I think that we've seen across studies that you mentioned, because I think it's those vulnerabilities that these different proposals will need to be addressing. And I think that'll help us evaluate them as we talk about it. I really think there are four themes that have resonated with my own experience from the studies that we've seen come out. One common theme is that the US Treasury market has grown so much and it's really outpaced the growth in dealer intermediation capacity. Another change in the Treasury market is the growth of electronic trading and non-dealer intermediaries.\n\nLogan: Some electronic markets have high frequency trading and very limited customer interaction. And as a result, participants are less likely to continue engaging in this market when volatility increases. And the third is the proliferation of trading venues and settlement mechanisms that have also created some fragmentation in the market structure. And I think, and result in more frictions across markets, particularly in times of stress. And we saw this play out in March and in April of 2020. And then finally, even as the market becomes more complex and interconnected, real-time data on positions and flows in the US treasuries is still pretty limited. And that reduces visibility for both market participants and for the official sector. So I think as we look at these different proposals, it's important to keep in mind these vulnerabilities because I think we want to be addressing these directly.\n\nLogan: And as you noted, several have put forward some recommendations and the IAWG in particular has said that they would focus on five. Those are improving resilience of market intermediation, improving data quality, evaluating expanded central clearing, enhancing trading venue transparency and oversight, and then finally assessing effects of fund leverage and liquidity risk management practices. And I think the key point I'd make in listing these work streams is that it's very unlikely that there's a standalone solution. I think these are all complimentary efforts. And I think the goal is to ensure that the US Treasury market is as resilient as possible using the combination of these changes that have been proposed. So some of the ones you noted central clearing, the SLR, the standing repo facility are all complimentary in that regard. But I do think we need to stay focused on a package of changes and not get too focused on any one proposal in particular.\n\nBeckworth: Well, one of those proposals has come through, come to fruition and that's the standing repo facility. I guess it was last year that the FOMC made that one official as well as making the FIMA repo facility permanent. Tell us a little bit about the standing repo facility. I've been a fan of this idea for some time. I've had some people on the show to talk about it, but what do you see it doing moving forward?\n\nThe Future of the Standing Repo Facility\n\nLogan: Well, I do think the decision on the standing repo facility and also the FIMA repo facility, which the committee voted on at the same time was a very historic decision with respect to the framework, and one that the committee deliberated on for some time. These facilities were implemented to support effective policy implementation by limiting the potential for pressures in repo or in global dollar funding markets to spill back to the Fed funds market. In recent years, we've observed that pressures in money markets can emerge rapidly and with little warning. And we saw that in September 2019, and again in March 2020. And since pressures in these overnight markets can be difficult to predict and are harder to tamp down once they emerge, I too do think that a key benefit is their ability to help mitigate rate pressures before they develop into these larger disruptions.\n\nLogan: And this should enhance market confidence and help to limit those pressures from building, even if the facilities end up being little used. So while not the primary objective of the facilities, I think having these backstops in financing markets can also have important positive effects for the treasury market functioning more generally. Certainly, the SRF reduces the potential for disruptions in Treasury repo markets to then hinder the dealer's ability to make markets in the Treasury cash market. And the FIMA repo facility can help reduce sales of Treasury securities by the FIMA accounts by providing them with this temporary liquidity against their holdings.\n\nLogan: Now, of course, these repo facilities alone won't prevent all types of pressures on the Treasury market to the extent that limits on intermediation capacity or sales of Treasury securities are happening for factors other than the need for temporary liquidity. Repo won't fully substitute for outright sales of securities, but they can meaningfully I think limit the potential for disruptions. It is a very important development, not only for our monetary policy implementation framework, but also for the Treasury market resiliency efforts that we're working on.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah, it was interesting to read today in the FOMC minutes from the December 2021 meeting that several participants said, hey, this standing repo facility will make tapering easier. It may even affect the final destination, the final size of the balance sheet if people can easily substitute between treasuries and reserves. If they know that's there, that confidence will make the transition to whatever your final target may be an easier path. So interesting to see that happen. And again, great timing for the minutes to come out as we are recording this show. And that's a nice segue to the next thing I want to talk about, and that's the Fed's balance sheet. You mentioned already, it's 8 trillion plus, and the FOMC has announced… or it is already tapering. And I know you can't speak to policy, but I'll just say from my side, it appears from the minutes today that there's going to be some QT or actual runoff occurring this year. And I'm just curious from your perspective, how does that work? How would we see your office, the Federal Reserve in general, do balance sheet reduction?\n\nAsset Purchases and the Process of Balance Sheet Reduction\n\nLogan: Well, maybe it's useful just to take a step back and talk about the asset purchases themselves as a standard tool in the Fed’s tool kit and how those work mechanically, and then come back to mechanically how they work as we begin to slow that process and ultimately decrease the size of the balance sheet. As I said, the asset purchases have become a standard tool in the toolkit to provide accommodation when short term interest rates are near zero. And in terms of the mechanics, I think about them working in a couple of ways. First, they work through the portfolio balance channel. When the Fed or the desk purchases securities from our counterparties, it raises the price of these securities and then lowers their yields. And those counterparties who sold securities to us may then rebalance their own portfolios to invest in other assets, lowering yields broadly, and then easing financial conditions.\n\nLogan: So that's the first channel we tend to think about these working. And the second one is a signaling channel. Asset purchases can signal that the Fed's committed to maintaining accommodated conditions and is unlikely to thereby raise the Fed funds rate for some length of time, and this also reduces yields by lowering the expected path of policy rates. And in periods of stress, such as that we saw in the pandemic, asset purchases can also restore market functioning and reduce risk premia that could otherwise increase yields. And this was a key benefit of the purchases early in the pandemic. So the overall goal again is to lower long term interest rates and keep credit flowing to the economy. And since the onset of the pandemic, the desk has been directed by the committee to purchase significant amounts of treasuries and agency MBS.\n\nLogan: And our assessment is that they've been very effective at easing financial conditions and generally supporting the recovery. And as you noted at the December meeting, the committee decided to accelerate the taper of these asset purchases. And this action was prompted by a rapidly strengthening labor market and currently elevated inflationary pressures and Chair Powell noted that a quicker conclusion of asset purchases would better position policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes. So our focus on the desk is on executing this reduction in the pace of asset purchases and to do so smoothly for the FOMC. And so far, I think this has gone well, and we haven't observed any challenges associated with the decline and purchase amounts. But of course, whereas I said always monitoring developments and keeping an eye towards effects there.\n\nLogan: Now, at some point when the current level of accommodation is no longer necessary to achieve the committee's goals, the committee's going to want to reduce the size of the Fed's balance sheet and unwinding these measures demonstrates that this important tool is used when needed. But importantly, it can be withdrawn once the committee's goals are achieved. And we do have some experience with the mechanics of reducing the balance sheet. At the conclusion of the large scale asset purchase programs after the global financial crisis, the committee did undertake balance sheet normalization that lasted about two years. So in terms of the mechanics of that process, balance sheet normalization was conducted in a gradual manner and a predictable manner. I think those are the two key themes there. And there were two implementation elements to that. First, principle payments from our maturing securities were no longer reinvested and that reduces the balance sheet size. And in other words, it was an organic process. We didn't sell assets. And then the second mechanical feature was that caps were set on these monthly redemption amounts to ensure a steady decline.\n\nLogan: And I think overall this process, that process of natural maturities rather than sales and caps to ensure a steady pace seemed to work quite well. And at the December meeting, the committee did review this previous experience that it had with balance sheet normalization. And there were several aspects of that previous approach that the committee felt remained applicable. Maybe I'll just highlight a couple of those themes from the discussion and these were highlighted in the minutes. The first one I think is clear communications, you know, clear communications provided in advance of the policy decisions were viewed as helpful in setting expectations and enhancing understanding of the overall policy approach and the second was consistent with the previous normalization episode. Changes in the target range for the Fed funds rate were still seen to be the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy.\n\nLogan: Then third, using caps on these redemption amounts, the mechanical process I talked about, can ensure balance sheet reduction occurs in a measured and predictable manner. I think that was recognized as being a very useful approach. Then fourth, retaining flexibility to make adjustments to the approach was viewed as helpful in nimbly responding to economic and market conditions. Those were some of the common themes, I think, that were recognized in looking back at the previous experience. But there were also some differences, and the committee noted that the economic outlook is much stronger now than in the previous episode and that the balance sheet is much larger and that these differences would be taken to account when making decisions about the balance sheet. As the minutes and the chair noted, no decisions have been made. The FOMC is going to be discussing these balance sheet issues in coming meetings, and our focus on the desk will be working to support those deliberations.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. You've had the experience already of doing QT, or quantitative tightening, but still, this is not a trivial task, right? I mean, there's a lot of things you got to consider, as you mentioned. You got to do only so much or you allow the principal to run off. You got to control that. You got to gauge the stance of the economy. That's the conditional forecast. You got to worry about the TGA balance, right? What's the Treasury doing? You have all these moving parts that you have to control for. So you do have your work cut out for you when it comes to actually implementing this. It's not just  press a button on a keyboard, and then it's done. There's a lot of judgment, I guess, involved in this exercise.\n\nLogan: Well, I think there are a whole host of considerations that you outlined that the committee will be thinking about and exploring in the upcoming meetings. At some point, the desk will get a very clear directive from the committee about how to implement this policy normalization and balance sheet normalization process. That directive, I think, will be very transparent and clear in terms of the mechanics of what we'll need to do to deliver on that directive.\n\nBeckworth: Now, don't you have some blog posts coming out at the New York Fed related to this discussion of the Fed's balance sheet?\n\nLogan: We do. Next week, we'll be releasing a series of blog posts about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy implementation framework. The purpose of the series is to help talk about how the Federal Reserve implements policy today. We'll be looking at the implementation framework, the tools, interest on reserve balances in the overnight RRP facility in supporting that framework. We're going to talk a little bit about technical adjustments to interest on reserve balances and overnight RRP and how we've used technical adjustments to support policy implementation. Then a little bit more about this new backstop facility, the standing repo facility that we talked about earlier. So I'm excited about the series and hope the audience takes the opportunity to review them.\n\nBeckworth: We look forward to seeing it. So speaking of the Fed's balance sheet, there's this runoff that's likely to occur. The balance sheet will get smaller. There's some destination. Is it too soon to start thinking about where that destination is? Is that going to be determined by the FOMC? Let me rephrase the question this way. Will the FOMC come up with a dollar size for the Fed's balance sheet, or more general, we'll know we're there when we're there kind of framing for that journey?\n\nIs There an End Goal for the Fed’s Balance Sheet?\n\nLogan: Well, in terms of the future of the balance sheet, the committee has stated that it plans to continue to implement policy in an ample reserves regime or a floor system. So we'll talk more about that in the post that'll be released. This implies that the balance sheet will need to be maintained at a level that supplies ample reserves to the banking system. Reserves right now are very large. They're highly abundant or super abundant, so I expect the balance sheet could decline some way from here and still maintain an ample level of reserves. But I think the key point is that the long run size of the balance sheet is uncertain because banks' demand for reserves varies over time.\n\nLogan: At the December FOMC meeting, participants suggested that it will be important that we monitor money market conditions as reserves fall in order to assess the appropriate level of reserves to maintain ample conditions. Indeed, we do have a lot of money market data, which allows us to observe those conditions in money markets at a granular level. And we do have our experience from the prior normalization to help serve as a guide when assessing those reserve conditions. And we have the new standing repo facility in place as a backstop now, which wasn't the case during the prior normalization period. So I expect that the long run portfolio size will again be driven by demand for Federal Reserve liabilities consistent with maintaining an ample reserves regime. The exact level is something that's unknown and will be something that we'll be monitoring to determine as the balance sheet declines.\n\nBeckworth: Well, I'm looking forward to this journey, and I'm especially looking forward to the role that the standing repo facility will play in this journey. Because as you said, it could affect how many reserves are demanded by the banks. In the few minutes we have left, Lorie, I want to ask about the framework you mentioned, ample reserves framework, or a floor operating system. We haven't touched on this. The overnight reverse repo facility, does that set the floor effectively for the rates and you could think of standing repo and discount rate being the ceiling, and you want the Fed funds rate somewhere between that? What role would the interest on reserves play in that system?\n\nThe Floor System and the Role of Interest on Reserves\n\nLogan: Well, just going back to 2019 when the FOMC adopted this framework for implementing policy, where they supply an ample supply of reserves that ensures the Fed's administered rates influence the Fed funds rate and other overnight rates. In a floor system, our job is to ensure that reserves are supplied to meet banks' needs for liquid balances and that the IORB and the overnight RRP are important features.\n\nLogan: Now in most economies, the interest on reserve balances would be enough to control interest rates. However in the US, banks are a smaller share of the financial system. So when the FOMC pursues policies such as asset purchases or lending like we've been doing since March 2020, expands the Fed's balance sheet, and banks can end up with more reserves than they're comfortable holding. So during these times, they lower the rates at which they take deposits, and the rates trade below IORB. So in order to enhance rate control, the overnight reverse repo facility was established, and this does place a floor under overnight rates by providing a range of money market participants, this other option.\n\nLogan: This really does two things. It improves investors' bargaining power in overnight markets, and it creates an alternative investment that can spread Federal Reserve liabilities beyond reserves that reduces the pressure on banks' balance sheets. The FOMC's been essentially operating with this floor system for many years now and using both IORB and the overnight RRP as key tools. That's turned out to be quite effective at controlling rates through a variety of environments.\n\nLogan: Recently, the overnight RRP has become a more important component of that framework, along with the growth in the Fed's balance sheet. Overnight RRP usage tends to grow when there are downward pressures on rates relative to IORB. This can happen when reserves are elevated and banks try to shed deposits or when the supply of short-term investments such as Treasury bills declines. In the current environment, we're seeing both of those elements. So the overnight RRP facility is particularly important now and a particularly attractive investment for money market participants. So we've seen the facility increase to record high levels. I think my main observation would just be that both IORB and overnight RRP are important components to the floor.\n\nBeckworth: Well with that, our time is up. Our guest today's been Lorie Logan. Lorie, thank you so much for coming on the show.\n\nLogan: David, thanks for having me. It's been a real pleasure and hope to be able to return some time soon.\n\nBeckworth: Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much."

    "text": "Thank you for the kind introduction, Imène [Rahmouni-Rousseau]. It’s great to see so many old friends, and it’s a real honor to give a keynote address at this important conference.\n\nAs a policymaker, I have the opportunity to speak on a wide range of topics, but money markets are where I grew up as a central banker. So it’s a particular pleasure to take a deep dive into the more technical aspects of monetary policy implementation and to do so from the perspective of a policymaker rather than a practitioner.\n\nLet me note that the views I express are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Friedman rule and monetary policy implementation\nIn recent decades, central banks around the world have been shifting toward floor systems for monetary policy implementation. That shift has been motivated by the actions central banks had to take in response to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and subsequent stress episodes; by a growing appreciation of the benefits of floor systems across a wide range of economic and financial environments; and by post-GFC changes in bank regulations and banks’ own risk management, which increased the demand for liquidity and the costs of interbank transactions.\n\nAmong the key benefits typically cited for floor systems is that they do not put a price on liquidity. That is, in a floor system, banks’ demand for central bank reserves is satisfied at something close to market interest rates. Market rates are not materially higher than the remuneration on the marginal dollar of reserves, and correspondingly there is no incentive for banks to economize on reserves, the most liquid asset in the financial system.\n\nAs a result, floor systems satisfy a version of the Friedman rule.[1] The opportunity cost to banks of holding reserves is approximately equal to the central bank’s cost of supplying reserves, which most analysts view as small.[2]\n\nIn theory, because floor systems remove incentives to economize on liquidity, they should reduce liquidity risk in the financial system. Yet, in economies around the world that use floor systems, we have seen serious liquidity strains in recent years.\n\nThese episodes include the pressures on liability-driven investment funds in the U.K.; the banking challenges in the U.S. earlier this year; the repo market pressures in 2019; and, of course, the global dash for cash at the onset of the pandemic.\n\nIn light of these events, some observers have questioned whether floor systems deliver the promised liquidity benefits. Some have even argued that floor systems make liquidity risk worse—an idea I strongly disagree with. And some have questioned the other side of the Friedman rule equation, asking whether central banks can in fact supply large quantities of reserves at minimal cost to the financial system and society.[3]\n\nToday, I will take on both sides of those critiques. I will argue that floor systems do reduce liquidity risk. But they don’t eliminate it. It remains incumbent on all players in the financial system—banks, other market participants, as well as central banks in our roles as both regulators and financial institutions—to appropriately manage liquidity risk. The appropriate strategies to manage liquidity risk look somewhat different in a floor system, and I think all players have work left to do to fully gain the benefits of these systems.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the costs of supplying reserves, it’s important to distinguish between two types of floor systems. When the central bank’s balance sheet is only as large as needed to meet the demand for liabilities such as reserves and currency, we call the system a liability-driven floor. That’s the approach we’ve selected for the long run in the United States, where our long-run operating regime will supply “ample” reserves. The FOMC deliberated long and hard over the word “ample,” and it contrasts with words like “abundant” and “super-abundant” that describe higher levels of reserves.[4] I don’t see large costs of supplying the quantity of reserves needed to establish a liability-driven floor.\n\nThere are also circumstances, such as the pandemic, in which it is appropriate for central banks to acquire additional assets to provide monetary accommodation or address severe strains in market functioning. Such balance sheet expansions create an asset-driven floor system. Asset-driven floors can pose some challenges. We can mitigate these challenges when circumstances make asset purchases appropriate, but it is better to minimize the challenges when we can. That is one reason I think it’s important to continue normalizing the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. (Another reason, of course, is that we need to remove monetary accommodation to restore price stability.)\n\nIn the rest of my remarks, I’ll address three topics. First, I’ll review the fundamentals of how floor systems work. Second, I’ll describe key policy lessons from the liquidity stress episodes of recent years. Finally, I will turn to the distinction between liability-driven and asset-driven floors and the challenges that very high levels of reserves can create. Throughout, I will draw on my experience both in my current role as a policymaker and in my previous role as manager of the System Open Market Account, leading the Open Market Trading Desk at the New York Fed that is responsible for implementing the Fed’s operating regime.\nThe fundamentals of floor systems\nLet’s begin by fixing ideas: What is a floor system? And how does it implement monetary policy?\n\nTo answer these questions, we need to consider reserves’ special role in the financial system. Reserves are funds that commercial banks, and sometimes other financial institutions, hold in accounts at the central bank. Payments between banks, or between customers of two different banks, are typically settled by transferring reserves from one bank’s reserve account to the other’s. Reserves’ use in settling payments makes them a unique asset. Reserves are always and immediately liquid. Other assets may be viewed as highly liquid if market participants can usually convert them into reserves quickly and at low cost. But no other asset is ever as safe and liquid as reserves.\n\nBanks hold reserves for three main reasons. Banks use reserves throughout the day to settle payments. They may hold additional reserves, above typical daily needs, to manage liquidity risk by buffering against unexpected payment outflows. And banks may hold reserves to satisfy regulations and supervisory guidance, including formal reserve requirements, or as part of liquid assets to meet broader liquidity regulations. Banks’ liquidity management and the resulting demand for reserves have evolved significantly since the Global Financial Crisis, a point I’ll come back to later.\n\nWhen a bank holds reserves, it forgoes putting that money into other assets such as loans or securities that may have higher risk-adjusted returns. Banks, individually and in the aggregate, therefore have a downward-sloping demand curve for reserves (Figure 1). At relatively low aggregate levels of reserves, banks are willing to tolerate a large spread between the returns on other assets and the return on reserves. As reserve levels increase, the spread between the returns on other assets and reserves must decrease. And when reserves reach levels that satisfy banks’ demand for liquid balances, the demand curve levels off with a market interest rate close to the interest rate the central bank pays on reserves.\n\nFigure 1\nThere are two ways for the central bank to implement monetary policy in this environment.\n\nThe central bank can provide a relatively limited—but potentially still quite large—supply of reserves, intersecting with the steep part of the demand curve (Figure 2). The central bank must then adjust reserve supply so the market clears at the desired interest rate. Small changes to the supply or demand for reserves can lead to significant changes in the policy rate in this regime.\n\nFigure 2\nAlternatively, the central bank can provide more reserves and vary the interest rate on reserves to influence the market interest rate (Figure 3). Such an operating regime is called a floor system because the interest rate on reserves is intended to create a floor below money market rates. Commercial banks will not generally want to earn less in money markets than they can earn by keeping cash at the central bank.\n\nFigure 3\nHowever, the floor provided by interest on reserves can be soft if some money market participants are ineligible to hold interest-bearing reserve accounts or if commercial banks face costs of expanding their balance sheets. That’s why I’ve drawn the graph with the reserve demand curve dipping below the interest rate on reserves. To establish a firm floor, central banks may need additional tools. The overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility serves this purpose for the Fed.\n\nThe level of reserves in a floor system might not be much larger than the level of reserves needed to implement policy on the steep part of the demand curve. Post-GFC changes in regulations and banks’ liquidity risk management have substantially increased banks’ reserve demand.\n\nAs I see it, floor systems have three main benefits.\n\nFirst, rate control in floor systems is more robust.[5] Since the Global Financial Crisis, both the supply of and the demand for reserves can be subject to much larger daily shocks. For example, in the U.S., the Treasury Department, other official entities and central counterparties hold accounts at the Fed that can drain reserves from the banking system.\n\nAs this chart in Figure 4 of daily changes in the Treasury General Account illustrates, the supply of reserves can regularly swing by tens of billions of dollars in a few days because of factors such as fiscal flows. And on the demand side, changes in liquidity regulations and risk management since the GFC have made banks’ demand for reserves less predictable.\n\nFigure 4\nControlling money market rates requires absorbing these shocks to supply and demand. In a floor system, this is relatively straightforward. If the central bank operates on the flat part of the reserve demand curve, the system will remain on the flat part even after typical shifts of demand or supply, and money market rates won’t change much. By contrast, in a scarce reserves system, the central bank must actively manage the supply of reserves to offset the shocks—a challenging task when the shocks are difficult to predict.[6]\n\nSecond, floor systems continue to effectively control rates when the central bank expands its balance sheet to provide macroeconomic stimulus or support financial stability. In the United States, we saw this benefit most recently at the onset of the pandemic. The FOMC responded to disruptions in market functioning by purchasing Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities at an unprecedented pace and scale.[7] Cumulatively, the Fed’s balance sheet expanded more than $2 trillion in a few months (Figure 5). At no point during this balance sheet expansion did we have any difficulty keeping the effective federal funds rate within the FOMC’s target range.[8]\n\nFigure 5\nBy contrast, when we rapidly expanded our balance sheet in 2008 in response to the Global Financial Crisis, we often saw the fed funds rate trade significantly below the FOMC’s target—even after we began paying interest on reserves, which proved to be only one of the components needed for a well-functioning floor system (Figure 6).[9]\n\nFigure 6\nThird, and most closely connected to my theme today, floor systems eliminate what would effectively be a penalty for good liquidity risk management. As I said earlier, reserves are the most liquid asset, bar none. The banking stresses earlier this year proved the unique value of reserves beyond any doubt. Only reserves are immediately liquid. Monetizing any other asset takes time. And sometimes it’s difficult to do at all: counterparties may offer only limited balance sheet space for borrowing against assets, while selling assets can crystallize losses and impair an institution’s health. Holding reserves therefore reduces banks’ liquidity risks relative to holding any other assets.\n\nThere are, of course, good reasons for banks to hold assets other than reserves. By making loans, banks provide the credit to households and businesses that is crucial for economic growth. But banks should not pay a penalty for holding reserves when that is the right choice for their liquidity risk management. If the interest rate paid on reserves is meaningfully below money market interest rates, as occurs in a scarce-reserves regime, there is a penalty to banks for managing liquidity well. Floor systems eliminate this penalty and meet banks’ demand for reserves at market prices. This is the sense in which floor systems implement a version of the Friedman rule.\n\nPolicy lessons from recent liquidity stress episodes\nThe question I now want to discuss is: If floor systems do such a good job of reducing the cost of liquidity, why do we keep seeing liquidity stresses? In the U.S., why did severe money market pressures in September 2019 cause some funding rates to spike by hundreds of basis points?[10] Why did the dash for cash challenge markets in 2020, and why did some banks face liquidity stress this past March? And across the Atlantic, what should we make of the liquidity problems that liability-driven investors in the U.K. experienced in 2022?\n\nMy answer is that floor systems reduce liquidity risk, but they don’t eliminate it.\n\nWe have seen concrete evidence that liquidity risk is lower in the floor regime. For example, since the Fed moved to a floor system, peak daylight overdrafts are about one-tenth the magnitude seen in the prior regime (Figure 7). And interbank payments are substantially less concentrated at the end of the day because banks are less likely to need to wait to receive incoming payments before making outgoing ones.[11] These are both signs that banks are not seeking to economize on liquidity as much as they used to. The floor regime has reduced the penalty for holding liquidity, as the Friedman rule recommends. So individual banks face less risk of lacking the liquidity needed to make outgoing payments, and the banking system as a whole is less vulnerable to disruptions from payments congestion or shocks late in the day.\n\nFigure 7\nStill, there will always be some shocks that a floor system can’t absorb on its own. These can take several forms, including large shifts in the aggregate supply of or demand for reserves; idiosyncratic shocks to individual banks that exceed the system’s capacity to immediately redistribute funds; and shocks to nonbank intermediaries that spill over to bank funding markets. We saw examples of these types of shocks in the liquidity stress episodes I mentioned.\n\nI draw four lessons from these experiences: First, a floor system should include strong backstop ceiling tools. Second, market participants and central banks alike should ensure they are operationally ready to respond to liquidity pressures. Third, regulations should support strong liquidity risk management. And finally, some shocks are too big for any operating regime to absorb easily.\n\nFirst, ceiling tools. In September 2019, as the Federal Reserve normalized its balance sheet following the expansion during and after the Global Financial Crisis, reserves fell below what we later assessed to be the ample level. It was necessary to add reserves to continue operating a floor system, and that’s what we did. Market data, particularly related to pricing conditions, can help signal when reserves are becoming less ample. But given the uncertainties I discussed earlier, I doubt the risk of reserves falling below the ample level can ever be eliminated, especially if the central bank wants to have an efficient balance sheet with ample but not abundant reserves.\n\nSo, as a practical matter, central banks that operate floor systems must be prepared to respond to tail events when reserves fall too low and money market rates can rise above the target level. While discretionary operations such as those we employed in 2019 can effectively address such pressures, a standing ceiling facility at a backstop rate makes a better first line of defense. A standing ceiling facility transparently provides market participants with information about how the central bank will respond and confidence that the central bank will maintain rate control.[12]\n\nIn the U.S., we have significantly strengthened our standing ceiling facilities over time. We’ve repeatedly revised discount window policies to make that traditional tool more effective.[13] In addition, in 2021, we established the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) and the Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) Repo Facility.[14] These facilities provide liquidity to our counterparties: primary dealers and eligible depository institutions in the SRF and foreign official holders in the FIMA facility.\nWe could study ways to further strengthen our ceiling tools. Such a study could examine how we can take on board the lessons of recent years as well as ongoing changes in the structure of the financial system. For example, the FOMC could further consider the potential benefits of centrally clearing SRF operations.[15] Central clearing could enhance the flow of funding to the broader market by allowing our counterparties to net funding received from the facility against onward lending to other market participants.\n\nOther central banks have considered adding counterparties to their liquidity operations.[16] These choices depend on a central bank’s charter and the financial system in which it operates. In my mind, the focus for the Federal Reserve given our context should be to enhance the effectiveness of operations with our existing counterparties.\n\nSecond, operational readiness. One criticism that has been leveled against floor systems is that when liquidity is ample, interbank trading may dry up and banks may become less practiced at sourcing funds when needed.[17] To the extent this happens, I don’t see it as a reason to criticize floor systems. That would be like criticizing modern building codes for reducing the risk of fire. If a city adopts a strong building code, fewer buildings will burn. Residents will have less experience escaping a blaze. Firefighters will have less experience putting out flames. These are good things. And while the lack of experience could have drawbacks, we know what to do about it: fire drills.\n\nSimilarly, the lack of daily liquidity challenges doesn’t absolve participants in the financial system from remaining ready should liquidity pressures emerge. A variety of flexible funding sources is available, and even in a floor system in which liquidity is usually ample, banks should be prepared to use these sources. During the banking stresses earlier this year, we found that some banks had not established access to the discount window, had not pre-positioned collateral so they could borrow against it, or had not tested the borrowing procedures. This is unacceptable in an era when bank runs can start in minutes on social media. Ceiling tools won’t work well if financial institutions aren’t prepared to use them.\n\nEvery bank in the United States should be fully set up at the discount window as part of its liquidity toolkit. That means setting up legal documents and collateral arrangements well before any funding need arises. And it means testing the plumbing—like a fire drill—so bankers have the muscle memory for borrowing when it’s needed.[18] The same goes for other contingent liquidity sources and for non-bank market participants.\n\nThe central bank, too, has a responsibility to maintain operational readiness in a floor system. The Desk regularly tests open market operations to ensure readiness to respond to a variety of potential stresses.\n\nThe Federal Reserve should also consider expanding the hours of critical services such as the discount window. With the launch of instant payments services such as FedNow, liquidity in the U.S. and other markets is increasingly a 24/7/365 business. Our liquidity backstop should be available whenever banks may need it. Over time, that could include nights, weekends and holidays, not just business days.\n\nAnd we should consider how our credit and supervisory policies affect operational readiness. A supervisory or regulatory expectation that depository institutions establish and test access to the discount window could help make individual firms and the financial system more resilient. Periodic testing by all institutions could also reduce the traditional stigmas associated with the discount window. And if we required banks to pre-position some amount of collateral at the window, we could reduce the risk that a bank is unable to borrow because its collateral is in the wrong place.[19]\n\nWe could also study ways to make our discount window, a fundamental central bank function, as strong and effective as possible. For example, we could consider the potential benefits of what I would call collateral-based lending. A collateral-based discount window program would lend to legally eligible depository institutions purely on the basis of their collateral.[20] In contrast, the current program of primary and secondary credit varies the terms of lending based on a borrower’s financial condition. Collateral-based discount window lending could strengthen the ceiling by ensuring all eligible institutions have equal access to liquidity against good collateral. It could also improve operational readiness by reducing the need to take time at critical moments to evaluate a borrower’s condition.\n\nI’ll now turn to my third lesson, regulations. Strong regulations are fundamental to a financial system that serves society’s needs. Regulations must also evolve alongside the overall structure of the financial system, the policy implementation framework and the risks that financial institutions face. Regulations that were well suited to a scarce-reserves regime and a world of relatively slow-moving liquidity demands are not necessarily ideal today.\n\nFor example, the Basel III leverage ratio counts all of a bank’s assets, including reserves, in the denominator. This rule can raise a bank’s cost of holding reserves and intermediating in funding markets, potentially working against the goal of reducing liquidity risk. Such costs may also add to frictions in the interbank market, reducing the system’s capacity to quickly redistribute liquidity to individual firms that need it.[21] More broadly, it is also important to consider the interactions among regulations, ceiling tools and liquidity risk, including how to ensure that banks are able to use their liquidity buffers and how liquidity regulations account for banks’ access to the discount window and the SRF.[22]\n\nFinally, the fourth lesson: some shocks are just too large. At the onset of the pandemic, market participants had to adapt to a dramatically different global risk environment while shifting to remote work. These developments triggered extraordinary financial market volatility, one-sided trading flows and demands for cash.[23] While improvements in ceiling tools, operational readiness and regulations could conceivably have partially mitigated the stresses, I don’t think any steps could have eliminated the stresses entirely. We should work to ensure the financial system is resilient and central bank intervention to support market functioning is rarely needed. But “rare” does not mean “never.”\n\nIn fact, the idea that some shocks are too large for a reasonable operating regime to absorb is built into the Friedman rule framework. The Friedman rule balances the benefits and costs of liquidity. It calls for providing liquidity up to the point that the benefits equal the costs—not for going beyond that point. Conceptually, it would be possible to further reduce liquidity risk by subsidizing banks to hold reserves instead of merely eliminating the interest rate penalty. But such a subsidy would have other costs. So we strike a balance and accept that some shocks will be larger than the regime can absorb without further central bank intervention.\n\nBeyond the Friedman rule: liability-driven and asset-driven floors\nThat brings me to the costs of supplying reserves and the distinction between liability-driven and asset-driven floor systems. Ordinarily, the policy rate is a central bank’s main monetary policy tool, and the balance sheet plays a supporting role. The Friedman rule describes the optimal quantity of reserves to supply in those normal times: the quantity of reserves that banks demand at market interest rates. Because reserve supply is determined by demand for the central bank’s liabilities, this floor system for ordinary times is called a liability-driven floor. But a central bank may also use its balance sheet more actively in response to deep economic downturns or severe market dysfunction. When a central bank acquires assets for those reasons, it also issues more reserves, creating an asset-driven floor system. In such a system, the amount of reserves is not governed by the Friedman rule—the tradeoff between the liquidity benefits and costs of reserves. Rather, reserve supply in an asset-driven floor is a side effect of the central bank buying assets in response to severe macroeconomic or financial stress.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is currently in an asset-driven floor system as a result of our post-pandemic purchases. However, we are running off our asset holdings to return to a liability-driven floor. This is our second such normalization cycle, following the post-GFC normalization of our balance sheet in 2018 and 2019.\n\nWhy normalize our balance sheet at all? Why not stick with a higher level of reserves? In my view, there are two reasons to return to ample rather than abundant reserves—in the Friedman rule framework, two costs of supplying reserves above the ample level.[24] First, abundant reserves can distort the price of liquidity for non-bank market participants. And second, while acquiring assets during a severe downturn or in response to severe market dysfunction can provide much-needed support for the financial system and economy, holding the assets too long can undermine the achievement of monetary policy goals. In particular, maintaining overly large asset holdings may push inflation above target or may complicate the calibration and communication of the policy stance, which ordinarily should center on the policy rate.\n\nThe first reason is relatively narrow and focuses on money markets. Reserves can be held only by banks (or other institutions eligible for reserve accounts). Other financial institutions must use other instruments, such as Treasury securities, as their liquid assets. By acquiring non-reserve assets to back reserves, the central bank adds to the supply of liquidity for banks but may increase non-banks’ cost of liquidity. But in an efficient system, the costs of liquidity should be similar for banks and non-banks. Significant differences in liquidity costs imply that liquidity is too abundant for one type of firm or too scarce for another.\n\nOne way to test whether the costs of liquidity are similar for banks and non-banks is to look at money market rate spreads.[25] For example, overnight Treasury repo rates represent the overnight return on a Treasury security. If Treasury repo rates are significantly below the interest rate on reserves, then Treasury securities, the key liquid asset for non-banks, have greater liquidity value than reserves. The Fed’s balance sheet expansions in response to both the Global Financial Crisis and the pandemic pushed repo rates below interest on reserves (Figure 8).\n\nFigure 8\nThese spreads indicated that liquidity conditions were more abundant for banks than non-banks. In 2018 and 2019, the gap closed as we normalized our balance sheet, and repo rates eventually stabilized a few basis points above interest on reserves. Repo rates and interest on reserves shouldn’t necessarily be exactly equal. There are technical differences between repos and reserves, as well as minor competitive frictions that could introduce a small spread. But in an efficient market, the spread should not be large. This argument is simply the mirror image of the idea that if money market rates are above the interest rate on reserves—if we move up above the floor—there is an undesirable penalty on liquidity for banks.\n\nSome researchers have taken the analysis of relative liquidity costs a step further by estimating the liquidity value of long-term Treasury securities.[26] In such models, the liquidity value of Treasuries includes a negative term premium associated with their flight-to-safety qualities. The central bank’s asset holdings influence that term premium, and one can attempt to calculate the level of asset holdings at which the liquidity value of Treasuries measured in this way would equal the liquidity value of reserves. But I am not persuaded that monetary policy implementation frameworks should be designed around this term premium. To the extent that long-term government debt is scarce, the Treasury can address the scarcity by changing the maturity structure of its debt issuance. When a central bank considers the costs and benefits of supplying more reserves, it should focus on the effects in money markets. Money market conditions reflect the liquidity value of reserves, a unique asset that only the central bank can provide.\n\nThe second reason for balance sheet normalization is outside money markets. Expanding the central bank balance sheet and acquiring assets makes setting and communicating the stance of monetary policy more complicated. The central bank must explain its use of two tools—asset purchases and the policy rate—instead of just one. And asset purchases are more difficult to calibrate because their effects are less certain. These challenges are worth surmounting when the policy rate is at the effective lower bound and further stimulus can come only through asset purchases, or when asset purchases are the best available response to threats to financial stability.\n\nBut in the absence of such needs, the benefits of higher reserves aren’t commensurate with the drawbacks. Indeed, a large balance sheet can even be counterproductive for our policy goals. The Federal Reserve and other central banks bought large quantities of assets during the pandemic for a reason: to support market functioning, the flow of credit and economic activity in response to a severe economic shock. Circumstances are now different. Financial markets are functioning smoothly. And our primary economic challenge is not a deep recession but rather too-high inflation. In this environment, it is important to remove economic stimulus by returning our assets to the level needed to supply ample—not abundant—reserves.\n\nConclusion\nCentral bankers have vigorously debated monetary policy implementation regimes for many years. And I have no doubt we will continue to do so for many more. The Friedman rule offers a useful guidepost in that debate. On the margin, central banks should equate the benefits and costs to society of supplying additional reserves. A floor system with ample reserves satisfies this criterion in my view.\n\nThank you.\n\n"

    "text": "Remarks at the Annual Primary Dealer Meeting, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York CityAs prepared for delivery\nWelcome to the 2019 Annual Primary Dealer Meeting. Each of your firms plays an important role as a trading counterparty in the implementation of monetary policy—a core responsibility of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the operating arm for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This is an area that has generated increased operational activity over the past year. These annual meetings provide us an opportunity to strengthen our relationship and communicate the New York Fed’s expectations of its counterparties.\n\nOver the course of the year, there have been important developments in the Federal Reserve’s framework for implementing monetary policy, and the markets in which we operate have continued to evolve. I’d like to focus today on what the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) is currently doing to implement the FOMC’s ample reserves regime, particularly over the next several months. In mid-October, the FOMC directed the Desk to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September, and we recently began Treasury bill purchases to achieve that objective. Since it will take some time to accumulate securities holdings, we also continue to conduct temporary repurchase agreement (repo) operations in order to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. Although money market conditions have calmed since the mid-September volatility, the Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring reserves conditions and money market developments, and the Desk will continue to use its tools and adjust operational plans as needed to maintain the federal funds rate in the FOMC’s target range.\n\nIn addition to discussing open market operations today, I would also like to focus briefly on another key development in money markets—the transition away from LIBOR. I will highlight today’s announcement about the New York Fed’s proposal to produce averages for the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (commonly known as the SOFR).\n\nBefore I begin, I will remind you that the views presented here are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nOpen Market Operations in an Ample Reserves Regime\n\nI’d like to start with some context about how the FOMC planned its transition to an ample reserves operating regime for monetary policy implementation.\n\nIn January, the FOMC announced its intention to continue implementing monetary policy using an ample reserves operating regime. This means that the supply of reserves is sufficient to ensure that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the Federal Reserve’s administered rates, and active management of the supply of reserves is not required.2 This last clause is an important feature of the framework and means that, over time, the level of reserves will be large enough to absorb short-term changes in factors affecting the supply of reserves without the need for frequent, sizeable interventions to offset these changes (Figure 1).\n\nIn March, the FOMC indicated that the longer-run level of reserves will be a level consistent with “efficient and effective” implementation of monetary policy.3 To support a smooth transition to the longer-run level of reserves, the FOMC also stated its intention to slow the pace of the decline in reserves—which had been coming down as a result of normalizing the balance sheet—over subsequent quarters, first by slowing and then by stopping the reduction in the Federal Reserve’s aggregate securities holdings. The end of balance sheet runoff occurred in August, and the FOMC continued to monitor a wide range of information to reach a judgement about the level of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation in an ample reserves regime.4\n\nIn mid-September, upward pressure emerged in funding markets as corporate tax payments and the settlement of Treasury securities increased demand for securities financing and sharply reduced reserves in the system. Consistent with the directive from the FOMC, the Desk responded with temporary open market operations to foster conditions that would maintain the federal funds rate within the target range. In mid-October, the FOMC directed the Desk to maintain over time reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September in order to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample.5 The FOMC judged this level more supportive of smooth market functioning and effective control over the federal funds rate, and we have seen money market pressures stabilize.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the quantity of reserves needed to maintain an ample reserves framework is subject to uncertainty and may change over time. Banks’ demand for reserves is not static. It shifts in response to changing financial conditions and will evolve through time as banks adjust their business models and respond to changes in the economic and regulatory environment. In addition, the level of reserves needed to maintain an ample reserves regime is more than the sum of individual banks’ reserves demand, particularly when there are frictions that result in inefficient redistribution of reserves. The measurement of these factors is complex, and the FOMC will continue to monitor a broad range of information to assess the level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective implementation of policy.\n\nI’d like to turn now to how the Desk will supply reserves to carry out the FOMC’s directive to maintain reserves over time “at or above” the level that prevailed in early September. This directive requires provision of a supply of reserves that can sufficiently absorb normal fluctuations in non-reserve liabilities, so shifts in these balances do not bring reserves below desired levels and potentially compromise effective interest rate control.\n\nThe Desk has been directed to purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year to achieve the FOMC’s objective, and we are currently executing those reserve management purchases at the initial pace of $60 billion per month.6,7 I’d like to share some thoughts on the composition and sizing of those purchases.\n\nFirst, why Treasury bills?\n\nAs I noted earlier, the goal of the reserve management purchases is to maintain an ample supply of reserves to support effective and efficient monetary policy implementation.\n\nBecause Treasury bills are short-dated instruments, purchases of these securities can help maintain the supply of reserves while limiting the impact on financial conditions. Moreover, bills are liquid instruments with deep markets, and the Federal Reserve doesn’t currently hold many of them. The Federal Reserve traditionally held a relatively large portfolio of Treasury bills (in addition to holdings across the coupon curve) in its System Open Market Account (SOMA), but sold or redeemed that bill portfolio during the Global Financial Crisis and in the Maturity Extension Program. While the FOMC has not yet made decisions about the long-run composition of its domestic securities portfolio, current bill holdings in the SOMA are low by any measure.8 Treasury bills represent less than 3 percent of the SOMA’s Treasury portfolio, compared to 15 percent of the outstanding Treasury universe (Figure 2). From a portfolio composition perspective, these purchases will incrementally add bills back to the portfolio as the FOMC continues to consider its desired long-run maturity composition.\n\nSecond, how do we approach the design of our purchases?\n\nAt present, three elements are driving the overall size of the reserve management purchases:\n\nFirst, reserve management purchases will replace over time the reserves that repo operations are currently supplying. In October, overnight and term repo operations together resulted in a daily average of around $190 billion in total repos outstanding (Figure 3). In the near term, these operations have boosted the supply of reserves and helped to mitigate the risk of money market pressures adversely affecting monetary policy implementation (Figure 4).\nSecond, reserve management purchases will support expected gradual increases in demand for the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities, like currency in circulation, the Treasury General Account, the foreign repo pool, and other deposits. All else equal, growth of non-reserve liabilities will reduce reserves over time. Therefore, to maintain steady reserve levels, the Desk will offset the reserve-draining effects of growth in these liabilities through securities purchases—the same way Treasury purchases supported trend balance sheet growth before the crisis.9 Taken together, non-reserve liabilities currently add up to around $2.5 trillion. Currency in circulation is the largest and fastest growing of these—accounting for more than $1.7 trillion (or about seven-tenths) of the total, and growing at an average annual pace of over 6 percent in recent years (Figure 5). Offsetting currency growth alone will result in over $100 billion in purchases per year. However, other non-reserve liabilities have also exhibited trend growth over time, and additional purchases will account for this as well.\nThird, reserve management purchases will provide reserves to absorb normal variability or unexpected changes in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities so reserves don’t fall below the level needed to operate the ample reserves framework. Figure 6 shows how variability in our non-reserve liabilities has grown in recent years. Balances in the Treasury’s General Account (TGA), in particular, fluctuate greatly from day to day. We saw that in September, when tax payment and Treasury settlement-related flows into the TGA reduced reserves by over $115 billion in the course of two days. In order to maintain reserve levels at or above those that prevailed in early September, reserves will be increased to a level that can absorb such variation when it occurs. Absent a sufficient supply, reserve balances could become too scarce, requiring large temporary open market operations to address funding pressures on days when there are large swings in reserves, like tax payment dates.\nIn practice, this will mean looking out over several months and sizing reserve management purchases to offset expected reserve declines. For example, reserve balances tend to decline notably in late April as the TGA grows with the collection of individual taxes, and the Desk’s planned purchases over the next several months will help to offset the anticipated decline in reserves associated with those flows.\n\nBesides estimating the total amount of purchases, the Desk also needs to determine the pace at which it will execute those purchases. The amount and timing of the operations take into account market functioning considerations and allow for some adjustments around periods with sharp expected declines in reserves or liquidity conditions.\n\nSo far, reserve management purchase operations have proceeded smoothly. The Desk has purchased $52.5 billion of the initial $60 billion in monthly purchases, through seven purchase operations of roughly $7.5 billion each. To date, those operations have generated strong offer-to-cover ratios, pricing that has been favorable relative to market and theoretical prices, and broad participation and awards from your firms. Moreover, the Treasury bill market is accustomed to shifting amounts of securities available for purchase due to seasonal dynamics related to TGA inflows and outflows and the debt ceiling, and we’ve seen market prices adjust as we expected given the flow of our planned purchases. With roughly $2.4 trillion of Treasury bills outstanding and daily turnover of around $95 billion, the bill market has substantial capacity to support our activity, and we expect to be able to maintain the current pace of Treasury bill purchases for some time.10\n\nThat said, the Desk is prepared to adjust the pace and other parameters of the reserve management purchases as necessary to maintain an ample supply of reserves and based on money market conditions. We’ll be closely monitoring the attractiveness of propositions and indicators of market functioning to assess whether operational adjustments are appropriate.\n\nIn the meantime, because it will take some time for the bill purchases to sustain the supply of reserves at or above levels prevailing in early September, the FOMC has also instructed the Desk to continue offering term and overnight repo operations at least through January. Repo operations foster conditions to maintain the federal funds rate within the target range through two channels. First, they supply reserves in support of the FOMC’s operating regime, helping to ensure that reserves are maintained over time in amounts at or above the early September levels, even in the face of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities.11 Second, they provide funding in repo markets to damp repo market pressure that could otherwise pass-through to the federal funds market and adversely affect policy implementation.\n\nThe repo operations have successfully offset supply changes and money market pressures associated with big anticipated drops in reserves, such as around mid-month and month-end settlements. In doing so, they have been effective at restoring calm in money markets and maintaining control over the federal funds rate. Overnight and term money market rates have moderated, on average, relative to IOER, and the effective federal funds rate has stayed well within the FOMC’s target range. Participation in the repo operations has been robust and the transmission to broader money markets has been good.\n\nOn October 23, the Desk announced an increase in the amount offered in overnight repo operations from at least $75 billion to at least $120 billion. We also increased the amount offered in the remaining term repo operations spanning the October month-end from at least $35 billion per operation to $45 billion, raising the total amount of term repos offered over this period to up to $180 billion. This increased capacity was supportive to money markets, and the federal funds rate was stable over October's month-end.\n\nAs we head into year-end, the Desk will continue to make adjustments as needed to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. It is good to see firms starting to address year-end funding needs, and we understand that, as firms manage their balance sheets more carefully in December, rates can be somewhat more variable and dealers may adjust their approach to our operations. We will monitor conditions closely and will be prepared to adapt open market operations as needed to meet the directives from the FOMC.\n\nAverages of SOFR Rates and the Transition from LIBOR\n\nBefore I wrap up, I’d like to say a few words about reference rates. As I noted to this group last year, the New York Fed is committed to producing robust and resilient reference rates and to supporting the transition away from LIBOR.12 New York Fed President John Williams has emphasized this issue, noting that while progress has been made, there is still much work to do, and with no guarantee of LIBOR’s existence beyond the end of 2021, the clock is ticking.13\n\nThe New York Fed helps advance these objectives as the administrator and producer of the SOFR, which was selected by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) as its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR, and also, in coordination with the Federal Reserve Board, through support of the ARRC. The SOFR, which launched in April 2018, is a measure of the general cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities in the repo market—a rate that broadly reflects how financial institutions fund themselves. Importantly, it reflects underlying transaction volumes averaging more than $1 trillion per day over the past year, and its production is compliant with IOSCO’s Principles for Financial Benchmarks. Over the past year-and-a-half, SOFR futures markets have demonstrated promising growth in notional volumes traded and liquidity, even if volumes remain low compared to both federal funds and Eurodollar futures. Additionally, there has been meaningful issuance of SOFR-linked cash products like floating rate notes.\n\nA next step in supporting broader adoption of the SOFR as a LIBOR alternative will be to meet the need expressed by market participants—particularly financial and corporate issuers of securities and loans—for a set of SOFR averages that can be used in a wide range of financial products.14 To this end, today, the New York Fed released a solicitation for public comment on a plan to publish daily, starting in the first half of 2020, a set of three compounded averages of the SOFR, as well as a daily SOFR index that would allow users to calculate compounded averages over custom time periods.15\n\nAn expansion to the suite of reference rates we produce is an important next step that further demonstrates the Federal Reserve’s commitment to support the usefulness of adopting the SOFR. I also urge you to commit to this critical endeavor. The comment period for the public solicitation will close on December 4, and I encourage you to review the proposal and provide feedback, including about the tenors and compounding methodology for the new products. While the response to preliminary socialization of the program parameters has been positive, we recognize the importance of getting these averages right. Market participant feedback was critical as the New York Fed began producing Treasury repo reference rates to support the transition, and your continued input will help ensure that the rates we produce best meet the needs of the financial system. More generally, every market participant needs to understand their LIBOR exposures and use all available tools to transition to robust alternative rates, such as the SOFR, as they prepare for a world without LIBOR.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, the Desk continues to operationalize the FOMC’s ample reserves regime. We are doing this by conducting Treasury bill purchases to maintain a supply of reserves consistent with the FOMC’s directive to maintain reserves at or above early-September levels. Also, since it will take some time to accumulate securities holdings to achieve that objective, the Desk is continuing to provide reserves temporarily through overnight and term repo operations. We are monitoring market conditions closely, have tools to effectively and efficiently support monetary policy implementation, and will make adjustments as needed. Both in the execution of open market operations and support for the transition from LIBOR, it is a very active time on the Desk, and our partnership with each of your institutions remains important to the smooth implementation of this work.\n\nFigures PDF\n\n\n1 I would like to thank Deborah Leonard for her assistance in preparing these remarks, and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for valuable comments and suggestions.\n\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, January 30, 2019.\n\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans, March 20, 2019.\n\n4 In its March update, the FOMC further explained that once it judged that reserves had reached a level consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation, it would begin increasing securities holdings once again to keep pace with trend growth of the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities and maintain an appropriate level of reserves in the system.\n\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation, October 11, 2019.\n\n6 Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Statement Regarding Treasury Bill Purchases and Repurchase Operations, October 11, 2019.\n\n7 We also continue to purchase Treasury securities across maturities (including bills) and security types to execute the FOMC’s directive to reinvest principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month in Treasury securities.\n\n8 Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, April 30-May 1, 2019, summarize the FOMC’s continued discussion of issues related to balance sheet normalization, including the maturity composition of its portfolio.

Mechanically, the claim against the Federal Reserve shifts from banks (who hold reserve balances) to other economic actors such as the public (who holds currency), the Treasury Department (who holds balances in its General Account), foreign official institutions (who invest their dollar-denominated foreign currency reserves in reverse repos with the Federal Reserve), or certain other financial entities, including government-sponsored enterprises and designated financial market utilities (who hold deposit accounts at the Federal Reserve).

    "text": "Remarks at the Policy Conference on Currencies, Capital, and Central Bank Balances, Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, CaliforniaAs prepared for delivery\nGood afternoon and thank you for inviting me to join this panel. \n\nThe panel’s topic—what we are normalizing to—is a key issue facing central banks as they normalize monetary policy after the crisis, and I hope to bring to this discussion an operational perspective from my position on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Open Market Trading Desk.  I will highlight three points:  First, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, once normalized, is likely to be smaller than it is today but considerably larger than it was before the crisis, regardless of the type of operating regime the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC or Committee) adopts in the long run.  Second, while the FOMC could maintain interest rate control through a corridor system for its longer run monetary policy implementation framework, it would require a lot of learning by doing and would be unlikely to look like our pre-crisis corridor system.  And third, based on what we’ve learned from operating a floor system thus far, it appears that this type of system can provide effective control of rates with operational simplicity.  Before I continue, I should note that the views presented here are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nLast October, the Federal Reserve began the process of reducing the size of its balance sheet—a significant milestone in the ongoing monetary policy normalization process.  Using a program of progressively increasing caps, we are gradually reducing the Fed’s securities holdings, which will reduce the supply of reserve balances in the banking system.2   This process will continue until reserves fall to a level that reflects the banking system’s demand for reserve balances and the FOMC’s decisions about how to implement monetary policy “most efficiently and effectively,” as noted in the FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.\n\nHowever, there remains much uncertainty over what the “normal” size of the Fed’s longer-run balance sheet will be and how long it will take to get there.  This uncertainty arises from numerous sources:  We don’t know how fast our MBS holdings will pay down, how quickly currency outstanding will grow, how many bank reserves will be required for the efficient and effective execution of monetary policy, or how other liability items on the Fed’s balance sheet will evolve.  The economic outlook also poses an ever-present source of uncertainty.\n\nAlthough the Committee has not yet specified what a normalized balance sheet will look like, market participants’ expectations may provide some helpful context.  The New York Fed’s most recent annual report on open market operations (released just a few weeks ago) presents a set of projections for possible paths of the Fed’s securities portfolio.3   As seen in Figure 1, the report shows three scenarios constructed from distributions of market participants’ surveyed expectations for the future size of the balance sheet.4   Survey-based expectations for the path of interest rates and some staff modeling fill in additional details.  While these scenarios by no means embody the full range of possible outcomes, they suggest the domestic securities portfolio’s size could normalize at $2.5 trillion to $3.3 trillion, with the larger end of that range projected to be reached within two years.  After its normalized size is reached, the portfolio is assumed to incrementally grow again as Treasury securities are purchased to keep pace with trend growth in liabilities, mainly currency.5\n\nThe projection exercise illustrates a key point:  The Fed’s future balance sheet will likely be considerably larger than its pre-crisis level.  This outcome is likely regardless of the design of the operating regime that the Committee ultimately uses to manage short-term interest rates.  The normalized size will be determined by the liability side of the Fed’s balance sheet, which will reflect two driving factors:  Growth in non-reserve liabilities, and a potential shift in the structural demand for reserves.\n\nFirst, there has been substantial growth in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities in recent years, and some factors are expected to grow further, as seen in Figure 2.  U.S. dollar currency in circulation tends to grow over time and has more than doubled since the start of the global financial crisis, to a current level of $1.6 trillion.6   The median survey response implies an expectation for currency to grow to around $1.8 trillion at the time the size of the portfolio normalizes—in other words, the portfolio will need to be $1 trillion larger than before the crisis just to back currency in circulation.  Meanwhile, various account holders—including the Treasury Department, foreign and international official institutions, government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), and designated financial market utilities (DFMUs)—have increased their balances held in Federal Reserve accounts or investment services, which currently represent over $700 billion in additional liabilities.\n\nSecond, it is likely there has been a shift in the structural demand for reserves, driven largely by banks’ response to changes in regulations and risk appetite that favor safe assets, particularly reserves.  If the demand curve for reserves has indeed shifted out, the amount of reserves the Federal Reserve will need to supply to achieve a given interest rate target will be comparably larger than it once was.\n\nThe FOMC acknowledged in last June’s addendum to its Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that it anticipates a future level of reserve balances that is “appreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis.”7   In the three projection scenarios I’ve shown, reserve balances (as derived from market participants’ expectations) are assumed to be around $400 billion, $600 billion, and $750 billion once a normalized balance sheet size is reached, well below the current level of $2 trillion and consistent with the Committee’s statement.  However, we have insufficient information to identify what factors inform these views.\n\nTaking reserves and non-reserve liabilities together, I see virtually no chance of going back to the pre-crisis balance sheet size of $800 billion.  Thus, discussion of whether to have a large or small balance sheet in the long run partly misses the point.  The conversation is really about the relative amount of reserves, which will be governed both by the banking system’s demand for reserve balances—something we will learn more about during the process of balance sheet normalization—and by the Committee’s future decisions around how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively.\n\nDebates about monetary policy implementation regimes generally center on two frameworks, illustrated in stylized form in Figure 3.  The traditional framework—a version of which the Fed used before the crisis—is a corridor system, which is generally associated with a scarce supply of reserves.  Policy is implemented through frequent adjustments to the supply of reserves, such that the supply intersects the steep portion of the reserve demand curve at the desired overnight interest rate.  Fluctuations in reserves stemming from autonomous factors are borne by the private sector through the central bank’s open market operations.  In contrast, the framework used to implement policy today is a floor system, which is associated with an abundant supply of reserves and policy implementation that is achieved through periodic changes to administered rates.  A floor system is generally associated with a relatively larger balance sheet than a corridor system because the central bank needs to supply enough reserves to satisfy demand on the flat part of the reserve demand curve, perhaps with an additional buffer to accommodate reserve supply shocks.  Such shocks typically stem from fluctuations in other liabilities.8   However, we do not really know how large or small a difference in the amount of reserves would be needed to run an effective and efficient floor versus a corridor in the longer run.  The answer will depend critically on the shape of the demand curve, which we will learn more about over time, as well as the specific design parameters of either framework.\n\nI would emphasize that central banks have successfully implemented both types of frameworks, or variations of them, and that the Fed can achieve interest rate control with either one.  Leaving aside some of the broader policy considerations, I’d like to make a few points about the technical operation of each framework in the longer-run.\n\nFirst, some observers see a return to the Fed’s pre-crisis, reserve-scarce corridor system as the natural conclusion to the normalization process, highlighting that system’s familiarity.  But it is important to note that fundamental changes in the money market landscape over the past decade would likely make monetary policy implementation in a future corridor system look substantially different than before the crisis.\n\nIn the Fed’s pre-crisis regime, hitting the target federal funds rate each day was a technically challenging exercise.  Demand for reserves was driven largely by reserve requirements, in addition to intraday payment clearing needs.  We started with a banking system that on most days was short of reserves.  Then, using staff forecasts of various factors affecting the supply of and demand for reserves over multiple days ahead, we calibrated open market operations with the dealers in the repo market to bring the aggregate supply of reserves into balance at the target rate.  With this aggregate balance achieved, individual banks distributed them. Banks facing a deficiency of reserves needed to find and trade with banks holding reserve surpluses, each balancing the costs associated with holding too many or too few reserves.9, 10   We were reliably proficient in hitting the FOMC’s target rate in normal times, but interest rate control was more challenging at times when factors affecting reserves were harder to predict.  This was particularly true in the early stages of the crisis, when large changes in reserve demand caused significant intraday and interday swings in federal funds rates (Figure 4).11, 12\n\nToday, with greater uncertainty and variability in factors affecting the day-to-day demand for and supply of reserves, it would be more difficult to anticipate fluctuations and achieve the necessary balance in reserve conditions even in normal times.  In aggregate, reserve demand is likely to be guided by a more complex set of drivers, including post-crisis liquidity regulation, supervision, resolution planning, and intraday payments risk management.  These needs have the potential to contribute to higher and more variable demand for reserves than banks had before the crisis.13   Estimating reserve demand would need to take into account these factors, as well as banks’ propensities to substitute between reserves and other relevant assets—something that may vary according to an individual institution’s business strategy.  Knowledge about the shape, position, and stability of banks’ reserve demand curve will likely emerge only with experience. \n\nAdditionally, we would need to consider shocks that affect the supply of reserves, such as those stemming from changes in the Fed’s non-reserve liabilities. As seen in Figure 5, net changes in non-reserve liabilities have become more variable in recent years.14\n\nEven if fluctuations could be accurately forecast, in a corridor system, they would need to be offset through open market operations to maintain interest rate control.  Larger fluctuations would likely require larger operations.15   In the years before the crisis, the average size of daily overnight repo operations was around $5 billion—a relatively small amount given the size of the repo market and dealers’ net securities financing needs.  Roughly 95 percent of these operations were for less than $10 billion, and the maximum operation size in normal times was $20 billion.  Looking just at recent variability in non-reserve liabilities and assuming overnight operations were used to offset their fluctuations, daily temporary operations in a corridor system might routinely need to be around $25 billion, but could go as high as $100 billion.16   We would need to consider whether the Fed’s repo and reverse repo operations could be dependably scaled to that degree, and whether their effects would be transmitted to other rates. \n\nOne consideration in this regard is that there appear to be greater frictions across funding markets today.  Dealer balance sheets have shrunk and become less elastic in the face of changes in regulation and risk management.17   While dealer caution contributes to the overall safety and soundness of the banking sector, it could mean we would need more or different types of counterparties for traditional repo operations, or perhaps different types of operations altogether—particularly if federal funds trading became idiosyncratic or disconnected from other rates.  In sum, a reinstated corridor might look less familiar than some expect.\n\nFor comparison, let me make a few observations about our experience with the floor system that the Fed is currently using.  The FOMC has successfully raised its target range for the overnight federal funds rate six times since December 2015, and, as seen in Figure 6, the effective federal funds rate has reliably printed in the prevailing target range over that time.  The policy stance has transmitted to a broad constellation of money market rates.  The system is simple and efficient to operate.  The interest rate the Fed pays on excess reserves serves as the primary policy implementation tool, with support from a standing facility that offers overnight reverse repos (ON RRPs) at an administered rate.18   There is no need to forecast specific factors affecting reserves or to conduct discretionary open market operations each day; overnight reverse repos are offered every day based on price, not quantity.  Day-to-day fluctuations in factors affecting reserves are accommodated by the elastic reserve demand given that reserve needs are widely met.  Market forces keep the federal funds rate in the FOMC’s target range by allowing a wide range of counterparties to price trades against the alternative option of investing with the Federal Reserve.  And in the aggregate, use of the Fed’s balance sheet is efficient by allowing private and official sector market participants to determine their preferred distribution across the range of Fed liabilities.19\n\nThis system could continue to work well with considerably lower levels of reserves, so long as the supply continued to intersect the flat part of the demand curve.  If reserves fell too low, we could see high volumes of fed funds borrowing at interest rates well above the interest rate on excess reserves, which would indicate that we were no longer operating at the flat part of the demand curve.20   As I noted earlier, maintaining a buffer of excess reserves to absorb reserve-draining shocks could prevent this outcome.  An important trade-off arises between the size of that additional buffer and the frequency and size of open market operations.21\n\nTo sum up, the FOMC could choose to retain the floor system to implement policy in the longer-run or it could choose to shift back to a corridor system.  However, a reinstated corridor system may be less familiar than some expect.  Such a framework would involve uncertainties about reserve demand and greater variability in factors affecting reserve supply, and would likely require operations that are larger, more variable, or even very different from those used before the crisis.  Meanwhile, those who favor a floor system may be encouraged by the performance of our current framework to date.  We’ve learned that the floor system has proven to be highly effective at controlling the effective federal funds rate and other money market rates, is resilient to significant shifts in market structure, and is efficient to operate.  Under either framework, the balance sheet will likely normalize at a level substantially larger than it was before the crisis to accommodate higher demand for reserves and non-reserve liabilities in the post-crisis landscape.\n\nFigures PDF\n\n\n1 I would like to thank Deborah Leonard for her assistance in preparing these remarks, as well as colleagues in the Federal Reserve System, including Antoine Martin, Simon Potter, Julie Remache, and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, for comments and suggestions.\n\n2 Principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings each month are reinvested only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising caps, laid out in a schedule in the June 2017 addendum to the FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. Around the time the caps reach their maximum levels in October 2018, Treasury reinvestments will typically occur only in mid-quarter months, while agency MBS reinvestments are projected to end altogether (assuming no downward shock in longer-term interest rates).\n\n3 See the report and accompanying data file, Open Market Operations during 2017, Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\n4 The scenarios represent the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the combined responses to the New York Fed’s December 2017 Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants. The surveys asked respondents to provide their expectations for the composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, on average in 2025, conditional on not moving to the zero lower bound at any point between now and the end of 2025.\n\n5 Treasury securities would also be purchased to offset the ongoing runoff of the Fed’s holdings of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. Such rebalancing will support the continuing normalization of the composition of the Fed’s securities portfolio, a process that is expected to take longer than normalization of the portfolio’s size. The FOMC has stated that it intends to hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run.\n\n6 The December 2017 survey responses used in the three scenarios shown here imply average annual currency growth rates of 2.6 percent, 4.6 percent, and 5.8 percent through 2025—a deceleration from the actual average annual growth rate of roughly 7 percent over the past five years.\n\n7 See the FOMC’s Communications related to Policy Normalization.\n\n8 All else equal, changes in non-reserve liabilities have the opposite effect on the supply of reserves.\n\n9 Reserve averaging over a two-week maintenance period provided a buffer around how precise the final distribution of reserves needed to be on any given day. Nonetheless, falling short of reserves could incur penalties or the need to borrow reserves at what might be relatively high rates, and since reserve balances were not remunerated, there was a steep opportunity cost to holding excess reserves.\n\n10 The degree to which such interbank trading, aimed at fulfilling a requirement imposed by the central bank, reflected fundamentals versus idiosyncratic factors is hard to assess. This ambiguity may obscure the value of its signal on market rates. Simon Potter explores this issue in Discussion of ‘Evaluating Monetary Policy Operational Frameworks’ by Ulrich Bindseil, 2016 Economic Policy Symposium, Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 25-27, 2016.\n\n11 Challenges operating in this environment are described by the SOMA Manager in FOMC meeting transcripts from September 18, 2007 and throughout the crisis. See also Spence Hilton, Recent Developments in Federal Reserve System Liquidity and Reserve Operations, Reserve Bank of Australia Conference, 2008.\n\n12 A separate operational consequence of the corridor system, revealed during the crisis, is that it can constrain the Fed’s ability to provide the types of lender-of-last-resort backstops that can help support financial stability. Accommodating broad-based, open-ended lending in a corridor system raises the need to drain any reserve additions to keep the federal funds rate close to the FOMC’s target, thus posing a tradeoff between the Fed’s monetary policy and liquidity provision objectives. New York Fed President Bill Dudley recently highlighted this challenge in Important Choices for the Federal Reserve in the Years Ahead, remarks at Lehman College, Bronx, New York, April 18, 2018.\n\n13 Bech and Keister explore the links between open market operations and short-term interest rate changes when banks face the possibility of a Liquidity Coverage Ratio shortfall in Liquidity Regulation and the Implementation of Monetary Policy, BIS Working Paper No. 432, October 2013.\n\n14 Increased variability arises from several changes over the past decade. Since 2008, the Treasury Department has managed its cash flows through the Treasury General Account (TGA) at the Fed; balances in the TGA exhibit significant volatility, typically rising when auctions of Treasury securities settle and on tax receipt dates, and shrinking when large payments are made. (Prior to 2008, the Treasury targeted a steady, low balance in the TGA. It also maintained private accounts, which absorbed the variability in cash flows.) DFMUs have gained access to Reserve Bank accounts since the crisis, and GSEs now pre-position funds in their Fed accounts prior to making principal and interest payments. Overnight reverse repos have been introduced as a monetary policy implementation tool. Additionally, in response to foreign central banks’ preferences to maintain robust dollar liquidity buffers and the reduced availability of alternative investments with private counterparties, the New York Fed has applied a less restrictive approach to the management of the foreign repo pool (a long-standing investment service through which foreign official and international account holders’ balances are swept into overnight reverse repos).\n\n15 Changes in other features of the system could potentially help to smooth conditions, for example, certain alterations to the reserves averaging framework might allow the system to absorb more volatility.\n\n16 These estimates are based on variability of liabilities that are outside the direct control of the Fed (such as currency, the Treasury General Account, the foreign repo pool, and other deposits) and capital. They exclude reserves and liabilities associated with monetary policy instruments (such as overnight and term reverse repos conducted with private counterparties and term deposits held by depository institutions).\n\n17 Committee on the Global Financial System, Structural Changes in Banking after the Crisis, CGFS papers, No. 60, January 2018.\n\n18 The ON RRP facility helps to reinforce the floor under market interest rates by establishing an important investment option for a wide range of active lenders in short-term funding markets, including certain types of nonbank institutions that are not eligible to earn interest on reserves. Take-up in ON RRP operations is sensitive to the pricing of the Fed’s reverse repos relative to the pricing and availability of comparable money market investments, including private repo, Treasury bills, and agency debt. Even with near-zero usage, as has been seen in recent months, the ON RRP facility supports market rates by ensuring that counterparties demand rates on other investments at least as attractive as the rate offered on the Federal Reserve’s ON RRPs.\n\n19 In a preliminary discussion about the long-run monetary policy implementation framework, FOMC participants commented on the advantages of an approach to policy implementation similar to the one currently in use, in which the active management of reserves would not be required. Such an approach was seen as “likely to be relatively simple and efficient to administer, relatively straightforward to communicate, and effective in enabling interest rate control across a wide range of circumstances.” However, policymakers made no decisions and acknowledged that they expected to learn from additional experience. See Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, November 1-2, 2016.\n\n20 We should also recognize that the fed funds rate might occasionally firm somewhat due to increases in interest rates in other money markets, which can affect the fed funds rate via arbitrage. Such developments are not necessarily a sign that reserves are becoming scarce. It is therefore important to understand dynamics not only in the fed funds market, but also across a broader range of money market instruments and transmission across them. Simon Potter features some such analysis in Money Markets at a Crossroads: Policy Implementation at a Time of Structural Change, remarks at the Master of Applied Economics’ Distinguished Speaker Series, University of California, Los Angeles, April 5, 2017.\n\n21 I discuss these issues in more detail in Implementing Monetary Policy: Perspective from the Open Market Trading Desk, remarks before the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York City, May 18, 2017."

    "text": "Dallas Fed President Lorie K. Logan delivered these remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 2025 Financial Markets Conference in Amelia Island, Florida.\nIt’s a pleasure to be back at this excellent conference. Thank you, Raphael [Bostic], for inviting me. And thank you to the organizers for putting together this panel of expert speakers:\n\nLou Crandall, chief economist of Wrightson ICAP;\nDeirdre Dunn, head of global rates at Citigroup Global Markets and chair of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee;\nand my former longtime colleague at the New York Fed, Nate Wuerffel, who is now head of market structure at BNY.\nI’m looking forward to a rich discussion.\n\nOur topic this afternoon is a timely one: the role of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) in Treasury and money markets. Before we jump in, I’d like to offer a few remarks to frame the conversation. As always, these are my views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nThe Treasury market and money markets sit at the very core of the financial system. The Treasury market finances the U.S. government, provides a safe and liquid asset relied on by investors worldwide, and creates a benchmark for broader long-term interest rates. Money markets establish overnight risk-free interest rates that are building blocks for all other asset prices, they keep credit flowing through the economy by financing a wide range of assets, and they are where the Fed implements the stance of monetary policy. And these markets are tightly linked because one of the main money markets is the repo market, where Treasury securities are financed.\n\nThese markets are extraordinarily strong, deep and liquid, as befits their systemic role. But they are not invulnerable. Observers have cited potential fault lines including limited intermediation capacity, buildups of leverage and uneven risk management.\n\nWhen economic shocks occur, market participants often seek to transfer large amounts of risk and raise large amounts of liquidity in Treasury and money markets. Such a surge in demand for intermediation requires an elastic supply of intermediation. Yet since the Global Financial Crisis, the balance sheet capacity of bank-affiliated dealers has not kept pace with growth in the amount of Treasury securities outstanding. So there is the potential—as we saw, for example, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic—for the demand for intermediation to overwhelm the supply of intermediation and create market dysfunction.\n\nIn principle, approaches to enhancing the resilience of intermediation capacity could address both banks and nonbanks. I’m sure our panelists and I could fill an entire session with ideas on bank intermediation. But our focus today is going to be the rest of the market: the nonbanks. I’m looking forward to a robust discussion of the state of Treasury intermediation by NBFIs and what can be done to strengthen it.\n\nExcessive leverage can amplify challenges from insufficiently elastic intermediation in stress episodes. Perhaps precisely because repo markets ordinarily function so well and Treasury securities are so safe and liquid, it is possible for NBFIs to obtain large amounts of leverage against them. Yet levered positions can be prone to unwind rapidly, adding to intermediation demands. Buildups of NBFI leverage in trades such as the cash-futures basis can, therefore, be cause for concern if the risks are not managed appropriately. Some observers had voiced worries about such a buildup earlier this year, so it was reassuring to see that the basis trade did not materially amplify the market volatility we experienced in early April.\n\nStrong risk management mitigates vulnerabilities from leverage, and the Securities and Exchange Commission mandate for broader central clearing marks an important step to strengthen risk management in the Treasury cash and repo markets. Data collected by the Office of Financial Research shows that a large fraction of noncentrally cleared bilateral repos are conducted with no haircut. In some circumstances, other components of a cash borrower’s portfolio may effectively provide the margin on these trades. But that is not always the case. And repos that are margined on a portfolio basis could be more difficult to move to different counterparties in times of stress. Broader central clearing will ensure risk management is stronger, more uniform and therefore more resilient.\n\nIn our conversation today, I’ll be interested to hear how our panelists think the transition to broader clearing is proceeding and how it’s influencing the overall structure and resilience of the market. I hope we can also explore other ideas to enhance risk management, such as the recent proposal on best practices from the Treasury Market Practices Group.\n\nLastly, as my Fed colleague Roberto Perli, manager of the System Open Market Account, noted in a recent speech, resilient funding liquidity makes the market as a whole more resilient. A strong Federal Reserve monetary policy implementation framework forms an important part of that resilience by ensuring ample liquidity will remain available across money markets at rates within or near the target range for the fed funds rate. In my view, rate control is not just about keeping the fed funds rate in the target range. The fed funds market is small. And the FOMC’s desired stance of monetary policy must transmit smoothly into larger and broader markets—especially the repo market.\n\nThe Fed’s rate control framework has two main components: The ample supply of reserves generally keeps money market rates close to the interest rate on reserve balances. And the standing ceiling facilities—the discount window, the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) and the Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) repo facility—help prevent rate spikes in the event of large, unexpected shocks to reserve supply, demand or distribution.\n\nThe ceiling tools have proven their effectiveness over time. However, I see some opportunities to strengthen them further.\n\nDepository institutions have greatly improved their operational readiness to borrow from the discount window. We should continue to reinforce the value of operational readiness so firms maintain these gains. And readiness is a partnership. At the Federal Reserve Banks, we are working to enhance our capacity to serve customers efficiently when they come to borrow, drawing on feedback received through a recent Request for Information by the Board of Governors. We should also continue to emphasize that borrowing from the window is an appropriate way for healthy banks to meet short-term funding needs—not something investors, ratings agencies or supervisors should criticize or question.\n\nWe can also enhance the SRF. As Roberto described in his recent speech, experiments and market outreach by the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk have found that conducting and settling the SRF operation in the morning, in addition to the current afternoon timing, makes the facility more effective by addressing intraday funding needs. I’m pleased that, as Roberto announced earlier this month, the Desk plans to soon introduce regular early-settlement SRF operations.\n\nCentral clearing of SRF operations would also make the facility more attractive and enhance rate control. That’s because central clearing would allow bank-affiliated dealers to net down their balance sheets when they borrow from the SRF and lend onward to other firms. Desk outreach has found that the lack of netting is one of several reasons why counterparties currently report high hurdle rates for borrowing from the SRF, along with reporting requirements and supervisory considerations. I’d also note that, although the SEC’s clearing mandate does not apply to the Fed, centrally clearing Fed operations on a voluntary basis would align with and support the market transition. I’ll be interested to hear our panelists’ perspectives on how to make the Fed’s tools as effective as possible.\n\nWith that, let’s turn to our conversation. I’d like to start with the big picture. How did markets, and especially non-bank participants, handle the high volatility and large flows in early April? And what’s the outlook for NBFIs in the years ahead? Deirdre, I’ll ask you to start with your view on Treasury markets, and then we’ll turn to Lou for an assessment of money markets."

    "text": "Remarks at SIFMA WebinarAs prepared for delivery\nIt is a pleasure to join you virtually today. I’m grateful to SIFMA for the kind invitation to discuss the Federal Reserve’s ongoing asset purchases and to all of you here today for your interest in the smooth functioning of financial markets.1\n\nIn response to the severe economic shock associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve is committed to using all of its tools to achieve its goals of maximum employment and price stability. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has cut the target range for the federal funds rate close to zero. Additionally, the Fed has taken a wide range of steps—many in coordination with the U.S. Treasury—to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments. These steps have targeted many different parts of the financial system and economy. Liquidity tools are supporting funding markets. Credit facilities are helping to ensure that small businesses, corporations, and state and local governments have access to credit. And, regulations have been temporarily adjusted to encourage bank lending. Another important measure, and the focus of my talk today, is the asset purchases that we have conducted at an unprecedented scale and speed to support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS)—both of which play crucial roles in the American financial system and economy.\n\nIn early to mid-March, amid extreme volatility across the financial system, the functioning of Treasury and agency MBS markets became severely impaired. Given the importance of these markets, continued dysfunction would have led to an even deeper and broader seizing up of credit markets and ultimately worsened the financial hardships that many Americans have been experiencing as a result of the pandemic.2 The FOMC responded quickly and decisively with substantial purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS, and then demonstrated an even more forceful commitment to market functioning by directing the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) to make purchases “in the amounts needed to support the smooth functioning of markets” for those securities.3\n\nAsset purchases are a standard tool of monetary policy implementation. Traditionally, the Desk has used Treasury purchases to maintain the supply of reserves in accordance with the FOMC’s policy implementation regime. Following the Global Financial Crisis, the FOMC used asset purchases primarily to exert downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, or in the case of MBS to ease mortgage rates, when the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound. The purchases during this most recent episode have been distinct in both their purpose, to address disruptions in market functioning, and their scale and speed, which have been unparalleled. As shown in Figure 1, System Open Market Account (SOMA) securities holdings grew at an extraordinary pace, with purchases totaling more than $100 billion on some days. Cumulatively, the purchases since mid-March have totaled $1.7 trillion of Treasuries and more than $800 billion of agency MBS,4 which represents the vast majority of the overall $2.6 trillion increase in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet since then, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nTo assess the pace of purchases needed to support market functioning, we used extensive metrics along with our best judgment. The initial rapid pace of purchases was motivated by a severe breakdown in the functioning of these markets. As market functioning improved, we substantially slowed our pace of purchases. Most recently, at its June meeting, the FOMC decided to increase holdings of Treasuries and agency MBS “at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning.”\n\nToday, I’d like to talk about the disruption we saw and the steps we took in response. I will focus on three broad questions. First, what is smooth market functioning and why does it matter? Second, how have our asset purchases supported smooth market functioning? And third, how will we structure purchases to sustain market functioning over coming months and remain vigilant against renewed deterioration? Let me note that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Is Smooth Market Functioning, and Why Does it Matter?\n\nBefore I describe our response to the recent crisis, I want to share how we think about smooth functioning in Treasury and agency MBS markets, and why it is so critical to the U.S. economy. I’ll focus on what we perceive as two important characteristics of smoothly functioning markets: liquidity and efficient pricing.5\n\nLiquidity comes in many forms. One form of liquidity is the availability of financing for existing or new positions. I think of this as funding liquidity. Another form of liquidity is the ease with which assets can be bought and sold, often called market liquidity. Although these concepts are distinct, they are related and reinforcing.6 When funding liquidity is abundant, market participants can finance the transactions that produce market liquidity. My comments today focus on how we have used asset purchases to support market liquidity, but I do want to note that the steps the Federal Reserve took at the same time to support funding markets almost certainly contributed to market liquidity. In fact, funding markets are now functioning quite well. As a result, as you can see in Figure 3, which is a close-up of my previous chart, our repo book has rolled off over recent months and is now down to zero, and usage of most other funding programs has also diminished.\n\nLiquid markets allow participants to transact quickly and at low cost, so they can easily adjust their positions in response to their own changing circumstances or broader economic developments. In normal conditions, the markets for Treasury securities and MBS are highly liquid. Confidence in the liquidity of Treasuries persuades investors to accept lower yields on these securities,7 and because Treasury interest rates are a benchmark for many other rates, these lower yields ultimately reduce borrowing costs for families, businesses, and state and local governments. Similarly, the liquidity of agency MBS helps investors to transact quickly and efficiently in residential mortgage loans, which results in lower mortgage interest rates for households. Supporting the liquidity of these markets has been an important component of the Federal Reserve’s actions to bolster the flow of credit and the effective transmission of monetary policy during the pandemic.\n\nTurning to efficient pricing, one can always debate whether any given asset price is right. However, we generally expect prices of instruments with identical or very similar cash flows to be closely connected, so opportunities for arbitrage are limited, and relative value spreads are small. In smoothly functioning markets, if prices of related instruments diverge, arbitrageurs sell the securities with high prices and buy those with low prices, profiting from the difference and pushing the prices back together. When arbitrage breaks down, the resulting mispricings make financial markets less useful for risk management and investment, which can ultimately restrict the flow of capital in the economy.\n\nIn practice, market liquidity is never perfect, and pricing discrepancies are never entirely eliminated. Liquidity providers—who buy securities from clients who wish to sell, and then look for other clients who wish to buy—are compensated for this service in the form of bid-ask spreads or other transaction costs. Likewise, investors do not exploit all arbitrage opportunities, because arbitrage typically requires capital and funding and entails transaction costs, as well as the risk of loss if the price difference widens rather than narrows. As a result, prices of closely related securities can sometimes diverge. Still, when the Treasury and agency MBS markets are functioning smoothly, transaction costs and price divergences should typically be small.\n\nMarkets are complex. No one indicator can show whether a given market is functioning smoothly. On the Desk, we use a suite of complementary categories of indicators to assess the functioning of Treasury and agency MBS markets. Without diving too deeply into these indicators, I’ve summarized the categories in Figure 4. The first category includes direct measures of liquidity, such as bid-ask spreads, price impact coefficients and market depth.8 The second category includes direct measures of relative value, such as the Treasury cash-futures basis, on-the-run spreads, spline errors, and MBS-Treasury yield spreads. The remaining categories contain indirect metrics. Instead of showing how well markets are functioning, these metrics reveal forces that can lead to breakdowns of liquidity and efficient pricing. In particular, we look at measures of trading pressure, which can show whether there is an imbalance between the volume of sales and the volume of purchases, and at the results of our open market operations, which can provide signals about the intensity of market participants’ desire to sell securities as well as other market conditions.\n\nHow Have the Federal Reserve’s Asset Purchases Supported Smooth Market Functioning?\n\nThe extreme shock to the economy and financial markets as the pandemic spread in early March led to a swift and severe deterioration in the functioning of the Treasury and MBS markets. Pessimism and uncertainty about the economic outlook as large segments of the economy were shut down, combined with concerns about markets’ ability to keep functioning in a remote environment, resulted in a strong desire for cash. In addition, the extreme volatility and its effect on risk metrics and margins meant that some normally profitable trades were no longer viable.\n\nInvestors and asset managers responded by rebalancing their portfolios, deleveraging, and acquiring the most liquid short-dated assets. In this environment, we saw a historically large flow of investor sales of Treasuries, as shown in Figure 5, as well as MBS. There were also notable sales by foreign reserve managers, whose Treasury securities held in custody at the Fed, shown in Figure 6, fell sharply during March. The flow strained the capacity of dealers and other liquidity providers to intermediate on normal terms. The challenges were particularly notable in off-the-run Treasuries, a sector where some dealers at times were reportedly reluctant to make markets at all. As a result, market functioning indicators were quite poor, as illustrated in Figure 7. Bid-ask spreads for Treasuries, in the left panel, and for agency MBS, in the right panel, both showed extraordinary increases. Relative value measures also widened notably, with prices appearing to diverge from fundamentals in some cases, as demonstrated by the Treasury cash-futures basis in Figure 8.9\n\nAt the FOMC’s direction, the Desk rapidly ramped up asset purchases to address these conditions. For the first few weeks, we had much to learn about how to maximize the effectiveness of purchases. We quickly adjusted operations based on our observations, and although it’s fair to say that at first we were mostly stabilizing market functioning, the purchases soon began to make meaningful improvements. As I’ll discuss in a moment, I think our flexibility itself played an important role in supporting market confidence.\n\nI’ve been pleased to see that the functioning of Treasury and MBS markets has now rebounded notably. I was also pleased to see that, in the end, financial markets and infrastructures were able to continue operating even as the industry shifted, en masse, to working from home. Measures of market liquidity have uniformly improved and are now well below their worst points, though some remain more stressed than at the start of the year. In talking with our contacts, we hear that the lingering effects of the extraordinary volatility in March and the uncertain financial environment are limiting improvements in some liquidity metrics by reducing the appetite to take the risks associated with making markets. Relative value spreads have also narrowed substantially, though as with liquidity, some metrics remain higher than before the pandemic.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s purchases have supported smooth market functioning through multiple channels. The purchases absorbed some of the flow of sales and helped restore two-way trading, which supports liquidity. In addition to absorbing a flow of securities, the purchases changed the stock of assets held by the private sector. Because the Desk accepts offers on securities with attractive prices, our operations can have the effect of buying undervalued securities and reducing price distortions.10\n\nBut these direct effects are not the only channels through which we think our purchases helped. The design of the purchase program also appeared to reduce market stress. I’d highlight two key aspects of the program in this regard: commitment and flexibility. The FOMC’s unlimited commitment to purchases “in the amounts needed” to support smooth market functioning was essential. Our market intelligence indicated that some investors had been selling not because they needed liquidity immediately, but because they wanted to take precautions against a further deterioration in market functioning. By providing confidence that the Treasury and MBS markets would remain liquid, the FOMC’s commitment to purchases reduced this motive for sales and helped calm the market.\n\nFlexibility, as I noted earlier, has been another hallmark of our purchases that has helped to support confidence in smooth functioning of the Treasury and agency MBS markets. For most of the spring, we issued calendars for our purchases one week at a time, rather than our usual monthly calendars, and revised these plans even daily when necessary. As our indicators showed changes in market functioning, we adapted by adjusting the size of our purchases, the distribution of purchases across sectors, and even the settlement timing of our agency MBS operations.11 This flexibility has allowed us to maximize support for smooth market functioning. Once we saw improvements in market functioning, we began reducing the pace of our purchases starting in late March—but we did so gradually to reduce the chance of renewed disruptions, and we have remained watchful for conditions that would warrant an increase in purchases.\n\nHow Will We Sustain Smooth Market Functioning?\n\nBy the time of the FOMC’s June meeting, we had reduced the pace of purchases to the equivalent of around $80 billion per month in Treasuries and about $40 billion per month, net of reinvestments, in MBS.12 The FOMC directed the Desk in June to continue increasing SOMA holdings at least at this pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.\n\nAlthough market functioning has improved markedly since the period of extreme stress in mid-March, uncertainty about the course of the pandemic makes it prudent to protect against further shocks. There also are still sectors of the market where liquidity and pricing have not fully returned to pre-pandemic conditions. The continued work-from-home posture at many firms, and ongoing uncertainty in the outlook, appear to have made liquidity providers somewhat more cautious. Purchases over coming months will help mitigate risks of renewed stress and sustain continued smooth market functioning.\n\nWith the shift to a program focused on sustaining smooth market functioning, we are now announcing a monthly purchase amount and have lengthened our purchase schedules to semi-monthly periods for both Treasuries and MBS. These longer calendars provide greater foresight into our purchase plans, allowing dealers to prepare for this activity in the context of their customer flows. Importantly, though, we will remain vigilant for signs of deterioration in market functioning and flexible in adjusting our operations as needed. This strategy will allow us to safeguard the gains we’ve made and support the continued flow of credit to American families and businesses.\n\nI’d emphasize in this regard that our assessment of market functioning is focused on indicators of market liquidity and efficient prices—not on the level of yields. It is certainly the case that the FOMC’s purchases have been absorbing duration and prepayment risk from the market. The total duration included in our Treasury purchases so far represents the equivalent of about $1 trillion in 10-year securities. Although term premiums do not appear to have come down significantly relative to just before the pandemic, our usual analysis indicates that our purchases have offset some upward pressure that could otherwise have occurred, for example as a result of the recent increases in Treasury debt issuance. I expect that the ongoing purchases will continue to absorb interest rate risk from the market, and that a wide range of factors other than our purchases will also continue to influence yields as our current purchases proceed.\n\nOverall, I am confident that the full range of Federal Reserve programs, including the Treasury and MBS purchases, will mitigate the ongoing risks to market functioning and sustain the progress we have seen. The economic and financial shocks resulting from the pandemic have been truly extreme. The Federal Reserve’s commitment to smooth market functioning should provide continued confidence amid the ongoing public health and economic uncertainties.\n\nStill, considering the crucial role of the Treasury and MBS markets in the financial system, and their growing size, it is important to ensure that these markets remain resilient to future shocks. What factors made these markets vulnerable to the abrupt deterioration in functioning that we saw in March? Could changes in regulations, data availability, or market infrastructure make market functioning more robust to future shocks? What role do funding markets play? These are challenging questions. They will require careful research and analysis, and they may not have simple answers. Still, the official and private sectors should be prepared to work together to assess them, and to do what it takes to ensure the continued strength and good functioning of these important markets.\n\nThank you.\n\nFigures PDF\n\n\n1 I would like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for his assistance in preparing these remarks, Ashley Rhodes for her assistance with data, and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for valuable comments and suggestions.\n\n2 See Lorie K. Logan, The Federal Reserve’s Recent Actions to Support the Flow of Credit to Households and Businesses, remarks before the Foreign Exchange Committee, April 14, 2020.\n\n3 The FOMC also directed the Desk to begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) to support the smooth functioning of that market. The approach that the Desk uses to assess CMBS market functioning is generally similar to the one I describe here for Treasuries and agency MBS. In addition, the FOMC directed the Desk to conduct large-scale repo operations to ensure an ample supply of reserves and support the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets, a topic I have discussed previously.\n\n4 The total for MBS includes purchases that are not yet settled.\n\n5 See, for example, Large central bank balance sheets and market functioning, report prepared by a Study Group chaired by Lorie Logan and Ulrich Bindseil, Markets Committee, Bank for International Settlements, October 2019.\n\n6 See Markus K. Brunnermeier and Lasse Heje Pedersen, 2009, “Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity,” Review of Financial Studies 22(6), 2201-2238.\n\n7 See Yakov Amihud and Haim Mendelson, 1991, “Liquidity, Maturity, and the Yields on U.S. Treasury Securities,” Journal of Finance 46(4), 1411-1425, and Arvind Krishnamurthy and Annette Vissing-Jorgensen, 2012, “The Aggregate Demand for Treasury Debt,” Journal of Political Economy 120(2), 233-267.\n\n8 For a discussion of liquidity metrics in the Treasury market, see Michael J. Fleming, 2003, “Measuring Treasury Market Liquidity,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review 9(3), 83-108.\n\n9 The cash-futures basis is the excess return that can be earned by purchasing a Treasury security in the cash market and delivering the security into a futures contract. A number of other relative value measures also showed distortions during this period, such as spreads between the yields of on-the-run and off-the run Treasury securities; spline errors, which are differences between actual prices of specific Treasury securities and theoretical prices calculated from a fitted curve; and spreads between MBS and Treasury yields, though other factors such as mortgage prepayment rates can also affect these spreads.\n\n10 The Desk conducts Treasury purchases across ranges of securities through a multiple-price auction mechanism, and evaluates offers against prevailing market prices as well as measures of relative value.\n\n11 Purchases in the MBS “to-be-announced” (TBA) market typically settle about a month after the transaction, but in March the Desk conducted some MBS operations for settlement two to three business days after the operation in order to more quickly influence market conditions.\n\n12 The Desk’s gross MBS purchases around the time of the FOMC’s June meeting were running at a pace of about $90 billion per month, which included about $50 billion in monthly reinvestments of principal payments on existing agency MBS holdings."

    "text": "Thank you, Armen [Babajanian]. Thank you all for having me.\n\nI’d like to begin by offering my deepest condolences to all those who lost loved ones in the catastrophic flooding in the Texas Hill Country earlier this month. The loss of life is heartbreaking—especially, for me as a parent, the deaths of so many children. I take inspiration, though, from the heroism of first responders and residents who stepped up to help and from how communities across the area have rallied to support our neighbors. These actions show the true character of Texas.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to visit the World Affairs Council of San Antonio this evening. In cities across the United States, World Affairs Councils promote engagement with global issues and deep community connections. This work is so important. The Dallas Fed frequently collaborates on events with World Affairs Councils in our region. Just last week, we partnered with the council in Dallas–Fort Worth to host a conversation with Federal Reserve Board Governor Chris Waller. I’m so glad to be with you here tonight, and I hope I’ll have many opportunities to return.\n\nI’m grateful to have many special guests in our audience, including current and former board members of the Dallas Fed. It means so much to have strong community partners like our board members who represent South Texas and who work with our branch here in San Antonio.\n\nI’m honored to share the stage this evening with our distinguished moderator, Speaker [Joe] Straus. Before we sit down to talk, I would like to share some initial remarks. As always, these are my views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, make up the Federal Reserve System. Relative to other public institutions, the Fed has two distinctive characteristics that are crucial to how we serve you. The Fed is not one centralized organization but rather a federated system with deep local roots. And in our monetary policy responsibilities, the Fed operates independently while remaining accountable to the public.\n\nOur network of operations across the country provides insights into communities’ unique economic circumstances. In the United States’ wonderfully varied economy, those perspectives help us make the best decisions to serve the country as a whole.\n\nBut the Fed’s federated structure doesn’t just help us gather information. Each reserve bank is a separate corporation with its own board of directors. Our directors represent the public in the district. And besides sharing perspectives on economic conditions, they hold us accountable for serving the district well.\n\nTo be clear, in most of our work, the Federal Reserve ultimately must act in unison to best serve the country as a whole. In monetary policy, we have to set the same interest rate target for Texas as for Tennessee. And in bank supervision, we can’t be any more or less stringent when we examine banks in San Antonio than we are in Seattle. But our local roots keep us accountable for including your voices in those national decisions.\n\nMy colleagues and I at the Dallas Fed talk frequently with business and community leaders—as well as workers and families—to learn how people are experiencing the economy. Those insights especially inform our monetary policy choices, which brings me to the Fed’s second unique characteristic, monetary policy independence.\n\nCongress tasked the Fed with setting monetary policy to achieve two goals: maximum employment and stable prices. In the short run, a central bank could always temporarily boost employment by cutting interest rates. But over time, excessive rate cuts would trigger a spiral of inflation, wiping out the benefits of a hot labor market. So to have a sustainably strong economy, a central bank has to make decisions for the long run.\n\nCongress designed the Federal Reserve System to promote that long-term focus. Members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to serve 14-year terms. Reserve bank presidents, like me, are appointed to five-year terms by our local boards of directors, with approval by the Board of Governors. The long terms for these roles let us choose policies that will best serve the country over time.\n\nWhile the Fed’s leaders aren’t up for election, we remain accountable to the public for achieving our monetary policy goals. That accountability comes through regular testimony to Congress, extensive public dialogue and ultimately the regular turnover of governors and reserve bank presidents as terms expire.\n\nResearch shows that central banks perform better on inflation when they are independent from short-term political considerations. The pattern is clear when looking around the world (perhaps a familiar vantage point for many of you as watchers of global affairs) and over history. And in my experience, the Fed’s combination of independence and accountability enables us to make thoughtful, objective, technical decisions while keeping the public interest at the center of all we do.\n\nThe Fed’s long-term focus shapes my thinking about monetary policy at the current juncture.\n\nThe U.S. economy has been quite stable over the past year despite substantial shifts in domestic policies and geopolitics.\n\nStarting with inflation, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ended in May, which is the most recent figure available. That’s down substantially from the postpandemic peak of 7.2 percent. It’s still a bit above the 2 percent target of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), though. And it’s only slightly lower than late last spring. While the last several monthly inflation prints have been encouraging, short streaks of good news have raised hopes before, only to disappoint people when inflation rebounded. So I'd like to see low inflation continue longer to be convinced.\n\nThis morning, we received the June data for the Consumer Price Index, which measures a slightly different mix of prices. The details of the CPI report suggest annual PCE inflation through June will probably move up a bit.\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market remains solid. The unemployment rate stands at 4.1 percent. Like inflation, that’s just about the same as late last spring. Job openings, quits and businesses’ hiring and firing rates have also been moving sideways.\n\nAfter cutting interest rates 100 basis points in the second half of 2024, the FOMC has held the fed funds target range steady at 4.25 to 4.5 percent so far this year. Where policy goes from here depends not only on the current state of the economy but also on the outlook for the future. Changes in monetary policy take time to work their way through the financial system and economy. So we have to set a stance of policy that makes sense for where the economy is going, not where it’s been.\n\nI see two main scenarios for how the economic environment could shape the path of policy over coming quarters. My base case is that we’ll need to keep interest rates modestly restrictive for some time to complete the work of returning inflation sustainably to the 2 percent target. But it’s also possible that some combination of softer inflation and a weakening labor market will call for lower rates fairly soon.\n\nLet’s walk through the case for each of those scenarios.\n\nWhile tariff increases have left only a modest imprint on inflation so far, they appear likely to create additional pressure for some time. Inventories and fixed-price contracts have helped some companies temporarily hold the line, but higher tariffs will need to be priced in when contracts renew and inventories run out. Tariffs on intermediate goods, such as parts used to assemble new cars, take time to show up in the prices of finished products. And some retailers are waiting to raise prices until they see where tariff rates settle.\n\nTo forecast inflation overall, it’s helpful to set aside categories of goods and services that have experienced unusually large price increases or decreases. Those big swings often reverse themselves. The Dallas Fed’s trimmed mean PCE inflation rate, which removes outliers, has historically provided a good read on the outlook for overall inflation. Through May, the trimmed mean stood at 2.5 percent over the past year and 2.7 percent over the past six months. That tells me we have more ground to cover to achieve our long-run inflation goal.\n\nMeanwhile, the environment appears favorable for demand to remain resilient. Broad financial conditions are supportive of growth. The stock market is near all-time highs. Credit spreads are near all-time lows. And in the Dallas Fed’s most recent Banking Conditions Survey, banking executives in the region told us loan volume and demand have picked up. Fiscal policy appears set to be a tailwind to aggregate growth, although the effects will vary across income levels and economic sectors. While consumer spending has stepped down from last year’s very strong pace, the solid labor market means household incomes are holding up.\n\nAll this adds up, for me, to a base case in which monetary policy needs to hold tight for a while longer to bring inflation sustainably back to target—and in this base case, we can sustain maximum employment even with modestly restrictive policy.\n\nBut even though that’s my base case, other possibilities are quite plausible. Inflation could turn out to be less persistent and less responsive to tariffs. There have been slight signs of cooling in the most recent labor data. Continuing unemployment claims have risen. And private sector job growth stepped down in June. While firing rates are low, so are hiring rates, which means it’s harder for people to find work when they lose their jobs or enter the labor force. House prices dipped in recent months, which could indicate cooling demand. Indicators of business and consumer sentiment, including the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Survey, have been relatively pessimistic. If households and businesses start to act on those worries, the hard measures of economic activity could worsen. And, as this audience knows well, against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical risks, any number of unanticipated shocks could throw the economy off course. Outcomes along any of these lines could shift the inflation and employment outlook and call for reducing interest rates sooner than in my base case.\n\nIn setting monetary policy, we have to balance a wide range of risks, including the risk that we misjudge which scenario the economy is in. If we cut rates too soon, inflation could get stuck above our target, and households and businesses might come to expect further price increases. History teaches that when higher inflation expectations become entrenched, the road back to price stability is longer, the labor market is weaker, and the economic scars are deeper. Yet if we don’t cut rates soon enough, the labor market could weaken more. Those job losses, too, would be painful. But we’d have the option of cutting rates further to get employment back on track. For now, I believe monetary policy is well positioned to achieve the FOMC’s goals of maximum employment and price stability and to respond appropriately as the outlook changes.\n\nThank you again for the opportunity to join you this evening. I’d be happy to take your questions."

    "text": "Good afternoon, my name is Lorie Logan, and I serve as the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nI’m happy to join you all here today at the Chicago Payments Symposium and to congratulate the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago on the 25th annual gathering of this conference. Year after year the Chicago Fed fills this room with industry leaders with a wide range of backgrounds who share a passion for the integrity, resiliency, accessibility and safety of our payments system. The connections and dialogue fostered here have made a lasting impact on the evolution of payments, and I look forward to seeing where the conversations this week lead.\n\nThe Fed provides payments services that are inclusive, accessible and easy to use. I sit on the Federal Reserve Banks’ Payments Committee, which oversees the reserve banks’ payments business. For many financial institutions, payments is a strategic component of their core business. And for us at the Fed, it’s a critical part of our mission. It’s an exciting time to be in payments, and the Fed is helping to drive some of the progress in this area.\n\nBefore I introduce our keynote speaker, McKinsey & Co. Global Co-Head of Payments Jon Steitz, I’ll highlight some of the Fed’s steps to modernize the payments system and innovate to meet evolving needs while maintaining the Fed’s commitment to safety, security and accessibility.\nModernization\nMany of you are familiar with FedWire Funds, the Fed’s electronic funds transfer service that banks, businesses and government agencies rely on for mission-critical, large dollar same-day transactions. The service handles nearly $5 trillion a day in payments. This summer, we successfully implemented the ISO 20022 global message standard in a one-day cutover. This was important because the standard advances the modernization of payment processes by providing a common language that is easily exchanged between business and banking systems. To implement the standard, every single financial institution that sends payments on the Fed network, their technology partners and all of their systems needed to change—on the same day, at the same time, for everyone across the country. It took an entire community of people across the Fed, financial institutions, their vendors, service providers and industry partners to make it happen. Many of you here today were part of this effort, and I would like to thank you for your contributions to this success.\n\nWhile we’ve made significant strides in digital payment modernization, we must also recognize the importance of physical currency in the payments ecosystem. Demand remains strong for U.S. currency both domestically and globally, with more than $2.4 trillion in circulation. Cash is important for many people who lack access to financial services and continues to be a safe and stable store of value. And to anticipate possible needs, the Fed is taking a critical look at our operations and making data-driven decisions on how we will meet cash demand in the future.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also in the process of replacing our high-speed currency authentication systems, which are more than 30 years old. The new machines will feature more advanced capabilities to streamline operations while ensuring the U.S. currency remains secure. In 2023, Dallas was selected as one of the four pilot sites for these new machines, and our team played an integral role in developing the procedures that support these updated systems. It’s been rewarding for us in Dallas to be part of this process and exemplify how we’re modernizing even our most traditional services.\n\nInnovation\nAs the Fed advances our modernization efforts, we’re simultaneously working on innovative payment solutions that address the growing demand for speed, efficiency and accessibility. Instant payments has been one of the most revolutionary developments in this space. Since the launch of the FedNow service in 2023, nearly 1,500 financial institutions (including banks of all sizes across all 50 states) and 40 service providers have joined the platform, with volumes increasing quarter over quarter.\n\nThe Bureau of Fiscal Service recently enabled FedNow as an option to process certain types of federal disaster relief payments. For businesses and households impacted by disasters or emergencies, the ability to quickly receive these payments is critically important. We’ve also introduced new functionality, such as the recent account activity threshold controls, that allow financial institutions to strengthen risk mitigation efforts by defining dollar value and transaction velocity thresholds based on customer segments. Next month, we plan to raise the maximum transaction limit from $1 million to $10 million to meet increased demand.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also conducting research on emerging technologies. For example, we are examining tokenization, smart contracts and artificial intelligence to better understand how private sector innovators may use these tools to improve payments. In addition, this research will help us identify opportunities to enhance our critical payment infrastructures.\n\nSafety\nAs payments evolve, so do the associated challenges. Frauds and scams, including check fraud, are growing concerns in the industry. As an operator and catalyst for system improvements, the Federal Reserve focuses on working collaboratively with the industry to enhance payment system safety. The Fed provides risk management tools and services that participating institutions may use as part of their fraud detection, prevention and mitigation programs. In June, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued an interagency request for information to seek public input on potential actions to help consumers, businesses and financial institutions mitigate the risk of fraud. The comment period recently closed, and we are now working together to consider next steps, including what actions we at the Federal Reserve can take as a payments operator.\n\nWe’re continuously looking for ways to enhance the safety of the services we offer. For example, Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the Fed’s largest payment service and supports the payments business nationwide, enabling the functionality of many of the popular payment avenues we all use. The ACH network processes over 85 million transactions per day, with electronic payment transfers continually increasing in number and value. We recently introduced a feature allowing subscribers to receive notifications when our systems detect suspicious activity.\n\nAt the Federal Reserve we will continue to balance modernization and innovation with safety and resilience across our payments rails. Ongoing coordination and collaboration with the private sector remain essential to address challenges that emerge and to create opportunities that benefit consumers, businesses and financial institutions.\n\nKeynote speaker\nTo dive deeper into the emerging technologies and innovation in the digital payments landscape, we will hear from today’s keynote speaker, Jon Steitz. It is my pleasure to introduce Jon, who is the global co-head of payments at McKinsey, where he advises banks and other payment providers on consumer needs and digital innovations. Jon has made several key contributions to McKinsey’s work in this space, including guiding the launch of new digital payments products for global and domestic financial institutions. In his remarks, Jon will cover the changing payments environment with a focus on what AI and agentic commerce could mean for financial institutions and their customers. Jon holds a bachelor’s degree in molecular biophysics and biochemistry as well as a law degree from Yale University.\n\nPlease join me in welcoming Jon to the stage. Thank you."

    "text": "Good morning.\n\nThank you, Mark [Wynne], for the kind introduction. And thank you all for joining us for the second Women in Central Banking Workshop.\n\nMy colleagues and I are especially pleased to co-sponsor this year’s event with the Norges Bank. The Norges Bank began this workshop last year to give women working in PhD programs an opportunity to present their research, receive feedback and network with each other as well as accomplished senior economists in central banks. We’re delighted to partner with the Norges Bank on this year’s workshop and hope this effort continues to grow.\n\nThis workshop means a lot to the Dallas Fed. We know that to accomplish our public mission, we need the best economists in the world to become central bankers. So, we are incredibly excited and proud to welcome women who will lead the next generation of economists to our bank today to share their research.\n\nScholarly economic research is integral to the work of central banks. Research deepens our understanding of the economy and financial system and enables policymakers to make well-informed decisions on all aspects of our mission. Here at the Dallas Fed, we recognize the value of your work and how it helps us achieve our mission of building an economy where everyone can participate and thrive. And I may be biased, but central banks can be a great place not only to do research but also to make an impact on the world with your research.\n\nWomen’s representation in economics\nThis workshop is important because while more women are serving in leadership positions, they remain significantly underrepresented in the field of economics as a whole. This is a global pattern and, unfortunately, a persistent one. In 2023, women received just under one-third of the PhDs granted in economics in the United States. That figure has been stagnant for a quarter century. And in subfields like macroeconomics, finance and quantitative methods, which are crucial for central banks, representation among women is even lower.\n\nWhile the underrepresentation of women isn’t unique to economics, the field has made less progress than some other traditionally male-dominated areas of study. For example, from 1998 to 2018, the percentage of engineering PhDs granted to women doubled. And in fields like medicine and law, where women made up less than one-tenth of students entering professional schools in the 1960s, the percentages of men and women entering these same programs were nearly equal by the early 2000s.\n\nThe progress we’ve seen in other fields gives me hope that with the right strategies, we can move the needle in economics as well. However, I still have concerns about whether we in economics are missing out on top talent. As I said at the outset, we need the very best economists contributing to our mission. How many young women who could become great economists aren’t even entering the profession?\n\nWomen’s representation affects not only the individual talent in the profession but our ability to form high-performing teams. A rising share of economics papers have multiple authors, and I’ve heard it said that research is a team sport. That’s even more true for public policy.\n\nThroughout my career, I have seen time and time again when we’re trying to innovate or solve complex problems, we do our best work when we bring diverse teams together. The different perspectives that team members bring—how we think, how we analyze information and what we know about the world—allow us to generate better ideas and more rapidly develop the best solutions. Increasing women’s representation will bring new and important perspectives to the table—ones that matter for public policy and especially for our work as a central bank.\n\nCentral banks are among the largest employers in the field of economics. Research from my colleague Nitzan [Tzur-Ilan] finds that although the Federal Reserve System as a whole employs more than 1,000 PhD economists, women made up only 22 percent of these economists as of 2021. Here in Dallas, women account for just 25 percent of our PhD economists. Frankly, this is an area the Dallas Fed needs to work on. A diverse workforce is key to developing the best insights so we can build an economy where everyone can participate and thrive. My leadership team and I are committed to encouraging and supporting women in the economics profession and in this bank, and today’s workshop supports that goal.\n\nIn late August, I attended the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. I look forward every year to this event hosted by my colleagues at the Kansas City Fed. It’s a bit like summer camp for central bankers—a time to discuss economics and policy with top experts from around the world.\n\nAt the very first Jackson Hole symposium in 1982, there was not a single woman on the program and precious few among the attendees. Over time, the organizers recognized that a substantial amount of talent wasn’t making it to the event and worked to include more women on the agenda and among the attendees. Today, one of the agenda items I look forward to most is a gathering of women leaders. Former Kansas City Fed President Esther George started that part of the program, and it’s been a key step in making the conference more inclusive.\n\nI am optimistic that with dedication and thoughtful efforts, we can bring more women into economics and central banking. From an institutional standpoint, this could include creating more diverse co-authorship networks, introducing mentorship programs, and building the pipeline in economics through efforts like the partnership we and other reserve banks have with the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession to host summer interns. We can also make a difference as individuals, by identifying opportunities for our colleagues, inviting others to share their work and perspectives, and supporting one another. The issues we’re facing are long-standing and structural in nature, but as with the women’s gathering at Jackson Hole that I mentioned earlier, even relatively small steps in the right direction can help drive lasting change. Our hope is that today’s workshop will contribute to that progress.\n\nConclusion\nI would like to again thank Norges Bank for their partnership in developing this workshop.\n\nThis event would not be possible without the work of our organizing committee: Emilia [Garcia-Appendini], Eleonora [Granziera] and Kasper [Roszbach] of Norges Bank; and Lucie [Lebeau], Pia [Orrenius], Nitzan [Tzur-Ilan], Mark [Wynne], Fang [Yang] and Ziaoqing [Zhou] of the Dallas Fed.\n\nI would also like to thank everyone who is presenting, our session chairs and discussants. I hope each of you is able to connect, build your networks and advance your research.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank you for being here and for having me. Whether you are joining us today as a PhD student, as a central banker or as someone in the field, your involvement is meaningful and makes a difference for the next generation of women in central banking."

    "text": "Thank you, Frank [Smets], for the kind introduction. And thank you to the BIS for inviting me to participate on this distinguished panel. International dialogues like today’s generate so many valuable insights about how central banks can navigate the current environment.\n\nThe theme of this panel is “future challenges for monetary policy in the Americas.” Where to begin? One challenge is simply to note all of the important challenges when I’ve been asked to keep my opening remarks to five minutes!\n\nI would like to highlight three topics in particular: the reconfiguration of global trade patterns and supply chains; the shift to a higher-interest-rate environment; and the need to keep inflation expectations well anchored after the surge in inflation following the pandemic. Let me note that these views are mine and not necessarily those of my Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) colleagues.\n\nIn recent years, companies worldwide began to reorganize their supply chains in response to disruptions experienced during the pandemic as well as geopolitical developments. Government policy changes in this space are ongoing, and the resulting changes in trade patterns could leave a substantial imprint on economic activity. For example, a Dallas Fed economist and a colleague at the Banco de México found in their research that tariffs on China drove growth at Mexican firms integrated into global supply networks. Central bankers will need to parse what these shifts mean for the inflation and employment outlooks and for capital flows. At the Dallas Fed, we recently launched our Global Institute to study these and other questions, and we look forward to generating insights that can advance the missions of the Federal Reserve and other central banks.\n\nTurning to my second point, following the Global Financial Crisis, many experts thought a core challenge of modern central banking was downside risk to inflation resulting from the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound. While a return to the lower bound remains one scenario to prepare for, the past few years show we must be equally well prepared to achieve our goals when rates are well above zero and inflation risks are to the upside.\n\nRelated, and this brings me to my third point, central banks will need to ensure inflation expectations remain well anchored following the recent global inflation surge. High inflation has been costly for households and businesses. It would be surprising if this episode didn’t cause people to reevaluate how they expect inflation to behave going forward. In the U.S., while market- and survey-based estimates of long-term inflation expectations have remained largely stable, survey measures of inflation uncertainty rose sharply at the start of the pandemic and remain elevated. I take this as a reminder that expectations won’t stay anchored forever on their own. In the end, monetary policymakers have to achieve what the public expects.\n\nAnd—as we all know—well-anchored inflation expectations are critical to success in monetary policy. History teaches that when inflation expectations become unanchored, central banks often can restore price stability only at a great economic cost.\n\nThis lesson figures centrally in my thinking about monetary policy for the U.S. in the near term. I think the possible policy strategies for the FOMC in 2025 boil down to two key alternatives. In some scenarios, it will soon be appropriate to resume reducing the federal funds target range. In other scenarios, we’ll need to hold rates at least at the current level for quite some time.\n\nInflation made progress toward the FOMC’s 2 percent target in 2024, while the labor market remained strong and stable. If these trends continue, the U.S. economy will have achieved a soft landing.\n\nYet we have been here before on inflation. It cooled substantially in late 2023, then resurged in early 2024. And January 2023 was unusually strong as well. My team’s analysis and conversations with business contacts suggest these bumps may result from an interaction between annual pricing decisions and the business cycle. Many businesses set prices once a year in January, and they have more pricing power when the economy is strong, as it has been in recent years.\n\nWe don’t yet know whether 2025 has brought another such bump. But if inflation rises, it will be a signal that monetary policy has more work to do both to restore price stability and to keep demand in balance with supply so we can sustain price stability.\n\nWhat if inflation comes in close to 2 percent in coming months? While that would be good news, it wouldn’t necessarily allow the FOMC to cut rates soon, in my view.\n\nSuppose, for example, that as the first quarter unfolds, monthly inflation figures come in at a 2 percent annualized rate, labor market indicators hold right where they were all fall, and consumer spending and business investment also stay strong.\n\nI’d find it hard to say monetary policy was meaningfully restrictive in that scenario. One aspect of the global higher-rate environment is that the neutral interest rate appears to have moved up—though it’s uncertain exactly how much. On-target inflation alongside two quarters of stability in the labor market and demand would strongly suggest that we’re already pretty close to the neutral rate, without much near-term room for further cuts. On the other hand, if the labor market or demand cools further, that could be evidence it’s time to ease.\n\nThere are many uncertainties right now beyond the near-term inflation and employment data. I mentioned trade policy, and as we’ll probably come back to later in the panel, financial conditions have been volatile. But to me, the monetary policy implications of these uncertainties generally come down to whether sustainably restoring price stability requires keeping rates at least at the current level or moving lower. And in choosing a path, we should be guided by the need to maintain well-anchored inflation expectations, which are fundamental in the long run to achieving both sides of the FOMC’s dual mandate for monetary policy.\n\nThank you.\n\nAdditional comments on financial conditions and the neutral interest rate (delivered in panel discussion)\nI’d like to discuss the role of the neutral interest rate in determining monetary policy and the key factors influencing that rate in the U.S. and globally right now.\n\nEven though I brought up the neutral rate in my opening remarks, that’s often not my starting point in thinking about monetary policy, because my background is in financial markets, and I think the nuances of markets matter. Households and businesses don’t usually borrow, save or invest at an overnight risk-free rate like the fed funds rate. Instead, most borrowing, saving and investing takes place at longer tenors, and often in forms that incorporate various risk premia. So when I think about whether monetary policy is in the right place to accomplish our macroeconomic goals, I tend to think about whether broad financial conditions are appropriately restrictive or accommodative, or whether broad financial conditions need to move.\n\nYet the central bank doesn’t control overall financial conditions. We control an overnight policy rate, and that overnight rate’s relationship to broader financial conditions can vary over time. It’s like driving a car with some occasional slippage in the transmission. So I don’t usually try to judge whether the policy rate itself is restrictive or accommodative, but instead I think through how moving the policy rate will affect broader financial conditions.\n\nAll that said, it’s helpful to have some benchmarks for the policy rate over time. Estimates of the neutral rate, or r-star—the policy rate that would be neither restrictive nor accommodative—are one such benchmark. Let me emphasize the word “estimates.” The neutral rate can’t be directly measured, but instead has to be estimated by consulting models and observing the evolution of the economy.\n\nEstimates like these depend on many assumptions. It’s also necessary to specify a time horizon. The neutral rate in the long run can differ from its value today.\n\nAs a result, estimates of r-star for the U.S. vary widely. Looking across a suite of publicly available models, estimates of the neutral real interest rate for the U.S. range from three-quarters of a percent to two and a half percent. And in the December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), FOMC participants’ estimates of the long-run real fed funds rate ranged from 0.4 to 1.9 percent.\n\nBut one thing these estimates generally have in common is that most of them have moved up substantially since before the pandemic. For example, five years ago in the December 2019 SEP, estimates of the long-run real fed funds rate ranged from 0 to 1.3 percent.\n\nAs I think about the economy, that shift makes sense.\n\nConceptually, the neutral rate depends on the balance between the supply of investment and the demand for investment. Factors that move investment supply or demand also move the neutral rate. I would categorize those factors into four main buckets:\n\nBusiness investment needs, which can result from drivers as varied as productivity growth, new technologies or changes in trade patterns.\nDemographics, because longer life expectancies and lower population growth raise desired savings.\nRisk premia, because higher structural demand for safe assets means investment supply and demand are in balance at a lower risk-free rate, all else equal.\nAnd global fiscal policy, which reflects the desired savings and investments of governments.\nDemographics change slowly and have weighed on neutral rates for many years. But the other factors can move more quickly. And postpandemic, many of them point in the direction of higher investment, lower savings and thus higher neutral rates—just as the models and estimates suggest.\n\nBecause global capital markets are relatively open, I tend to think these factors operate globally and affect neutral rates across economies. Indeed, model estimates of r-star have tended to move in parallel across developed markets for the past half-century. But country-specific developments can also matter. For example, large capital flows into one country from the rest of the world would shift out the supply of investment in the recipient country and have the opposite effect on the neutral rate in that country as elsewhere.\n\nThis brings me back to where I started, with the importance of broad financial conditions. While some of the drivers of the neutral rate are purely economic, others such as risk premia and capital flows relate to financial markets. Adjusting neutral rate estimates to account for these financial factors is an inexact science. And so while measures of r-star are a helpful benchmark, it will always be important to take broad financial conditions into account in determining how to set the policy rate to achieve a central bank’s goals.\n\nNotes\n\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and other Dallas Fed colleagues for assistance in preparing these remarks."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nI want to thank the Money Marketeers of New York University for inviting me to speak again today.1  These events provide a valuable forum for discussing the intersection of monetary policy implementation and money markets.\n\nWhen I last spoke to this group in December 2020, there had been an historically rapid expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet associated with actions taken in response to the COVID-19 shock.  These measures were highly effective at restoring market functioning and fostering accommodative financial conditions, helping the U.S. economy recover from the pandemic-related downturn.  At the same time, they generated a significant increase in reserves supplied to the banking system.  This year, even as the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet expanded at a more gradual overall pace, growth in Federal Reserve liabilities held by market participants—both in the form of bank reserves and in overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility balances—accelerated, and money market conditions shifted notably.\n\nIn my last talk, I suggested that one of the key advantages of the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) ample reserves operational framework is its flexibility, allowing monetary policy to be implemented efficiently and effectively across a range of environments.  Today, I would like to share some observations on how the framework adapted to much higher levels of liquidity this year and is working as intended to support control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates.  I also want to highlight changes the FOMC has made in recent months to ensure the implementation framework continues to be effective through different environments, even on occasions when shocks disrupt markets.\n\nBefore I continue, let me note that the views I express today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nRecent Shifts In Liquidity Have Been Historically Large, And Money Market Rates Declined…\n\nLet me start with a brief review of the recent evolution of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, and how this has influenced conditions in money markets.  In response to the COVID-19 shock, the Federal Reserve, along with many other central banks, expanded its balance sheet to support the smooth functioning of financial markets, and maintain the vital flow of credit to households and businesses.  From March to December 2020, the Federal Reserve’s assets increased by roughly $3 trillion, as shown in Figure 1.\n\nThis expansion in assets could have been accompanied by a commensurate increase in Federal Reserve liabilities in the form of bank reserves.2   However, concurrent with the growth in the balance sheet in 2020, the U.S. Treasury’s General Account (TGA)—effectively Treasury’s cash account at the Federal Reserve—rose dramatically.  Treasury increased the TGA to ensure sufficient cash was available to support programs aimed at helping American households and businesses weather the pandemic.3   Growth in the TGA, as indicated in Figure 2, limited reserve growth associated with the balance sheet expansion.\n\nStarting in mid-2020, the pace of net asset purchases slowed, and in December 2020 the FOMC adopted guidance that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by at least $120 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward its economic goals.4  However, even with this more steady pace of balance sheet growth, Federal Reserve liabilities held by market participants—in the form of reserves and ON RRP balances—increased sharply in 2021, as indicated on the right in Figure 2.  This resulted from the dramatic $1.5 trillion decline in the TGA since the beginning of the year.5\n\nUnsurprisingly, the increase in reserves resulted in downward pressure on overnight interest rates—including the federal funds rate—relative to the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate.6  As reserve balances rose, some banks perceived a cost to expanding their balance sheets further and lowered their deposit rates.7   In response, depositors and other investors shifted assets to money market mutual funds (money funds), which raised demand for money market investments and put downward pressure on money market rates more broadly.  On the year, government money fund assets under management (AUM) have increased by over $320 billion, as shown in Figure 3.\n\nIt’s important to note that at the same time demand for money market investments rose, the net supply of U.S. Treasury bills—an essential investment for money funds and other investors—fell by an historically large amount:  over $1.2 trillion so far in 2021, as indicated in Figure 3.  This combination of increased liquidity and reduced supply of investment options had the potential to put substantial further downward pressure on overnight rates, including the federal funds rate.\n\n…The ON RRP Facility Worked As Intended To Support Rate Control\n\nThe ON RRP facility was established as part of the FOMC’s ample reserves framework in order to support interest rate control in a wide variety of environments.  It offers a broad range of money market investors the option to invest in an overnight reverse repo with the Federal Reserve, which improves their bargaining power for private investments.  It also offers an alternative investment when private investments are not available at rates above the ON RRP rate.8\n\nIn the first quarter of this year, ON RRP facility usage became more regular, and it has increased rapidly since.  Recently, reductions in the TGA and Treasury bill supply have accelerated, and the ON RRP facility has exceeded $1.2 trillion consistently since mid-September, as shown in Figure 4.\n\nThe ON RRP facility is working as intended, even as usage expands to new highs. Just as IORB creates a floor for rates on bank lending activity, the ON RRP facility supports control of the federal funds rate by providing a soft floor for the overnight money market activity of a broader set of money market participants.9   Usage of the facility also broadens the holders of Federal Reserve liabilities beyond banks, easing pressure on bank balance sheets that may result from reserve growth.  As shown in Figure 2, the supply of reserves has increased relatively modestly this year, as the ON RRP facility absorbed much of the increase in liquidity from the decline in the TGA and ongoing asset purchases.\n\nAn essential feature of the ON RRP facility is that it has a fixed rate and therefore its size is determined by the interest rate environment.10   Just as usage of the facility grew in response to downward pressure on money market rates, it should decline in response to increases in them.  For example, if Treasury were to expand Treasury bill supply and interest rates on these instruments rose above the ON RRP rate, investors should naturally reallocate out of the facility and back into these assets.  Similarly, if the supply of reserves declines and rates rise relative to the IORB rate, ON RRP balances should naturally recede.  This dynamic has been observed in the past.  Following the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in response to the Global Financial Crisis, the level of reserves began to decline in 2014, and as money market rates moved away from the ON RRP rate, usage of the facility gradually fell back to zero.\n\nThe flexible size of the ON RRP facility helps the FOMC’s ample reserves framework adapt smoothly to different reserve and money market environments.  The FOMC has indicated that, with the federal funds rate likely to be constrained by its effective lower bound more frequently than in the past, it is prepared to use its full range of tools—including large-scale asset purchases—to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.11  As such, extended periods of elevated ON RRP usage may be a relatively regular feature of the ample reserves framework.  This isn’t a challenge for monetary policy implementation; it’s the framework working as designed.\n\nModest Adjustments Were Made To Terms Of Implementation Tools To Evolve With The New Environment…\n\nEven with the ON RRP facility promoting interest rate control this year, the Federal Reserve has made some modest adjustments to its implementation tools.\n\nAs I’ve just described, IORB provides a floor for bank lending rates, and the ON RRP facility supports control of the federal funds rate by creating a floor beneath the overnight activity of a broader set of money market participants.  Earlier this year, the IORB rate was 10 basis points and the ON RRP rate was zero.  Unsurprisingly, as reserves increased, the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) edged further below the IORB rate and closer to the bottom of the FOMC’s target range.  Against the backdrop of declining Treasury bill supply and rising government money fund AUM, overnight secured rates fell to near zero.\n\nThe Federal Reserve implemented a technical adjustment to administered rates in June, lifting the IORB and ON RRP rates by five basis points each, shifting up their position in the target range.  This was a normal adjustment in response to evolving money market conditions, intended to help maintain the federal funds rate well within the target range.  Lifting the ON RRP rate above zero also helped support the smooth functioning of money markets.  With secured rates near zero, money funds with stable net asset values (NAVs) could have experienced challenges covering operating costs and limited inflows, increasing the potential for further downward pressure on rates.\n\nThis was the sixth such technical adjustment.  Like the five adjustments before, it worked as expected.  Both secured and unsecured overnight rates shifted modestly higher, in line with the change in the two administered rates.  As shown in Figure 5, throughout this year not only has the EFFR printed well within the target range, but the bulk of trading in the federal funds market—as shown by the 1st and 99th percentiles of trades underlying the EFFR—has also fallen within the range.\n\nThe adjustments to the Federal Reserve’s policy implementation tools this year haven’t been limited to administered rates.  To ensure the ON RRP facility is effective, it is important to provide access to a sufficiently broad set of money market participants and to offer counterparties adequate investment capacity.\n\nIn April, the eligibility requirements for RRP counterparties were adjusted to make the facility more accessible, in line with the New York Fed’s efforts to ensure that its counterparty policies both support effective policy implementation and promote a fair and competitive marketplace.  Since then, we have onboarded new RRP counterparties, increasing the diversity of our counterparty base.\n\nThe ON RRP facility’s per-counterparty limit has also been adjusted this year.  In March, the FOMC lifted the limit to $80 billion to account for changes in the size and concentration of the money fund industry since 2014, and to ensure sufficient capacity to maintain an effective floor under the federal funds rate.  Most recently, as ON RRP usage steadily increased, the FOMC raised the limit again, this time to $160 billion.  Since the increase, some counterparties have participated in ON RRP operations for more than $80 billion, including on the September quarter-end date.\n\n…And Additional Tools Were Added To Strengthen The Policy Implementation Framework\n\nIn order for the FOMC’s ample reserves framework to effectively support policy implementation through different environments, it also needs to be resilient to occasional shocks that can arise.  In recent years, we have observed that pressures in money markets can emerge rapidly, and that these can spill back into the federal funds market.  Based on the effectiveness of repo operations to support policy implementation, particularly during periods of stress, the FOMC established two new standing overnight repo facilities at its July meeting:  a domestic standing repo facility, the SRF, and a repo facility for foreign and international monetary authorities, the FIMA Repo Facility.12\n\nThe SRF is intended to address pressures in the repo market that can spill into the federal funds market, and to flexibly add reserves, when needed.  Both primary dealers and banks can access repo funding through the SRF against a limited set of high-quality securities: U.S. Treasuries, agency debt, and agency MBS.13  While primary dealers have long been counterparties to the Federal Reserve’s open market operations, the FOMC decided in July to add banks as eligible counterparties to the SRF, which allows them to access the facility on similar terms as primary dealers.  Additionally, banks are key participants in the federal funds market and adding them should enhance interest rate control by offering a backstop source of liquidity.  Earlier this month, the New York Fed began accepting formal expressions of interest from banks to become SRF counterparties.  Several have started the process, and we expect the first group of banks will be able to participate in the SRF early next year.  I encourage banks interested in learning more about the SRF to reach out to the New York Fed.14\n\nThe FIMA Repo Facility is available to help address global dollar funding pressures that can emerge.  Disruptions in global funding markets have the potential to negatively impact financial conditions faced by U.S. households and businesses, in particular during significant stress events in broader financial markets.  The FIMA Repo Facility provides foreign official accounts a source of temporary liquidity against their holdings of Treasury securities at the New York Fed to address these pressures.  Foreign account holders have responded positively to the establishment of the facility, as it provides an alternative to outright sales and complements the existing U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines by extending access to dollar funding to a broader range of foreign official institutions.\n\nImportantly, in the FOMC’s ample reserves framework, the role of the ON RRP facility and the new repo facilities are not symmetric.  These new repo facilities, while offered daily, are not expected to be used regularly.  The FOMC is committed to maintaining an ample supply of reserves to ensure that administered rates—the IORB and ON RRP rates—exercise control over the federal funds rate.  So, whereas the ON RRP facility could see persistent usage in some environments, these new repo facilities are only intended to act as occasional backstops.\n\nLooking Ahead, Working To Ensure Implementation Framework Remains Flexible And Adaptable…\n\nI’ve talked today about how the Federal Reserve’s ample reserves framework has ensured effective policy implementation recently by adapting to evolving money market conditions, and about some of the new tools added to the framework.  However, market structure continuously evolves, which in turn can have important implications for the framework.  Recognizing that, I would like to share a few thoughts on two important changes on the horizon.\n\nThe first is work to improve the resilience of the U.S. Treasury market.  In light of the disruptions in March 2020, and also shorter-lived disruptions on other occasions, market participants, academics, and the official sector have been analyzing underlying vulnerabilities in the Treasury market.  While the new standing repo facilities are designed to support effective policy implementation, I expect they will also contribute to smooth functioning of the Treasury market by ensuring temporary liquidity is available against Treasury securities.  More broadly, the Inter-Agency Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), of which the New York Fed and the Federal Reserve Board are members, has identified several key areas for further study to improve Treasury market resilience.15  Some of this work could result in important changes to market structure that are relevant for the FOMC’s implementation framework.  For example, on the Open Market Trading Desk at the New York Fed (the Desk), we have been attentive to developments around expanded central clearing.  These could ultimately merit a study of the costs and benefits of central clearing for some of the Desk’s open market operations to ensure their ongoing effectiveness.16\n\nLooking further ahead, a second area that could have material implications for policy implementation is technological innovation in payments and money.  Around the world, financial market participants and the public are seeking faster and cheaper payment settlement.  This desire is resulting in the development of new, private-sector means of transfer, such as stablecoins, and the study of public-sector solutions, like central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and faster payments.17  The Federal Reserve itself is undertaking an initiative called FedNow that will enable banks to provide safe and efficient instant payment services.  And, the Federal Reserve Board will soon be publishing a paper to engage the public on policy issues associated with a U.S. CBDC.  On the Desk, we are focused on the broad implications of financial innovation for monetary policy implementation.  While it’s not yet clear how the money and payment ecosystem will evolve in the future, it seems apparent that there will be important implications for markets and policy implementation.  But I want to return to the theme I started with:  the implementation framework is flexible, and it will be adapted as needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.\n\nTransitioning Away From LIBOR, Only 79 Days Left\n\nAs I wrap up my remarks, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention a fast-approaching, critical milestone in the transition away from LIBOR.  After a yearslong effort to reduce the financial stability risk posed by the use of this flawed reference rate, this year will effectively mark LIBOR’s end. While U.S. dollar LIBOR will continue for a little while in order to support the transition of legacy contracts, supervisory guidance has been clear that banks should stop entering into new U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts no later than the end of this year.18,19\n\nThe New York Fed plays an important role in supporting a smooth transition away from LIBOR.  Jointly with the Federal Reserve Board, we convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), and we produce the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).  We also operate in financial markets, and need to transition ourselves.  To prepare for the end-of-year deadline, we reviewed our contracts with our trading counterparties and are amending these contracts to replace existing U.S. dollar LIBOR references with ones linked to SOFR.  These documents should be fully executed by the end of October.\n\nWhile there has been significant progress in the overall transition to date, there is still more work that must be done.  Not only is it imperative that firms around the world act without delay, it’s equally important that they are prudent in their choice of alternative reference rates.  The official sector has repeatedly emphasized the importance of using alternatives that can be reasonably expected to remain robust and resilient.\n\nThe ARRC selected SOFR as its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR for institutions of all sizes because it is based on a market that is vast and liquid, with nearly $1 trillion of daily transactions by a diverse set of borrowers and lenders underlying the rate.  SOFR isn’t the only alternative available, but it certainly is the most robust, most liquid option.  If market participants opt to use rates other than SOFR, they should make sure they fully understand how those rates are constructed and any fragilities associated with them.20\n\nThank you for your attention, and I would like to again thank the Money Marketeers for the opportunity to speak with you today.  I look forward to the discussion with Dov.\n\nFigures PDF\n\n\n1 I would like to thank Will Riordan, as well as Julia Gouny and Matt Raskin, for their assistance in preparing these remarks, and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for valuable comments and suggestions.\n\n2 When the Federal Reserve purchases assets or conducts liquidity-providing operations, it credits depository institutions’ reserve accounts.  The terms “depository institution” and “bank” are used interchangeably in these remarks.\n\n3 The TGA is a Federal Reserve liability.  Treasury uses the TGA to make and receive payments.  When it receives payments, this results in a corresponding decline in reserve balances held by banks.  When it makes payments, this results in a corresponding increase in reserve balances.\n\n4 See the FOMC’s statement from its December 2020 meeting.\n\n5 Based on the Federal Reserve’s H.4.1 report (Factors Affecting Reserve Balances), the TGA was $1.61 trillion on December 30, 2020.  It was $96 billion on October 6, 2021, the most recent release of the H.4.1 report.\n\n6 Effective July 29, 2021, the Federal Reserve Board amended Regulation D to eliminate references to an interest on required reserves rate and to an interest on excess reserves rate and replaced them with a single interest on reserve balances rate.\n\n7 In remarks earlier this year, I discussed how increasing reserves and banks’ perception of balance sheet costs may interact; see Impact of Abundant Reserves on Money Markets and Policy Implementation (April 15, 2021).\n\n8 ON RRP operations are conducted each day at a pre-announced offering rate set by the FOMC.  ON RRP transactions are settled using U.S. Treasury securities held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio.  A wide range of counterparties—primary dealers, banks, money funds, and government-sponsored enterprises—are eligible to participate in the ON RRP.  Each counterparty can invest funds in the ON RRP facility up to a per-counterparty limit.  For more information on the ON RRP facility, please see Repo and Reverse Repo Agreements.\n\n9 As noted in remarks earlier this year (Impact of Abundant Reserves on Money Markets and Policy Implementation, April 15, 2021), some money market transactions have periodically occurred at rates below the ON RRP rate.  Much of the sub-ON RRP rate trading appears to be for technical reasons.\n\n10 The aggregate size of an ON RRP operation is limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the SOMA that are available for such operations.\n\n11 Please see the FOMC’s Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications, including its 2020 Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, for more on the Committee’s outlook for the use of the full range of its tools to achieve its monetary policy goals.\n\n12 See the minutes of the April 2021 and June 2021 FOMC meetings for more information on the experience with the Federal Reserve’s repo operations in September 2019 and March 2020, and the discussion of considerations related to the establishment of the SRF and FIMA Repo Facility.\n\n13 Banks are allowed to participate in the SRF without the requirements associated with becoming a primary dealer.  Primary dealers must meet certain expectations on an ongoing basis, including bidding on a pro-rata basis in all Treasury auctions as well as consistently participating in open market operations, and three banks are already primary dealers.  For more information on expectations and requirements for primary dealers, please see the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Policy on Counterparties for Market Operations.\n\n14 For more on SRF counterparties, including information on eligibility requirements and the process for expressing interest in becoming an SRF counterparty, please see Standing Repo Facility Counterparties.\n\n15 For more information on the five primary areas of study for the IAWG, see Remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Annual Primary Dealer Meeting (April 8, 2021) by Brian Smith, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Finance, U.S. Department of the Treasury.  The five areas of study are: 1) data quality and availability; 2) resilience of market intermediation; 3) central clearing; 4) trading venue transparency and oversight; and 5) leverage and fund liquidity risk management practices.\n\n16 In the minutes to the June 2021 FOMC meeting, it was that noted that “[s]everal participants suggested that, in order to ensure an SRF continues to be effective, it may be appropriate to study the costs and benefits of additional adjustments over time, such as moving to a cleared settlement structure.”\n\n17 For more on potential changes in the U.S. payments system, including central bank digital currencies, please see recent remarks by Governor Lael Brainard (Private Money and Central Bank Money as Payments Go Digital: an Update on CBDCs, May 24, 2021).\n\n18 One-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will end as of December 30, 2021.  All remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will cease being published after June 30, 2023.\n\n19 See SR 20-27: Interagency Statement on LIBOR Transition, which states that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation “encourage banks to cease entering into new contracts that use [U.S. dollar] LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021, in order to facilitate an orderly—and safe and sound—LIBOR transition.”\n\n20 For more on the LIBOR transition, please see recent remarks by Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles (Goodbye to All That: The End of LIBOR, October 5, 2021) and New York Fed General Counsel Michael Held (Prepare for Landing, September 15, 2021)."

    "text": "Thank you for inviting me to participate in this important workshop. These in-depth discussions about how the Fed implements monetary policy are incredibly valuable. I’m going to get back to the very basics: the target interest rate that policy implementation aims to control.\n\nAs everyone here surely knows, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) primarily adjusts the stance of monetary policy by changing the target range for the federal funds rate. For almost as long as the FOMC has issued post-meeting FOMC statements, they have reported what the committee decided about the fed funds target. And the FOMC has repeatedly affirmed the centrality of the fed funds target in establishing its policy stance.\n\nMy aim today is to argue that the time has come for the FOMC to prepare to target a different short-term interest rate. I will make four points.\n\nFirst, the Fed has evolved its operating targets through the years to maintain influence over monetary conditions as the financial system evolved. Updating the target from time to time is part of how we manage the central bank efficiently and effectively on the public’s behalf.\nSecond, money markets have changed greatly since the FOMC began publicly targeting the fed funds rate in the mid-1990s. The fed funds target is outdated.\nThird, while targeting fed funds currently provides effective control of broader monetary conditions, the connections are fragile and could break suddenly. The FOMC should take that risk off the table.\nAnd fourth, this isn’t a hard problem. A repo rate would provide a more robust target and allow us to adjust proactively and planfully.\nModernizing the target rate would not interfere with continuing to carry out the FOMC’s principles and plans for normalizing the Fed’s balance sheet. As I’ve said before, the Fed is supplying too many reserves and must bring them down to an efficient level. If anything, a more robust target rate would allow that process to proceed more smoothly.\n\nLet me also emphasize that modernizing the target rate would not change the FOMC’s monetary policy strategy. The operating target specifies how the FOMC measures and influences monetary conditions. It’s entirely separate from the question of how restrictive or accommodative those conditions should be to achieve the FOMC’s macroeconomic goals.\n\nMy remarks will cover the highlights of a longer essay that my colleague Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and I published today. Needless to say, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\n\nA very brief history of the Fed’s operating targets\nWhen the FOMC decides whether monetary conditions should tighten, ease or stay the same, it’s not enough to talk about monetary conditions in general. You need a specific, quantitative target. That target guides the concrete actions the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk will take to achieve the desired conditions. Since the mid-1990s, the target has also had a second, even more important role: to transparently communicate the stance to the public and allow the public to hold the Fed accountable for its choices.\n\nOver the years, the Fed has changed its operating targets to adapt to shifts in the economic and financial environment.\n\nIn the 1950s, when reserve requirements strongly influenced bank lending, the Fed focused on controlling the banking system’s free reserves. In the 1960s, the fed funds market was growing, and studies suggested that variables other than free reserves might have more predictable economic effects. By 1967, daily open market operations sought to control borrowed reserves and the fed funds rate.\n\nBy the late 1970s, policymakers thought the Fed needed to tightly control monetary aggregates to bring down inflation. The Fed moved to target reserve growth and allowed the fed funds rate to swing by as much as several hundred basis points in a day.\n\nThen, in the early 1980s, changes in the regulation of interest rates on bank accounts disrupted the relationship between economic activity and monetary aggregates. The FOMC reverted to targeting borrowed reserves. The Desk monitored the fed funds rate to assess whether it should add or drain reserves to hit the target.\n\nThroughout this history, the targets were internal, not communications vehicles. Market participants had to infer the target from the Desk’s actions.\n\nThat changed in the 1990s when the FOMC began issuing post-meeting statements. While the world has become accustomed to the statements giving a target for the fed funds rate, they didn’t start out that way. The first post-FOMC press release, on Feb. 4, 1994, said simply: “Chairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions. The action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market interest rates.” Since January 1996, the FOMC has announced the fed funds target rather than intended pressures on reserve supply.\n\nChanges in money markets since the mid-1990s\nThat was three decades ago. A lot has changed since then, and the fed funds target is showing its age.\n\nThe fed funds market involves unsecured loans between banks or other institutions that are eligible to hold deposits at the Fed. The fed funds rate is the average overnight rate on these loans. Besides commercial banks, the participants can include government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), particularly Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs).\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the fed funds rate was well suited as a guide to money market conditions. Bank reserves at the time didn’t pay interest. With market rates typically hundreds of basis points above zero, any bank that had excess reserves was highly motivated to lend them out to peers that were short of required reserves. These incentives created a vibrant unsecured interbank market where the interest rate closely reflected banks’ marginal cost of funds.\n\nThat is not the world we live in anymore.\n\nThe Global Financial Crisis (GFC) revealed many dangers. One of them is that unsecured, short-term loans between banks can amplify a crisis. Lenders can suddenly lose money because they don’t have collateral to fall back on. And borrowers can be caught short of cash if their lenders suddenly notice the risk and pull back.\n\nPost-GFC regulations aimed to make the financial system safer by mitigating these risks. The regulations make unsecured short-term interbank lending less attractive for banks on both sides of the loan. That’s a good thing. It keeps depositors’ money safe, and it ensures banks can keep lending to America’s families and businesses through thick and thin. But it means fed funds is no longer where banks normally look to lend or borrow short-term cash.\n\nAnother important change is in the way the Fed implements monetary policy. In the 1990s, the Fed kept reserve supply below the quantity banks would have wanted to hold if reserves had paid a market interest rate. That system let the New York Fed’s trading desk control money market rates by making slight adjustments in reserve supply. But the artificial scarcity had a serious cost. Scarce reserves meant banks were effectively taxed on their use of liquidity. They couldn’t serve their customers and the economy efficiently.\n\nIn 2008, the Fed fixed that problem. With Congress’s authorization, reserves now pay interest. And the Fed now supplies as many reserves as banks demand with market rates close to the interest rate on reserves. We call this a system of ample reserves.\n\nIt’s a more modern and efficient way to implement monetary policy. U.S. dollar reserves are the safest and most liquid asset in the world, an asset that greases the wheels of the banking, financial and payments systems. With ample reserves, banks don’t need to artificially economize on safety and liquidity. The financial system is more stable and resilient. Payments flow more smoothly. And by the criterion of Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, it’s efficient for society.\n\nBut by law, only depository institutions are legally eligible for interest on reserves. Government-sponsored enterprises aren’t. So the ample reserves regime, beneficial as it is, changed the fed funds market from one that redistributed scarce reserves and set banks’ marginal cost of funds to one where GSEs and banks primarily arbitrage access to interest on reserves. The funds rate now also reflects banks’ balance sheet costs for that arbitrage and bargaining power between banks and GSEs, not just the cost of funds. Put that together with the post-GFC banking rules, as well as reforms that made money market funds safer, and unsecured markets like fed funds just aren’t very relevant anymore.\n\nThe center of gravity in U.S. money markets now lies in repo markets, where loans are secured by Treasury securities or other collateral. Overnight and open-dated repo volume averages more than $4.5 trillion per day. By contrast, fed funds volume runs only a bit over $100 billion. Repo rates represent a marginal cost of funds for a wide swathe of borrowers and lenders. And a repo rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), has replaced the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) as the dominant reference rate in U.S. financial contracts.\n\nThe fragility of connections between fed funds and other markets\nThat said, for the moment, fed funds remains a viable target. Rates continue to transmit well between fed funds and other markets. So fed funds still gives us a good gauge of broader monetary conditions, and controlling fed funds still influences broader monetary conditions.\n\nBut the connection is fragile.\n\nFed funds already moves noticeably less than Treasury repo rates. Money market developments earlier this month provide an instructive example. In the first week of September, repo rates rose 3 to 8 basis points relative to the end of August as markets digested a settlement of Treasury securities. Repo rates partly retraced in the second week of September. Then, on September 15, a tax payment date coincided with another Treasury settlement. Tri-party repo rates rose 10 basis points to 4.50 percent, or 17 basis points above the level at the end of August. They’ve since come back down. And yet, through this entire period, until the FOMC cut rates last Wednesday, the fed funds rate remained precisely 4.33 percent, exactly where it had been every trading day since December of last year.\n\nThe stability of the fed funds rate isn’t due to virtuosic open market operations by the Desk or, more generally, to the FOMC targeting fed funds. The target range is 25 basis points wide. The stability comes from concentration in the fed funds market. With only the 11 FHLBs as major lenders, and relatively few bank borrowers, fed funds relationships are long-lasting. A participant who tried to chase a few basis points from day to day would have to weigh those small profits against the risk to the relationship.\n\nSuch a concentrated market could abruptly grow more idiosyncratic. The Federal Home Loan Banks have been exploring options for increasing their investments in bank deposits. New early morning maturity tri-party repo products may also attract FHLBs. With only 11 FHLBs, any change could quickly reach the entire market.\n\nThe market is also vulnerable to any stress that leads the FHLBs to pull back on fed funds lending. We saw this in March 2023. Banking stresses led commercial banks to seek more term advances from FHLBs. The FHLBs appeared to meet those demands in part by reducing fed funds investments, and fed funds volume fell 64 percent in two business days.\n\nAlternative rate options\nOne might say that since all is fine for now, there’s no need to act. But if transmission between fed funds and other money markets ever broke down, we’d need to quickly find a replacement target. And I don’t think making important decisions under time pressure is the best way to promote a strong economy and financial system.\n\nTo fix this, the FOMC should plan ahead and prepare to transition proactively to a different rate.\n\nGood alternative targets are available.\n\nOptions fall in three broad categories. The first includes administered rates, such as interest on reserves or the rate on the Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement Facility or the Standing Repo Facility. The second category involves measures of the constellation of money market rates. And the third category entails switching to a different single market rate.\n\nI’m not a fan of targeting an administered rate. The FOMC should say what market conditions it’s aiming for. And the public should be able to verify the FOMC is delivering those conditions. Targeting an administered rate short-circuits that accountability: Administered rates will always be exactly what the Fed wants them to be, regardless of market conditions.\n\nTargeting the constellation of market rates is also unattractive. Which rates should you include? Should you weight all rates equally or count some more than others? If the FOMC refers only to a qualitative level, how can the public hold the committee accountable? To put it in technical terms, it’s a mess. Monetary policy needs to influence money market rates broadly, but the way to do that is to target a single rate that transmits well to others.\n\nSo which single rate is best? Overnight repo markets are the center of gravity. Within those markets, repos against Treasury collateral make the most appropriate target, because when risk-managed appropriately, they are essentially riskless.\n\nParticipants in dollar funding markets have widely adopted SOFR as a reference rate. It covers north of $2.5 trillion a day in overnight Treasury repos.\n\nBut SOFR isn’t currently a clean gauge of funding costs. SOFR combines two main market segments: tri-party repos that take place primarily between cash investors and large dealers, and centrally cleared repos that take place primarily between large dealers and smaller ones or leveraged investors. Large dealers have some market power in intermediating between the segments, so rates in the centrally cleared segment can partly reflect market power rather than the cost of funds.\n\nThe tri-party general collateral rate (TGCR) is cleaner, and I think it would currently offer the best target. It incorporates more than $1 trillion a day in risk-free transactions that represent a marginal cost of funds and marginal return on investment for a large number of participants. It is calculated with a robust methodology. It transmits well across money markets.\n\nAnd the Fed’s existing tools already provide effective control of TGCR. Let me be clear that by control, I don’t mean pinpoint control to the basis point. In an ample reserves regime, money market rates should average close to interest on reserves, but there can be some fluctuations around that average. It would be perfectly fine, in my view, for TGCR to move up and down from day to day, much as it has for many years. After all, the target range is 25 basis points wide. A tolerance for modest volatility would allow us to maintain rate control with our current simple and efficient tools, without large, frequent or complex operations.\n\nThe shift in private activity toward secured markets makes it very likely, in my view, that the target rate will eventually need to change. If the target rate must change, the best time for a change would be when markets are functioning smoothly and market participants can have plenty of advance notice. Proactively adopting TGCR as the target would allow for an orderly transition. The alternative, waiting for evidence that a change is urgent, could force a rapid switch in a more challenging environment.\n\nAn intermediate option would be to announce a contingency plan but not implement it for the time being. That could allow more time to assess how the Securities and Exchange Commission’s mandate for broader central clearing affects the pros and cons of targeting TGCR versus SOFR. But it’s not my preferred approach, because while a contingency plan is better than no plan, it might still have to be implemented quickly in case of sudden stress.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many aspects of selecting an operating target that I didn’t have time to get into. So I hope you’ll read our full essay. And to reiterate, these are only my views. But I believe the FOMC should modernize the target rate.\n\nThank you."

    "text": "Introduction\n\nWelcome to this year’s primary dealer meeting. Primary dealers play several important roles as trading counterparties in the implementation of monetary policy, as participants in Treasury auctions, and as providers of information on financial markets. These annual meetings provide us an opportunity to strengthen this relationship and communicate our expectations. We also have a shared interest in ensuring that markets function efficiently, effectively, and fairly. To help achieve these goals, the official sector employs a variety of channels, including legal, regulatory, and supervisory. Additionally, officials work with market participants to help guide private-sector solutions. Today, I will speak about our shared efforts in the reform of reference interest rates, focusing the discussion on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s (New York Fed) part as an administrator and producer of reference rates. The views presented here are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nResponding to LIBOR’s Uncertain Future\n\nReference rates serve a number of purposes in financial markets. They facilitate trading in standardized contracts, which can lower transaction costs and improve market liquidity. They can reduce information asymmetries by providing a transparent, independent pricing source. A robust and reliable reference rate can also reduce moral hazard by limiting incentives to misreport pricing for settling a contract. However, a reference rate that is not well designed may increase moral hazard by creating incentives to manipulate the rate.2\n\nNo reference rate is more ubiquitous than the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). U.S. dollar LIBOR is estimated to be referenced in $150 to $200 trillion of financial contracts, including loans, interest rate swaps, and mortgage-backed securities.3 Many market participants, including the primary dealer community gathered here today, have exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR. However, as Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Chief Executive Andrew Bailey noted in a speech last July, the lack of activity in the wholesale unsecured funding markets that underlie LIBOR means the sustainability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed.4 In fact, existing LIBOR panel banks have only agreed with the FCA to support LIBOR through the end of 2021.5 While U.S. dollar LIBOR may exist past 2021, prudent risk management implies preparing for a world without it.\n\nFor several years, the Federal Reserve—in conjunction with others in the official sector—has supported private-sector efforts to identify viable alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR, reduce reliance on LIBOR, and strengthen financial contracts to better address the risk of a cessation of LIBOR. Until relatively recently, this work has focused on the interest rate derivatives market, which represents a very large proportion of total gross notional exposure to LIBOR. But, as Governor Powell noted in a speech in November, the risks to LIBOR highlighted by Andrew Bailey emphasize the need for all participants in the markets where LIBOR currently is referenced to seriously consider how best to transition away from its use.6\n\nFurther, as you are aware from previous meetings, in 2016 the Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG) incorporated recommendations in its Best Practices that market participants should understand their vulnerabilities in using financial benchmarks. The TMPG recommends that where current benchmarks are inconsistent with the Principles for Financial Benchmarks (Principles) published by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), market participants should develop plans to use alternative benchmarks that are consistent with the Principles.7,8 It is important that market participants fully assess their exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR given both its weaknesses as a benchmark and the risk that it may not always be published, and that they take steps to mitigate their exposure by adopting more robust contract language and transitioning to alternative rates.\n\nThis past June, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) selected an overnight Treasury repo reference rate that the New York Fed plans to produce—the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR)—as “best practice for use in certain new U.S. dollar derivatives and other financial contracts”.9,10 The ARRC’s selection of this rate is part of the motivation behind my comments on the New York Fed’s role as an administrator and producer of reference rates.\n\nOver the last two years, the New York Fed has enhanced the calculation of the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and launched an entirely new rate, the overnight bank funding rate (OBFR). We also announced plans to begin producing three Treasury repo reference rates, including the SOFR that was selected by the ARRC. At the core of these developments are investments the Federal Reserve has made in all aspects of the administration and production of reference rates to ensure that our rates are reliable measures of market activity. These rates are anchored in active underlying markets, are based on a comprehensive set of transactions that incorporate controls to mitigate risk of errors and manipulation, and are capable of being published every day, even in adverse circumstances.\n\nThe New York Fed produces reference rates primarily to inform monetary policy implementation by developing a better understanding of money market dynamics and to aid market functioning by providing transparency. For example, collecting the transaction-level data necessary for producing robust reference rates enhances the Federal Reserve’s ability to analyze market developments. While we have not historically produced rates with the explicit goal of having them referenced in financial contracts, we understand that they often are used that way.11 And, we are committed to the continued production of durable rates that market participants can have confidence in over the long run.\n\nIn the remainder of my remarks, I will first describe the improvements the New York Fed has made to our production process and how those improvements ensure that the rates we produce today are reliable. I will then discuss how our three new rates will help deepen our understanding of money market dynamics and provide transparency for secured money markets. Finally, I will address how we plan to maintain the relevance and reliability of our reference rates as markets evolve.\n\nEvolution of the Effective Federal Funds Rate\n\nAdministering and producing reference rates is not a new activity for the New York Fed. Daily calculation of the EFFR dates back at least to the 1950s. Today, changing the target range for the federal funds rate is the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) primary means of communicating adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, and the EFFR serves as a measure to assess whether conditions in money markets are consistent with the policy stance. However, when the New York Fed first produced the EFFR, the federal funds rate was not the FOMC’s policy target.12 Like the OBFR today and our forthcoming repo rates, the EFFR served as a useful indicator of conditions in an important money market.\n\nFrom the 1950s until early 2016, the EFFR was calculated as a volume-weighted mean based on data collected voluntarily from federal funds brokers. While we continue to be confident in the integrity of the EFFR production process employed during those years, the international focus on best practices in the production of reference rates following revelations about the manipulation of LIBOR hastened our efforts to review all aspects of the EFFR production process. This review included an assessment of whether the EFFR could be strengthened by switching to a more robust data source that better reflected activity in the federal funds market, and whether a volume-weighted mean remained the most appropriate measure of central tendency.\n\nAs a result, in March 2016, we began calculating the EFFR using the Report of Selected Money Market Rates (the FR 2420 report), which collects transaction-level data directly from a large set of domestic banks and agencies of foreign banks operating in the United States.13,14 The FR 2420 report offers a wider breadth of market coverage, higher transaction volumes, and more granular information for better data monitoring than the brokered data used previously. At the same time, the measure of central tendency employed was switched to a volume-weighted median, after analysis indicated a median is less likely to be materially impacted by erroneous data and outliers than a volume-weighted mean.15,16\n\nAdditional changes were implemented to further strengthen the EFFR. We invested in a sophisticated production platform to ensure a well-controlled end-to-end production process, from collection of the data to rate calculation and publication. We refined our framework for regular review by oversight bodies, and enhanced our ethics and conflict-of-interest policies for staff involved in reference rate production. We also put in place a resilient backup production process—including geographic dispersion of staff and platforms involved in data collection, administration, and publication—and developed a data contingency plan that features a backup source of transaction data.\n\nReflecting our commitment to producing rates aligned with international best practices, we will publish a statement for all reference rates the New York Fed administers and produces documenting their compliance with IOSCO’s Principles. We anticipate publishing such a statement for the EFFR and OBFR in the next few weeks, and we will release similar documentation of compliance with IOSCO’s Principles for the three planned Treasury repo rates likely around the time of their initial publication.\n\nDevelopment of a New Overnight Bank Funding Rate\n\nAs we worked to enhance production of the EFFR, we also developed the OBFR—the New York Fed’s first reference rate designed from the outset to be compliant with IOSCO’s Principles. The OBFR was created to increase the amount and quality of publicly-available information about overnight unsecured funding costs of U.S.-based banks. The OBFR is calculated using both federal funds and Eurodollar transactions, as reported in the FR 2420 report.17,18 Many U.S.-based banks are active in the federal funds and Eurodollar markets, so having a measure of borrowing costs across both markets provides a more complete picture of overnight unsecured borrowing costs than looking at the federal funds market alone.\n\nWhen we launched the OBFR in the first quarter of 2016, daily Eurodollar volume was in excess of $200 billion. Today, however, volume is nearly 50 percent lower. The decline largely reflects two factors: less investment by prime money market funds, and a substitution from offshore to onshore wholesale deposits by some banks. The former is a function of the more than $1 trillion decline in prime money market fund assets under management in 2016 associated with the implementation of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) money market fund reforms.19 The latter reflects some U.S.-based banks shifting from taking deposits in their Caribbean branches to taking similar deposits onshore.20 Eurodollar deposits currently are captured in the FR 2420 report, and included in the OBFR. However, onshore wholesale deposits are not captured. The Federal Reserve is considering enhancing the FR 2420 report to capture such “onshore Eurodollar” deposits, where the motivation, counterparty, and pricing are similar to the Eurodollar deposits included in the FR 2420 report. If these transactions are collected in the FR 2420 report, we will consider including them in the OBFR as well.\n\nConsistent with our ongoing analysis of the scope of transactions underlying the OBFR, creating a durable reference rate that is reliable over the long run involves some need for flexibility. Financial markets are not static; they evolve. And, for a reference rate to remain relevant over the long run, it must have the flexibility to evolve with the market that underlies it. Of course, changing the calculation of a rate too frequently may create excessive volatility and uncertainty as to exactly what the rate measures, potentially contributing to a loss of confidence in the integrity of the rate. For this reason, we believe it is important to be clear in describing what each reference rate we produce is meant to measure. We do not wish to make frequent changes to the rates we produce, but we are committed to making necessary ones.\n\nExpanding Production to Treasury Repo Rates\n\nSecured markets—the Treasury repo market in particular—also play a critical role in the efficient functioning of financial markets and the implementation of monetary policy.21 However, historically there have been limited data available to the public on the Treasury repo market.22 In November 2016, the New York Fed announced that, in cooperation with the Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Research (OFR), we were considering publishing three reference rates based on overnight Treasury repo transactions to improve repo market transparency. Publication of these rates should improve market functioning and our insight into monetary policy implementation. Additionally, the ARRC had expressed interest in a repo rate produced by the public sector as a possible alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR.23\n\nWhy Produce Three Treasury Repo Rates?\n\nHaving identified an opportunity to provide greater transparency into conditions in the Treasury repo market and support reference rate reform, we decided to produce not just one new repo rate, but three. Why three?\n\nFirst and foremost, we wanted to produce a rate reflective of a broad swath of activity in the Treasury repo market. At the same time, we recognized that one broad rate might not consistently reflect differing conditions in various segments of the market. Dynamics in the overnight Treasury tri-party repo market—the segment of the market characterized by cash-rich investors such as money market funds lending to government securities dealers—may not always be the same as dynamics in the blind-brokered, largely interdealer GCF Repo service offered by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). For example, greater opportunity for balance sheet netting resulting from a single central counterparty in the GCF Repo market, and the blind-brokered nature of trading in that market are two differences between the tri-party and GCF Repo markets that impact the set of counterparties active in each market and incentives for trading. Both of these factors could manifest in a divergence in rates.24\n\nTrades in the tri-party and GCF Repo markets are made against pools of “general” collateral. In a general collateral (GC) repo trade, the cash provider stipulates a population of acceptable collateral—for example, all Treasury securities—but does not stipulate the specific securities that must be pledged to settle the transaction. However, in the bilateral repo market, where the services of a tri-party agent are not used, the counterparties themselves identify specific securities to settle each trade. As a result, the bilateral repo market can be used to temporarily acquire specific securities, which can create different trading incentives than simply investing cash against a pool of securities. In particular, demand for specific securities—the supply of which may be relatively scarce—can have a significant impact on rates in the bilateral repo market.\n\nThe money market funds eligible to participate in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repurchase facility (ON RRP) predominantly lend cash in the tri-party market.25 As such, a rate focused only on the tri-party repo market may be useful when evaluating money market fund participation in the ON RRP. On the other hand, a broad measure of the cost of financing Treasury securities in the repo market—one not just limited to GC trades—may be a better fit for other purposes. For example, a broad measure may be a better reflection of the average secured funding cost for a bank holding company that participates across the tri-party, centrally-cleared interdealer, and bilateral repo markets.26\n\nOur choice to produce three overnight Treasury repo rates recognizes this “fit for purpose” issue. Given existing market segmentation and the potential for activity to shift across segments as the repo market evolves, one rate likely is not a perfect fit for all needs. However, producing a vast number of very similar rates is not practical either. From the public feedback received, we believe that producing these three rates will strike the right balance.\n\nWhat are the Three Rates the New York Fed Will Produce?\n\nI will provide an overview of each rate’s “Interest,” the term in IOSCO’s Principles for what a rate conceptually is intended to measure. Transactions in which the Federal Reserve is a counterparty will be excluded from all three rates, as the rates are meant to reflect private-market transactions, and the Federal Reserve’s motivation for transacting in the repo market tends to be different than for other participants.27\n\nThe first rate—the tri-party general collateral rate, or TGCR—is intended as a measure of rates on overnight, tri-party Treasury GC repo transactions where the counterparties involved know each other’s identity at the time of the trade. The terms of all tri-party trades are bilaterally negotiated between the security and cash providers before using the services of a tri-party agent to clear and settle trades. Based on recent data, the TGCR would include around $280 billion of daily tri-party repo transactions.\n\nThe second rate—the broad general collateral rate, or BGCR—is intended to capture all trades where the specific securities provided as collateral are not identified until after other terms of the trade are agreed. The BGCR will include all trades in the TGCR plus other GC trades, such as those that are blind brokered. Given the addition of approximately $15 billion in overnight Treasury GCF repo transaction volume, if calculated today the BGCR would capture nearly $300 billion in daily transaction volume.\n\nThe third rate—SOFR—is the broadest measure of the cost of borrowing overnight in the repo market using Treasury securities as collateral. The first two rates—the TGCR and BGCR—both focus exclusively on the GC repo market, but, as I noted earlier, not all repo trades are for “general” collateral. Many trades in the bilateral repo market are at rates similar to those on GC repo trades in the tri-party repo market, with the cash providers’ motivation for lending in the bilateral market very similar to the motivation of a cash provider in the tri-party repo market. However, in some bilateral repo market trades the cash provider is seeking to acquire specific Treasury securities, and the specific securities to be delivered are determined at the outset of the trade, before a rate is agreed. When such trades occur at rates below prevailing rates on GC trades, the securities collateralizing the repo are said to be trading “special.” The more demand for a specific security exceeds the supply available to be lent, the greater the “specialness” premium for that security, and the lower the rate on repo trades for that security. A cash provider’s motivation for entering GC and “specials” repo trades is different—investing cash in the case of a GC trade and acquiring specific securities in a “specials” trade. However, irrespective of the motivation of the cash provider, both types of trades provide the cash borrower a means to borrow funds with Treasury securities as collateral.\n\nSOFR is intended to reflect the general cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, regardless of the motivation of the cash providers participating in the trades. However, a limited number of Treasury securities often trade with a significant “specialness” premium—i.e., at rates considerably lower than those prevailing for GC trades and most “specials” trades. A significant “specialness” premium implies that the supply-demand dynamics for a particular Treasury security are very different than for the vast majority of Treasury securities. To mitigate the potential influence of Treasury securities trading very “special,” we will remove a portion of the lowest-rate transactions in the bilateral repo market from the calculation of the SOFR.\n\nGiven the significant activity in the bilateral repo market cleared by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), transaction volume underlying the SOFR would be in the neighborhood of $800 billion if calculated today, more than double the volume underlying the BGCR.\n\nStarting in the second quarter of this year, the New York Fed expects to begin producing and publishing the three repo rates on a daily basis, alongside the EFFR and OBFR. We have explored how best to calculate each of the three rates—also incorporating public comment received through the Federal Register Notice process—and arrived at a calculation methodology for each rate. I will not discuss every aspect of each rate, as that detailed information is already available, but there are four key points that are important to highlight.28\n\nFirst, all three repo rates will be calculated as volume-weighted medians.29 We selected the volume-weighted median as the most appropriate measure of central tendency for these rates for the same reasons we selected it for the EFFR and OBFR. A median is more robust to submissions of erroneous data and is more likely to reflect a transacted rate, as compared with a volume-weighted mean.30\n\nSecond, we have put in place various measures that should mitigate the risks associated with data collection for all three rates. While some have expressed concern that a portion of the data underlying the rates is collected under a commercial agreement, the production of a transaction-based rate necessitates the collection of transaction data, and there are inherent risks in any data collection. I would also note that in November, OFR announced plans to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking this year to collect the cleared repo data underlying the BGCR and SOFR.31 Simply put, if the markets underlying the three repo rates are active, I do not anticipate that acquisition of necessary data will be an impediment to the ongoing production of the rates.\n\nThird, I want to provide further clarity around our method for identifying the set of bilateral trades to be excluded or “trimmed” from the SOFR, and discuss why we settled on this particular approach.\n\nOur use of a volume-weighted median helps to ensure that “specials” will not have an undue influence on the rate; however, we have taken additional precautions to ensure that this is the case. All transactions in the FICC-cleared bilateral data set with rates below the 25th volume-weighted percentile will be removed, and the remaining bilateral transactions will then be combined with the tri-party and GCF Repo transactions to calculate the SOFR. In selecting this trimming methodology, we sought a method that would remove transactions for securities trading with an extreme “specialness” premium, consistent with the concept of the SOFR I outlined earlier, while also being relatively easy to communicate. We explored a variety of potential trimming methods and settled on the one we feel is the simplest that still gets the job done.\n\nFinally, we are working to determine what additional historical data we can provide for all three repo rates, which is reflective of the requests for such data received through the public comment process. There has been particular focus on data for the SOFR, as some have suggested that providing a time series of the SOFR extending back prior to 2007 and the onset of the financial crisis would ease adoption of the rate as an alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. We have previously released indicative rates for the TGCR, BGCR, and SOFR from August 2014 forward based on transaction-level data provided by the tri-party clearing banks and DTCC, and we are looking into producing similar indicative rates for dates earlier than 2014.32, 33 However, the calculation of these rates utilizes some information that first became available after the financial crisis as part of reforms to the tri-party repo market infrastructure. While we may be able to provide additional historical data beyond what we have already published, it is unlikely such data will reach prior to the onset of the financial crisis for any of the three rates.\n\nHowever, for nearly two decades, the New York Fed has collected daily summary data from the primary dealers on their borrowing across all segments of the overnight Treasury general collateral repo market. A rate based on these summary data may serve as a useful indicator of the behavior of rates in the overnight Treasury repo market, and the New York Fed is considering a one-time release of a time series of this primary dealer survey rate. While a rate based on the primary dealer data would cover similar segments of the repo market as the SOFR, the rate would not be a perfect substitute for the SOFR. For example, the primary dealer survey rate would be a volume-weighted mean, would only cover the GC segment of the repo market, and would not cover activity by non-primary dealers. Additionally, the rate could not be produced in a process aligned with international best practices.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nTo conclude, I hope that I have provided you with a brief history of the New York Fed’s role as an administrator and producer of reference rates while highlighting various aspects of the Treasury repo rates we plan to begin producing later this year, including the role these rates play in mitigating risks from overreliance on U.S. dollar LIBOR. In the end, I hope you walk away with two key messages.\n\nFirst, the New York Fed is committed to producing durable reference rates. That is, we are committed to producing rates that are robust and resilient, both now and in the future. These rates are compliant with IOSCO’s Principles, and best practice dictates that administrators periodically review the rates they produce to assess whether changes in the underlying markets require changes to those rates. The New York Fed plans to perform such reviews periodically for the repo rates, as well as for the EFFR and OBFR. We do not anticipate frequent changes to how we calculate the rates we produce, but if we believe changes are necessary, we are committed to making them, and to doing so in a transparent fashion that provides an opportunity for public input. The integrity of the rates we produce is of the utmost importance, whether they are used for analytical purposes or as reference rates in financial contracts.\n\nSecond, recognizing that the long-term availability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed, it is critical that market participants with exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR assess their associated risk and take steps to mitigate their exposure. While individual firms must decide on the most appropriate way to manage LIBOR-related risk, we encourage all to take two steps at a minimum: (1) adopt contract language capable of addressing the cessation of a reference rate, and (2) reduce reliance on U.S. dollar LIBOR by transitioning to robust alternative rates, such as the SOFR. In addition to being in the best interest of individual financial institutions, greater reliance on robust alternative reference rates aids the transmission of monetary policy and reduces financial stability risks.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n1 I would like to thank William Riordan for his assistance in the preparation of these remarks, as well as colleagues in the Federal Reserve System, including David Bowman, James Clouse, Joshua Frost, Jane Ihrig, Joshua Louria, Simon Potter, and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, for numerous insightful comments and suggestions.\n\n2 For more on the use of reference rates, please see Towards better reference rate practices: a central bank perspective, Bank for International Settlements, March 2013, and Duffie, Darrell, and Jeremy C.

The ARRC was charged with identifying a robust alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR, and with developing a plan to encourage its use in some derivatives and other transactions. For more on the ARRC, including the selection of its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR, see the ARRC website.\n\n10 “Treasury repo” refers to repurchase agreement (repo) transactions on U.S. Treasury securities.\n\n11 In May 2016, The Risk Management Association (RMA) and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) recommended the use of the OBFR “as a benchmark for pricing and performance reporting purposes to replace the fed funds open rate.” (https://www.sifma.org/resources/news/rma-and-sifma-recommend-new-york-feds-overnight-bank-funding-rate-as-new-benchmark-to-replace-the-fed-funds-open-rate/) The announcement by RMA and SIFMA followed work by the TMPG on best practice guidance to address the use of financial benchmarks in the Treasury, agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities markets.\n\n12 The FOMC did not begin targeting the federal funds rate until the 1980s.

However, there is an active market for Eurodollars in the U.S., with U.S.-based banks indirectly borrowing Eurodollars through their offshore branches and then transferring the funds onshore.\n\n18 Currently, daily transaction volume in the federal funds market is about $90 billion, while the Eurodollar market is larger, with daily volume of about $120 billion.\n\n19 For more on the money market fund reforms, see SEC Adopts Money Market Fund Reform Rules, 23 July 2014.\n\n20 The minutes from the May 2017 FOMC meeting noted that the Committee was informed of analysis Federal Reserve staff were undertaking to understand “changes in the practices of some domestic and foreign banks for booking certain types of liabilities” that had resulted in a reduction in Eurodollar transactions in the FR 2420 report.\n\n21 The New York Fed's Open Market Trading Desk does not operate directly in the federal funds market to implement monetary policy; rather, temporary open market operations to aid in control of short-term interest rates are conducted in the repo market.\n\n22 The Treasury repo market is estimated to be in excess of $4 trillion, but the exact size of market is difficult to measure, given a paucity of data on certain segments of the market. This estimate is based on methodology used in Mapping and Sizing the U.S. Repo Market, Liberty Street Economics, 25 June 2012.\n\n23 The ARRC noted in its Interim Report and Consultation (May 2016) that it “expressed some preference for a [repo] rate produced by the public sector.”\n\n24 Currently, the value of cash borrowed in the overnight Treasury tri-party repo market is many multiples of that borrowed in the GCF Repo market. As such, dynamics in the tri-party repo market likely will dominate in a reference rate that combines activity in both markets. However, the size gap between the two market segments was much smaller in recent years, and it may narrow again as the two markets evolve. In assessing repo market segmentation, we did not simply focus on current market dynamics, but also looked at historical behavior while recognizing that the repo market may evolve in uncertain ways.\n\n25 While still predominantly using the tri-party repo market for lending cash in the repo market, money market funds have expanded their lending in the bilateral repo market since the SEC’s money market fund reforms were implemented in 2016.\n\n26 The rate capturing the broadest measure of the activity in the overnight Treasury repo market will include transactions executed in the tri-party and GCF Repo markets, as well as transactions executed using the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation’s (FICC) DVP repo service. FICC’s DVP repo service is a form of bilateral repo, as it does not use the tri-party infrastructure to settle trades.\n\n27 Cash borrowers in the repo market generally are motivated by a need to raise cash, including financing their security holdings. Meanwhile, cash providers typically are motivated by either earning a return on invested cash or acquiring specific securities. However, repos also serve as one of the Federal Reserve’s tools for monetary policy implementation, and the Fed’s motivations for using repos likely are quite different from other market participants. For example, the Fed’s motivation for operating the ON RRP is neither to raise cash nor to finance the Treasury securities held in the System Open Market Account. As indicated in the FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, the ON RRP helps control the federal funds rate by supplementing interest paid on excess reserve balances.\n\n28 For information on the calculation of the repo rates please see Investigating the Proposed Overnight Treasury GC Repo Benchmark Rates, Liberty Street Economics, 19 December 2016; Introducing the Revised Broad Treasuries Financing Rate, Liberty Street Economics, 19 June 2017; The Cleared Bilateral Repo Market and Proposed Repo Benchmark Rates, FEDS Note, 27 February 2017; and the Federal Register Notice linked to this Federal Reserve Board press release (8 December 2017).\n\n29 In addition to publishing the volume-weighted median, the New York Fed will publish summary statistics for each rate. These will consist of the 1st, 25th, 75th, and 99th volume-weighted percentile rates, and the transaction volumes.\n\n30 Although some have expressed concerns that a median may be significantly more volatile than a volume-weighted mean in the context of these repo data, the New York Fed’s internal analysis of the transaction-level data has not found this to be the case. In fact, a volume-weighted median actually appears to be less susceptible to changing in response to small changes in the empirical distribution of rates than either a volume-weighted mean or a trimmed mean.\n\n31 See OFR Update on Bilateral Repo Collection, 22 November 2017.\n\n32 These indicative rates were produced using transaction-level data from the tri-party clearing banks and DTCC that are similar to those that will underlie the production TGCR, BGCR, and SOFR when they are formally launched later this year, and were compiled using the calculation methodology that will be utilized for the production rates. However, the indicative rates were not produced in a manner that is as robust as the IOSCO-complaint production process that will be utilized when the rates are launched in the second quarter of this year.\n\n33 For the previously released indicative rates, see Joshua Frost’s presentation at the Alternative Reference Rates Committee Roundtable, 2 November 2017."

    "text": "Good afternoon. As members of the Foreign Exchange Committee, you are all well aware of the importance of well-functioning financial markets. I would like to thank you for the commitment you have shown to supporting the smooth functioning of the foreign exchange market. Your continued leadership is especially important in these challenging times. And we are all grateful to those who are putting themselves in harm’s way on the front lines to take care of others during this unprecedented public health emergency.\n\nIn early to mid-March, amid extreme volatility across financial markets triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, several markets at the center of the U.S. financial system were severely disrupted. In short-term funding markets, it was difficult to borrow for longer than overnight. In the usually very liquid markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), trading became impaired. In investment-grade credit markets, even healthy borrowers found that credit was unavailable or very expensive.\n\nThese markets matter not only for those who participate in them, but also—because of their central role in the financial system—for workers and families throughout the United States. Continued disruptions could quickly make it more difficult for families to obtain mortgages at reasonable interest rates, for businesses to fund their operations and pay their workers, and for local, state, and federal governments to pay for essential services. Such a credit crunch would exacerbate the hardships many are experiencing in this period of economic constraint necessary to fight the spread of the coronavirus, and reduce the odds of a strong recovery afterward.\n\nTherefore, it was important for the Federal Reserve to act quickly and decisively to support market functioning and the flow of credit. Over a period of a few weeks, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to near zero. The Federal Reserve also announced a sequence of strong actions to support the flow of funding in short-term markets, the functioning of Treasury and MBS markets, and the availability of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments.\n\nToday, I will provide an overview of these actions to date from my perspective as manager of the System Open Market Account and head of the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk. The Fed’s recent actions have involved an unprecedented array of tools—from standard open market operations conducted by the Desk and deployed on a larger scale than ever before, to new facilities that use the Federal Reserve’s emergency powers with the consent of the Treasury Secretary and financial backing from the Treasury and Congress. Some actions targeted problems in a single market, while others worked to support functioning across many markets. In addition, because they were deployed in close succession, the actions reinforced each other, with improvements in each market supporting the functioning of other markets and the financial system overall. I will speak about recent actions to support liquidity and the flow of credit in four areas: domestic short-term funding markets, international dollar funding markets, markets for Treasuries and MBS, and credit markets.\n\nBefore I proceed, let me note that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nDomestic Short-Term Funding Markets\n\nFunding markets transfer funds from households and businesses that seek safe, easily accessible short-term investments to firms that have short-term borrowing needs. For example, a manufacturing company with a temporary surplus of cash might invest in a money market mutual fund, planning to take the money back out in a few weeks to invest in new equipment. In turn, the money market fund might buy commercial paper issued by another company that needs to cover its payroll, or it might use a repurchase agreement (or “repo”) to lend to a broker-dealer that needs to finance an inventory of Treasury securities. The smooth flow of funds in these markets allows businesses to readily finance their operations and investors to engage in vibrant trading that keeps a wide range of other markets working well.\n\nIn mid-March, short-term funding markets became severely impaired. In repo and commercial paper markets, there was little term funding available. Even for overnight borrowing, some market participants paid much higher rates than usual. Figure 1 shows the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is the median rate on certain overnight repos against Treasury collateral, as well as the 75th and 95th percentiles of the distribution of these Treasury repo rates. Ordinarily, this distribution of rates is very tight. However, in the second and third weeks of March, it widened notably, with some borrowers paying dozens of basis points above the median, and well above the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate.\n\nThe initial pressures in funding markets led to further strains. Investors became reluctant to buy the commercial paper of healthy issuers, for fear that when the paper came due, the issuers would have difficulty rolling it over into new paper. Prime money market funds—which invest in commercial paper—saw outflows of about $150 billion over the month of March as some investors worried that difficulty selling holdings would eventually prevent the funds from satisfying withdrawals.\n\nStarting March 9, the Federal Reserve launched a series of actions to stabilize funding markets. The first two actions involved expanding the use of standard tools: repo operations by the Desk and discount window lending by all 12 Reserve Banks.\n\nThe Desk increased daily offerings of overnight repos from $100 billion to $150 billion, then to $175 billion, and ultimately to even larger amounts.2 The Desk also began offerings of one-month and three-month term repos, each for $500 billion.3 These offerings allow dealers to access ample funding for Treasury and MBS collateral.\nThe Federal Reserve Board lowered the primary credit rate by 150 basis points, to 0.25 percent, and announced that banks could borrow from the discount window for up to 90 days.4 These steps provide banks with ready access to funding that they can use to provide credit to households and businesses.\nShortly thereafter, several additional actions used emergency tools, based on the Board’s authority to act in unusual and exigent circumstances with consent of the Treasury Secretary and, in some cases, funding as well:\n\nThe Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) allows the New York Fed’s primary dealers to obtain funding against a wide range of collateral at the same rate as the discount rate. By increasing dealers’ access to funding, this facility helps them to provide credit across numerous markets.5\nThe Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF) lends against assets that banks acquire from money market funds. By helping to ensure that money market funds will be able to meet demands for redemptions, this facility encourages investors to leave cash in these funds, which then provide credit that flows to the broader economy.6\nThe Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) purchases commercial paper directly from highly rated companies and municipal governments. The availability of this facility reduces the risk that eligible commercial paper issuers will be unable to roll over their debts at maturity. In turn, the reduction in risk encourages investors to buy commercial paper from businesses that use the funds to pay employees and invest in operations, and from municipalities that use credit to provide public services. Furthermore, because this facility purchases newly issued commercial paper, it not only enhances liquidity but also directly supports the flow of credit to eligible issuers.7\nInternational Dollar Funding Markets\n\nAs the world’s preeminent reserve currency, the dollar plays a leading role in trade and investment far beyond our country’s borders. Banks around the world borrow dollars in international markets to finance these activities. In addition, global banks borrow dollars to finance investments in the United States—lending, that is, to American families, companies, and the U.S. government. As members of the FX Committee, you are well versed in the importance of international dollar funding markets.\n\nThese markets, too, came under severe strain in March. Shown in Figure 2, the yen-dollar swap basis spread—a measure of the premium paid to borrow dollars using yen in the foreign exchange market—soared by roughly 200 basis points. Other foreign exchange swap basis spreads also rose sharply, and foreign exchange swap trading volumes declined. These pressures had the potential to spill over to domestic funding markets, as international banks can compete to borrow dollars in the U.S., as well as the potential to disrupt the flow of credit from international financial institutions to domestic borrowers.\n\nTo ease strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets, the Federal Reserve and other central banks took coordinated actions in March to enhance the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity through central bank swap lines around the world. These swap lines are designed to improve liquidity conditions in the United States and abroad by providing foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver dollar funding to institutions in their jurisdictions during times of global funding market stress. This supports activities that rely on access to U.S. dollar funding, including supplying credit to U.S. borrowers. The Federal Reserve and the central banks of Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Switzerland, and the euro area agreed to lower the pricing on the standing swap lines, to supply dollars at longer tenors in addition to regular one-week operations, and to increase the frequency of one-week operations. The Federal Reserve also established temporary swap lines, limited in size, with nine other central banks around the world.\n\nIn addition to the swap lines, the Federal Reserve established a temporary repo facility to allow foreign and international monetary authorities to temporarily exchange U.S. Treasury securities held in their accounts with the New York Fed for U.S. dollars. This facility provides those central banks with an alternative source of dollar funding that they can then lend to institutions in their jurisdictions. The facility also helps to support the smooth functioning of the market for U.S. Treasury securities by reducing foreign central banks’ need to sell these securities outright when private cash and repo markets become stressed.\n\nMarkets for Treasury and Mortgage-Backed Securities\n\nThe market for U.S. Treasury securities is commonly described as the deepest and most liquid in the world. Ordinarily, it is easy for investors to sell Treasuries quickly and at low cost. This liquidity adds significantly to the value of Treasury securities, helping the U.S. government to borrow at low interest rates. As many other interest rates are priced relative to the safe interest rate on Treasuries, the liquidity of the Treasury market ultimately reduces financing costs for families and firms throughout the economy.\n\nAlthough not as liquid as the Treasury market, the market for agency MBS—pools of residential mortgages backed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac—is also ordinarily very liquid. This liquidity makes MBS a more attractive investment, supporting low mortgage rates and the flow of mortgage financing to American households.\n\nHowever, in mid-March, liquidity in Treasuries and MBS dried up. The Desk’s market monitoring and data analysis suggest that two key factors were at work. First, amid large moves in asset prices and uncertainty about access to liquidity, many investors sought to sell bond holdings. Some of these investors, such as asset managers that might need to meet redemptions, were seeking to raise cash. Others were rebalancing their portfolios after the sharp fall in equity prices, or exiting positions that were no longer viable in the highly volatile market conditions. These large sales of bonds drove up dealers’ inventories of Treasuries and MBS; facing balance sheet constraints and internal risk limits amid the elevated volatility, dealers had to cut back on intermediation. Second, volatile market conditions led some trading firms to step back from the market, further reducing liquidity. Figure 3 shows the consequences: The average bid-ask spread for Treasury securities, a measure of transactions costs, rose by a factor of about 13 over the first few weeks of March. Many other measures of functioning in the Treasury and MBS markets also deteriorated.\n\nIn response, the Desk, at the direction of the FOMC, is undertaking extensive purchases of Treasuries and MBS to support the functioning of these critical markets. Although asset purchases are a standard Desk tool, the scale of these purchases has been unparalleled, totaling about $1.6 trillion in the past four weeks. Also, we are now buying agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which are pools of mortgages on apartment buildings and other commercial properties that are backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. As important as the volume of purchases is the FOMC’s commitment, announced March 23, to purchase whatever amounts are needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy.8 Extending a strong commitment to support market functioning has calmed trading conditions and allayed the potentially self-fulfilling fear that conditions might deteriorate further.\n\nI should note that supporting smooth market functioning does not mean restoring every aspect of market functioning to its level before the coronavirus crisis. Some aspects of liquidity—especially aspects related to transactions costs and market depth—are importantly affected by fundamental factors such as how the current extraordinary uncertainty about the economic outlook influences trading behavior. These aspects of market functioning may not return all the way to pre-crisis levels for some time, even as our purchases slow.\n\nNor does supporting smooth market functioning mean eliminating all volatility. In well-functioning markets, prices will respond rapidly and efficiently to new information. During the unprecedented disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, a great deal of new information arrives every day about the outlook for specific markets, such as housing, and for the economy as a whole. These changes in the outlook should move the Treasury and agency MBS markets irrespective of the Federal Reserve’s purchases.\n\nCredit Markets\n\nIn normal times, credit markets allow households and businesses to finance a vast array of activities: buying a car or a house, attending college, covering a short-term gap between revenue and expenses, or making a long-term investment in new products or factories. In this time of economic stress, credit markets are all the more critical, helping families to borrow rather than forgo necessities, and helping businesses to keep going, cover their payrolls, and, eventually, make the investments needed for a strong recovery.\n\nYet credit markets have come under substantial pressure in recent weeks. For example, the spread of interest rates on investment-grade corporate bonds relative to Treasury securities widened by about 250 basis points from late February to mid-March, as illustrated in Figure 4.\n\nMuch of that pressure results from significant changes in the economic outlook: With many businesses temporarily closed and millions of people losing their jobs, lenders see a greater likelihood that some borrowers will be unable to repay. But impaired market functioning has also contributed to the pressures. For example, borrowers often repay their debts by borrowing anew, but rolling over debt is difficult in a stressed market, so lenders may conclude that market dysfunction will lead to defaults even by financially sound borrowers and respond by reducing lending or seeking higher interest rates. We saw several signs that poor market conditions were contributing to credit stress in March, including a drop-off in corporate and municipal bond issuance and large outflows from bond mutual funds.\n\nMany of the Federal Reserve actions in funding and asset markets that I described earlier are also helping to support credit markets. For example, the PDCF, CPFF, and MMLF can all provide funding for loans to creditworthy borrowers such as households, businesses, or local governments, while MBS purchases support a key market for credit to households.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve Board, with the consent of the Treasury Secretary and backing provided by the Treasury and Congress under the CARES Act, has used its emergency authority to announce numerous steps targeted at other major credit markets. The Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF) will buy newly issued corporate bonds and syndicated loans, while the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) will give investors an outlet to sell corporate bonds—in both cases supporting a key market for credit to large employers.9 The Board has also announced a Main Street Lending Program that will purchase up to $600 billion in loans to small and midsize businesses, as well as a facility that will support the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that make PPP loans to small businesses.10 In addition, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) will support the issuance of securities backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans, small business loans, and other debt, while the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF) will lend up to $500 billion to state and local governments.11 All of these steps will help keep credit markets working and credit flowing to qualified borrowers in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nConclusion\n\nModern financial markets are closely connected to one another. Stresses in one market can easily lead to stresses in others, raising the risk that the financial system as a whole becomes significantly impaired. For example, if short-term funding markets are disrupted, otherwise creditworthy borrowers may have difficulty rolling over their debts—which can make the borrowers more risky and create pressures in credit markets. The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-’08 showed how rapidly problems can spread across financial markets and ultimately damage the economy.\n\nToday’s crisis is different, having originated outside the financial system, in an enormous challenge to public health. Yet the lesson of the previous crisis still applies, and the Federal Reserve has taken it to heart in responding to the recent stresses in funding markets, Treasury and MBS markets, and credit markets. By acting quickly and forcefully to support all of these markets at once, we have been able to stabilize market conditions. Many challenges surely lie ahead for the economy and financial markets. But the past month demonstrates that the Federal Reserve will use its tools aggressively to keep markets working so that credit can flow to households, businesses, and state and local governments throughout our economy.\n\nThank you.\n\nFigures PDF\n\n\n1 I would like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for his assistance in preparing these remarks, Ashley Rhodes for her assistance with data, and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for valuable comments and suggestions.\n\n2 See Statement Regarding Repurchase Operations (March 9, 2020), Statement Regarding Repurchase Operations (March 11, 2020), and Statement Regarding Repurchase Operations (March 17, 2020).\n\n3 See Statement Regarding Treasury Reserve Management Purchases and Repurchase Operations (March 12, 2020).\n\n4 See Federal Reserve Actions to Support the Flow of Credit to Households and Businesses, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (March 15, 2020).\n\n5 See Primary Dealer Credit Facility, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n6 See Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n7 See Commercial Paper Funding Facility, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n8 See Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement (March 23, 2020).\n\n9 See Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n10 See Main Street Lending Program and Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n11 See Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility and Municipal Liquidity Facility, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System."

    "text": "Remarks before the Money Marketeers of New York University (delivered via videoconference)As prepared for delivery\nThank you to the Money Marketeers of New York University for inviting me to speak today.1\n\nMoney markets are vital to the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses, and central to the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy implementation. For nearly 75 years, the Money Marketeers has been an essential forum for discussing critical issues related to money markets. I am pleased that this group is continuing to meet virtually in these challenging times, allowing this important dialogue to continue. I look forward to our discussion.\n\nWhen I last spoke with this group in April 2019, I talked about the recent decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to maintain an ample reserves regime as its long-run framework for implementing monetary policy.2 An ample reserves regime is a version of a “floor” system in which reserves are supplied in sufficient quantity to ensure that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates. At the time, I noted two key benefits that the FOMC highlighted in choosing this framework. First, it provides effective control over short-term interest rates in a broad range of environments, including during periods when large amounts of liquidity are needed to relieve stress in the financial system or large-scale asset purchases are required to support the U.S. economy.3 And, second, from an operational perspective, a steady-state ample reserves regime can be simple and efficient to operate.\n\nHowever, in March, the global financial system experienced an extraordinary shock, triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, and our focus shifted rapidly. The Federal Reserve took swift and decisive action to address the shift in the economic outlook and deteriorating conditions in financial markets. The FOMC cut the target range for the federal funds rate close to zero, and directed the Desk to conduct repo operations and purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to support market functioning. The Federal Reserve undertook a wide range of additional steps—many in coordination with the U.S. Treasury—to support the flow of credit to the U.S. economy, and coordinated with foreign central banks to stabilize dollar funding conditions. Some regulations were also temporarily adjusted to encourage bank lending. These measures, alongside swift and forceful fiscal policy action, succeeded in stabilizing financial markets and averted an even deeper collapse in economic activity.4\n\nAlthough the pandemic shock itself was unprecedented, the responses that it required—a rapid increase in assets and expansion of liquidity—were the type of actions the FOMC contemplated when choosing an ample reserves regime. And, as expected, the shift to operating at much higher reserve levels has been smooth, allowing the FOMC to focus on supporting the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Today I’d like to talk about this shift to higher reserve levels and our observations on money markets so far, and explain why the Federal Reserve’s framework is well suited to implement policy in this environment.\n\nLet me note that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Impact Has the Federal Reserve’s Pandemic Response Had on the Balance Sheet and Reserve Balances?\n\nI would like to start with a review of changes in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet since March. It is the size of the balance sheet and composition of liabilities that determine the level of reserves in the banking system, which, in turn, has a meaningful influence on money market rates and policy implementation.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet grew at a historic pace between March and June of this year as a result of the FOMC’s critical actions to support market functioning and the flow of credit to the U.S. economy. Most of the increase resulted from purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS, shown in dark and light blue. Expanded repo operations and central bank liquidity swaps, as well as credit and liquidity facilities established with the support of the U.S. Treasury—collectively shown in gray—also contributed to this growth.5 More recently, the rate of growth in the balance sheet has slowed. With market functioning significantly improved, outstanding balances across funding operations and credit and liquidity facilities have gradually declined, and the pace of net Treasury and agency MBS purchases has been steady since June.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve expands its assets, reserves in the banking system increase. This is mechanical; for example, when the Desk purchases securities from dealers, the Federal Reserve funds these purchases by crediting the reserve accounts of dealers’ custodian banks.6 As shown in dark blue in Figure 2, reserves in the banking system grew rapidly during the spring, and have reached a level of over $3 trillion, exceeding the prior peak in reserves, which occurred in 2014.7\n\nIn addition to supplying reserves to the banking system, the Federal Reserve maintains an account for the U.S. government, known as the Treasury General Account (TGA), as well as accounts for other domestic and foreign official entities.8 Increases in the balances held in these accounts alter the composition of liabilities on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and reduce the level of reserves in the banking system. For example, when investors purchase Treasury debt, funds are transferred from their bank accounts to the TGA.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, the TGA has risen dramatically since March, as the Treasury Department built cash balances to prepare for potentially unprecedented outflows related to the pandemic response.9 Treasury’s cash management policy is motivated by precautionary risk management and calibrated to allow Treasury to cover outflows in case of a temporary interruption to market access.10 The TGA currently stands at roughly $1.5 trillion, nearly four times its largest size prior to this year. This balance is generally expected to fall in the coming months and, while the extent of the decline is uncertain, most expect the balance to remain well above historical norms.\n\nCurrency in circulation is another liability that affects the level of reserves. The pandemic increased the public’s demand for currency, likely for both precautionary and transactional purposes. As a result, currency has grown at a rapid pace compared to prior years, increasing by approximately $250 billion since March.\n\nGrowth in the TGA, currency, and other non-reserve liabilities has muted the growth in reserves since March; reserve balances would have been about $1.6 trillion higher had these other liabilities remained unchanged. In effect, this increase in non-reserve liabilities has broadened the funding of the expansion in Federal Reserve assets beyond reserves held by the banking system.\n\nBefore I move on, I want to highlight one other Federal Reserve liability: the overnight reverse repo, or ON RRP, which currently has no outstanding balance. Unlike other non-reserve liabilities, the overnight reverse repo is used directly as a tool in the Federal Reserve’s operating framework to ensure effective interest rate control. A broad range of money market participants can invest funds in the ON RRP at a fixed rate, placing a floor under overnight interest rates.\n\nHow Has the Historic Increase in Reserves Affected Money Markets?\n\nTo highlight how reserve supply influences money market rates, Figure 3 shows a stylized depiction of the relationship between the overnight interest rate and banks’ demand for reserves.\n\nPrior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the Federal Reserve operated a regime in which just enough reserves were supplied to meet banks’ reserve requirements and payment needs. In this environment, depicted to the left, the marginal bank borrowed at rates above the interest rate earned on reserves—which at the time was zero—to ensure sufficient balances were maintained to cover payment needs.\n\nIn an ample reserves framework, reserves are instead supplied in an amount that leaves most banks with reserve balances above what they need for payments purposes. As a result, many are comfortable investing excess balances when the return on other high-quality liquid assets is above the interest paid on excess reserves (IOER), and also taking deposits at rates near IOER.11 In effect, IOER sets a benchmark for short-term lending and borrowing. This environment is represented by the part of the reserve demand curve that flattens out with rates near IOER, depicted to the right.12\n\nHowever, when reserves are supplied well beyond what banks require for payments purposes, many may perceive increasing balance sheet costs associated with taking on additional reserves. In this environment, the marginal bank borrows at overnight rates below IOER, as it requires additional compensation to grow its balance sheet further.13 We might consider reserves at this point to be in abundant supply. Even when reserves are abundant, IOER retains its strong influence on rates, although federal funds and many other overnight money market instruments trade at a spread below IOER.\n\nSo where are we currently on this graphic?\n\nAs I’ve described, the supply of reserves has been shifting significantly to the right along this curve. Given this, we may have expected money market rates to be lower than they currently are, reflecting more of an abundance of reserves. However, as shown in Figure 4, the effective federal funds rate has remained relatively close to IOER in recent months—much closer than it was when reserves were at similar levels in 2014.\n\nI’d highlight two main factors that are contributing to this difference.\n\nFirst, banks’ reserve management practices appear to have shifted since March. Figure 5 shows federal funds rates relative to IOER for different levels of aggregate reserves, over the last 10 years, with observations this year shown by the light and dark red dots. Since March, rates have been higher relative to IOER than was the case during the earlier period of abundant reserves, shown by the light blue dots representing observations in 2014 and 2015.\n\nSome of the light red dots represent observations during the highly uncertain days of March, when some banks paid elevated rates to maintain precautionary reserve balances in the face of extraordinary customer demand for liquidity. To better understand this dynamic, the Federal Reserve Board included new questions in the most recent Senior Financial Officer Survey (SFOS), which is a survey of commercial banks that collectively hold around three-fourths of the reserves in the system. Banks that increased their reserve balances from February to April confirmed that a strong desire to hold precautionary liquidity against potential customer credit line draws or deposit outflows drove the increase.14 The results of this survey were released to the public yesterday and are available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website.\n\nInterestingly, even as this elevated market uncertainty has receded and reserve levels have continued to increase, rates have remained near IOER, as indicated by the dark red dots. It could be that a greater comfort among domestic banks to hold higher reserve balances, at least for now, is contributing to rates continuing to trade near IOER. In the SFOS, the banks with higher reserve holdings since April indicated that their increase was motivated by a desire to maintain a buffer against deposit outflows, as well as the absence of attractive risk-adjusted investment alternatives.15 As shown in Figure 6, the growth in reserve balances has been particularly notable for the U.S. global systemically important banks (GSIBs) and large domestic banks that typically accumulate deposits.16 These banks collectively hold a much higher share of reserves than during the post-GFC period, when foreign banking organizations (FBOs) absorbed a greater share of the reserve increase.17\n\nA second, and likely important factor, contributing to the higher level of rates relative to IOER is the significant increase in Treasury’s net bill issuance this year to fund fiscal stimulus, shown in Figure 7. Although Treasury bills are external to our stylized reserve demand curve, they are highly liquid and safe investment instruments, and an increase in the supply of Treasury bills tends to raise rates on a range of money market instruments that lenders consider to be substitute investments. Indeed, analysis by New York Fed colleagues finds that, controlling for changes in reserves, an increase of $1 trillion in the supply of short-term Treasury securities raises the spread of the effective federal funds rate relative to IOER by about three basis points.18 This helps explain some of the firmness in money market rates in recent months.\n\nIt is also possible that the configuration of the Federal Reserve’s administered rates within the target range has influenced the relative firmness in rates at times. The current spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates is narrower than during the earlier period of abundant reserves. Because of this, it would not have been possible for the effective federal funds rate to trade as far below IOER as it did during the 2014 to 2016 period, although this does not likely explain why rates are as close to IOER as they currently are.\n\nWhere Do Money Market Rates Go From Here?\n\nReserves over the near term seem likely to continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace than during the spring of this year. The degree and rate of growth will depend, in large part, on the path of asset purchases that the FOMC chooses. For example, in the Desk’s November Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market Participants, the median respondent expected net Treasury and agency MBS purchases to continue at the current pace through the end of next year before slowing in subsequent years. In addition, as I noted above, most market participants expect the Treasury Department to draw down the TGA balance over the medium term. Together, changes in Federal Reserve assets and liabilities such as these could add significant reserves to the banking system.\n\nEven as aggregate reserve levels are expected to grow, many banks have suggested they will increasingly take actions to limit the growth in their own reserves. We have already heard from some banks that compression in net interest margins and changes in their regulatory ratios associated with higher reserve levels are making additional reserve growth less attractive for them.19 Indeed, even as market participants broadly expect reserve levels to increase in coming months, the majority of SFOS respondents expected their own reserve levels to be stable or decline, as shown in Figure 8. Many of these respondents reported that they intend to let wholesale funding and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances run off, and to lower the rates they offer on certain deposits. It is important to note that these types of business changes take time to implement. So, even if reserves were to stay near current levels, these actions could put downward pressure on market rates.\n\nOf course, as I described above, reserves remain in the banking system unless they are absorbed by growth in another Federal Reserve liability, or Federal Reserve assets decrease. The system is closed. Actions taken by individual banks to limit reserve growth can redistribute reserves to banks that have more capacity to absorb them, and money market rates adjust until banks in aggregate eventually demand the total amount of reserves being supplied.\n\nDuring the 2010 to 2014 period, as rates declined, FBOs absorbed a significant amount of reserves, in part by taking on additional deposits from money market mutual funds. FBOs are natural borrowers in wholesale deposit markets and faced lower balance sheet costs associated with reserve growth than domestic depository institutions.20 It remains to be seen, however, if these banks will be as comfortable taking additional reserves in the current environment, or if other banks will step in to absorb reserve growth should rates fall.\n\nGoing forward, it seems likely that some of the factors that have been supporting rates this year—the increase in the TGA, highly elevated bill issuance, and domestic banks’ apparent comfort with reserve growth to date—will moderate or reverse. We will continue to monitor money markets closely to assess evolving conditions.\n\nHow Will the Fed’s Tools Work to Maintain Interest Rate Control?\n\nAs I noted above, the Federal Reserve has two important tools that can help maintain control over the federal funds rate and other short-term rates in this environment. IOER sets a benchmark against which banks evaluate short-term borrowing and lending opportunities, and this in turn passes through to other money market rates. When rates fall below IOER, the ON RRP maintains a floor on overnight rates by offering a broad range of money market investors an alternative risk-free investment option.21\n\nOn occasion, the Federal Reserve has adjusted these administered rates to influence where the effective federal funds rate falls within the target range. Since 2018, the Federal Reserve has made five such adjustments to IOER and, as shown in Figure 9, each time the effective federal funds rate moved in line with the adjustment, demonstrating IOER’s strong influence. In instances where rates have drifted lower relative to IOER, the ON RRP has maintained a strong floor.22 Since 2016, the effective federal funds rate has not traded below the target range, even on balance sheet reporting dates when there can be strong downward pressure on rates.\n\nAs shown in Figure 9, IOER is currently set at 10 basis points, well below the top of the target range. If undue downward pressure on rates were to emerge, the Federal Reserve could adjust IOER higher to lift overnight rates. Even if this downward pressure persisted, the ON RRP would maintain a strong floor by providing an alternative investment for money market participants and, if needed, by reducing the quantity of reserves held by the banking system to relieve pressure on bank balance sheets. The Desk has over 120 counterparties to the ON RRP, representing a large majority of investors in the triparty repo market, giving this tool broad coverage to accomplish these objectives.23\n\nOf course, we will respond to the environment as it evolves. The Federal Reserve stands ready to adjust the terms of the ON RRP and parameters of other tools as needed to ensure their efficacy.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nIn conclusion, I have been pleased that the FOMC’s implementation framework was able to support actions taken to address the pandemic, by smoothly accommodating a shift to much higher reserve levels. Given this significant increase in reserves, we might have expected money market rates to trade lower in the FOMC’s target range relative to IOER than they have, similar to the earlier experience with abundant reserves.\n\nHowever, the factors that supported rates this year—the increase in the TGA, highly elevated bill issuance, and domestic banks’ apparent comfort with reserve growth to date—may moderate in 2021. As a result, rates could fall, reflecting an abundance of reserves. If this softness in rates emerges, it could help the financial system accommodate the growth in reserves by encouraging some banks to take on additional balances. Even if more persistent downward pressure on rates emerges, we are confident that the Federal Reserve has tools to ensure effective control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates across the broad range of potential outcomes.\n\nFigures PDF\n\n\n1 I would like to thank Yan Chow, Jason Miu, Matt Raskin, Tim Wessel, and Patricia Zobel for their assistance in preparing these remarks; Steph Clampitt and David Tam for their assistance with data; and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for valuable comments and suggestions.\n\n2 Logan, Lorie K.

The Board of Governors has prescribed rules governing the payment of interest by Federal Reserve Banks in Regulation D. Since 2008, these two rates have been set at the same value. Prior to 2008, there was no interest paid on reserves.\n\n12 For a perspective on the shape of the reserve demand curve in an ample reserve environment see Afonso, Gara, Kyungmin Kim, Antoine Martin, Ed Nosal, Simon Potter, and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl (2020). Monetary Policy Implementation with an Ample Supply of Reserves, Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-020. Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n13 Even in an ample reserves environment, some banks, typically smaller institutions, pay rates above IOER to meet liquidity shortfalls. This is reflected by the 99th percentile of rates on federal funds transactions generally being above IOER. Some banks may also be willing to pay rates slightly above IOER if borrowing from an institution that has a more attractive runoff rate under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirements.\n\n14 The SFOS is a collection of qualitative and limited quantitative information about liability management, the provision of financial services, and the functioning of key financial markets from a selection of commercial banks, including U.S. and foreign banking institutions. The 80 respondents of the September 2020 SFOS span a diverse set of foreign and domestic banks in terms of business models and size.\n\n15 Though SFOS respondents did not rate it as a top driver, another possible contributor is the temporary regulatory relief measures, such as the temporary exemption of reserves and Treasury holdings from the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) calculation.\n\n16 See Gara Afonso, Marco Cipriani, Gabriele La Spada, and Will Riordan, A New Reserves Regime? COVID-19 and the Federal Reserve Balance Sheet, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Liberty Street Economics, July 7, 2020. During this period, the concentration of reserves also increased (see Gara Afonso, Marco Cipriani, Steph Clampitt, Haitham Jendoubi, Gabriele La Spada, and Will Riordan, How Bank Reserves Are Distributed Matters. How You Measure Their Distribution Matters Too., Federal Reserve Bank of New York Liberty Street Economics, November 24, 2020).\n\n17 Foreign banking organizations increased their reserve balances sharply for a brief period in March and April, as shown in Figure 6, as some borrowed more from their parent organizations, which accessed dollar liquidity through the network of standing central bank swap lines. See Nicola Cetorelli, Linda S. Goldberg, and Fabiola Ravazzolo, How Fed Swap Lines Supported the U.S. Corporate Credit Market amid COVID-19 Strains, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Liberty Street Economics, June 12, 2020.\n\n18 See Antoine Martin, James J. McAndrews, Ali Palida, and David Skeie, Explaining the Puzzling Behavior of Short-Term Money Market Rates, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Liberty Street Economics, August 24, 2020. The updated Staff Report analysis indicated that $1 trillion of additional reserves tends to reduce the effective federal funds rate by 8 basis points relative to the IOR rate, while an additional $1 trillion of Treasury securities with under one year to maturity tends to increase the effective federal funds rate by about 3 basis points.\n\n19 Net interest margins for U.S. banks reached a 36-year low in the second quarter of 2020 according to data collected by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.\n\n20 The relative funding costs and incentives for holding reserves were impacted by the widening of the FDIC’s assessment base and changes to the Basel III leverage ratio. FBOs were not subject to the FDIC’s fee nor did most have daily-averaged leverage ratios. For further discussion, see Ayelen Banegas and Manjola Tase (2016).

These operations could address any unexpected firmness in rates associated with shocks to the financial system or reserves.\n\n22 From late-2013 to 2015, the Desk conducted the ON RRP as a test operation to facilitate policy rate control. For further discussion of these test operations and the design of the ON RRP, see Josh Frost, Lorie Logan, Antoine Martin, Patrick McCabe, Fabio Natalucci and Julie Remache (2015). Overnight RRP Operations as a Monetary Policy Tool: Some Design Considerations, FEDS Notes, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 19, 2015. Since the overall limit on the ON RRP size was lifted in December 2015, the effective federal funds rate has only fallen below the ON RRP rate once. On December 31, 2015 the effective rate was 20 basis points while the ON RRP rate and the bottom of the target range were 25 basis points.\n\n23 Federal Home Loan Banks are major lenders in the federal funds market and can also leave balances in their accounts at the Federal Reserve which earn zero percent. \n\nBy continuing to use our site, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Statement.

    "text": "Thank you for that kind introduction, Ellen [Meade]. It’s great to be here at Duke and to have a chance to talk about monetary policy with one of my favorite former Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nToday, I’d like to discuss the progress we’ve made toward the Fed’s macroeconomic goals, as well as the risks ahead. The views I share are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAs you know, inflation surged in 2021 and 2022 on the heels of the economic disruptions from the pandemic. The annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) peaked at more than 7 percent, far above our 2 percent target. The FOMC responded by rapidly raising the target range for the federal funds rate—a total of 5.25 percentage points over a year and a half. These actions aimed to bring the economy into better balance so we can sustainably achieve both of our Congressionally mandated goals: stable prices and maximum employment.\n\nWe have made substantial progress toward that objective. For the second half of 2023, PCE inflation was just 2.1 percent, annualized. Moreover, while the labor market cooled from its overheated pace in early 2023, it remained strong, with the unemployment rate holding below 4 percent. The combination of cooler inflation and still-strong economic activity in the second half of 2023 inspired optimism that the economy was on a benign track toward restoring price stability without too much cost to workers, businesses, families and communities.\n\nIn the first two months of 2024, however, inflation data surprised to the upside. In the rest of my remarks, I’ll assess the economic outlook and risks in light of these recent developments. My bottom line is that while the benign path back to price stability remains possible, I see meaningful risks to continued progress.\n\nSome good news\nIt’s remarkable how resilient the economy has been to the increases in interest rates over the past two years. While the FOMC’s rate increases were necessary to restore price stability, the rapid pace carried a risk of a nonlinear reaction in financial markets or the economy. This was one reason I supported slowing the pace in late 2022 even as I remained committed to raising rates as high as necessary to accomplish the FOMC’s dual-mandate goals.\n\nAt times last year, we saw data that some interpreted as cracks in the economy and labor market, and we heard concerns from financial market and business contacts that a recession could be imminent. But today, contacts consistently tell me they see a soft landing as the most likely scenario. In the Dallas Fed’s most recent Texas Business Outlook Surveys, half of respondents said they expect demand to pick up over the next six months. The risk of an abrupt deterioration in economic activity appears to be fading.\n\nMoreover, immigration and innovation have continued to support the supply side of the economy.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently reported a major upward revision in estimates of net immigration. Relative to estimates made last year, the CBO now calculates that an additional 4 million people immigrated to the United States from 2021 through 2023. And the CBO now projects 4.4 million more immigrants from 2024 through 2026, again relative to estimates made in 2023. Dallas Fed economists judge that the CBO estimates are more of an upper bound than a mid-range estimate. The calculations assume relatively high numbers of undetected border crossings and relatively low rates of unmeasured return migration. Nevertheless, the inflows are clearly very large. We’ve seen them firsthand in the Dallas Fed’s district.\n\nBecause many immigrants come to the United States seeking to participate in our vibrant economy, they add significantly to the labor force. This helps explain the combination of robust payroll growth with stable unemployment and a less-tight labor market over the past year. The implications for the economic outlook, of course, depend on how long this wave of immigration continues and on whether immigration affects aggregate demand as much as aggregate supply.\n\nTurning to innovation, we could also be at the beginning of an era of stronger productivity growth.\n\nWhile I don’t want to be overly optimistic, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has enormous potential. We took a deep dive into how companies are using generative AI at recent meetings of the Dallas Fed’s head office and branch boards of directors. Our directors oversee the management of the bank, connect us to communities throughout the district and provide critical insights to inform our monetary policy deliberations. A number of the business and community leaders on our boards reported that they are already seeing stunning gains in productivity from generative AI, as some research has also found. One firm found that a single accountant can now conduct expense audits that used to take 10 workers. At another firm, AI has raised software engineers’ productivity by 20 percent. However, it remains uncertain how many companies have the scale needed to profit from these tools, how AI can be applied safely in life-critical fields like medicine and aviation, and what the effects will be for industrial concentration, income inequality and the structure of the labor market.\nGiven the uncertainties, I’m not ready to put higher trend productivity in my baseline outlook. However, the risks to productivity appear clearly skewed to the upside. Stronger productivity growth would open space for economic activity and wages to rise without generating above-target inflation.\n\nInflation concerns\nOn the other hand, I’m increasingly concerned about upside risk to the inflation outlook. To be clear, the key risk is not that inflation might rise—though monetary policymakers must always remain on guard against that outcome—but rather that inflation will stall out and fail to follow the forecast path all the way back to 2 percent in a timely way.\n\nAssessing the inflation outlook can be challenging because large swings in the prices of a few narrow categories of goods or services can temporarily throw off the headline readings. For this reason, to judge where overall inflation is headed, I find it helpful to look at measures that remove outliers, like the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate.\n\nGiven the strength in the trimmed mean late last year, I had expected inflation to firm over the first half of 2024. Even so, January’s inflation print was disappointing. January wasn’t a story of outliers. The entire distribution of price changes shifted to the right. Residual seasonality could help explain the firm January data, but if so, the improvement in inflation in the second half of 2023 was overstated.\n\nAnd the data for February, though better than January’s, weren’t great. The six-month and 12-month core and trimmed mean PCE inflation rates all landed around 3 percent, and the three-month rates were somewhat higher.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of disappointingly firm inflation data, I wasn’t surprised when a business executive in my district shared that the company’s unions are demanding contracts that incorporate compensation for future inflation. Reports like this reinforce the importance of bringing inflation sustainably back to the FOMC’s 2 percent target. We need to fulfill our commitment to the public. And we need to keep inflation expectations anchored.\n\nThe neutral interest rate\nBeyond the inflation data, I’m concerned that the stance of monetary policy may not be as restrictive as most forecasts assume. I’ve previously talked about how I assess whether broad financial conditions are sufficiently restrictive. Today, I want to share an additional dimension of my thinking. Economists often assess whether monetary policy is boosting or slowing growth and inflation by comparing the policy rate to a theoretical level, called the neutral rate, that would represent neither a headwind nor a tailwind. Failing to recognize a sustained move up in the neutral rate could lead to overaccommodative monetary policy.\n\nNow, the neutral rate—r-star for short—is notoriously uncertain and difficult to measure. But you can get a sense of where FOMC participants think it is by looking at the long-run projections for the fed funds rate in our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). From mid-2019 through the end of last year, the median of those long-run projections was almost always 2.5 percent—implying a neutral real rate of 0.5 percent after accounting for the 2 percent inflation target. At our most recent meeting, that median ticked up to a 0.6 percent real rate.\n\nThe right tail of the distribution has spread out considerably, though. Seven FOMC participants now project a long-run fed funds rate of at least 3 percent—corresponding to a neutral real rate of at least 1 percent—compared with just three participants making such projections a year ago.\n\nAnd, economic and financial evidence is accumulating that the long-run neutral rate has likely moved up. I divide the evidence into three buckets: fundamentals, model estimates and financial market prices.\n\nEconomic theory suggests that fundamental drivers of investment and growth influence the neutral interest rate over time. Growing federal deficits have greatly expanded the supply of safe assets. Meanwhile, between the energy transition, nearshoring and the growth of AI, there are many sources of increasingly strong investment demand. And, as I mentioned earlier, we could be seeing the beginnings of higher productivity growth. All of these factors should raise the neutral rate, all else equal.\n\nEconomists have also developed many models to estimate the neutral real interest rate. My team and I reviewed a suite of these models. None of them gives a point estimate as low as the 0.6 percent median in the latest SEP. Some models estimate a neutral real rate above 2 percent, corresponding to a neutral federal funds rate above 4 percent given the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation target. All of the model estimates are imprecise and have wide confidence intervals, however. And some of the models technically measure a short-run concept of the neutral rate, though in these cases the measures are highly persistent and are also informative about the long run.\n\nFinally, financial market prices reveal market participants’ views on the neutral rate. The 5-year, 5-year-forward real rate on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities is around 2 percent. That interest rate incorporates a term premium that isn’t included in the neutral level of short-term rates. But the gap to the SEP median is larger than most model-based estimates of far-forward term premiums.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Primary Dealers also suggests market participants expect higher real overnight rates in the long run. The difference between respondents’ median estimates for the long-run fed funds rate and the long-run inflation rate has risen from 0.5 percent to around 0.9 percent over the past year.\n\nMarkets aggregate the information of investors across the economy. While we may not be sure exactly how much each of the fundamental factors has moved, how those moves translate into r-star, or which model is right, we can learn from what markets are saying about the combined effect. And, as I formulate my views on appropriate policy, I’m taking evidence of sustained shifts in the neutral rate into account, alongside all the other evidence on the economic and financial outlook. Although the neutral rate is uncertain, using the information we do have on it can help ensure monetary policy is set so that broad financial conditions will be sufficiently restrictive to achieve our dual-mandate goals.\n\nConclusion\nTo return to the big picture, the inflation concerns I just described are upside risks, not my baseline outlook.\n\nNevertheless, in light of these risks, I believe it’s much too soon to think about cutting interest rates. I will need to see more of the uncertainty resolved about which economic path we’re on. And, as always, the FOMC should remain prepared to respond appropriately if inflation stops falling. A flexible approach to monetary policy will provide time to continue assessing the data and outlook and make the best choices to sustainably achieve both stable prices and maximum employment.\n\nFinally, a few words about the Fed’s asset holdings. After acquiring close to $5 trillion in assets in 2020 through 2022 to support the economy and the smooth functioning of financial markets amid the pandemic, the FOMC has been allowing some assets to mature to normalize our balance sheet. We have reduced our balance sheet by about $1.5 trillion so far.\n\nReducing our asset holdings also removes liquidity from the financial system. So far, more than the entire reduction in our balance sheet has come out of the overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) agreement facility, where counterparties such as money market funds can place excess cash at the Fed. As a result, bank reserves have actually increased since 2022. But ON RRP balances are now down to somewhat above $400 billion. Once those balances are depleted, asset runoff will reduce bank reserves one for one, all else equal. Moreover, the current pace of asset runoff is about twice what it was in early 2019, the last time we normalized our balance sheet. Overly rapid reductions in bank reserves could outpace money markets’ ability to redistribute reserves to the banks that need them most. That would risk pressures that could force us to stop balance sheet normalization prematurely.\n\nWe typically announce changes in our asset redemptions in advance to avoid disrupting the market. Yet it’s difficult to predict exactly when ON RRP balances will be depleted, because the rate of decrease has been volatile. It depends on many factors besides the Fed’s asset holdings—in particular, tax payments and Treasury bill issuance, which are both in flux at this time of year.\n\nSo, I believe it will soon be appropriate for the FOMC to decide when to slow—not stop—the runoff of our asset holdings. A slower but still meaningful pace will provide more time for banks and money market participants to redistribute liquidity and for the FOMC to assess liquidity conditions. It will also reduce the risk of going too far. I see this as a technical decision to ensure effective policy implementation and support a smooth path to an efficient balance sheet size. It should not have much effect on broader financial conditions. And it is unrelated to considerations of the appropriate degree of policy restriction to achieve our dual-mandate goals.\n\nThank you. I look forward to our conversation."

    "text": "Remarks at the Annual Primary Dealer Meeting (delivered via videoconference)As prepared for delivery\nWelcome to the 2021 Annual Primary Dealer Meeting.\n\nPrimary dealers play an important role as counterparties in open market operations, providing a key link in the implementation of monetary policy—a core responsibility of the New York Fed as the Reserve Bank selected to operate in financial markets on behalf of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). In addition, primary dealers serve as important participants in U.S. Treasury auctions. I'm glad that we're back together—even if only virtually—to participate in this annual forum. These meetings provide an opportunity to strengthen our relationship and communicate our expectations.\n\nIt was just over a year ago that the global economy and financial markets were upended by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Federal Reserve undertook extraordinary actions to respond to the crisis. Today, I'd like to reflect on the operational approach of the New York Fed's Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) during the past year, and some of the lessons I take away from this experience. Moreover, I'd like to highlight how our operations have transitioned since the onset of the pandemic, and some of the ways they will continue to evolve to ensure that we implement the FOMC's directives for open market operations in an effective and efficient manner.\n\nBefore proceeding, let me note that the views presented here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.1\n\nThe Pandemic Response: Flexible and Adaptive\n\nIn my remarks to this group at the end of 2019, I focused on the FOMC's approach to implementing an ample reserves regime.2 We had set a course to gradually reduce repurchase operations and eventually maintain an ample level of reserves with regular Treasury purchase operations.\n\nEvents overtook those plans. Our focus shifted abruptly when the onset of the pandemic triggered extraordinary economic stresses and dislocations in the global financial system.3 The Federal Reserve responded with swift and integrated action to support smooth market functioning and ensure the flow of credit to U.S. households, businesses, and state and local governments. In addition to conducting large repo operations and purchasing substantial amounts of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), the Federal Reserve expanded FX swap lines and Discount Window lending, and extended liquidity to critical parts of financial markets and the economy through special lending and credit facilities. Also, regulations were temporarily adjusted to encourage bank lending.\n\nOn the Desk, responding to the crisis required an exceptionally high degree of adaptability and flexibility. For open market operations—both repo operations and outright purchases—the Desk was broadly directed by the FOMC to support smooth market functioning.4 For Treasuries, agency MBS and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), the FOMC directed us to purchase securities in the amounts needed for this purpose. To comply with these directives, we responded to fast-moving market developments and adjusted operations as conditions evolved. In reflecting on the crisis, I believe that both the FOMC's full commitment to market functioning and the speed, scale and flexibility of our operations were essential components to a successful response.\n\nOver time, market functioning has improved markedly, and we have gradually returned to more normal operations: asset purchases now proceed at a steady pace, regularly-scheduled term repo operations and agency CMBS operations are no longer being conducted, and the lending authority for all but one of the 13(3) facilities has expired. Of course, even as some of the extraordinary measures have been wound down, the FOMC remains committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy.\n\nOn the Desk, we continue to adapt our operations to ensure the effective implementation of the FOMC's directive. Today, I would like to share some thoughts on how we have returned to more normal operations and how they will continue to evolve.\n\nAsset Purchases: Ongoing Adjustments to Ensure Efficient and Effective Implementation\n\nThe FOMC's objective for asset purchases has evolved since the beginning of the pandemic; whereas purchases were initiated to support smooth functioning in the markets for Treasuries and agency MBS, over time the Committee has expanded the objective of purchases to include helping to foster accommodative financial conditions. Since its meeting in December of last year, the FOMC has directed the Desk to increase the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month and has stated that it will continue to increase these holdings until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nAs the Desk considers how to approach operations, we first and foremost seek to carry out the FOMC directive in an efficient and effective manner. In doing so, there are important operational choices to be made. The Desk's approach to these choices is guided by key principles, a few of which I would like to highlight today. First, we aim to be transparent, providing information to market participants and the public to ensure fairness and promote understanding of our purchase operations. We also seek to obtain securities at competitive and appropriate prices for the Federal Reserve, as this will ultimately benefit the U.S. taxpayer. In addition, unless otherwise appropriate for efficient and effective implementation under the directive, we endeavor to operate in a manner that is relatively neutral to the securities available for purchase and in a way that limits the potential for our operations to affect normal market functioning. In practice, we follow this principle by purchasing Treasury securities across sectors in approximate proportion to the universe of Treasury securities outstanding and by concentrating our purchases of agency MBS in recently produced securities. I would like to discuss a few changes that we have made or are planning in the Desk's Treasury, agency MBS, and agency CMBS operations that help us adhere to these guiding principles.\n\nTreasury Purchase Operations\n\nLast March, when conditions were highly disrupted in the U.S. Treasury market, we purchased a wide range of securities to address broad market dysfunction—and, at times, we weighted purchases more heavily toward sectors in which conditions were especially strained. Adjustments made to the size and composition of purchases were announced in the Desk's purchase calendars, often released multiple times a week.\n\nAs market conditions stabilized, we adjusted purchase allocations to be roughly proportional to the amounts outstanding across the nominal Treasury coupon and TIPS coupon curves, and we lengthened the purchase calendars to provide more predictability in our planned operations.\n\nAs our Treasury purchases transitioned to a more proportional allocation, there were still sectors of the curve that we refrained from purchasing. For example, the Desk generally has avoided purchasing bills, both to avoid increasing scarcity value in these securities arising from strong investor demand and because bill purchases have relatively little impact on financial conditions.5\n\nEven in this steadier operating regime, we continue to adjust our purchase approach consistent with our principles. For example, we conduct periodic reviews of our allocations across purchase sectors and make modest changes in response to the evolving market environment. During the past year, issuance of Treasury securities has increased markedly as the U.S. Treasury has sought to fund pandemic-related fiscal stimulus expenditures. Even with this new issuance, the distribution of Treasury coupons outstanding has been fairly stable given the large outstanding stock of Treasury debt. However, modest shifts have occurred. In particular, the introduction of the 20-year Treasury bond has increased amounts outstanding around the 20-year maturity point. In addition, the pace of increase in TIPS issuance has been slower relative to nominal coupon securities. With net issuance expected to remain high in the near term, we anticipate that the composition of outstanding supply will continue to evolve. As a result, we plan to make minor technical adjustments to our purchase sectors and increase the frequency at which we update purchase allocations to remain roughly proportional to the outstanding supply of nominal coupon securities and TIPS. We expect to announce these as a part of a normal purchase calendar release in coming months.\n\nAgency MBS\n\nOur agency MBS operations starting last March were also initially driven by the need to support smooth market functioning. Purchases focused at first on a broad range of coupon securities in the outstanding universe of agency MBS that came under intense selling pressure. Our operations also included purchases for near-term settlement to help ease pressures on dealer balance sheets, which is different than the Desk's usual practice of purchasing in the forward-settling market.\n\nAs conditions normalized, agency MBS purchases returned to a more neutral allocation roughly in line with recently produced agency MBS coupons in the to-be-announced (TBA) market. These agency MBS coupons represent the most liquid and readily available supply and their purchase is least likely to cause settlement frictions in the agency MBS market. Their yields are also most closely tied to primary mortgage rates. The recent rise in longer-term Treasury yields and primary mortgage rates has shifted origination into agency MBS with relatively higher coupons, and our purchases have followed suit.\n\nThe recent increase in interest rates will also have implications for the timing of purchases and the amounts of securities purchased relative to supply. We reinvest our monthly agency MBS proceeds after paydowns are received, and in the near term these purchases may continue at a robust pace. In contrast, agency MBS origination volumes are expected to decline because of the recent increase in mortgage rates. This temporary difference between the amount of our reinvestments and origination volumes will diminish as the prepayments in our portfolio also slow down because of higher mortgage interest rates. However, in the meantime, we will be closely monitoring for possible signs that market participants are experiencing difficulty delivering enough agency MBS pools into forward TBA contracts and will adjust the forward settlement date of our purchases accordingly.\n\nIf needed, the Desk can also conduct dollar roll transactions to facilitate the orderly settlement of securities purchases. These operations help limit the potential for the Desk's purchases to disrupt normal market functioning by rolling forward the settlement month of securities that may be showing signs of short-term scarcity.6 We recently enhanced the transparency of dollar roll operations by releasing the results on the New York Fed's website on the same day that the operations occur, rather than weekly. This change provides more timely information to all market participants.\n\nFinally, it is fitting to conclude the discussion of our asset purchases by noting the end of regularly scheduled agency CMBS operations. During the pandemic, the FOMC directed the Desk to purchase agency CMBS for the first time to help address the dislocations in that market. Given the ongoing stabilization in this market, we recently ceased regularly scheduled operations in agency CMBS.\n\nEven as the crisis has receded and our operations have normalized, we remain ready to adjust our operations as needed to sustain smooth market functioning, as directed by the FOMC. This could include changing the size or composition of our Treasury and agency MBS purchases or even recommencing purchases of agency CMBS, if needed. As I noted earlier, fulfilling the directive from the FOMC is our first priority.\n\nMoney Markets: The New Normal\n\nI'd like to turn now to money markets. Many of the extraordinary measures taken to address dysfunction in dollar funding markets associated with the pandemic have also gradually wound down. The Desk's remaining term repo operations were phased out in February, the frequency of some central bank swap line operations was reduced last summer, and the lending authority of the 13(3) funding facilities related to money markets has expired.\n\nNonetheless, the FOMC's ongoing asset purchases continue to lift bank reserves to new highs, and an environment of elevated reserves is likely to be the new normal for an extended period.7 Fortunately, the Federal Reserve's ample reserves framework is well-suited for managing short-term interest rates in environments associated with a wide range of reserve levels. In fact, the rapid increase in assets and the resulting expansion of reserves that have occurred during the pandemic are the types of actions the FOMC contemplated when choosing an ample reserves regime. While this shift to operating at much higher reserve levels has been smooth, the Federal Reserve is always prepared to make adjustments to ensure effective policy implementation.  \n\nMost recently, the growth in reserves has contributed to a decline in overnight rates relative to interest on excess reserves (IOER). The effective federal funds rate and other overnight unsecured rates have softened modestly, while we have observed more pronounced downward pressure on overnight repo rates. The large size of secured market investors, such as government money market funds (MMFs) and government sponsored enterprises, combined with recent reductions in the investments available for these investors, such as Treasury bills, have put particular downward pressure on repo and bill rates.\n\nIn this environment, the overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility is likely to become an increasingly important element of our operating framework. The ON RRP facility helps place a floor on overnight rates by offering a broad range of money market investors an alternative risk-free investment option. The availability of this facility is especially important because nonbanks represent a substantial proportion of the U.S. financial system and money markets, but do not have access to interest-bearing reserves at the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the facility can alleviate downward pressure on money market rates associated with reserve growth by broadening the liabilities that support balance sheet expansion. The ON RRP has historically been an effective floor for the federal funds rate and has also supported other short-term interest rates, and we expect it will continue to do so in the future.\n\nAs a measure of prudent planning, the Desk recently conducted a review of key design features of the ON RRP to ensure that the facility supports effective policy implementation. Notably, assets under management at government MMFs—a major group of money market investors—have increased significantly and become more concentrated at the largest funds since the facility's $30 billion per-counterparty limit was set in 2014. In light of these changes, the FOMC recently increased the per-counterparty limit on ON RRP usage to $80 billion which restores the capacity of the facility relative to the assets under management at our MMF counterparties to roughly the level that existed when the $30 billion limit was established.\n\nStaff also reviewed access to the facility and concluded that the existing counterparty types are still representative of the universe of repo market investors. However, the review also presented an opportunity to consider potential adjustments in line with the New York Fed's broader efforts to ensure that our counterparty policies promote a fair and competitive marketplace—a topic that we'll be exploring further in today's panel discussion. Expanding counterparty eligibility can reduce barriers to entry and foster inclusivity by potentially making our operations accessible to smaller firms. A more vibrant and diverse marketplace could, in turn, strengthen the effectiveness of monetary policy implementation tools. In this regard, we expect in coming months to reduce the size and activity thresholds for ON RRP counterparty eligibility, which will help achieve these goals.\n\nThis is part of the Federal Reserve's ongoing commitment to support diversity, inclusion, and opportunity, following the expanded counterparty access for certain 13(3) facilities and agency CMBS operations. Relaxing eligibility criteria helps bring a diverse set of firms by size, business model, and ownership into our counterparty base, and we look forward to leveraging these new business relationships to also broaden our market intelligence efforts.\n\nAs a final note on money markets, in addition to ensuring that the ON RRP's terms continue to support effective policy implementation, the Federal Reserve may consider adjusting administered rates if undue downward pressure on overnight rates emerges, as noted in the minutes of the March FOMC meeting released yesterday. The Federal Reserve has adjusted administered rates within the target range on numerous occasions in recent years as conditions in overnight markets have changed. Such adjustments are purely technical steps to support effective policy implementation and to maintain the federal funds rate well within the target range.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, we have gradually returned to more normal operations amid greatly improved financial market conditions. The Desk has continued to adapt its operations to ensure that it meets the FOMC's directive. In addition, we have sought to adjust the way open market operations are carried out to be consistent with our principles of transparency, transacting in a way that will ultimately benefit the U.S. taxpayer, and limiting the potential to disrupt normal market functioning as a result of our operations.\n\nAs will be discussed in a panel later today, the New York Fed also remains engaged with efforts to advance the important goal of enhancing market resiliency through both our sponsorship of the Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG) and our support of the LIBOR transition as co-convener of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) and producer of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). Our partnership with each of your institutions remains an important part of the effective and efficient implementation of policy and of ensuring financial market stability and resiliency.\n\n\n\n1 I would like to thank Linsey Molloy, Matt Raskin, Nate Wuerffel, and Patricia Zobel for their assistance in preparing these remarks and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for valuable comments and suggestions.\n\n2 This “ample reserves regime” is a version of a “floor” system in which reserves are supplied in sufficient quantity to ensure that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates.\n\n3 For additional details about the Federal Reserve's response during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lessons, see Governor Lael Brainard (2021), “Some Preliminary Financial Stability Lessons from the COVID-19 Shock,” speech delivered at the 2021 Annual Washington Conference, Institute of International Bankers, held via webcast, March 1, and Lorie Logan (2020), \"Treasury Market Liquidity and Early Lessons from the Pandemic Shock,\" speech delivered at the Brookings-Chicago Booth Task Force on Financial Stability (TFFS) meeting, held via videoconference, October 23.\n\n4 For additional details about the Federal Reserve's response during the COVID-19 pandemic to support and sustain market functioning, see Lorie Logan (2020), “The Federal Reserve’s Market Functioning Purchases: From Supporting to Sustaining,” speech delivered at the SIFMA Webinar, held via videoconference, July 15.\n\n5 Floating rate notes (FRNs) have also not been purchased in operations since March 2020 due to the limited impact these purchases would have on financial conditions.\n\n6 The Desk may roll the settlement month forward by selling the dollar roll. A dollar roll sale is a transaction that involves the sale of agency MBS for delivery in one month and the simultaneous agreement to purchase substantially similar securities in a later month, thus effectively postponing delivery when there is a dislocation in available supply. The Fed can also use a coupon swap to settle some agency MBS purchases; a coupon swap is the simultaneous sale of one agency MBS and purchase of another agency MBS, which has a different coupon, issuer, or both.\n\n7 Over the last month, reserve growth accelerated and reached a new peak of nearly $4.0 trillion, reflecting asset purchases conducted over the last year and the recent decline in the Treasury General Account (TGA)."

    "text": "Thank you for that kind introduction, Dean Quddus. It’s a pleasure to be with you all this morning, and it’s so good to be here at Prairie View A&M. I appreciate the many ways the Dallas Fed has been able to partner with Prairie View, including the Summer Banking Academy Program, the many students who have interned at our bank, and the graduates who are now part of our staff. Thank you so much for this invitation to join you all at The Hill.\n\nWhile today’s event was marketed as “A Conversation with Lorie Logan,” I have to say I am extremely honored to be the one having a conversation with Dr. Ruth Simmons. Dr. Simmons’ influence and achievements are almost impossible to overstate. As a scholar, teacher and administrator at universities across the country—from USC to Brown to Prairie View—she has changed the lives of countless students. You already know the many ways she has broken barriers. To put it simply, when the New York Times quotes Toni Morrison describing you as “a bit of a miracle” and “an unusual combination of real politics and integrity,” you are providing a powerful example of leadership and service.\n\nDr. Simmons’ passion for education and her extraordinary career are deeply inspiring to me and, I’m sure, to all of you.\n\nSo, Dr. Simmons, thanks for having me today. Thank you for your service as a member and, now, chair of the Houston Board of Directors at the Dallas Fed. And thanks most of all for the incredible work you have done throughout your career to create opportunities for everyone to grow, prosper and thrive.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\nWhen I think about what we do at the Federal Reserve, it’s all about advancing an economy where everyone has opportunities to thrive.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we describe our work as “Building a Strong Economy Together.” The Dallas Fed is one of the 12 Reserve Banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. We are the nation’s central bank, and we perform five functions to support a strong economy for everyone in the United States:\n\nWe supervise banks to ensure they are safe and sound.\nWe promote the stability of the financial system as a whole.\nWe operate parts of the payments system, which lets you get cash from your bank or send money electronically to pay a bill.\nWe promote consumer protection and community development.\nAnd—this will be my main focus today—we carry out monetary policy to pursue two goals established by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices.\nA theme of my remarks will be that in carrying out the Federal Reserve’s mission, we make decisions for the long term. We try to do what is best and most sustainable for the economy over time, even when those choices are not the easiest to make in the moment.\n\nThat longer-term focus will be familiar to you as college students who have made real sacrifices to invest in your education and your future. And that focus is particularly important to me today because of the economic situation we are in.\n\nThere are many good things about the current economy. Unemployment, for example, is at the lowest level in more than half a century.\n\nBut today’s economy also has flaws. Not everyone shares fully in the benefits of economic growth. And the high rate of inflation is undermining living standards.\n\nIn my view, the imbalances in the economy are not likely to be sustainable for the long term. So I would like to share with you some thoughts on what it will take to get to a more sustainable economy, and the Fed’s role in that effort. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nInflation\nInflation over the past two years has been much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, but prices have risen since January 2021 at an average annual rate of 5.5 percent.\n\nThis high rate of inflation challenges families and businesses in the short run, and it weakens our economy in the long run.\n\nPeople’s incomes fall short of the rising cost of rent and groceries, and increases in the cost of living have been particularly stressful for lower-income households. Businesses can’t plan well when they don’t know what they’ll pay for materials or be able to charge their customers.\n\nAnd the longer high inflation continues, the greater the risk that prices and wages rise just because people think inflation will remain high. Such a spiral makes the business cycle more volatile, undermining the long and stable expansions that particularly benefit the most vulnerable in society.\n\nIn sum, price stability is foundational for a healthy economy and labor market over time.\n\nNow, there has been some progress on inflation in recent months. But the question for monetary policy is not whether there has been some progress, but rather whether the progress will continue. Will inflation return all the way to our 2 percent target, and will it sustainably remain there over time?\n\nTo answer those questions, I find it helpful to break down some of the components of inflation.\n\nAs it happens, for the last three months of 2022, headline PCE inflation slowed to an annualized rate of 2.1 percent. However, a good bit of that drop in inflation was due to falling prices of oil and other commodities. Energy prices, as measured by the PCE price index for energy goods and services, fell at a 16 percent annual rate over the last three months of 2022. But while it’s a relief to see lower prices at the gas pump, energy prices can’t keep falling at this rate forever.\n\nCore inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has historically been a better guide to where overall inflation will go in the future. And core PCE inflation was nearly 3 percent annualized for the last three months of 2022, which is significantly higher than the inflation rate the public is counting on us to deliver.\n\nTo better understand the challenge in returning inflation sustainably to 2 percent, we can break down core inflation into a few more pieces: core goods, which includes items like cars and clothing; housing services, such as rent; and core services excluding housing. This last category makes up about half of personal consumption and includes everything from health care to transportation to entertainment.\n\nCore goods prices fell at a 3 percent annual rate in the last three months of 2022, partially offsetting rapid increases in services prices. Goods prices dropped in part because supply chains were recovering from the disruptions of the pandemic. Supply chains can’t recover twice, so I don’t see 3 percent deflation in core goods as sustainable. It seems more likely that core goods inflation will move up to the prepandemic trend of zero or a bit below, which means we’ll need lower services inflation to sustain 2 percent inflation overall.\n\nTurning to housing inflation, during the pandemic, the demand for housing rose, pushing up rents and house prices. More recently, the housing market has cooled as interest rates have risen. Because rents adjust infrequently as leases turn over, it takes time for a cooler housing market to translate into lower measures of housing inflation. Housing inflation was still around 9 percent annualized for the last three months of 2022. But our research at the Dallas Fed suggests that housing inflation should peak later this year.\n\nThe larger concern is with services other than housing. Core services inflation excluding housing has been running in a range of 4 to 5 percent for close to two years, with little sign of improvement. You could say this is the core of the inflation problem.\n\nIf core services inflation excluding housing remained in its current range, while other categories returned to their prepandemic pace, total inflation going forward would settle much closer to 3 percent than to our 2 percent goal. And depending on how the U.S. and world economies evolve, inflation could be even higher. For example, the Dallas Fed’s business contacts tell us that China’s rapid transition out of zero-COVID policies could drive up commodity prices this year by more than what most people currently expect.\n\nBroad-based and persistent services inflation is not the result of special circumstances like supply-chain disruptions that will eventually go away. Rather, I see it as a symptom of an overheated economy, particularly a tight labor market, which will have to be brought into better balance for the overall inflation rate to return sustainably to 2 percent.\n\nEmployment\nThe labor market is important in its own right for monetary policy, given the FOMC’s mandate to achieve both price stability and maximum employment. But in addition, because services prices depend substantially on labor costs, the outlook for sustainably returning inflation to 2 percent hinges in large part on what happens in the labor market.\n\nThe job market today is incredibly strong. Last month, the U.S. economy added 517,000 jobs. By most estimates, that’s more than five times what’s needed to keep pace with the growth of the labor force. We shouldn’t put too much weight on a single report, which can be driven by one-off factors. But on average over the past half-year, the economy has added 350,000 jobs a month, which is still very high.\n\nAnother sign of strength in the labor market is that as of December, there were 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person in the United States. That is down only slightly from the all-time high of two openings per unemployed person last March. And it is well above the ratio of 1.2 openings per unemployed person in 2019—which was thought at the time to be a very strong labor market.\n\nThe strong labor market has been driving up wages, which have been growing at an annual rate of about 4.5 to 5 percent by a variety of measures.\n\nNow, your first thought may be that rising wages are a good thing. If workers are earning 5 percent more, aren’t they better off? But rising wages make workers better off only if workers can buy more goods and services with those wages. Most workers’ wages have not risen as fast as prices. So even though workers are taking home more dollars, their budgets are stretched thinner and thinner.\n\nOver time, to be able to buy more goods and services with their wages, workers taken together must produce more goods and services. In other words, labor productivity must rise.\n\nThere is a formula for this. In the long run, if companies’ profit margins—or, more precisely, capital’s share of income—are stable, the growth rate of prices will equal the growth rate of wages minus the growth rate of labor productivity.\n\nFalling profit margins could also conceivably contribute to lower inflation in the short run.\n\nBut for 5 percent wage growth to be consistent with 2 percent inflation on a sustained basis, productivity would have to rise at a 3 percent annual rate. Yet output per hour worked grew at an annual rate of only 1 and a quarter percent from 2012 through 2019, and there is little indication it has accelerated meaningfully since then.\n\nAbsent a dramatic rise in productivity, it seems likely that sustainably returning inflation to 2 percent will require substantially lower wage growth. That may take time. Respondents to the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys expect more than 5 percent wage growth in 2023, which is down significantly from what they saw in 2022 but still quite elevated. Wage pressures have moderated somewhat in the latest national reports on average hourly earnings and employment costs. I’d need to see a lot more data, though, to be convinced the labor market is no longer overheated.\n\nTo achieve better balance, labor supply will have to increase, or labor demand will have to decrease.\n\nLabor supply has been weak coming out of the pandemic. Early retirements, deaths and lingering illness from the pandemic have reduced the supply of workers. So have structural challenges like the lack of child care for working parents. And immigration fell to nearly zero during the pandemic, though it has since bounced back sharply. Beyond that, employers tell me that when workers are available, they often lack the necessary training or skills.\n\nAddressing the structural challenges is critical for the Texas and U.S. economies in the long run. Developing a larger, higher-skilled workforce will help support productivity growth and ensure we have a strong economy for everyone.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we’re committed to partnering with communities in our region and conducting research that can inform solutions. For example, our digital inclusion initiative is helping community leaders in South Dallas, Ector County, El Paso County and southern New Mexico find ways to expand affordable broadband internet access and digital skills training to bridge the digital divide. That will allow more students to complete online school assignments, more parents to access online job postings and more people to participate fully in the economy. Through our Advance Together initiative, we are also supporting public, nonprofit and business leaders who are transforming their local education and workforce systems.\n\nBut efforts like these take time. So when it comes to the current elevated inflation, the FOMC has to respond by tightening monetary policy to reduce demand.\n\nInterest rates\nWhat do I mean by tightening monetary policy? The FOMC’s primary tool is the target range for the federal funds rate, an overnight interest rate. Since the start of 2022, we have raised this target by 4.5 percentage points, the largest one-year increase in four decades. In addition, since last June, we have been reducing our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nBoth of these tools push up interest rates for consumers and companies throughout the economy. Financial conditions have, therefore, tightened significantly. The 10-year nominal Treasury yield has risen about 2 percentage points, and mortgage rates have risen nearly 3 percentage points, since the start of 2022. Importantly, in recent months, real medium-term interest rates as measured by the yields on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities have averaged above 1.5 percent. That is a significantly restrictive level given that most estimates suggest the neutral real interest rate is below 1 percent.\n\nIn moving forward with monetary policy, we need to manage two risks.\n\nThe most important risk I see is that if we tighten too little, the economy will remain overheated and we will fail to keep inflation in check. That could trigger a self-fulfilling spiral of unanchored inflation expectations that would be very costly to stop.\n\nJust last week, the Dallas Fed’s Research Department hosted some of the world’s leading scholars on the history of inflation. These experts had studied experiences with high inflation in the United States, Europe and Latin America from the 1920s through the present. They offered a wide range of views on macroeconomics and monetary policy, and it was a stimulating debate. A key lesson I took away was that when central banks aren’t sufficiently proactive in addressing high inflation, the road back to price stability is longer, the labor market is weaker, and the scars on the economy can last long after inflation is finally reduced. We must stay focused on bringing inflation back to target in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nAt the same time, if we tighten too much or too fast, we risk seeing the labor market weaken much more than is necessary to control inflation. Those job losses would be very costly, too, particularly for lower-income households.\n\nMy own view is that, given the risks, we shouldn’t lock in on a peak interest rate or a precise path of rates. After raising rates at a historically rapid pace during 2022, the FOMC decided at our most recent meeting to increase rates by a more historically typical increment of a quarter percentage point. I anticipate we will need to continue gradually raising the fed funds rate until we see convincing evidence that inflation is on track to return to our 2 percent target in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nThe evidence I’m looking for to gain confidence in the inflation outlook includes some further and sustained improvement in the inflation statistics, as well as a clear change in the underlying factors—like the imbalance of aggregate supply and demand and resulting very tight labor market—that have been producing high inflation. And I think we need to see the economy evolving more or less as forecasts predict. When inflation repeatedly comes in higher than the forecasts, as it did last year, or when the jobs report comes in with hundreds of thousands more jobs than anyone expected, as happened a couple weeks ago, it is hard to have confidence in any outlook.\n\nI will also remain attentive to financial conditions. Ultimately, conditions need to be sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability. We must remain prepared to continue rate increases for a longer period than previously anticipated, if such a path is necessary to respond to changes in the economic outlook or to offset any undesired easing in conditions. And even after we have enough evidence that we don’t need to raise rates at some future meeting, we’ll need to remain flexible and tighten further if changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions call for it.\n\nConclusion\nThe FOMC is committed to delivering a healthier economy, with maximum employment and stable prices. And our policy strategy must be one that will sustain those outcomes over the long run. That requires paying attention not only to the latest wiggles in inflation and employment, but also to whether the economy is rebalancing in a way that can last.\n\nThank you."

    "text": "Good morning, and thank you to the Brookings Institution-Chicago Booth Task Force on Financial Stability for convening this discussion on such a critical topic. This has been a year marked by tremendous human suffering related to the pandemic and unprecedented challenges for the global economy and financial markets. The events that unfolded in March and April underscored the importance of understanding market functioning and liquidity so that financial markets continue to serve their important role in supporting the economy.1\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the global financial system experienced an extraordinary shock, triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Asset prices adjusted sharply, reflecting increasing pessimism and uncertainty about the economic outlook as large segments of the economy began to shut down. A spike in financial market volatility, combined with concerns about markets’ ability to function in a remote work environment, resulted in a surge in the demand for cash.\n\nThe Federal Reserve took swift and decisive action in response to both the shift in the economic outlook and deteriorating conditions in financial markets.2 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut the target range for the federal funds rate close to zero, and directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) to conduct repo operations and purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to support the smooth functioning of these markets. The Federal Reserve undertook a wide range of additional steps—many in coordination with the U.S. Treasury—to support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments. Regulations were also temporarily adjusted to encourage bank lending. These comprehensive actions, alongside swift passage of the CARES Act to support the U.S. economy, were essential for stabilizing U.S. financial markets and averting an even deeper collapse in economic activity.\n\nThe disruption in the U.S. Treasury market was especially notable, as measures of market functioning deteriorated at unparalleled speed to levels not seen since the Global Financial Crisis. The Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid fixed-income market in the world. It serves as a critical benchmark for all other dollar fixed-income markets, both in the U.S. and abroad, including the mortgage, corporate debt, and municipal bond markets that are essential to the flow of credit. Given the importance of the Treasury market, continued dysfunction could have led to an even deeper and broader seizing-up of credit and ultimately worsened the economic hardships that many Americans have been experiencing.\n\nThe Desk initially responded to the severe dysfunction by expanding repo operations, and then, at the direction of the FOMC, by buying a substantial quantity of Treasury securities and agency MBS. The FOMC then demonstrated a more forceful commitment by directing the Desk to purchase these securities “in the amounts needed” to support smooth functioning of these markets. The speed and scale of these actions—and the flexibility with which they were deployed—stabilized and eventually restored market functioning, and in June the FOMC transitioned the objective of purchases to sustaining smooth market functioning. During the period from March to June, the Federal Reserve purchased a total of around $1.6 trillion of Treasuries and $700 billion of agency MBS, as shown in Figure 1.3\n\nIn recent months, the public and private sectors initiated broad-based efforts to better understand the dynamics that led to the Treasury market dislocation in March and April. Ongoing research is helping shape our views of what happened, and last month the New York Fed, along with other Joint Member Agencies, co-hosted the sixth annual U.S. Treasury Market Conference.4 Participants focused on the causes of the Treasury market disruption and potential measures that could be taken to ensure the market’s resilience going forward.\n\nToday, I want to share some observations from our experience executing open market operations on the Desk during this period, and from the developing body of research and discussions. I would note that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Have I Taken Away from the Data and Research So Far?\n\nData and developing research offer perspective on important elements of the events of last spring. Though many aspects of what occurred warrant further study, I would like to focus my remarks on insights that the data and research provide about the exceptional desire to sell Treasury securities, and the capacity of the Treasury market infrastructure to manage these flows.\n\nOn the Desk, we certainly heard from our contacts and observed in the data available to us at the time that there was an extraordinary volume of selling by Treasury investors. Since then, data have confirmed that the size of those sales was unprecedented. As shown in Figure 2, customer transaction volumes reported by primary dealers spiked from an average level of around $400 billion per day in February to a peak of around $650 billion per day in mid-March—an increase of more than 50 percent. The more granular data from the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) confirm that the size of the risk being transferred was exceptional. The top half of Figure 3 shows the volume of daily customer sales of off-the-run Treasury securities expressed in “10-year equivalents,” a measure of the dollar amount of securities normalized by their interest rate risk.5 The bottom half shows customer purchases, net of the Federal Reserve’s purchases. The difference between these, in red, highlights the extraordinary degree of market liquidity being demanded by customers.\n\nWe also observed in March and April that these sales of Treasury securities were coming from a wide range of investors. While some commentary since then has focused on the role of certain investor types and strategies, recent data and work by academics help to dimension the broad-based nature of the selling.6\n\nMutual funds appear to have sold in exceptionally large volumes, as these funds monetized their most liquid asset holdings to prepare for potential redemptions and rebalance their portfolios. As shown in Figure 4, net sales of Treasuries by domestic mutual funds totaled almost $200 billion in the first quarter, the largest quarterly decline on record.7\n\nForeign official accounts, some of which were raising funds to meet actual and anticipated local needs for U.S. dollars, were also large net sellers, as shown by data from official accounts held at the New York Fed depicted in Figure 5. According to data from the Federal Reserve’s Financial Accounts of the United States, shown in Figure 6, foreign accounts, both official and private, sold a meaningful amount of Treasuries in the first quarter, although these data also include funds that operate in the U.S. but are domiciled offshore.\n\nThere has been significant attention on hedge fund sales of Treasury securities, and whether these amplified the stresses in the Treasury market. We heard in March and April that the sharp increase in volatility and futures margins resulted in relative value funds and other levered strategies reducing their positions.8 According to the U.S. Financial Accounts data, net sales of Treasury securities by households—a category that includes private investors domiciled in the U.S.—were notable in the first quarter, shown in Figure 7.9 We also observed that the reduction in net short positions in Treasury futures held by levered accounts accelerated sharply in March, as shown in Figure 8. Some research papers attribute a significant degree of the stress to hedge funds unwinding cash-futures basis positions, while others question whether these strategies were a meaningful contributor to the dynamics.10 This is difficult to judge, in large part because the available data on hedge fund holdings and transactions are incomplete. In the context of broad-based selling pressure, though, I think of these sales as an important contributing factor, but not the sole source of the challenges.\n\nIn addition to giving greater insight into the historic size and breadth of sales, data and recent research shed light on how the Treasury market responded to these extraordinary flows.\n\nBefore diving into this, I’d like to start with some background on the ecosystem of Treasury market intermediation. Broadly speaking, trading takes place in two separate but connected market segments: the dealer-to-client segment, where dealers transact with end-investors, and the interdealer segment, which is generally comprised of dealers and principal trading firms, or “PTFs,” trading with one another in the most liquid securities and largely on electronic limit order books.11 The interdealer segment is critical to the intermediation process, as it allows participants to manage risk and adjust positions rapidly and serves as an important source of price discovery in Treasuries. These features support the intermediation of customer flows and the smooth functioning of the Treasury market overall.12\n\nOur observations in March and April were that these intermediation channels became highly strained. The data show that dealers entered March with inventories of Treasury securities that were already high by historical standards, and, as depicted in Figure 9, those inventories grew as investors sold securities. Our conversations with dealers suggest that, amid a sharp increase in perceived risk, it became increasingly challenging to hold these positions and absorb new ones. In March, volatility in Treasury markets soared to levels not seen since the Global Financial Crisis, as shown in Figure 10.13 Heightened volatility increases the risk that dealers face in intermediating markets, as prices have greater potential to move during the period between the purchase and sale of securities. In this environment, dealers noted that risk measures rose sharply, and many suggested that internal risk management processes developed to ensure compliance with regulations limited the nimbleness with which they could respond to rapidly evolving circumstances.\n\nIn an environment of extraordinary volatility and large Treasury sales, the terms on which dealers were willing to make markets deteriorated sharply. For example, in less liquid off-the-run Treasury securities, bid-ask spreads, which are a measure of the price that investors pay to transact, rose to almost 30 times their normal levels and reached historic wides, as shown in Figure 11.\n\nDeteriorating conditions in the interdealer market likely exacerbated the challenges that dealers faced providing market liquidity to their customers by limiting their ability to efficiently manage risk. As highlighted in a recent note by Federal Reserve economists Dobrislav Dobrev and Andrew Meldrum, market depth in on-the-run Treasury securities fell dramatically compared to typical levels, and standing orders near the top of the order book on electronic systems were not replenished rapidly enough to keep pace with increased trading volumes. Figure 12, reproduced from their note, illustrates this sharp drop in market depth, showing the top level and top three levels of the order book on a normal day, on the left, and on a highly stressed day in mid-March, on the right.14, 15 Liquidity providers in this market—both dealers and PTFs—faced high and unpredictable volatility and flows that made it riskier to maintain or quickly restore standing orders. Overall, PTFs, which are more thinly capitalized and do not typically hold positions overnight, appear to have reduced the competitiveness of their intermediation to a somewhat greater degree, as their share of transaction volume fell, depicted in Figure 13.16\n\nNonetheless, it seems important to note that while the terms on which Treasuries were intermediated deteriorated dramatically, a much higher-than-normal volume of private transactions still occurred. So, while liquidity was severely strained, the volume that intermediaries were managing was still quite high, even in the less liquid market segments such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and off-the-run Treasury securities.\n\nIn sum, I interpret the work to date as confirming our observations at the time that unprecedented demand for cash led to selling that was historic in size and broad-based in nature. Intermediation activity expanded, but was unable to keep pace, and the market came under severe strain. As a result, the Fed stepped in to buy securities at unprecedented scale and speed, ultimately restoring and sustaining effective market functioning.\n\nWhat Ideas Have Been Raised That Could Make the Market More Resilient?\n\nAt the U.S. Treasury Market Conference, there was an insightful and robust discussion among industry professionals, academics, and policymakers about Treasury market resilience.17 While participants acknowledged that there is still much more to learn about the events of March and April, many shared early ideas on how the resiliency of this critical market might be enhanced over time.\n\nFinancial markets are always evolving in response to changes in the environment, including technology, regulation, and business models. Participants at the conference noted that, in recent years, we have seen substantial growth in the share of electronic intermediation, significant changes in the regulation of key intermediaries, and a meaningful shift in both the outstanding size and holders of Treasury debt.\n\nParticipants highlighted how each of these has brought substantive benefits, but may also present new considerations. Increased volume of electronic trading on central limit order books has contributed to reductions in transaction costs and lowered barriers to entry for new liquidity providers. However, available liquidity can diminish in highly volatile markets, as market makers manage risk and may have less relationship incentive to maintain liquidity provision on anonymous platforms. Regulations have enhanced financial stability by making banks and their broker-dealers more resilient, but conference participants suggested that the manner in which firms implement regulations may reduce their flexibility to respond to rapidly evolving conditions.\n\nFinally, participants highlighted that growth in Treasury issuance has been essential for the U.S. government to support U.S. households and businesses during the pandemic, but, as Darrell Duffie noted in a recent paper, ongoing increases in the stock of Treasuries may result in greater peaks in the demand for intermediation.18 These peaks may be amplified by the reliance of some investors on Treasuries to provide liquidity in portfolios with natural liquidity mismatches, and by the use of leverage in some Treasury investment strategies.19\n\nI was pleased that conference participants also offered some early ideas for enhancing the resiliency of the Treasury market in this evolving environment. Of course, given the complexity associated with changes to Treasury market infrastructure, I would highlight that these ideas are preliminary and all would require further analysis.\n\nFirst, several conference participants suggested that, while Treasury market data has improved markedly in recent years, continuing to enhance transparency could bolster confidence in the ability to transact fairly, particularly in volatile markets.20 For repo markets, providing public data on the opaque uncleared bilateral segment could improve visibility into the size of levered Treasury positions, and data on term repo might give market participants more confidence in pricing. In the Treasury cash market, continuing to refine and increase the availability of the TRACE data would improve our understanding of the market, including the types and prevalence of trading strategies and the methods of execution.21\n\nSecond, conference participants suggested ways to increase the capacity for and flexibility of liquidity provision, so the market can manage peaks in liquidity demand. Expanding access to trading venues and central clearing were both highlighted as potential ideas. Increased central clearing can help market participants manage settlement risk and facilitate more efficient balance sheet usage, and may also pave the way for more direct trading among Treasury market participants.22, 23 Separately, several conference participants thought it might be helpful to explore whether adjustments to certain regulations might enhance banks’ flexibility, while still maintaining their resiliency.\n\nThird, and finally, participants highlighted steps that could help stem the volume of sales during periods of high volatility and stress. Several indicated that greater uniformity or enhanced transparency in margin practices could reduce the need for funds employing certain levered trading strategies to unwind positions amid higher volatility. In addition, some thought further study may be warranted on the role of nonbank financial institutions in this market. With regard to the Federal Reserve, participants suggested that existing repo backstops could be fortified, as these facilities provide confidence in the liquidity of Treasuries, thus reducing the need for outright Treasury sales during stress events.24\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, the pandemic created exceptional uncertainty about the economic outlook and concern about financial market functioning, resulting in an intense demand for cash. This desire to raise cash rapidly, combined with extraordinary financial market volatility, resulted in an unprecedented volume of Treasury sales and stresses in the Treasury market. In response, the Federal Reserve stepped in to support the smooth functioning of this vital market in order to maintain the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\n\nThis was truly an exceptional event. However, while it is tempting to dismiss it as a once-in-a-lifetime shock, it is important to take time to reflect and assess if lessons can be learned that could make the Treasury market even more resilient to future shocks. The situations that require policy intervention should be extraordinarily rare.\n\nIn this regard, I have been heartened by the energy that academics, industry professionals, and public sector officials have brought to understanding the underlying drivers of the stress in March and April. The developing research and discussions are already producing vital insights, and I encourage continued engagement on these issues. I also look forward to working together with other agencies and industry professionals to explore ways to enhance the resilience of the U.S. Treasury market, so that it continues to be the deepest and most liquid fixed-income market in the world.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to the discussion.\n\nFigures PDF\n\n\n1 I would like to thank Katherine Femia, Frank Keane, Matt Raskin and Patricia Zobel for their assistance in preparing these remarks, Nathan Dodge and Kathleena Inchoco for their assistance with data, and colleagues in the Federal Reserve System for valuable comments and suggestions.\n\n2 Logan, Lorie K. (2020). The Federal Reserve’s Market Functioning Purchases: From Supporting to Sustaining, speech delivered at the SIFMA webinar, July 15, 2020.\n\n3 These figures reflect the period from March 13, through June 10, 2020. At its June meeting, the FOMC transitioned the objective of its purchases from supporting to sustaining smooth market functioning. In September, the FOMC expanded the objective to include helping to foster accommodative financial conditions.\n\n4 The conference was co-hosted by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Conference details are available at https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/events/markets/2020/0929-2020.\n\n5 Off-the-run Treasury securities are all but the most recently issued Treasury securities. A 10-year equivalent converts the dollar amount of security holdings with different characteristics into the equivalent amount of securities with 10 years to maturity, based on their duration risk or interest rate sensitivity. This is one measure of interest rate risk in a portfolio.\n\n6 Annette Vissing-Jorgensen, Bond markets in Spring 2020 and the response of the Federal Reserve, August 2020, provides an overview of the broad-based nature of these sales.\n\n7 Yiming Ma, Kairong Xiao and Yao Zeng also dimension these sales in their paper, Mutual Fund Liquidity Transformation and Reverse Flight to Liquidity, July 2020.\n\n8 One relative value strategy that received attention is the Treasury cash-futures basis. This basis represents the difference in price between a Treasury futures contract and underlying Treasury securities in the deliverable basket.

    "text": "Remarks before the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York CityAs prepared for delivery\nThank you for inviting me to speak and for that kind introduction. For years I have had the privilege to be a part of the audience at these events, and it’s an honor to be asked to address the group.\n\nSince the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has used short-term interest rates and its balance sheet to achieve its policy objectives. In my remarks this evening, I will make some observations on the current approach to influencing short-term interest rates and the execution of operations by the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk, and consider how these operations might evolve as the Federal Reserve eventually normalizes its balance sheet. I will also look back at our past experience, which may offer perspective as we prepare for what lies ahead. The views presented are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.1\nThe Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Implementation Framework Is Working Well\n\nThe Federal Reserve has successfully raised the overnight federal funds rate three times since December 2015 in the gradual process of normalizing the stance of monetary policy. During this time, the effective federal funds rate has printed within the prevailing target range set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). These results have been achieved with an abundant supply of reserve balances created in the banking system by large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) from 2008 through 2014 and amid significant changes in U.S. money markets.2\n\nA central bank’s operational framework for implementing monetary policy is designed to control policymakers’ selected target, typically a short-term interest rate. Since December 2015, the Federal Reserve has been using a floor-style framework that allows us to change short-term interest rates while maintaining an abundant supply of reserve balances that has fluctuated in a wide range, mostly above $2 trillion. We can illustrate this framework with a stylized graph showing the relationship between the interest rate and banks’ demand for reserves (Figure 1). When reserves are scarce, the curve slopes steeply downward, and small variations in the supply of reserve balances produce sharp moves in interest rates. But when reserves become plentiful enough, banks’ demand flattens out, and interest rates become effectively insensitive to shifts in reserve supply. The interest rate at which the curve levels out reflects the return that banks receive on reserves held at the central bank. Thus, in a floor system, undesired upward movements in rates are prevented by making the supply of reserves abundant enough to intersect the flat part of the demand curve, while undesired downward movements are prevented by establishing the rate of interest paid on reserves held at the central bank.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s implementation of a floor regime is unique in featuring two tools that help prevent the effective federal funds rate from falling appreciably below the FOMC’s target range. The primary tool—interest on reserves (IOR)—applies to the reserve balances held by banks in their accounts with the Federal Reserve.3 In principle, the federal funds rate should not fall below IOR, because depository institutions have no incentive to lend federal funds at interest rates below what they could earn simply by leaving the funds in their reserve accounts. However, a number of frictions have caused the effective federal funds rate to print moderately below IOR, leading the Federal Reserve to use a supplementary tool—a facility that offers overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs) at a specified offering rate to a wide range of counterparties.4\n\nThe ON RRP facility helps to reinforce the floor under market interest rates by providing an outside investment option to a broad group of nonbank market participants that are not eligible to earn IOR.5 We’ve observed that a high volume of actual ON RRP usage has not been necessary to achieve interest rate control. In the first half of 2016, for example, average daily usage of the facility was $63 billion. In principle, even with zero usage, the ON RRP facility can support market rates by ensuring that counterparties demand rates on other investments at least as attractive as the rate offered on the Federal Reserve’s ON RRPs.\n\nThe ON RRP facility also serves as a flexible shock absorber that helps to maintain interest rate control when transitory shifts occur in the supply and demand for short-term market instruments. For example, around key month- and quarter-end reporting dates, some financial institutions shrink their balance sheets, a measure that reduces the availability of private money market investments, puts downward pressure on money market rates, and produces higher ON RRP take-up. Last fall, the ON RRP facility also helped to maintain rate control during the implementation of money market fund reform by temporarily absorbing heightened demand for safe, overnight investments by government money market funds.\n\nThus, with almost a year and a half of experience with a federal funds target above the zero lower bound, our current approach has so far proved to be both effective and resilient to structural changes in the market. The new framework is also quite simple and efficient from an operational perspective. To fully appreciate this, it’s useful to look back at the conduct of open market operations before the global financial crisis.\n\nOpen Market Operations in Money Markets Pre-Crisis\n\nPrior to the crisis, the Federal Reserve’s operational framework was similar to a corridor system based on reserve scarcity.6 At that time, the Federal Reserve did not pay interest on reserves. Banks’ demand for reserves balanced the costs of falling short of their reserve requirements against the opportunity cost of holding too many non-interest-bearing reserves or of borrowing reserves at a penalty rate. This trade-off created a steeply downward-sloping demand curve for reserves (Figure 2). Facing that demand curve, the Desk conducted daily open market operations to bring the system’s aggregate supply of reserves to a level where it would meet the estimated demand at or near the FOMC’s target federal funds rate.7 Active interbank trading distributed these reserves within the system, between banks with a surplus of reserves and those with a deficit.\n\nManaging the supply of reserves at levels that kept the federal funds rate from moving too high or too low was a technically challenging exercise that required both market knowledge and expert judgment.8 Reserve forecasters on the Desk and at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors projected various elements that could affect the supply of and demand for reserves over multiple days ahead. Anticipating changes in the supply of reserves required a detailed understanding of numerous factors, many of which were driven by forces outside the control of the Federal Reserve—so-called “autonomous factors,” such as balances held by the Treasury in its account at the Federal Reserve or physical U.S. currency held by the public. To determine the demand for reserves, staff gathered information to estimate banks’ reserve needs and plans for meeting them over each two-week reserve maintenance period.9 Using this information, staff planned open market operations—specifically, overnight and term repurchase agreements, and purchases of Treasury securities—to affect reserve conditions throughout each maintenance period. Uncertainty about various factors, such as swings in banks’ clearing needs, meant that fluctuations in banks’ demand for reserves could not be completely forecasted, especially on a daily basis, but even predictable variations resulted in the need for open market operations on most days.\n\nIn normal times, we were reliably proficient in hitting the FOMC’s target rate. However, interest rate control was more challenging at times when autonomous factors or the demand for reserves was harder to predict. These challenges were particularly acute during the early stages of the financial crisis, when large changes in reserve demand caused significant intraday swings in federal funds rates.10 A framework based on actively managing the supply of reserves was, from an operational perspective, also a discretionary and interventionist approach, albeit one that required only small adjustments on most days. Moreover, the pre-crisis framework created costly cash management regimes for banks, which had to meet reserve requirements and avoid overnight overdrafts in an environment with reserve scarcity and the high opportunity costs entailed by holding reserves.\n\nOpen Market Operations in Money Markets Today\nThe Desk’s role now is quite different. With reserve balances far in excess of banks’ reserve requirements, the Desk cannot meaningfully influence the federal funds rate by changing the supply of reserves, so the Federal Reserve achieves control over the federal funds rate by setting rates on various central bank liabilities.\n\nThe Desk’s operational charge for maintaining the federal funds rate in the FOMC’s target range is now centered on running the ON RRP facility. On a daily basis, the Desk auctions ON RRPs at an offering rate and aggregate offering limit set by the FOMC. The operation is based on price, not quantity, so there is nothing to forecast ahead of time.11 Market forces then keep the federal funds rate within the FOMC’s target range by pricing private trades against the alternative option of investing with the Federal Reserve, rather than by having interbank trading redistribute reserves throughout the system, as it did before the crisis. However, this approach relies on the Desk maintaining a larger and more heterogeneous set of counterparty relationships than before the crisis.\n\nWe support this framework with substantial market analysis, but the nature of the analysis has changed. The current framework does not require high-frequency forecasts of factors affecting the supply of and demand for reserves. Instead, we analyze trading dynamics and relationships among a broad set of market participants to build knowledge about how our tools affect private sector trading incentives and how market developments might affect policy implementation. This knowledge helps us to better understand the first steps in the transmission of the monetary policy stance, to assess the efficacy of policy implementation, and to provide advice on how the Federal Reserve could adjust the framework and tools if needed to ensure they remain effective.12\n\nWhat Could the Monetary Policy Implementation Framework Look Like in the Future?\n\nThe current framework was developed as a means for the Federal Reserve to normalize the stance of monetary policy after the extraordinary balance sheet expansion that was undertaken in the aftermath of the crisis, but policymakers have begun to consider what framework to use in the longer run.13 In a preliminary discussion about the long-run monetary policy implementation framework held in November 2016, FOMC participants commented on the advantages of an approach to policy implementation similar to the one currently in use, in which active management of the supply of reserves would not be required. They noted that such an approach could be compatible with a balance sheet that was much smaller than the current one, though likely at least somewhat larger than the pre-crisis balance sheet. Such an approach was seen as “likely to be relatively simple and efficient to administer, relatively straightforward to communicate, and effective in enabling interest rate control across a wide range of circumstances.”14 However, policymakers made no decisions on these issues and acknowledged that they expected to learn from additional experience before making such judgments.\n\nIn the meantime, I believe it is important that we continue to consider what a “new normal” might look like in order to ensure operational and analytical readiness—just as we spent several years preparing to raise the federal funds rate away from zero by expanding counterparties, developing and testing ON RRPs and various types of term reserve-draining operations, and enhancing our collection of data on money market activity.\n\nWhat Might the Balance Sheet and Open Market Operations Look Like in the Future?\n\nThe FOMC’s statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans notes that in the long-run, the FOMC intends to “hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.” It is challenging to determine far in advance what balance sheet size would accomplish this objective. However, it is probable that the normalized balance sheet will be considerably larger than its pre-crisis level, even before considering the volume of reserves that the FOMC would decide to supply. The reason is that recent growth trends in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities will augment the necessary size of the normalized balance sheet independent of the operational framework adopted by the FOMC in the long run. To understand this point, it’s useful to consider the liability side of the Federal Reserve’s current balance sheet (Figure 3).\n\nFirst, currency in circulation—a central bank’s traditional liability—remains a large and growing balance sheet item. Federal Reserve notes outstanding have nearly doubled since the start of the crisis, with a current level of about $1.5 trillion, implying that currency demand alone requires a much larger balance sheet than before the crisis. A simple assumption is that U.S. currency in circulation will grow in line with nominal U.S. GDP growth. However, it is easy to imagine shocks that could materially affect currency growth, either positively or negatively. For example, with heavy usage of U.S. paper currency overseas, demand for dollars appears sensitive to changes in global growth and financial and geopolitical stability.15 In addition, it is hard to know what longer-term implications financial technology will have for currency demand.\n\nSecond, the U.S. Treasury holds cash balances at the Federal Reserve in the Treasury General Account (TGA), its primary “checking account.” Before the crisis, Treasury targeted a TGA balance of $5 billion on most days; those balances increased during the global financial crisis. In May 2015, the Treasury announced plans to hold a level of cash generally sufficient to cover one week of outflows to help protect against a potential interruption in market access.16 Since that cash management policy went into effect, TGA balances have averaged around $250 billion, reaching as high as $440 billion.\n\nThird, designated financial market utilities (DFMUs) can now establish and hold cash deposits in Reserve Bank accounts.17 The buildup of DFMU balances has prompted “other deposits” on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to grow steadily over recent years to a current level of about $85 billion, compared to a pre-crisis average of less than $1 billion. The other deposits category also includes balances held by GSEs and international and multilateral organizations.18\n\nFourth, the Federal Reserve has long offered an overnight repurchase agreement investment to foreign official and international account holders—a service known as the foreign repo pool. The foreign repo pool has grown from an average level of around $30 billion before the crisis to an average of about $250 billion now. The rise reflects foreign central banks’ preferences to maintain robust dollar liquidity buffers, reduced availability of alternative low-risk investment options with private counterparties, and the New York Fed’s removal of constraints on account holders’ ability to vary the size of their investments.\n\nIn projecting the size of the normalized balance sheet, one can make assumptions about the long-run trends that will determine future levels for each of these non-reserve liabilities, subject to various kinds of uncertainty. Even taken at today’s levels, the TGA, other deposits, and the foreign repo pool alone account for about $600 billion of the Federal Reserve’s current balance sheet size. Adding on currency outstanding brings this set of non-reserve liabilities to $2.1 trillion today, and this set is likely to grow as the economy continues to expand. This sum does not yet consider reserves or ON RRPs.\n\nThe ON RRP facility, which has averaged around $165 billion this year, is another non-reserve liability that one might need to factor into balance sheet projections. The FOMC has said that it plans to phase out the ON RRP facility when it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate. However, as mentioned earlier, the facility has been a useful shock absorber amid structural changes in money markets, and it may be that some such facility would be helpful in maintaining effective interest rate control should the FOMC decide to remain in a floor system in the longer run. Of course, a decision to maintain an ON RRP facility would require longer-term choices about counterparty relationships and consideration of possible financial stability risks.19\n\nFinally, to complete projections for the normalized size of the balance sheet, we must consider reserve balances, currently the Federal Reserve’s largest liability. Two components will help shape the long-run level of reserve balances: banks’ demand for reserves and what, if any, additional supply of reserves might be deemed appropriate for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.\n\nThe precise shape and position of banks’ demand curve is not currently known, but we generally understand the key forces that are likely to influence it. Changes in bank liquidity regulation and supervision since the crisis will be particularly important.20 In this new environment, we will need to consider the relative attractiveness of rates paid on reserves and close substitutes, such as Treasury securities, as well as banks’ propensity to substitute between these assets in meeting their liquidity requirements. Other characteristics of reserves may boost their inherent appeal—for example, intraday liquidity that supports clearing and settlement activities, or perceptions that holding reserves makes an institution safer. These factors are likely to contribute to higher and more variable demand for reserves than banks had before the crisis. If the demand curve for reserve balances has indeed shifted out, then a greater supply of reserves will be needed to attain a given interest rate target.\n\nMoreover, it is important to take into account how uncertainty and increased variability in the non-reserve liabilities I’ve discussed could warrant an additional supply of reserves (Figure 4). For example, TGA balances exhibit significant day-to-day variation stemming from the settlement of securities and the receipt of tax payments. All else equal, changes in non-reserve liabilities have the opposite effect on the supply of reserves. What these variations will mean for the amount of reserves the Federal Reserve decides to supply—and also for the size of the normalized balance sheet and the types of open market operations that will be employed—will depend heavily on the operational framework the FOMC chooses in the longer run.\n\nTo remain in a floor system, the Federal Reserve would need to supply enough reserves to satisfy bank demand along the flat portion of the reserves demand curve. It would also need to ensure that even amid shocks to non-reserve liabilities, the supply of reserves would stay on the flat part of the demand curve. There are essentially three ways to accomplish that objective. First, as in the past, the Federal Reserve could establish limits for the overall size of or daily variations in non-reserve account balances. Second, the Desk could carry out open market operations to offset fluctuations in reserve-absorbing factors, similar to what we did in our pre-crisis framework but at a lower frequency. Third, the balance sheet could include an additional buffer of excess reserves sufficient to ensure that most shocks would still leave us safely to the right of the steep part of the demand curve. Providing this additional buffer would require that the Federal Reserve retain a corresponding amount of assets.\n\nAn important trade-off in a floor system arises between the size of that additional buffer and the frequency and size of open market operations. In the current floor framework, the buffer is more than large enough to absorb shocks without the need to conduct offsetting open market operations. In fact, the level of reserve balances has fluctuated by as much as $700 billion since the start of 2016 with no material impact on federal funds market dynamics. To project the balance sheet’s long-run size, one could try to estimate the size of a conservative buffer by examining the distribution of changes in currency, the TGA, other deposits, and the foreign repo pool. Data since January 2016 suggest an additional buffer of reserves of about $145 billion would absorb 99 percent of changes in the daily average holdings of these liabilities from week to week (Figure 4). Accounting for variability in ON RRPs could add another $215 billion to the buffer.21\n\nIn a floor system with a buffer that would sufficiently accommodate swings in non-reserve liabilities, IOR would continue to be the primary tool to maintain interest rate control, perhaps supported by ON RRPs if needed. In addition, the Federal Reserve would still need to conduct some reserve-adding open market operations, but only periodically, to accommodate trend growth of balance sheet items like currency; otherwise, the quantity of reserves would eventually be smaller than that needed for efficient and effective policy implementation.\n\nHowever, if the FOMC wanted to maintain a somewhat smaller balance sheet, it might prefer to operate a floor system with a smaller buffer. In this case, the Desk would have to use regular reserve-adding open market operations to offset transitory shocks to reserve-absorbing factors in addition to secular trends. The smaller the buffer, the more the Desk’s operational schedule and supporting analysis would need to focus on short-run changes in demand for the Federal Reserve’s liabilities.\n\nReturning to a corridor system, in which we operate on the steep part of the demand curve, would mean an even smaller balance sheet. Daily forecasting and frequent open market operations would once again be required to manage the supply of reserves in the face of either reserve-adding or reserve-absorbing shocks in order to maintain interest rate control.\n\nOne could put together all of these elements—one’s projected levels for the range of non-reserve liabilities and assumptions about the supply of reserves—to arrive at some rough estimates of the range of balance sheet sizes that would be required under these different operational frameworks.22 However, the uncertainties surrounding these factors at this stage are very large. Furthermore, the variability of these factors over time suggests that the size of the balance sheet that best balances the trade-offs will evolve as the structure of money markets and other factors change. In practice, it will likely be necessary for the Federal Reserve to closely monitor the behavior of money markets as its balance sheet shrinks, and to use that information to enhance our understanding of the evolution of the demand for reserves and the other, non-reserve liabilities.\n\nHow Might We Know When We Are Getting Close to a Normalized Balance Sheet Size?\n\nThe FOMC is currently maintaining the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by reinvesting payments of principal on its securities holdings and has said that it anticipates continuing to do so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well underway. When the FOMC reduces its securities holdings, the supply of reserves will also shrink. As that process occurs, understanding evolving money market dynamics and the structure of the reserves market will be a central component of the Desk’s analytical agenda—regardless of whether the FOMC decides to remain in a floor system or return to a corridor system. A key focus for interest rate control will be assessing the shape and position of the reserve demand curve and interpreting financial market conditions to gauge how far we are from the steep portion of it. Our thinking on this is still evolving, but let me offer a few thoughts.\n\nUpward pressure on overnight interest rates is the most direct indicator that reserves are becoming scarce. If the FOMC were to return to a corridor system, this would be the main indicator we would need. An increase in rates would likely suggest that reserve supply had moved onto the steep part of the demand curve, exhibiting the desired reserve scarcity that is associated with this type of operational framework. In assessing when to stop reducing the balance sheet to remain in a floor system, however, upward pressure on rates might not be as useful an indicator. Although brief increases in rates might not be materially adverse, a longer-lasting rise in rates would be a sign that reserves had already become scarcer than needed to maintain interest rate control. Thus, for a floor system, it will be important to develop and assess more forward-looking indicators to signal impending reserve scarcity.\n\nData from the Federal Reserve’s Report of Selected Money Market Rates (FR 2420) provide visibility into transactions in a range of unsecured funding markets and could be leveraged to develop some such indicators. Changes in the distribution of traded funding rates or in the nature of trading in the federal funds market might be signs that conditions in money markets were becoming more directly influenced by the amount of reserves. For example, most market activity today is characterized by banks borrowing from nonbanks to earn IOR. As reserves are reduced, a shift towards banks borrowing reserves to cover unexpected shortfalls could be a sign of mounting reserve scarcity. Banks needing to cover shortfalls might borrow from nonbanks at rates closer to IOR or from banks, likely at rates above IOR (since banks are unlikely to lend reserves at a rate below what they could earn if they left the funds in their reserve account).23\n\nMonitoring correlations between trade volumes and rates might also be informative. Higher volumes accompanied by lower rates—a negative correlation—could suggest an increase in arbitrage activity as banks try to earn the spread between market rates and IOR, while a positive correlation between volumes and rates could indicate that banks need to borrow reserves at relatively high rates at the end of the day to cover reserve shortfalls.24\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up: The Federal Reserve’s framework for implementing monetary policy has evolved quite substantially since the financial crisis. The unique floor system we’ve adopted to influence short-term interest rates, which uses interest on reserves and overnight reverse repos as support, has given the FOMC excellent control of the federal funds rate and supported efficient transmission to other money market rates.\n\nIn the longer run, the Federal Reserve could choose to retain the floor system to implement monetary policy or shift back to a corridor system. Under either operational framework, the balance sheet would decline significantly from its current size, but remain substantially larger than it was pre-crisis in order to accommodate its non-reserve liabilities and to supply an appropriate quantity of reserves. Moreover, the balance sheet’s size will change over time, driven by changes in longer-run demand for various Federal Reserve liabilities.\n\nIf the Committee remains in a floor system, the Federal Reserve will need to supply enough reserves to satisfy demand along the flat portion of the reserve demand curve plus, perhaps, an additional buffer to absorb variability in demand for non-reserve liabilities. These considerations would contribute to a larger balance sheet than in a corridor system. The size of the buffer would influence the need to conduct open market operations to offset temporary shocks, so policymakers would need to consider a trade-off between a larger balance sheet that accommodates this buffer and the complexity associated with more active forecasting and open market operations.\n\nOnce the Committee begins to reduce the balance sheet, we will track market dynamics to gauge the impact of declining reserve balances. Given the uniqueness of the current operational framework and the substantial ongoing changes in money markets, this task will present an interesting challenge for the staff, and one that we are preparing for as we carry out our operational and analytical responsibilities.\n\nThank you. I would be happy to answer any questions.\n\nFigures PDF\n\n\n\n1 I would like to thank Deborah Leonard for her assistance in the preparation of these remarks, as well as colleagues in the Federal Reserve System, including Antoine Martin, Simon Potter, Brian Madigan, and Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, for numerous insightful comments and suggestions.\n\n2 See Simon Potter, “Money Markets at a Crossroads: Policy Implementation at a Time of Structural Change,” remarks presented at the Master of Applied Economics Distinguished Speaker Series, University of California at Los Angeles, April 5, 2017.\n\n3 Congress granted the Federal Reserve the authority to pay interest on reserves in 2006, initially with an October 2011 effective date. Congress subsequently accelerated the effective date to October 2008, in response to the financial crisis, in order to enhance the Federal Reserve’s ability to control short-term interest rates amid its reserve-expanding credit programs and asset purchases. Even before the crisis, Federal Reserve staff had started to examine ways to improve the Federal Reserve’s approach to policy implementation using its authority to pay IOR as a new tool. See the April 2008 Federal Reserve staff memo to the FOMC, “Interest on Reserves: A Preliminary Analysis of Basic Options.”\n\n4 One complication stems from the ineligibility of nonbank financial institutions (such as government-sponsored enterprises and money market mutual funds), which account for a significant share of cash lending activity in U.S. money markets, to earn interest on reserves. Frictions also include credit limits imposed by cash lenders and other impediments to market competition, and the costs incurred by banks through balance sheet expansions related to arbitrage activity.\n\n5 The efficacy of this mechanism relies on access to ON RRPs by a sizable share of market participants active in overnight markets. The New York Fed has developed an extended network of reverse repo counterparties that includes money market funds, government-sponsored enterprises, and banks, in addition to the primary dealer counterparties that traditionally participate in open market operations.\n\n6 The Federal Reserve’s corridor was asymmetric: Depository institutions could borrow funds from the discount window at a rate 100 basis points above the FOMC’s federal funds target rate, setting a soft ceiling, but reserve balances held in their Federal Reserve accounts earned zero interest, the floor. A thorough review of how this system operated is found in Huberto M. Ennis and Todd Keister, “Understanding Monetary Policy Implementation,” Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly 94, no. 3 (Summer 2008): 235-63.\n\n7 Although the FOMC’s policy target, the federal funds rate, represents an unsecured lending rate between banks, the Desk conducted its operations with its primary dealer counterparties in the secured financing market for general collateral repurchase agreements (repos). In doing so, the Desk created reserves in the banking system by crediting the dealers’ accounts at the tri-party clearing banks, which are depository institutions. Related adjustments in reserve conditions directly influenced interbank trading and rates in the federal funds market. However, these operations were not designed to exert any influence directly over the repo markets in which we transacted.\n\n8 See Ben S. Bernanke, “Implementing Monetary Policy,” remarks presented at the Redefining Investment Strategy Education Conference, University of Dayton, Dayton, Ohio, March 30, 2005.\n\n9 Banks’ demand for reserves was driven by the need to meet reserve requirements (set forth in Regulation D, 12 CFR 2014) and to support intraday payments activity. Reserve requirements are calculated as a proportion of an institution’s transaction deposits during a fourteen-day computation period. Institutions satisfy their requirement by maintaining an average level of vault cash or balances in their account at a Federal Reserve Bank equal to the reserve requirement over a lagged, two-week maintenance period. Averaging across a maintenance period helped to provide some automatic flexibility in the face of various shocks by allowing banks to spread out their reserve holdings over time as they assessed changes in supply and relative costs; a provision that allowed banks to carry some of their reserve excess or deficiency into the subsequent maintenance period also helped to smooth volatility.\n\n10 See Spence Hilton, “Recent Developments in Federal Reserve System Liquidity and Reserve Operations,” Reserve Bank of Australia conference Lessons from the Financial Turmoil of 2007 and 2008, Sydney, Australia, July 14-15, 2008.\n\n11 Mechanics of the operation are described in Federal Reserve Bank of New York, FAQs: Reverse Repurchase Agreement Operations.\n\n12 Enhancements to the Federal Reserve’s collection of money market data in recent years support this analysis. Data on federal funds, Eurodollar, and certificate of deposit transactions collected through the Report of Selected Money Market Rates (FR 2420) provide critical insight into how unsecured markets function, helping Federal Reserve staff to understand trends and relationships across money markets and to assess the effectiveness of policy implementation. Additionally, data collected from the tri-party clearing banks offers perspective on secured financing transactions.\n\n13 The FOMC’s September 2014 statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans defines normalization as “steps to raise the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates to more normal levels and to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.”\n\n14 See Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, November 1-2, 2016.\n\n15 Since 1987, annual currency growth rates ranged from 1 percent to 11 percent, excluding outliers in 1999 and 2000 associated with the century date change. The demand for safe assets abroad frequently contributed to divergences between U.S. nominal GDP growth and currency growth. See Ayelen Banegas et al, “International Dollar Flows,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers, no. 1144, September 2015; and Ruth Judson, “Crisis and Calm: Demand for U.S. Currency and Home and Abroad from the Fall of the Berlin Wall to 2011,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System International Finance Discussion Papers, no. 1058, November 2012.\n\n16 See the Treasury Department’s quarterly refunding statement, May 6, 2015.\n\n17 Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 outlines measures for enhanced supervision of financial market utilities that are designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council.\n\n18 Foreign official institutions also maintain deposits in Federal Reserve accounts. Since 2016, these deposits have averaged around $5 billion.\n\n19 See Joshua Frost et al., “Overnight RRP Operations as a Monetary Policy Tool: Some Design Considerations,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, no. 712, February 2015.\n\n20 These changes make it hard to draw on our past experience. For example, in their April 2008 memo to the FOMC on options for interest on reserves, Federal Reserve staff suggested that the amount of reserves needed to run a floor system with high balances was on the order of $35 billion and potentially higher on some days. This estimate was consistent with models of reserve demand relationships at that time, but seems implausible today.\n\n21 We would need to consider the drivers of changes in the ON RRP facility’s size and whether those changes were matched by offsetting changes in demand for reserves or other Federal Reserve liabilities. For example, when banks shrink their balance sheets at quarter-ends and investors move to the ON RRP facility, increased demand for ON RRPs is offset by decreased demand for reserves, shifting the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities but not their total volume. However, other fluctuations in ON RRP demand are not automatically matched by offsetting changes in demand for reserves or other Federal Reserve liabilities, and thus could necessitate adjustments in the balance sheet’s size or in the terms of the facility.\n\n22 The Desk’s Report on Open Market Operations during 2016 and accompanying data files illustrate some projected paths for the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities portfolio under alternative scenarios for the long-run level of liabilities.\n\n23 Currently, trades among banks represent less than 5 percent of daily trading volume. There is a risk that in the new regulatory environment, banks may be less eager to trade with each other than they were pre-crisis even as the supply of reserves becomes smaller, making an increase in interbank trading an unreliable indicator. Banks’ costs of expanding their balance sheets may inhibit interbank lending, whereas intermediation between nonbanks and banks does not increase the size of banks’ balance sheets in the aggregate. See Simon Potter, “Discussion of ‘Evaluating Monetary Policy Operational Frameworks’ by Ulrich Bindseil,” 2016 Economic Policy Symposium, Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 25-27, 2016.\n\n24 Increased use of daylight credit, which is virtually nonexistent today, might also signal mounting scarcity absent changes in required reserves."

    "text": "Thank you for that kind introduction, Katie [Pryor], and thank you for the opportunity to be part of today’s program.\n\nI would like to start by recognizing the work of the Greater Houston Partnership. The partnership connects business and community leaders to address critical issues for the region’s economy. We at the Dallas Fed are grateful for our collaboration with the GHP. Several of our directors and advisory committee members, people we rely on for real-time insight on the economy, also serve as GHP board members or staff. It is wonderful to see Dr. Ruth Simmons here today. Dr. Simmons is chair of the Dallas Fed’s Houston board as well as a member of the GHP board. And we’re so pleased that Daron Peschel, senior vice president and our Houston regional executive, is able to serve on the GHP board as well.\n\nIt’s always great to visit Houston. This is an incredible city and a vital contributor to the U.S. and global economies. Houston is the energy capital of the world and an international hub for energy innovation. Its geography, infrastructure and workforce also make it a vibrant center for industries including logistics, aerospace, health care and biotechnology. Houston was the very first city I visited outside Dallas when I began a listening tour of the region after joining the Dallas Fed as president and CEO two years ago. And every time I return, I’m more impressed with the city’s dynamism, the powerful partnerships between business and community leaders, and the innovation taking place here.\n\nAs you’d expect in such a dynamic place, a lot has changed since my first visit to Houston in early October of 2022—new solar, wind and carbon capture projects; the Energy Department’s selection of Houston as a hydrogen hub; continued expansion at the Texas Medical Center; and ambitious lunar plans at NASA. Still, the foundational elements of energy, geography, infrastructure and workforce that I learned about in 2022 have stayed in place.\n\nThe same is true for the national economy since 2022; a lot has changed, but a lot remains the same. Today, I’ll share with you how my thinking on the economy has evolved and how I’m continuing to apply some foundational considerations to the economic challenges we face today. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Federal Reserve\nWhen I think about what we do at the Federal Reserve, it’s all about advancing an economy where everyone has opportunities to thrive.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we describe our work as “Building a Strong Economy Together.” The Dallas Fed is one of the 12 reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System. We are the nation’s central bank, and we perform five functions to support a strong economy for everyone in the United States:\n\nWe supervise banks to ensure they are safe and sound.\nWe support the stability of the financial system as a whole.\nWe operate parts of the payments system, which lets you get cash from your bank or send and receive money electronically as you do business.\nWe promote consumer protection and community development.\nAnd—this will be my focus today—we carry out monetary policy to pursue two goals established by Congress: maximum employment and stable prices.\nProgress on inflation and the start of monetary policy normalization\nAs I’m sure you recall, inflation two years ago was much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. But as of mid-2022, prices had risen more than 7 percent since a year earlier. Soaring prices strained the budgets of families and businesses and had the potential to destabilize our economy over time.\n\nAt the same time, the labor market was incredibly strong—by many measures, unsustainably so. With companies adding jobs faster than the labor force was adding workers, wages surged. While those higher wages weren’t enough, for many workers, to keep pace with the cost of living, the wage pressures threatened to cause businesses to raise prices even more.\n\nThe FOMC responded by rapidly tightening monetary policy. We raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 5.25 percentage points from early 2022 through mid-2023. We also began running off securities holdings that we had accumulated to support the economy during the pandemic.\n\nThese measures helped bring the economy into much better balance. The most recent annual PCE inflation reading was 2.2 percent. Progress on inflation has been broad based; it’s not just a few outlying price categories that have cooled. You can see that in the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate, which removes outliers and has fallen from a peak of 5 percent two years ago to 2.67 percent on an annual basis in August. And, while the labor market remains healthy, it has cooled as well.\n\nIn light of this progress, I supported the FOMC’s decision last month to begin normalizing the stance of monetary policy by lowering the target range for the fed funds rate. Less-restrictive policy will help avoid cooling the labor market by more than is necessary to bring inflation back to target in a sustainable and timely way.\n\nThe path ahead\nTo recap, the economic and monetary policy picture today is entirely different from two years ago:\n\nInflation and the labor market are in striking distance of our goals rather than seriously overheated.\nAnd the policy rate is headed down rather than up.\nWhat haven’t changed are the key considerations I’m applying in thinking about the FOMC’s policy choices. First among those, of course, is my commitment to sustainably achieving both of our dual-mandate goals: maximum employment and stable prices. I also continue to carefully consider the risks and uncertainties we face. The appropriate policy strategy depends on whether the path ahead is clear or cloudy. And I continue to pay close attention to financial conditions and to the information I receive from business and community contacts and the Dallas Fed’s regional surveys. While the FOMC controls the overnight fed funds rate, households and businesses usually borrow at longer tenors. Understanding how our monetary policy stance translates to broader financial conditions and the day-to-day experiences of households and businesses is crucial for understanding the economic outlook and how monetary policy may need to respond.\n\nIn the rest of my remarks, I’ll share how I’m thinking about the economic outlook and upcoming monetary policy decisions in light of those considerations. I’ll discuss inflation and employment in turn. And I will argue that, following last month’s half-percentage-point cut in the fed funds rate, a more gradual path back to a normal policy stance will likely be appropriate from here to best balance the risks to our dual-mandate goals.\n\nInflation outlook and risks\nThe Fed’s inflation target is for overall inflation, including the prices of all consumer goods and services. But to get a handle on where overall inflation will head in the future, I like to focus on measures that exclude volatile outliers and unusual shocks, such as the Dallas Fed trimmed mean that I described earlier. The drop in the trimmed mean since 2022 demonstrates that we’ve reduced inflation for most goods and services. The trimmed mean has continued to move down recently, though progress has become more gradual. The 12-month measure remains somewhat elevated even as shorter-term trimmed mean measures have approached 2 percent.\n\nTo understand whether monetary policy is restrictive enough to return overall inflation all the way to 2 percent, I have been paying particular attention to the inflation component that economists refer to as “core services.” This category includes services other than those related to energy, which are usually quite volatile. Because services are generally produced flexibly and domestically, core services inflation is typically more responsive to U.S. economic conditions and helps assess how monetary policy is influencing price pressures.\n\nWhile measures of inflation for both housing services and other core services remain above their prepandemic levels, recent trends have been encouraging. I expect that a couple of factors will help bring these components down to levels consistent with 2 percent overall inflation over time. The stance of monetary policy is still restrictive and should continue to restrain demand for both housing and other services. And longer-term inflation expectations reflected in surveys and financial market prices remain close to our 2 percent target, anchoring decisions by price and wage setters.\n\nThe healing of supply chains since the pandemic has reduced inflation, too. Energy and food inflation, two categories that are susceptible to supply shocks, contributed to the inflation surge in 2021 and 2022 but are now holding down overall inflation. Core goods inflation has returned to its slightly negative prepandemic level. That’s a result not only of healthier supply chains but also of cooler goods demand.\n\nAll that said, while the upside risks to inflation have diminished, they have not vanished. I continue to see a meaningful risk that inflation could get stuck above our 2 percent goal.\n\nOne way such a scenario could play out would be if aggregate demand proves stronger than most forecasts currently assume. The ongoing resilience in consumption and gross domestic product (GDP) hint at the potential for unexpectedly strong demand, as do recent upward revisions to data on gross domestic income and the savings rate.\n\nFinancial conditions could also boost demand beyond what the economy can sustain. As I mentioned earlier, the fed funds target influences economic activity only indirectly, because most households and businesses pay longer-term interest rates that also reflect their creditworthiness. Financial conditions have eased notably from a year ago. Mortgage rates have dropped, equity prices are near all-time highs, and credit spreads are near historic lows. Even if the current assessment of demand is on target, an unwarranted further easing in financial conditions could boost spending and push aggregate demand out of balance with supply.\n\nThese risks suggest the FOMC should not rush to reduce the fed funds target to a “normal” or “neutral” level but rather should proceed gradually while monitoring the behavior of financial conditions, consumption, wages and prices.\n\nA related upside risk to inflation stems from uncertainty regarding what the “neutral” level of the federal funds rate even is. Besides examining broad financial conditions, economists often consider whether monetary policy is boosting or slowing growth and inflation by comparing the policy rate to a theoretical level that would represent neither a headwind nor a tailwind. That neutral rate is notoriously uncertain and difficult to measure. But you can get a sense for it from economic fundamentals, models, surveys and market prices. And all of these suggest the neutral rate may be higher than before the pandemic.\n\nStructural changes in the economy, like the energy transition and advances in artificial intelligence, are a prime driver. These developments are fueling strong investment demand as well as potential increases in productivity. You can see the changes in investment firsthand throughout Texas, in projects like the enormous liquefied natural gas plants under construction along the Gulf Coast, the semiconductor fabs encouraged by the CHIPS [Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors] Act, as well as new data centers and the energy sources to supply them.\n\nImportantly, though, uncertainty about the neutral rate has also risen, perhaps because these changes in the economy are quite recent and will take time to fully assess. The FOMC’s own projections display the uncertainty. Four times a year, we release our projections for the fed funds rate as well as unemployment, inflation and GDP growth. Around the FOMC table, participants’ projections for the longer-run fed funds rate now vary by more than 1 percentage point, compared with a spread less than half that wide two years ago. In this uncertain environment, lowering the policy rate gradually would allow time to judge how restrictive monetary policy may or may not be and reduce the risk of inadvertently boosting inflation by bringing the policy rate below its neutral level.\n\nFinally, I remain attentive to inflation risks from supply chains and geopolitical developments. I am closely watching the aftermath of the recent strike at the Port of Houston and other Gulf Coast and East Coast ports. The Dallas Fed’s contacts tell us the three-day work stoppage isn’t likely to leave a lasting mark on supply chains. But workers and port operators have agreed to revisit their contract in January, so risks remain. I am also closely watching the conflict in the Middle East. As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said, while the human toll is devastating, the Federal Reserve’s institutional role is a limited one: to monitor the economic implications. U.S. and global energy markets are currently somewhat slack, which has held down risk premiums in oil markets. However, the potential for more significant disruptions and price impacts cannot be ruled out.\n\nEmployment outlook and risks\nTurning to the employment side of the FOMC’s dual mandate, labor markets appear close to balanced. Job gains have slowed from their torrid pace two years ago. However, as the most recent employment report showed, firms are continuing to hire workers across a broad range of sectors. The unemployment rate has risen from historic lows. It averaged 4.2 percent over the past three months, which is near or just below most experts’ judgments of the rate consistent with stable inflation.\n\nStill, the labor market remains healthy. There are more job openings than unemployed workers nationally. The rise in unemployment over the past year is due mainly to labor force growth and slower hiring rather than more people losing jobs. Layoffs and initial claims for unemployment insurance remain low.\n\nStrong consumption and investment growth continue to support the job market. Real GDP grew at a 3 percent annual rate, seasonally adjusted, in the second quarter. Timely measures of economic activity, such as the Dallas Fed’s Weekly Economic Index and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker, suggest strong growth in the third quarter as well. And results from the Dallas Fed’s most recent Texas Business Outlook Surveys indicate that firms generally expect activity to remain solid over the next six months. \n\nNonetheless, as the labor market has cooled, we face more risk that it will cool beyond what is needed to sustainably return inflation to 2 percent or that the employment situation may even deteriorate abruptly.\n\nAssessing the labor market risks is challenging because the data are unusually uncertain of late. Over the summer, the Bureau of Labor Statistics significantly lowered its estimates of payroll job growth through last March, due largely to changing estimates of how many businesses have formed or closed. The bureau could further revise the figures as additional benchmarking data become available. Faster immigration, meanwhile, makes it more difficult to precisely judge the rate of job growth that’s consistent with a stable labor market. And because it takes time for new immigrants to integrate into the labor market, they could temporarily raise the unemployment rate even if the market remains strong. Storms and strikes, meanwhile, will complicate the interpretation of this month’s jobs report. In light of these uncertainties, just as with inflation, I believe the FOMC can best balance the labor market risks for now by normalizing policy gradually—neither waiting too long to act nor moving too quickly and risking going too far.\n\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the economy is much closer to sustainably achieving the FOMC’s goals of maximum employment and price stability now than it was two years ago. The changes in the economy call for a different stance of monetary policy. But the considerations I’m applying in assessing the appropriate stance remain the same:\n\nA strong commitment to sustainably achieving both parts of the FOMC’s dual mandate—maximum employment and stable prices.\nCareful consideration of how the risk environment affects our strategy.\nAnd attention to how monetary policy transmits through broader financial conditions and ultimately influences the economic lives of households and businesses.\nAs I consider the economic statistics, financial conditions, and reports from business and community contacts, two takeaways stand out to me. First, the economy is strong and stable. But second, meaningful uncertainties remain in the outlook. Downside risks to the labor market have increased, balanced against diminished but still real upside risks to inflation. And many of these risks are complex to assess and measure. As we complete the return to price stability and a well-balanced labor market, the path ahead is cloudy, not clear.\n\nIf the economy evolves as I currently expect, a strategy of gradually lowering the policy rate toward a more normal or neutral level can help manage the risks and achieve our mandated goals. It should go without saying, though, that the future is uncertain. Any number of shocks could influence what that path to normal will look like, how fast policy should move and where rates should settle. Policy should not follow a preset course. In my view, the FOMC will need to remain nimble and willing to adjust if appropriate.\n\nThank you.\n\n"

    "text": "Good morning. Thank you for joining us for the second day of our conference on technology-enabled disruption.\n\nThis is the fifth conference on this topic in a series organized by the Atlanta, Dallas and Richmond Federal Reserve Banks. And the conversations among business leaders, scholars and policymakers remain as dynamic and important as ever.\n\nThe disruptive potential of technology has been unusually noticeable just in the short time since the previous conference in the series last October. After many years of relatively under-the-radar research, generative artificial intelligence [AI] exploded onto the public scene last November with the release of ChatGPT and, soon afterward, a number of competitors.\n\nThese remarkable new tools are already changing how companies provide customer service, how software developers write code, how college professors grade essays and even how art is made. However, you will be glad—I think—to know that the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy statements are still written entirely by humans.\n\nOne wonders whether, years from now, we’ll look back at the time between this conference and the last one as a critical turning point—a time when we first truly saw a technology that, with its capacity to perform so many activities once thought of as uniquely human, may fundamentally reorient the human endeavor. Or will it turn out, instead, that generative AI is just another tool, an important one to be sure, but no more profoundly transformative or disruptive than other important technological tools?\n\nIn the financial sector, too, the disruption of technology has been quite volatile. We’ve seen in recent months how the combination of the rapid spread of information and the speed of financial transactions in the digital age puts a premium on banks’ effective management of liquidity risk. To bankers in the audience, I’d highlight a message from remarks I made at the Texas Bankers Association last week. In this new environment, I believe every bank should be fully prepared to borrow from the Federal Reserve’s discount window and to test its use regularly, including moving collateral between the Fed and the FHLBs [Federal Home Loan Banks]. It’s a sign your bank is strong, manages risk well and is fully prepared to serve your customers’ needs.\n\nAs authorities continue to learn from the recent episode, it will be valuable to examine how supervision and regulation can best take operational readiness into consideration. For example, an expectation that banks establish and regularly test the discount window access could help make individual firms and the financial system more resilient. Unlike requirements for banks to hold more liquid assets, an expectation for discount window readiness would allow banks to engage as much as always in the traditional business of banking—taking deposits and making loans—that is so critical to our economy. Also, if all banks regularly tested their discount window access, the traditional stigmas associated with borrowing from the Fed would be further reduced.\n\nThere is more here the Fed can do, too. Looking forward, the Fed should also consider expanding the hours of operation for critical services like the discount window. Our liquidity backstop should be available whenever banks might need it. As liquidity increasingly becomes a 24/7/365 business, that could come to include nights, weekends and holidays.\n\nThis morning, though, I’ll focus on another aspect of innovation in financial services that hasn’t gotten as many headlines as liquidity stresses but may be more transformative in the long run. That is how the Federal Reserve is advancing innovation in payments. I’ll then turn the stage over to our experts on technological disruption. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\n\nFedNow\nThe Federal Reserve operates part of the nation’s payment system—a mission that is sometimes less visible than our work on monetary policy, financial stability and community economic development but is just as fundamental to the strength of the nation’s economy.\n\nThe latest addition to the Fed’s payments infrastructure is the FedNow service—a new instant payments service that the Fed is developing and will begin to roll out in July. FedNow will enable financial institutions of all sizes, in every community, to provide safe and efficient instant payment services for their depositors. Through institutions that use FedNow, people and businesses will be able to send and receive payments in real time. Recipients will have full and immediate access to funds. And the service will be available around the clock and every day of the year.\n\nThroughout my career, increased speed has been a key theme in financial services innovation. Algorithms that trade in fractions of a second have replaced voice-brokered and open-outcry markets. The settlement cycle for stock trades shortened to two business days from three in 2017 and is scheduled next year to shorten again to one day. The special fleet of airplanes that moved paper checks around the country for processing has now been almost entirely replaced by much faster image processing, and the total volume of checks processed by the Federal Reserve is down more than 80 percent from the peak three decades ago as people convert to electronic payments.\n\nBroadly available instant payments are the latest step in this push for speed, both in the United States and around the world. Of course, wire transfers between financial institutions are instantaneous and have been possible for decades. But enabling consumers and businesses to instantaneously make direct payments to one another is much newer and potentially transformative.\n\nThe private sector has created a number of options for instant payments—including tools built on existing payment rails as well as entirely new rails.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the Federal Reserve has the public responsibility of ensuring payment services are available and accessible to all depository institutions. That responsibility has been central to our work on many forms of payments over time. And as the world moves toward faster payments, we are taking that commitment to this new type of service. I see our commitment to ensuring broad and fair access as increasingly important in maintaining a diverse, vibrant banking ecosystem amid long-term trends toward consolidation.\n\nFedNow will be the public option for financial institutions to support instant payments for their customers. This new payment rail will work alongside private sector rails, but the key is that this rail will ensure broad access. All types of depository institutions will have the option to use it—from the largest money-center banks to the smallest banks and credit unions in rural communities.\n\nSome of the use cases for instant payments are already familiar, like using an app to instantly split a restaurant bill with a friend or getting paid immediately for your work instead of waiting for a paycheck.\n\nBut those familiar use cases are not why I see FedNow as potentially transformative. What’s transformative is that broad access to this new service is likely to foster all kinds of innovations that we haven’t even thought of yet.\n\nWhen email first became available to the general public, it didn’t seem like such a big deal to many of us. We thought it was just fine if a letter or bill took a few days to arrive through the mail. But once email was widely available, we discovered the power of immediate communication. Similarly, I expect that broad access to instant payments will enable people to invent all kinds of valuable new use cases that, today, we may not even imagine. And I think broad access is critical here because those great ideas could come from anywhere—any bank or any customer.\n\nSo that FedNow can achieve that transformative potential, I’m focused on making sure it is indeed accessible to the financial institutions that want to use it. Many smaller banks use third-party service providers known as core processors to connect to payments services. The Federal Reserve is working with core processors and other third-party technology providers to ensure banks will have the support they need to use FedNow.\n\nIt will take time to get all of the nation’s depository institutions set up for a change of this magnitude. We are rolling out FedNow in July with some early adopters. And then we will continue working with institutions on a rolling basis. Broad access must remain the goal so the country can harness the full benefits of this innovation.\n\nConcluding remarks\nLet me conclude by briefly previewing this morning’s sessions.\n\nAs we can see in the work of the Federal Reserve and depository institutions to create and connect to FedNow, technological innovation requires investment. That can be large-scale financial investment by a business. Or the smaller-scale— but still very meaningful—investment of a person working late, lonely hours to pursue their idea for making a better future.\n\nIn either case, investments in innovation are forward-looking decisions. They rely on the innovator’s belief that the investment will ultimately pay a return.\n\nMacroeconomic and global uncertainty can challenge that belief. In a world of pandemics, wars and economic volatility, one could forgive the innovator for being a little less confident in earning a future return. Yet a world of pandemics, wars and economic volatility is quite likely a world that needs more innovation—not less.\n\nThis morning, we will hear how business leaders and researchers resolve, or at least think about, that dilemma. Our speakers include executives from real estate, health care and banking, as well as scholars of firm dynamics, finance, economic growth, and research and development. It is a testament to the importance of research to the future of the economy that there are researchers who research research! I know we’ll all learn a lot from these discussions.\n\nThanks to all of our speakers for sharing your expertise with us. And thanks to all of you for joining us here today."

    "text": "Good afternoon.\n\nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, I would like to extend a warm welcome to each of you. I’m required to give the official disclaimer that these are my views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues, but on the warm welcome at least, I think we are unanimous.\n\nI am so happy you joined us for a deep dive into a vital part of the financial system: bank funding.\n\nI’m a big believer in the power of diverse ideas and open debate. To properly discuss this topic—or really any important economic or financial issue—we need to hear a wide range of perspectives. That includes the voices of policymakers, academic researchers and especially experts working in the field, in this case, bankers. At the Dallas Fed, we are working to build a strong economy together, so we greatly appreciate all of you joining us from across the nation to engage in these conversations. This is our second annual conference on bank funding, and I know the discussions will only get deeper and richer as we continue each year.\n\nI’m also delighted to welcome my dear colleagues from the Cleveland and Atlanta Feds, Beth Hammack and Raphael Bostic. It’s always a privilege to spend time with Beth and Raphael, either at our Federal Open Market Committee meetings in Washington or anywhere else. I’m pleased we are sponsoring this conference together, and I look forward to hearing their views during their fireside chat tomorrow.\n\nBanking is crucial to our economy, and funding is crucial to banking.\n\nBy taking deposits and making loans, banks enable customers to safely save money and finance investments that grow their families, businesses and communities.\n\nA vibrant banking ecosystem ensures that customers of all kinds can find banks that meet their needs.\n\nAnd funding is at the center of this business, because funding is how a bank receives excess cash from customers who have it and transforms that cash into a loan that fuels investment and economic growth.\n\nFunding can take many forms, from small retail deposits to wholesale debt. That variety both helps banks meet their evolving needs and supports a variety of banking business models.\n\nBanks have the preeminent responsibility for managing their own funding and funding risks. However, government policies do affect the funding environment for banks.\n\nI’d highlight two policy issues that will be a focus this afternoon.\n\nFirst, the Fed’s primary credit program allows healthy banks to borrow at the discount window against good collateral. Alongside other contingent funding sources, the discount window can be an important component of banks’ overall plans for ensuring they have strong access to liquidity and can effectively serve their customers across economic and market environments. The Federal Reserve banks have been streamlining and modernizing discount window operations so we can most efficiently and effectively serve banks when they come to borrow. Among those efforts, we are working to enhance coordination with the Federal Home Loan Banks, particularly for managing collateral. I look forward to hearing perspectives during the conference on how the operational improvements to date are working and what more we might do to make the discount window more operationally effective for depository institutions.\n\nSecond, deposit insurance underpins the stability of bank funding by reassuring depositors their money is safe. Unfortunately, there is not currently a level playing field for deposit insurance. The public has a perception that the government will bail out too-big-too-fail banks and protect all the depositors at these giant firms. Meanwhile, at community banks, deposits are insured only up to the $250,000 limit. In normal times, customers are confident in their banks’ safety, and the insurance limit may not make much difference. But when stress emerges, customers want safety above all else, and they’ve sometimes run to the biggest banks. Or customers increasingly use reciprocal deposits, which offer added insurance but cost banks money and create operational and other risks. The unlevel playing field between community banks and too-big-to-fail giants undermines the vibrant, competitive banking ecosystem that our economy needs. There have been a variety of proposals for deposit insurance reform, and I’ll be interested to hear discussions on what steps might work best.\n\nThe dialogue today and tomorrow will also examine how new technology is changing depositors’ behavior and the role of bank supervision. I’m excited about this agenda and so glad you all could join us. Please enjoy your lunch, and at 1:15 p.m. we’ll begin the conference program in the auditorium."
