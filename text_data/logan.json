    "text": "The below transcript has been republished from Macro Musings , a podcast hosted by David Beckworth of the Mercatus Center. Listen to the podcast episode .\n\nDavid Beckworth: Lorie, welcome to the show.\n\nLorie Logan: David, thanks for having me. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nBeckworth: Well, it's a real treat for me, and I know my listeners will also really enjoy having you on the program today. We are recording this January 5th, and as it turns out, Lorie, the minutes from the December FOMC meeting just came out, and I was reading them before I got on the show here with you.  And I read a paragraph that was all about you. I'm reading a paragraph that says, \"In discussing recently established backstop facilities, the manager noted continued progress.\" And it goes on to talk about the standard repo facility and the FEMA repo facility. I'm like, \"Hey, that's Lorie. I'm going to be speaking to Lorie today.\"\n\nBeckworth: So, it's a real honor for me, and I know many of my listeners as well, to get you on this show. Because we talk about this stuff a lot, but to get someone who's actually on the front lines, who's actually doing it. Wow. What a real treat for us. So, thank you for coming on the show. Okay. Lorie, maybe you can tell us a little bit about yourself. How did you get to where you are? What is your career journey like? Any lessons learned along the way?\n\nLogan: Well, thanks. And again, David, it's great to be here. I've had a strong interest in public service and public policy from a young age, which I think was inspired by my family's involvement in local politics, growing up in a small town in Kentucky. And then later fostered by experiences studying political science at Davidson College and later at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.  And it was at Columbia that I was first introduced to global economic policy issues and opportunities at the Fed. And since then, I spent over 20 years, nearly my entire career, in the Markets Group at the New York Fed, deepening my own understanding of the financial system and working to make monetary policy implementation more effective.\n\nLogan: I started off in 2000 as a trader analyst, reporting on financial market developments and executing domestic operations on the government securities desk. And it was this real-time interaction of analysis and trading that provided an incredible opportunity to learn and to work at the intersection of public policy and financial markets. And I still love those aspects of what I do today. My time in the Markets Group has been marked with periods of accelerated learning. I was on the desk and involved with the historic lending in the securities lending program on September 11th. I crafted plans for liquidity facilities and the large scale asset purchases during the global financial crisis, and led development of the overnight RRP facility to support interest rate control after the GFC. And these experiences deepened my perspective, and over time I grew into increasing leadership positions.\n\nLogan: Two years ago, I was appointed to the SOMA manager role, where I'm now responsible for implementing the FOMCs policy directives and managing the system's $8 trillion securities portfolio. And this involves overseeing open market operations and reporting on financial markets at each of the FOMC meeting minutes. And you heard about that in the minutes that were released today. And working at the Fed has just been an incredible experience. I've had the privilege of serving in a mission-driven organization, one that's focused on making the economy stronger and the financial system more stable for all. And to me, that's especially grounding each day. And I get to do it with an amazing group of people.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. I want to talk about that group of people in a minute, but just going back to your experience, you were there from 2000 to the present. So, you've seen a lot, as you mentioned. You have a lot of institutional knowledge inside of yourself, a lot of human capital for the New York Fed, and you were there for 9/11. And I'm just wondering, what was it like to go through that? Did you have to shut down the office? Were you there working through it? What was it like at that time? Because you're pretty close to the location of the Twin Towers.\n\nLogan: That was just an incredibly difficult experience, and very early on in my tenure at the New York Fed. We were very close to the towers and it was both a difficult time personally and professionally for me and for all those that I was working with. I was there that day, and it was a difficult day to participate in the operations that we did to support market function, and was difficult in the days after. But at that time, I really learned what it means to be a part of the central bank and the role and responsibility of the central bank to be open and available to provide liquidity when the financial market needs it most.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. Very harrowing experience for sure. Well, let's talk about your group at the New York Fed. You oversee a lot, and I'm just looking off your bio here. I see four different roles and this may understate what you actually do, but let me list them off and you can correct me if I'm wrong or add to the list.  But one of your roles is, and you mentioned this already, but the execution of monetary policy for the FOMC. Number two, provision of fiscal agent services to the US Treasury Department and support of its debt issuance and foreign exchange operations. Three, analysis of global financial market developments. And four, production of the New York Fed's reference rates, including the SOFR. So, you do a lot. And in each of those, I guess bullet points, you have a lot of things you could unpack underneath that. Is that list a comprehensive list or is there more you would add to that?\n\nDay-to-Day Operations at the New York Fed\n\nLogan: Well, those are all the things that we do on the trading desk, which is a part of the Markets Group at the New York Fed. In addition to those activities, the Markets Group also, like each of the reserve banks, executes the discount window and also provides financial services for other or central banks. But as the SOMA manager, I'm responsible for overseeing policy implementation analysis. And to do that, I lead a large team of traders and analysts and policy advisors with a real range of backgrounds in finance, economics and policy. So, maybe I'd to share a little bit about my day-to-day and how that looks, most days, and also how that changes over time.\n\nLogan: In terms of my day-to-day, I think my kids, who've had just a really unique and front row seat as we've been working remotely during the pandemic, describe it best. They say my day starts very early and is jam-packed with meetings. And I think that's pretty accurate. My day does begin early. Often starting on an international call before 7:00 AM, but some staff come in even earlier around 4:00 to begin monitoring overseas markets. And then we all come together each morning at 9:05 to discuss our operations and how we're interpreting markets.\n\nLogan: It's an important meeting for me, and it's a meeting that's been held at that time for decades. At that meeting, I typically have my eye on how effectively our operations are working. And I'm also thinking broadly about markets, trying to put what the team is seeing in the context of the FOMCs goals. And then the rest of my day is typically spent in meetings geared toward helping the group achieve on its mission. We run a big operation to manage the portfolio. There's a lot of deliberation and planning to ensure the operations run smoothly and that we communicate about them clearly. And I also spend a significant amount of time with our board colleagues in DC, and then with policymakers, about bigger picture implementation strategy decisions.\n\nLogan: We also to maintain a broad range of external relationships. And a lot of my time is focused on those relationships, and with other central bank colleagues, to share implementation experiences and to really learn from each other.  The most important part of my time though is spent on our people and what they need to be successful. I manage a large team, as I said, and work to ensure that we understand our evolving priorities and that the team's working well. We certainly faced some tough challenges recently, as we've shifted to a remote virtual environment, and that's going to be a continued focus as we develop new ways of doing our work after the pandemic.\n\nBeckworth: Well, let's say there's a crisis emerging, let's say for example, repo panic 2019. You see things unfolding, do you have the power to go ahead and do something, or do you have to call the FOMC first and get authority from them? Are you empowered at some level to respond to market developments?\n\nLogan: As you noted, there are definitely periods when we have to organize our time to be more responsive to these evolving developments. And in those times, the structure of the day is quite similar, but we're in this crisis management mode, and the pace accelerates. The decisions that we're making are more complex and made with less information, but we do make them with an eye to flexibility so we can learn and adapt quickly. And really depends on the environment that we're in at the time, which decisions we make directly on the desk and which we are making at the direction of the FOMC. In each FOMC meeting, the committee issues a directive to the desk, which gives us instructions on how to implement monetary policy, so some of those decisions are ones that we make be at the direction from that particular directive for the intermediate period. And then there's others that might be unusual that we may want to recommend. And those may require a change in the directive or an actual committee vote in between meetings. So it really depends on the environment we're in.\n\nBeckworth: Okay. I want to move on to actual developments and what you have done over the past few years, particularly what happened in March, 2020. Before we do that, go one last question about the New York Fed. And this is a less serious question. But I'm sure you've seen Die Hard with a Vengeance , the movie where the Die Hard character ends up at the New York Fed. And these people try to steal gold from the New York Fed. Is the gold still there? Have you visited the gold down in the basement of the New York Fed?\n\nLogan: Well, I'm certain the gold's still there. I haven't actually been in the building in a bit of time, David.\n\nBeckworth: Okay.\n\nLogan: Given the pandemic, but I know it's still there and it is a really interesting tour to do. My middle son actually is the one who's been able to do that tour with me. And it's been a real highlight for him. And hopefully we'll be back in the building and my other kids will get the chance to do the tour, too.\n\nBeckworth: Very nice. All right. So you've given a lot of talks on what happened in March 2020. The “Dash For Cash” as it's called. A number of talks. You were a part of the Fed's response to it. And I was hoping you could summarize for us your view of what happened during that period.\n\nThe \"Dash for Cash\" and Subsequent Policy Response\n\nLogan: So perhaps I'll take a step back and first talk about what we observed at the time. And then turn to how we responded. So in first, in terms of what we observed, we first saw changes in financial markets early in 2020. Equity markets globally were volatile, responding to the virus that was spreading quickly. By late February, as more cases were confirmed in the US, conditions began to decline quite rapidly. I think it's really important to first emphasize the magnitude of the shock that financial markets were absorbing in early 2020. At the time, the economy had been experiencing relatively steady economic growth. And over the course of just a few weeks, market participants became concerned that large parts of the economy could completely shut down, potentially creating a historic recession. And additionally, market participants were also highly concerned that the financial system itself might not function properly in a remote environment.\n\nLogan: The infrastructure of the global financial system is complex. It's interconnected. There are dependencies all over along the chain of the transactions. So while the financial system itself ultimately made that transition relatively smoothly, that was not an outcome, I think, many thought possible at the time. So the result was just extreme volatility as financial assets repriced to reflect these developments. And there was also a broad base dash for cash as investors sought the safety of cash. Even Treasury securities, which are usually seen as the most liquid of financial assets, were being sold broadly to raise dollars. And so this shift was really unprecedented. Unprecedented in its scale and in its scope, and resulted in severe disruptions across financial markets and had the potential to make economic conditions even worse by cutting off the flow of credit to households and businesses that were most vulnerable.\n\nLogan: So how did we respond? Well, over the first few weeks in March, our operations transitioned from business as usual to managing an unprecedented pandemic. By early March, we had already put the staff in a heightened monitoring stance, and had taken steps to increase the size and lengthen the tenor of repo operations. And you'd asked earlier, are there decisions that you can make directly on the desk? And those are two examples of ones that we can make directly. However, the conditions continue to worsen and to broaden. And so, to me, the turning point was March 12th. And it was on that day where we took more aggressive action. First, we offered almost unlimited amounts of funding through the repos. And then later that day, to help alleviate the strains in Treasury cash markets, we announced a shift in our purchases of Treasury bills to purchase across the Treasury coupon curve.\n\nLogan: And that's an example where we actually needed approval from the chair to make that type of decision. So right there, just that one day, you can see the different types of decisions that we make and the authorities that we have. My own sense was that these moves would help stem the dysfunction. But by the end of the day, we were already seeing significant one way flows and conditions continue to worsen. And we could see that in just a broad set of metrics that we were monitoring. So very late that night, we conferenced again with the team to assess whether more aggressive actions were needed, what options we could put on the table, and then whether we could make those options operationally feasible within such a short window of time because we needed to implement whatever recommendation we'd be putting forward that next morning.\n\nLogan: So after a very lengthy call, we decided to recommend that we pull forward an entire month's worth of Treasury purchases into a single day. Such an aggressive option we hoped would signal that we were prepared to take the actions needed to maintain functioning. And so that discussion was really when I realized we were in an unprecedented environment. Just the extraordinary demand for cash was creating conditions that required us to respond with unmatched size and speed. And ultimately, the FOMC announced an unbounded commitment to support market function. And we met daily from that point on about how many and which Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities to buy. And of course, the Fed also took a broad range of other actions to stem dysfunction across markets, including the FX swap lines with foreign central banks, and also a broad range of liquidity and credit facilities. And it was the combination of these actions, I think, that were successful at supporting the flow of credit in such an uncertain time. And I just want to emphasize that all of this was done by staff working from home.\n\nLogan: Many of them amazing working at home for the first time. And the conditions were quite challenging. And we're always investing in operational readiness, and we'd had virtual capabilities. But we had never operated from home to this extent. So this was a new experience for us and for all of our counterparties. And I'm still in awe of what the team was really able to achieve in those early days.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. A very amazing story there. And I think it's important for us to do the counterfactual. What if the New York Fed hadn't stepped in? I mean the global dollar funding markets are so large, they're global, as you mentioned. And if you hadn't stepped in, it could have been a really horrible outcome, another financial crisis like we saw in 2008, or worse. And so the demands on your staff, I imagine, just are going to grow over time as global dollar funding markets grow as well. I also want to come back to this, maybe an idea of what was this crisis? And from my perspective, and correct me if I'm wrong, the dash for cash was more of a plumbing issue than a fundamental fiscal solvency issue of the US government. It was just people trying to liquidate positions or get into some of their asset and they couldn't. The plumbing was constrained, maybe even cracked or broken. Is that a fair way to analogize what happened?\n\nLogan: I think the experience really underscored the fact that, while the Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid in the world, there are some underlying fragilities. So I think that's what you're referring to. Of course, the pandemic represented as shock of such magnitude that I think even the most resilient market likely would've experienced disruptions. But we've also seen disruptions to Treasury market functioning in more benign environments. And here I'm thinking back to October, 2014 or September, 2019. And sometimes, with those, there was a seemingly little trigger. So I do think, given the importance of this [Treasury] market, financing the government and in supporting the implementation of monetary policy, that it's critical that we take steps to enhance the plumbing and resiliency of the market. So I do think that is a big focus of the work that we're doing on the desk and the inner agency working group on Treasury markets is really focused on.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. I read that report preparing for the show. The inner agency working group for market surveillance from, I guess, November last year. And also, there's been the Brookings Task Force on Financial Stability, Group of Thirty. A lot of great pieces coming out explaining what's going on. And a lot of them have common suggestions for improving. And let me just throw them out there and let me know what you think. So one of them is increased central clearing in the Treasury market. Another is a standing repo facility. And we can kind of check that one off, that's already been adopted. And then several others tweak the supplemental leverage ratio and then better data. But let me just start with the first one, then maybe go one by one. Central clearing, do you see an important role for that moving forward?\n\nThe Role of Central Clearing Moving Forward\n\nLogan: I do. And maybe just before jumping into those potential changes to improve their resiliency. Maybe I could highlight just a couple of themes from my own experience. And I think that we've seen across studies that you mentioned, because I think it's those vulnerabilities that these different proposals will need to be addressing. And I think that'll help us evaluate them as we talk about it. I really think there are four themes that have resonated with my own experience from the studies that we've seen come out. One common theme is that the US Treasury market has grown so much and it's really outpaced the growth in dealer intermediation capacity. Another change in the Treasury market is the growth of electronic trading and non-dealer intermediaries.\n\nLogan: Some electronic markets have high frequency trading and very limited customer interaction. And as a result, participants are less likely to continue engaging in this market when volatility increases. And the third is the proliferation of trading venues and settlement mechanisms that have also created some fragmentation in the market structure. And I think, and result in more frictions across markets, particularly in times of stress. And we saw this play out in March and in April of 2020. And then finally, even as the market becomes more complex and interconnected, real-time data on positions and flows in the US treasuries is still pretty limited. And that reduces visibility for both market participants and for the official sector. So I think as we look at these different proposals, it's important to keep in mind these vulnerabilities because I think we want to be addressing these directly.\n\nLogan: And as you noted, several have put forward some recommendations and the IAWG in particular has said that they would focus on five. Those are improving resilience of market intermediation, improving data quality, evaluating expanded central clearing, enhancing trading venue transparency and oversight, and then finally assessing effects of fund leverage and liquidity risk management practices. And I think the key point I'd make in listing these work streams is that it's very unlikely that there's a standalone solution. I think these are all complimentary efforts. And I think the goal is to ensure that the US Treasury market is as resilient as possible using the combination of these changes that have been proposed. So some of the ones you noted central clearing, the SLR, the standing repo facility are all complimentary in that regard. But I do think we need to stay focused on a package of changes and not get too focused on any one proposal in particular.\n\nBeckworth: Well, one of those proposals has come through, come to fruition and that's the standing repo facility. I guess it was last year that the FOMC made that one official as well as making the FIMA repo facility permanent. Tell us a little bit about the standing repo facility. I've been a fan of this idea for some time. I've had some people on the show to talk about it, but what do you see it doing moving forward?\n\nThe Future of the Standing Repo Facility\n\nLogan: Well, I do think the decision on the standing repo facility and also the FIMA repo facility, which the committee voted on at the same time was a very historic decision with respect to the framework, and one that the committee deliberated on for some time. These facilities were implemented to support effective policy implementation by limiting the potential for pressures in repo or in global dollar funding markets to spill back to the Fed funds market. In recent years, we've observed that pressures in money markets can emerge rapidly and with little warning. And we saw that in September 2019, and again in March 2020. And since pressures in these overnight markets can be difficult to predict and are harder to tamp down once they emerge, I too do think that a key benefit is their ability to help mitigate rate pressures before they develop into these larger disruptions.\n\nLogan: And this should enhance market confidence and help to limit those pressures from building, even if the facilities end up being little used. So while not the primary objective of the facilities, I think having these backstops in financing markets can also have important positive effects for the treasury market functioning more generally. Certainly, the SRF reduces the potential for disruptions in Treasury repo markets to then hinder the dealer's ability to make markets in the Treasury cash market. And the FIMA repo facility can help reduce sales of Treasury securities by the FIMA accounts by providing them with this temporary liquidity against their holdings.\n\nLogan: Now, of course, these repo facilities alone won't prevent all types of pressures on the Treasury market to the extent that limits on intermediation capacity or sales of Treasury securities are happening for factors other than the need for temporary liquidity. Repo won't fully substitute for outright sales of securities, but they can meaningfully I think limit the potential for disruptions. It is a very important development, not only for our monetary policy implementation framework, but also for the Treasury market resiliency efforts that we're working on.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah, it was interesting to read today in the FOMC minutes from the December 2021 meeting that several participants said, hey, this standing repo facility will make tapering easier. It may even affect the final destination, the final size of the balance sheet if people can easily substitute between treasuries and reserves. If they know that's there, that confidence will make the transition to whatever your final target may be an easier path. So interesting to see that happen. And again, great timing for the minutes to come out as we are recording this show. And that's a nice segue to the next thing I want to talk about, and that's the Fed's balance sheet. You mentioned already, it's 8 trillion plus, and the FOMC has announced… or it is already tapering. And I know you can't speak to policy, but I'll just say from my side, it appears from the minutes today that there's going to be some QT or actual runoff occurring this year. And I'm just curious from your perspective, how does that work? How would we see your office, the Federal Reserve in general, do balance sheet reduction?\n\nAsset Purchases and the Process of Balance Sheet Reduction\n\nLogan: Well, maybe it's useful just to take a step back and talk about the asset purchases themselves as a standard tool in the Fed’s tool kit and how those work mechanically, and then come back to mechanically how they work as we begin to slow that process and ultimately decrease the size of the balance sheet. As I said, the asset purchases have become a standard tool in the toolkit to provide accommodation when short term interest rates are near zero. And in terms of the mechanics, I think about them working in a couple of ways. First, they work through the portfolio balance channel. When the Fed or the desk purchases securities from our counterparties, it raises the price of these securities and then lowers their yields. And those counterparties who sold securities to us may then rebalance their own portfolios to invest in other assets, lowering yields broadly, and then easing financial conditions.\n\nLogan: So that's the first channel we tend to think about these working. And the second one is a signaling channel. Asset purchases can signal that the Fed's committed to maintaining accommodated conditions and is unlikely to thereby raise the Fed funds rate for some length of time, and this also reduces yields by lowering the expected path of policy rates. And in periods of stress, such as that we saw in the pandemic, asset purchases can also restore market functioning and reduce risk premia that could otherwise increase yields. And this was a key benefit of the purchases early in the pandemic. So the overall goal again is to lower long term interest rates and keep credit flowing to the economy. And since the onset of the pandemic, the desk has been directed by the committee to purchase significant amounts of treasuries and agency MBS.\n\nLogan: And our assessment is that they've been very effective at easing financial conditions and generally supporting the recovery. And as you noted at the December meeting, the committee decided to accelerate the taper of these asset purchases. And this action was prompted by a rapidly strengthening labor market and currently elevated inflationary pressures and Chair Powell noted that a quicker conclusion of asset purchases would better position policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes. So our focus on the desk is on executing this reduction in the pace of asset purchases and to do so smoothly for the FOMC. And so far, I think this has gone well, and we haven't observed any challenges associated with the decline and purchase amounts. But of course, whereas I said always monitoring developments and keeping an eye towards effects there.\n\nLogan: Now, at some point when the current level of accommodation is no longer necessary to achieve the committee's goals, the committee's going to want to reduce the size of the Fed's balance sheet and unwinding these measures demonstrates that this important tool is used when needed. But importantly, it can be withdrawn once the committee's goals are achieved. And we do have some experience with the mechanics of reducing the balance sheet. At the conclusion of the large scale asset purchase programs after the global financial crisis, the committee did undertake balance sheet normalization that lasted about two years. So in terms of the mechanics of that process, balance sheet normalization was conducted in a gradual manner and a predictable manner. I think those are the two key themes there. And there were two implementation elements to that. First, principle payments from our maturing securities were no longer reinvested and that reduces the balance sheet size. And in other words, it was an organic process. We didn't sell assets. And then the second mechanical feature was that caps were set on these monthly redemption amounts to ensure a steady decline.\n\nLogan: And I think overall this process, that process of natural maturities rather than sales and caps to ensure a steady pace seemed to work quite well. And at the December meeting, the committee did review this previous experience that it had with balance sheet normalization. And there were several aspects of that previous approach that the committee felt remained applicable. Maybe I'll just highlight a couple of those themes from the discussion and these were highlighted in the minutes. The first one I think is clear communications, you know, clear communications provided in advance of the policy decisions were viewed as helpful in setting expectations and enhancing understanding of the overall policy approach and the second was consistent with the previous normalization episode. Changes in the target range for the Fed funds rate were still seen to be the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy.\n\nLogan: Then third, using caps on these redemption amounts, the mechanical process I talked about, can ensure balance sheet reduction occurs in a measured and predictable manner. I think that was recognized as being a very useful approach. Then fourth, retaining flexibility to make adjustments to the approach was viewed as helpful in nimbly responding to economic and market conditions. Those were some of the common themes, I think, that were recognized in looking back at the previous experience. But there were also some differences, and the committee noted that the economic outlook is much stronger now than in the previous episode and that the balance sheet is much larger and that these differences would be taken to account when making decisions about the balance sheet. As the minutes and the chair noted, no decisions have been made. The FOMC is going to be discussing these balance sheet issues in coming meetings, and our focus on the desk will be working to support those deliberations.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. You've had the experience already of doing QT, or quantitative tightening, but still, this is not a trivial task, right? I mean, there's a lot of things you got to consider, as you mentioned. You got to do only so much or you allow the principal to run off. You got to control that. You got to gauge the stance of the economy. That's the conditional forecast. You got to worry about the TGA balance, right? What's the Treasury doing? You have all these moving parts that you have to control for. So you do have your work cut out for you when it comes to actually implementing this. It's not just  press a button on a keyboard, and then it's done. There's a lot of judgment, I guess, involved in this exercise.\n\nLogan: Well, I think there are a whole host of considerations that you outlined that the committee will be thinking about and exploring in the upcoming meetings. At some point, the desk will get a very clear directive from the committee about how to implement this policy normalization and balance sheet normalization process. That directive, I think, will be very transparent and clear in terms of the mechanics of what we'll need to do to deliver on that directive.\n\nBeckworth: Now, don't you have some blog posts coming out at the New York Fed related to this discussion of the Fed's balance sheet?\n\nLogan: We do. Next week, we'll be releasing a series of blog posts about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy implementation framework. The purpose of the series is to help talk about how the Federal Reserve implements policy today. We'll be looking at the implementation framework, the tools, interest on reserve balances in the overnight RRP facility in supporting that framework. We're going to talk a little bit about technical adjustments to interest on reserve balances and overnight RRP and how we've used technical adjustments to support policy implementation. Then a little bit more about this new backstop facility, the standing repo facility that we talked about earlier. So I'm excited about the series and hope the audience takes the opportunity to review them.\n\nBeckworth: We look forward to seeing it. So speaking of the Fed's balance sheet, there's this runoff that's likely to occur. The balance sheet will get smaller. There's some destination. Is it too soon to start thinking about where that destination is? Is that going to be determined by the FOMC? Let me rephrase the question this way. Will the FOMC come up with a dollar size for the Fed's balance sheet, or more general, we'll know we're there when we're there kind of framing for that journey?\n\nIs There an End Goal for the Fed’s Balance Sheet?\n\nLogan: Well, in terms of the future of the balance sheet, the committee has stated that it plans to continue to implement policy in an ample reserves regime or a floor system. So we'll talk more about that in the post that'll be released. This implies that the balance sheet will need to be maintained at a level that supplies ample reserves to the banking system. Reserves right now are very large. They're highly abundant or super abundant, so I expect the balance sheet could decline some way from here and still maintain an ample level of reserves. But I think the key point is that the long run size of the balance sheet is uncertain because banks' demand for reserves varies over time.\n\nLogan: At the December FOMC meeting, participants suggested that it will be important that we monitor money market conditions as reserves fall in order to assess the appropriate level of reserves to maintain ample conditions. Indeed, we do have a lot of money market data, which allows us to observe those conditions in money markets at a granular level. And we do have our experience from the prior normalization to help serve as a guide when assessing those reserve conditions. And we have the new standing repo facility in place as a backstop now, which wasn't the case during the prior normalization period. So I expect that the long run portfolio size will again be driven by demand for Federal Reserve liabilities consistent with maintaining an ample reserves regime. The exact level is something that's unknown and will be something that we'll be monitoring to determine as the balance sheet declines.\n\nBeckworth: Well, I'm looking forward to this journey, and I'm especially looking forward to the role that the standing repo facility will play in this journey. Because as you said, it could affect how many reserves are demanded by the banks. In the few minutes we have left, Lorie, I want to ask about the framework you mentioned, ample reserves framework, or a floor operating system. We haven't touched on this. The overnight reverse repo facility, does that set the floor effectively for the rates and you could think of standing repo and discount rate being the ceiling, and you want the Fed funds rate somewhere between that? What role would the interest on reserves play in that system?\n\nThe Floor System and the Role of Interest on Reserves\n\nLogan: Well, just going back to 2019 when the FOMC adopted this framework for implementing policy, where they supply an ample supply of reserves that ensures the Fed's administered rates influence the Fed funds rate and other overnight rates. In a floor system, our job is to ensure that reserves are supplied to meet banks' needs for liquid balances and that the IORB and the overnight RRP are important features.\n\nLogan: Now in most economies, the interest on reserve balances would be enough to control interest rates. However in the US, banks are a smaller share of the financial system. So when the FOMC pursues policies such as asset purchases or lending like we've been doing since March 2020, expands the Fed's balance sheet, and banks can end up with more reserves than they're comfortable holding. So during these times, they lower the rates at which they take deposits, and the rates trade below IORB. So in order to enhance rate control, the overnight reverse repo facility was established, and this does place a floor under overnight rates by providing a range of money market participants, this other option.\n\nLogan: This really does two things. It improves investors' bargaining power in overnight markets, and it creates an alternative investment that can spread Federal Reserve liabilities beyond reserves that reduces the pressure on banks' balance sheets. The FOMC's been essentially operating with this floor system for many years now and using both IORB and the overnight RRP as key tools. That's turned out to be quite effective at controlling rates through a variety of environments.\n\nLogan: Recently, the overnight RRP has become a more important component of that framework, along with the growth in the Fed's balance sheet. Overnight RRP usage tends to grow when there are downward pressures on rates relative to IORB. This can happen when reserves are elevated and banks try to shed deposits or when the supply of short-term investments such as Treasury bills declines. In the current environment, we're seeing both of those elements. So the overnight RRP facility is particularly important now and a particularly attractive investment for money market participants. So we've seen the facility increase to record high levels. I think my main observation would just be that both IORB and overnight RRP are important components to the floor.\n\nBeckworth: Well with that, our time is up. Our guest today's been Lorie Logan. Lorie, thank you so much for coming on the show.\n\nLogan: David, thanks for having me. It's been a real pleasure and hope to be able to return some time soon.\n\nBeckworth: Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nI  want to thank the Money Marketeers of New York University for inviting me to  speak again today. 1 These events provide a valuable forum for  discussing the intersection of monetary policy implementation and money markets.\n\nWhen  I last spoke to this group in December 2020, there had been an historically rapid  expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet associated with actions taken  in response to the COVID-19 shock.  These  measures were highly effective at restoring market functioning and fostering  accommodative financial conditions, helping the U.S. economy recover from the  pandemic-related downturn.  At the same  time, they generated a significant increase in reserves supplied to the banking  system.  This year, even as the Federal  Reserve’s balance sheet expanded at a more gradual overall pace, growth in  Federal Reserve liabilities held by market participants—both in the form of  bank reserves and in overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility balances—accelerated,  and money market conditions shifted notably.\n\nIn  my last talk, I suggested that one of the key advantages of the Federal Open  Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) ample reserves operational framework is its flexibility,  allowing monetary policy to be implemented efficiently and effectively across a  range of environments.  Today, I would  like to share some observations on how the framework adapted to much higher  levels of liquidity this year and is working as intended to support control  over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates.  I also want to highlight changes the FOMC has  made in recent months to ensure the implementation framework continues to be  effective through different environments, even on occasions when shocks disrupt  markets.\n\nBefore  I continue, let me note that the views I express today are my own, and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nRecent Shifts In  Liquidity Have Been Historically Large, And Money Market Rates Declined…\n\nLet  me start with a brief review of the recent evolution of the Federal Reserve’s  balance sheet, and how this has influenced conditions in money markets.  In response to the COVID-19 shock, the Federal  Reserve, along with many other central banks, expanded its balance sheet to  support the smooth functioning of financial markets, and maintain the vital  flow of credit to households and businesses.   From March to December 2020, the Federal Reserve’s assets increased by roughly  $3 trillion, as shown in Figure 1 .\n\nThis  expansion in assets could have been accompanied by a commensurate increase in Federal  Reserve liabilities in the form of bank reserves. 2 However, concurrent with the growth in the  balance sheet in 2020, the U.S. Treasury’s General Account (TGA)—effectively  Treasury’s cash account at the Federal Reserve—rose dramatically.  Treasury increased the TGA to ensure  sufficient cash was available to support programs aimed at helping American households  and businesses weather the pandemic. 3 Growth in the TGA, as indicated in Figure 2 , limited  reserve growth associated with the balance sheet expansion.\n\nStarting  in mid-2020, the pace of net asset purchases slowed, and in December 2020 the  FOMC adopted guidance that it would continue to increase its holdings of  Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by at least  $120 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward  its economic goals. 4 However, even with this more steady pace of  balance sheet growth, Federal Reserve liabilities held by market  participants—in the form of reserves and ON RRP balances—increased sharply in  2021, as indicated on the right in Figure 2 .  This resulted from the dramatic $1.5 trillion decline  in the TGA since the beginning of the year. 5\n\nUnsurprisingly,  the increase in reserves resulted in downward pressure on overnight interest  rates—including the federal funds rate—relative to the interest on reserve  balances (IORB) rate. 6 As reserve balances rose, some banks  perceived a cost to expanding their balance sheets further and lowered their  deposit rates. 7 In response, depositors and other investors shifted  assets to money market mutual funds (money funds), which raised demand for  money market investments and put downward pressure on money market rates more  broadly.  On the year, government money  fund assets under management (AUM) have increased by over $320 billion, as  shown in Figure 3 .\n\nIt’s  important to note that at the same time demand for money market investments rose,  the net supply of U.S. Treasury bills—an essential investment for money funds  and other investors—fell by an historically large amount:  over $1.2 trillion so far in 2021, as  indicated in Figure 3 .  This combination  of increased liquidity and reduced supply of investment options had the  potential to put substantial further downward pressure on overnight rates,  including the federal funds rate.\n\n…The ON RRP  Facility Worked As Intended To Support Rate Control\n\nThe  ON RRP facility was established as part of the FOMC’s ample reserves framework  in order to support interest rate control in a wide variety of environments.  It offers a broad range of money market  investors the option to invest in an overnight reverse repo with the Federal  Reserve, which improves their bargaining power for private investments.  It also offers an alternative investment when private investments are not available at rates above the ON RRP  rate. 8\n\nIn  the first quarter of this year, ON RRP facility usage became more regular, and it  has increased rapidly since.  Recently, reductions  in the TGA and Treasury bill supply have accelerated, and the ON RRP facility  has exceeded $1.2 trillion consistently since mid-September, as shown in Figure 4 .\n\nThe  ON RRP facility is working as intended, even as usage expands to new highs.  Just as IORB creates a floor for rates on bank lending activity, the ON RRP facility supports control of the federal funds rate by providing a soft floor for the overnight money market activity of a broader set of money market  participants. 9 Usage of the facility also broadens the  holders of Federal Reserve liabilities beyond banks, easing pressure on bank  balance sheets that may result from reserve growth.  As shown in Figure 2 , the supply of reserves has  increased relatively modestly this year, as the ON RRP facility absorbed much  of the increase in liquidity from the decline in the TGA and ongoing asset  purchases.\n\nAn  essential feature of the ON RRP facility is that it has a fixed rate and  therefore its size is determined by the interest rate environment. 10 Just as usage of the facility grew  in response to downward pressure on money market rates, it should decline in  response to increases in them.  For  example, if Treasury were to expand Treasury bill supply and interest rates on  these instruments rose above the ON RRP rate, investors should naturally  reallocate out of the facility and back into these assets.  Similarly, if the supply of reserves declines  and rates rise relative to the IORB rate, ON RRP balances should naturally recede.  This dynamic has been observed in the past.  Following the expansion of the Federal  Reserve’s balance sheet in response to the Global Financial Crisis, the level  of reserves began to decline in 2014, and as money market rates moved away from  the ON RRP rate, usage of the facility gradually fell back to zero.\n\nThe  flexible size of the ON RRP facility helps the FOMC’s ample reserves framework  adapt smoothly to different reserve and money market environments . The FOMC has indicated that, with the federal  funds rate likely to be constrained by its effective lower bound more  frequently than in the past, it is prepared to use its full range of  tools—including large-scale asset purchases—to achieve its maximum employment  and price stability goals. 11 As such, extended periods of elevated ON RRP usage  may be a relatively regular feature of the ample reserves framework.  This isn’t a challenge for monetary policy  implementation; it’s the framework working as designed.\n\nModest  Adjustments Were Made To Terms Of Implementation Tools To Evolve With The New  Environment…\n\nEven  with the ON RRP facility promoting interest rate control this year, the Federal  Reserve has made some modest adjustments to its implementation tools.\n\nAs  I’ve just described, IORB provides a floor for bank lending rates, and the ON  RRP facility supports control of the federal funds rate by creating a floor beneath  the overnight activity of a broader set of money market participants.  Earlier this year, the IORB rate was 10 basis  points and the ON RRP rate was zero.   Unsurprisingly, as reserves increased, the effective federal funds rate  (EFFR) edged further below the IORB rate and closer to the bottom of the FOMC’s  target range.  Against the backdrop of  declining Treasury bill supply and rising government money fund AUM, overnight secured  rates fell to near zero.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve implemented a technical adjustment to administered rates in  June, lifting the IORB and ON RRP rates by five basis points each, shifting up  their position in the target range.  This  was a normal adjustment in response to evolving money market conditions, intended  to help maintain the federal funds rate well within the target range.  Lifting the ON RRP rate above zero also  helped support the smooth functioning of money markets.  With secured rates near zero, money funds  with stable net asset values (NAVs) could have experienced challenges covering operating  costs and limited inflows, increasing the potential for further downward  pressure on rates.\n\nThis  was the sixth such technical adjustment.   Like the five adjustments before, it worked as expected.  Both secured and unsecured overnight rates  shifted modestly higher, in line with the change in the two administered rates.  As shown in Figure 5 , throughout this year  not only has the EFFR printed well within the target range, but the bulk of  trading in the federal funds market—as shown by the 1st and 99th  percentiles of trades underlying the EFFR—has also fallen within the range.\n\nThe adjustments to the Federal  Reserve’s policy implementation tools this year haven’t been limited to administered  rates.  To ensure the ON RRP facility is  effective, it is important to provide access to a sufficiently broad set of  money market participants and to offer counterparties adequate investment  capacity.\n\nIn April, the eligibility  requirements for RRP counterparties were adjusted to make the facility more  accessible, in line with the New York Fed’s efforts to ensure that its  counterparty policies both support effective policy implementation and promote  a fair and competitive marketplace.   Since then, we have onboarded new RRP counterparties, increasing the  diversity of our counterparty base.\n\nThe ON RRP facility’s  per-counterparty limit has also been adjusted this year.  In March, the FOMC lifted the limit to $80  billion to account for changes in the size and concentration of the money fund  industry since 2014, and to ensure sufficient capacity to maintain an effective  floor under the federal funds rate.  Most  recently, as ON RRP usage steadily increased, the FOMC raised the limit again,  this time to $160 billion.  Since the  increase, some counterparties have participated in ON RRP operations for more  than $80 billion, including on the September quarter-end date.\n\n…And Additional Tools  Were Added To Strengthen The Policy Implementation Framework\n\nIn  order for the FOMC’s ample reserves framework to effectively support policy  implementation through different environments, it also needs to be resilient to  occasional shocks that can arise.  In  recent years, we have observed that pressures in money markets can emerge  rapidly, and that these can spill back into the federal funds market.  Based on the effectiveness of repo operations  to support policy implementation, particularly during periods of stress, the  FOMC established two new standing overnight repo facilities at its July  meeting:  a domestic standing repo  facility, the SRF, and a repo facility for foreign and international monetary  authorities, the FIMA Repo Facility. 12\n\nThe  SRF is intended to address pressures in the repo market that can spill into the  federal funds market, and to flexibly add reserves, when needed.  Both primary dealers and banks can access repo funding through the SRF against a limited set of high-quality securities:  U.S. Treasuries, agency debt, and agency  MBS. 13 While primary dealers have long been  counterparties to the Federal Reserve’s open market operations, the FOMC  decided in July to add banks as eligible counterparties to the SRF, which  allows them to access the facility on similar terms as primary dealers.  Additionally, banks are key participants in  the federal funds market and adding them should enhance interest rate control  by offering a backstop source of liquidity.   Earlier this month, the New York Fed began accepting formal expressions  of interest from banks to become SRF counterparties.  Several have started the process, and we expect  the first group of banks will be able to participate in the SRF early next year.   I encourage banks interested in learning  more about the SRF to reach out to the New York Fed. 14\n\nThe  FIMA Repo Facility is available to help address global dollar funding pressures  that can emerge.  Disruptions in global  funding markets have the potential to negatively impact financial conditions  faced by U.S. households and businesses, in particular during significant  stress events in broader financial markets.   The FIMA Repo Facility provides foreign official accounts a source of  temporary liquidity against their holdings of Treasury securities at the New  York Fed to address these pressures.  Foreign  account holders have responded positively to the establishment of the facility,  as it provides an alternative to outright sales and complements the existing  U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines by extending access to dollar funding to a  broader range of foreign official institutions.\n\nImportantly,  in the FOMC’s ample reserves framework, the role of the ON RRP facility and the  new repo facilities are not symmetric.  These  new repo facilities, while offered daily, are not expected to be used  regularly.  The FOMC is committed to  maintaining an ample supply of reserves to ensure that administered rates—the  IORB and ON RRP rates—exercise control over the federal funds rate.  So, whereas the ON RRP facility could see  persistent usage in some environments, these new repo facilities are only  intended to act as occasional backstops.\n\nLooking Ahead, Working To Ensure Implementation Framework Remains Flexible And Adaptable…\n\nI’ve  talked today about how the Federal Reserve’s ample reserves framework has  ensured effective policy implementation recently by adapting to evolving money  market conditions, and about some of the new tools added to the framework.  However, market structure continuously evolves,  which in turn can have important implications for the framework.  Recognizing that, I would like to share a few  thoughts on two important changes on the horizon.\n\nThe first is work to improve the resilience of the U.S. Treasury  market.  In light of the disruptions in March 2020, and also shorter-lived disruptions on other occasions, market participants, academics, and the official sector have been analyzing underlying vulnerabilities in the Treasury market.   While the new standing repo facilities are designed to support effective  policy implementation, I expect they will also contribute to smooth functioning  of the Treasury market by ensuring temporary liquidity is available against  Treasury securities.  More broadly, the  Inter-Agency Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), of which  the New York Fed and the Federal Reserve Board are members, has identified several  key areas for further study to improve Treasury market resilience. 15 Some  of this work could result in important changes to market structure that are  relevant for the FOMC’s implementation framework.  For example, on the Open Market Trading Desk  at the New York Fed (the Desk), we have been attentive to developments around expanded  central clearing.  These could ultimately  merit a study of the costs and benefits of central clearing for some of the  Desk’s open market operations to ensure their ongoing effectiveness. 16\n\nLooking  further ahead, a second area that could have material implications for policy  implementation is technological innovation in payments and money.  Around the world, financial market participants  and the public are seeking faster and cheaper payment settlement.  This desire is resulting in the development  of new, private-sector means of transfer, such as stablecoins, and the study of  public-sector solutions, like central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and faster  payments. 17 The Federal Reserve itself is undertaking an initiative  called FedNow that will enable banks to provide safe and efficient instant  payment services.  And, the Federal  Reserve Board will soon be publishing a paper to engage the public on policy  issues associated with a U.S. CBDC.  On  the Desk, we are focused on the broad implications of financial innovation for  monetary policy implementation.  While  it’s not yet clear how the money and payment ecosystem will evolve in the future,  it seems apparent that there will be important implications for markets and  policy implementation.  But I want to  return to the theme I started with:  the implementation  framework is flexible, and it will be adapted as needed to implement monetary  policy efficiently and effectively.\n\nTransitioning Away  From LIBOR, Only 79 Days Left\n\nAs  I wrap up my remarks, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention a fast-approaching,  critical milestone in the transition away from LIBOR.  After a yearslong effort to reduce the  financial stability risk posed by the use of this flawed reference rate, this  year will effectively mark LIBOR’s end. While  U.S. dollar LIBOR will continue for a little while in order to support the transition  of legacy contracts, supervisory guidance has been clear that banks should stop  entering into new U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts no later than the end of  this year. 18 , 19\n\nThe  New York Fed plays an important role in supporting a smooth transition away  from LIBOR.  Jointly with the Federal  Reserve Board, we convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC),  and we produce the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).  We also operate in financial markets, and need  to transition ourselves.  To prepare for  the end-of-year deadline, we reviewed our contracts with our trading  counterparties and are amending these contracts to replace existing U.S. dollar  LIBOR references with ones linked to SOFR.   These documents should be fully executed by the end of October.\n\nWhile  there has been significant progress in the overall transition to date, there is  still more work that must be done.  Not  only is it imperative that firms around the world act without delay, it’s  equally important that they are prudent in their choice of alternative reference  rates.  The official sector has  repeatedly emphasized the importance of using alternatives that can be reasonably  expected to remain robust and resilient.\n\nThe  ARRC selected SOFR as its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR for  institutions of all sizes because it is based on a market that is vast and  liquid, with nearly $1 trillion of daily transactions by a diverse set of  borrowers and lenders underlying the rate.   SOFR isn’t the only alternative available, but it certainly is the most  robust, most liquid option.  If market  participants opt to use rates other than SOFR, they should make sure they fully  understand how those rates are constructed and any fragilities associated with  them. 20\n\nThank  you for your attention, and I would like to again thank the Money Marketeers  for the opportunity to speak with you today.  I look forward to the discussion with Dov.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nThank  you for the invitation to speak at this SIFMA event. 1 It is a pleasure to be  back with you to discuss financial markets and monetary policy implementation. When I last spoke with this group in July of last year,  I shared my views on the marked deterioration in conditions in the U.S.  Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets at the onset of  the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Federal Reserve's asset purchases undertaken to  support market functioning.\n\nAsset purchases are ongoing and continue to help foster smooth  market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, supporting the flow  of credit to households and businesses. This expansion in the Federal Reserve's  assets also has the effect of increasing Federal Reserve  liabilities—particularly reserve balances—which can have important implications  for money markets. Today, I would like to discuss the recent  rapid expansion in reserves, and its influence  on money market conditions. I plan to share some perspective on how, in this  environment, the Federal Reserve's tools will help maintain the federal funds  rate well within the target range and support effective policy implementation.\n\nBefore  I continue, let me note that the views I express today are my own, and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nReserves Rise to Historically  High Levels\n\nI'd  like to start with some context on the historic nature of the changes in the  Federal Reserve's balance sheet over the past year. Since the beginning of March  2020, the Federal Reserve's assets have grown from $4.2 trillion to $7.7  trillion, as shown in Figure 1 , representing the largest increase over a  similar timeframe in the Federal Reserve's history. This expansion reflects the  FOMC's swift and decisive actions to address deteriorating conditions in  financial markets and the severe economic downturn associated with the  pandemic. As part of those measures, increases in holdings of U.S. Treasury  securities, shown in dark blue, and agency MBS, shown in red, have supported  smooth market functioning and helped to foster accommodative financial  conditions.\n\nAn  increase in Federal Reserve assets is naturally accompanied by an increase in liabilities.  As Figure 2 shows, the expansion in assets over the past year was primarily supported  by increases in two types of liabilities: bank reserves, shown in red, and the  Treasury General Account (TGA), shown in light blue.\n\nThe  TGA is the U.S. Treasury's cash account with the Federal Reserve, and the U.S.  government uses this account to make and receive payments. As the pandemic  unfolded in 2020, the Treasury built up precautionary balances in this account to  prepare for outflows associated with fiscal spending to address the economic  downturn. This increase in the TGA limited growth in reserves that would have  otherwise resulted from the Federal Reserve's balance sheet expansion. However,  more recently, the Treasury began drawing down these precautionary balances and  the TGA declined by over $600 billion in the first quarter. This reduction in  the TGA, combined with ongoing asset purchases, has lifted reserves at an  extraordinary pace in recent months; aggregate reserves reached an all-time high  of $3.9 trillion on April 7, an increase of about $800 billion since the  beginning of the year.\n\nAs of December, reserves held by domestic banks as a share of their total assets were at the highest level that we have observed, as shown by the dark blue line in Figure 3 , and reserves have risen since then. As aggregate reserves grow, banks may perceive increasing costs associated with higher reserve balances and the resulting growth in their balance sheets.  If so, individual banks may take actions to limit or manage these impacts, such as reducing wholesale funding, discouraging deposit inflows, or purchasing securities to reduce reserve holdings. 2\n\nTo date, reserve increases among domestic banks have been broadly distributed across firms of all sizes, as shown on the right-hand side of Figure 4 . Some banks—global systemically important banks (GSIBs) and other large domestic banks, in particular—appear to be reducing reliance on certain types of wholesale funding and purchasing high quality securities to manage their balance sheets. However, much of the recent growth in reserves has been driven by deposit inflows that may be more challenging to moderate.\n\nAlthough  individual banks can take steps to limit growth in their own reserve balances,  reserves in aggregate cannot fall unless they are absorbed by other Federal  Reserve liabilities or Federal Reserve assets decline. The actions banks take  to limit or manage reserve balances instead put downward pressure on money  market rates relative to the interest paid on excess reserves (IOER) until the  banking system is content to hold the aggregate supply of reserves.\n\nOvernight Rates Have Fallen,  but to Different Degrees\n\nEven  as reserves have risen to historic levels, the effective federal funds rate  (EFFR) has remained relatively stable at around seven basis points, three basis  points below IOER, as shown by the dark blue line in Figure 5 . At the same time, overnight secured rates have fallen and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), shown in red, has declined to around one basis point.\n\nWhat might account for this growing  difference between unsecured and secured rates?\n\nThe resilience to date in overnight unsecured borrowing rates reflects, in part, foreign banking organizations' (FBOs) robust borrowing at rates relatively close to IOER. As shown in Figure 6 , FBOs account for almost all activity that makes up the Overnight Bank Funding Rate (OBFR)—a broad measure of wholesale overnight unsecured rates—and their volumes have increased considerably in recent months. Alongside this growth in wholesale liabilities, FBO reserve balances have grown by roughly 45 percent since the beginning of the year, as shown in Figure 7 . Our understanding is that these FBOs value their relationships with wholesale lenders and may face lower balance sheet costs than many domestic banks, and therefore have not demanded a wider spread below IOER to take on this funding.\n\nIn  contrast, reductions in U.S. Treasury bill supply and robust growth among  secured money market investors has resulted in more pronounced downward  pressure in overnight secured rates. In the year to date, the publicly  available supply of Treasury bills has declined by around $300 billion. Meanwhile,  as shown in Figure 8 , government money market fund (MMF) assets under  management (AUM), which are markedly higher since the pandemic began, have grown  significantly since the start of the year. Investors view government MMFs as  safe and highly liquid investments, and they become increasingly attractive as  banks lower deposit rates or limit deposit growth. 3\n\nHistorically,  when significant differences emerge between secured and unsecured rates, we  have seen investors—most notably prime MMFs—reallocate between these markets, moderating  the rate spread. 4 However, prime MMFs have become much less prominent in recent years, as shown  in Figure 9 . It may be that, with investors somewhat more cautious after the  stresses in money markets last spring, the yield earned on unsecured  investments does not currently offer a sufficient premium to attract new  investments into prime MMFs or for prime fund managers to take on additional  liquidity risk with existing AUM. 5 These factors may also be contributing  to a slightly wider spread than we have observed in recent years.\n\nWhere  might rates go from here?\n\nUltimately, the evolution of overnight rates will depend on the adjustment to higher reserve levels, and the supply and demand for overnight investments. As aggregate reserves continue to grow, banks may take additional actions to manage growth in their individual reserve balances. 6 In previous periods of elevated reserves, FBOs absorbed a significant share of reserves through wholesale borrowing and, as I noted, recently we have seen growth in FBO balances. However, it remains to be seen if some FBOs will be comfortable taking additional reserve balances, and if so, whether it will require a wider spread below IOER for them to do so.\n\nIn an environment where banks are seeking to moderate growth in reserve balances, MMFs are also likely to see ongoing inflows, increasing the demand for short-term investments. To the extent that these inflows continue to go to government MMFs, secured rates may experience more downward pressure. The supply of government investments, including Treasury bills, will be an important factor influencing money market rates.\n\nAs  rates adjust to rising reserves and changes in the supply and demand for overnight  investments, we will be monitoring markets closely. We are confident that the  Federal Reserve has the tools to maintain control over the federal funds rate  and support effective policy implementation, a discussion I will turn to now.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Tools  Support Rate Control, with the ON RRP Facility Becoming More Central in the Framework\n\nIn January 2019, the FOMC communicated its intention to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates. 7, 8 The payment of IOER  sets a benchmark against which banks evaluate their lending and borrowing  opportunities. In addition, the Federal Reserve offers a fixed-rate investment  to a broad base of money market investors, known as the overnight reverse repo  (ON RRP) facility, which establishes a floor for overnight rates below IOER. The  availability of this facility as an investment option improves money market lenders'  bargaining power in private markets. When investors use the facility, the  reverse repo transactions and corresponding reduction in reserves broadens the  liability base that supports asset purchases and alleviates the pressures on  bank balance sheets that lower money market rates.\n\nIn  an abundant reserves environment when overnight rates trade sufficiently below  IOER, the ON RRP facility becomes a more central part of the implementation  framework. Since its introduction, the ON RRP facility has been effective at providing  a floor for the federal funds rate and limiting downward pressure on other overnight  rates, as shown in Figure 10 . 9 Meanwhile, concerns about possible  repercussions of the ON RRP facility that were discussed when it was  established—such as the potential for investments to shift towards the facility  in times of stress or for it to reshape the financial industry in unanticipated  ways—have not materialized in the intervening years, even through various  periods of market stress. 10, 11 Overall, the ON RRP  facility has proven to be a highly effective tool for monetary policy  implementation.\n\nThe availability of the  ON RRP facility may be particularly important in the U.S.  context. This is because the U.S. banking system is smaller relative to the overall  size of the economy than in other advanced economies, as shown in Figure 11 ,  and because non-bank entities represent a relatively larger proportion of the  U.S. financial system. As a result, a given amount of asset purchases relative  to gross domestic product may have a more significant impact on the U.S.  banking system than it would on the banking systems in other countries. The ON  RRP facility can continue to provide a floor on rates and broaden the set of  holders of Federal Reserve liabilities beyond reserves held by banks.\n\nUltimately,  it is the price adjustments in money markets that will determine the mix of  liabilities between reserves and the ON RRP facility. 12 These price adjustments could  also affect the mix of other Federal Reserve liabilities, although likely to a  lesser degree. The Federal Reserve offers accounts and investments to certain  official institutions and financial market utilities (FMUs). As money market  rates decline, these entities may also increase their balances. As shown in Figure 12 , some of these other liabilities have grown notably over the past year. For example, although still lower than in earlier years, Foreign Official and International Monetary Authority (FIMA) accounts have recently increased their reverse repo pool investments and unremunerated balances with the New York Fed, shown in dark blue and red, respectively. 13 Other deposits with Reserve Banks,  which primarily comprise accounts for Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs)  and FMUs designated systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight  Council, have also increased materially.\n\nAn Update of ON  RRP Terms Ensures it Supports Effective  Policy Implementation\n\nAs a measure  of prudent planning, the Open Market Trading Desk (\"Desk\") recently conducted a  review of key design features of the ON RRP facility to ensure that the  facility's terms continue to support effective policy implementation. We found  that the existing ON RRP facility counterparty types—MMFs, GSEs and banks, as  well as primary dealers—continue to cover the major investors in the tri-party  repo market in which the Desk operates the ON RRP. However, the MMF industry  has grown in size and has become more concentrated at the largest funds since  the facility's $30 billion per-counterparty limit was set in 2014. In light of this  evolution, the FOMC decided to increase the ON RRP facility per-counterparty  limit to $80 billion in order to restore the capacity of the facility relative  to the aggregate size of money fund counterparties to roughly the level that  prevailed when the $30 billion limit was established. This should help ensure  that the ON RRP facility maintains a floor for the federal funds rate and  supports effective policy implementation. Related to this review, the Desk is  planning in coming months to relax certain eligibility criteria that MMFs and  GSEs, in particular, must meet in order to be eligible as ON RRP facility counterparties. 14 These changes could reduce  barriers to entry in the industry for smaller MMFs and promote a more fair and  inclusive marketplace.\n\nSince the most recent FOMC meeting, the facility has continued to serve as an effective floor even as greater downward pressure on overnight secured rates has emerged. There has been relatively modest take-up on most days as the ON RRP facility has bolstered money market lenders' bargaining power. Take-up at March quarter-end rose to $134 billion, and the ON RRP facility provided an outlet for investors on this date when financial firms managed their balance sheets more tightly.\n\nSince the facility's inception, we have periodically observed some repo trading at rates below the ON RRP offering rate, as shown in Figure 13 by the first percentiles of the Tri-party General Collateral Rate (TGCR) and SOFR. Recently some activity has occurred at rates below zero in interdealer markets, as captured in the SOFR first percentile. This appears to be technical in nature, driven in part by the value that dealers place on the ability to centrally clear these transactions and net their balance sheet exposures. Given these benefits, we understand that dealers who have access to the ON RRP facility are lending at modestly negative rates. Even as modest volumes occur at rates below the ON RRP rate, the facility continues provide an effective floor. However, we will continue to monitor money markets closely and make adjustments to ON RRP operations as needed.\n\nAdministered Rates Support  Effective Policy Implementation\n\nIn addition to ensuring that the ON RRP’s facility's terms continue to support effective policy implementation, it might be appropriate to implement adjustments to administered rates should undue downward pressure on overnight rates emerge, as noted in the minutes of the March FOMC meeting released last week. The Federal Reserve has adjusted administered rates relative to the target range on numerous occasions in recent years as conditions in overnight markets have evolved, as shown in Figure 14 . Such adjustments are purely technical steps to support effective policy implementation and to maintain the federal funds rate well within the target range.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn  conclusion, the adjustment to higher reserve levels has important implications  for money markets. I have been pleased that the FOMC's implementation framework  continues to accommodate the adjustment to higher reserve levels resulting from  the FOMC's actions to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative  financial conditions.\n\nGiven  the significant increase in reserves and reduction in Treasury bill supply  since the start of the year, overnight money market rates have softened. With  reserves expected to grow further, we will be monitoring money markets closely  and will continue to make adjustments as needed.\n\nIn  this environment, I am confident that the Federal Reserve's tools will continue  to support effective policy implementation. IOER sets a benchmark for bank  lending and borrowing activity, and the ON RRP facility establishes a floor for  overnight rates. Ultimately, it is these administered rates and the spread  between them that will control overnight money market rates in the FOMC's ample  reserves regime and will influence the mix of Federal Reserve liabilities.\n\nI  would like to thank SIFMA and the organizers of this event for the opportunity  to speak here today. I look forward to the Q&A session, as well as the  roundtable on Treasury market structure that follows.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to speak with you today at the New York Fed and Columbia SIPA workshop on monetary policy implementation. Many of you have attended these workshops in the past, and it is great to be together again to talk about issues of essential importance to policy implementation. It is also nice to see so many new participants, reflecting the broad interest and engagement in the topic of digital innovation.\n\nOver the past two days, we heard about faster forms of payments and new, digital forms of money—both private and public—and the effects they might have on money markets, policy implementation frameworks, and the international landscape.\n\nDigital innovation in money and payments is occurring for a reason—consumers, businesses, and financial market participants can benefit from around-the-clock, faster, and possibly programmable payments, both to reduce risk and to simplify financial transactions. Increased competition that results from new forms of money and payments could lower costs, increase service availability, and stimulate further innovation.\n\nHarnessing the benefits of innovation to consumers and businesses, while maintaining a safe and effective monetary system, may require new legislation, changes to regulations and to supervisory approaches, and modernization of traditional payment systems. The specifics of the appropriate initiatives will vary by country. These developments could have significant implications, including for financial stability, national security interests, and international cooperation.\n\nIn my role as manager of the Federal Reserve’s System Open Market Account, I am looking at these issues from the vantage point of monetary policy implementation. And in my remarks today, I will discuss some key issues that digital innovation in money and payments raises for policy implementation. In particular, I will examine how digital currencies might impact interest rate control and central bank balance sheets. In the spirit of this workshop, I won’t speak to the U.S. context specifically, but rather intend to discuss conceptual issues for policy implementation across jurisdictions. And, I won’t take a position on regulation, design choices, or a preference for a private or public solution.\n\nAs always, the views I express today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nPrivate and Public Innovation\n\nI would like to start by describing two types of monetary instruments that could, in the future, be significant for policy implementation. In the private sector, a broad range of digital assets are emerging. A subset of those digital assets, known as stablecoins, could over time be used by consumers and businesses as money, if they serve as a safe means of payment, a store of value, and a unit of account. 2 Some jurisdictions are considering bringing these kinds of instruments into the regulatory framework by requiring their issuers to become banks or other licensed entities. 3 This could enhance the ability to safely integrate them into the payments system. It could also expand access to central bank accounts and services to new entrants, allowing the stablecoins to be backed by the most liquid and stable of assets: central bank reserves.\n\nTraditional commercial banks are also forming consortiums and partnering with digital innovation firms to increase their offerings of liabilities associated with digital activities, which might entail offering deposits to stablecoin issuers or even direct issuance of stablecoins.\n\nMany are also investing in distributed ledger activities that could transform their businesses. Preliminary analysis of the May 2022 Senior Financial Officer Survey suggests that most U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs) expect growth and development in these areas to be a medium or high priority over the next couple of years, and banks continue to explore these areas to see how they fit into their business strategies. 4\n\nCentral banks are also innovating. Many are implementing new forms of payments or experimenting with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to prepare for the future. Currently, over 60 jurisdictions have launched faster payment services. 5 In addition, central banks are building expertise and investing in technology to examine the potential applicability of CBDCs. 6\n\nMonetary Policy Implementation in An Evolving Monetary System\n\nAs we consider the potential impact of this array of innovations, it is useful to start with a view into the current monetary system.\n\nFor decades, central bank reserve balances have been the safest and most liquid asset, at the core of a smoothly operating financial system. Most economies operate with two-tier monetary systems, in which households and businesses hold and make payments with cash and private money such as bank deposits, while only banks can hold and make payments with central bank reserves. Regulation, supervision, and deposit insurance help keep commercial bank money safe. In turn, deposits fund growth in the economy through loans to households and businesses. And central banks provide liquidity backstops to ensure that the banking system can meet its liquidity obligations to the public.\n\nMost policy implementation frameworks around the world are designed based on this two-tiered system. In these frameworks, central banks control the aggregate supply of their liabilities and the rates at which these liabilities are remunerated, which in turn influences the market interest rates that are transmitted to the economy. 7\n\nIn considering the impact on implementation frameworks of an environment including private and public digital currencies, I would like to raise two key questions that central banks might consider. First, what are the implications for the tools of interest rate control? And second, how might the central bank balance sheet adapt?\n\nWhat are the implications for the central bank’s tools of interest rate control? Most central banks adjust and communicate their monetary policy stance through an interest rate target, and successful implementation entails supplying central bank liabilities in a manner that promotes conditions in money markets consistent with this stance. Central banks often rely on three pillars to control interest rates: the rates of remuneration on liabilities; the amount of liquidity supplied; and the provision of liquidity backstops.\n\nCertain design choices for the adoption and integration of digital currencies could alter how central banks use these pillars to control short-term interest rates.\n\nPillar 1: Rates of remuneration Many advanced economy central banks currently operate in some type of a floor system, in which the administered rate or rates paid on certain central bank liabilities are a core component of interest rate control. 8 The development of new digital forms of currency raises questions about how to fit new liabilities into these remuneration frameworks.\n\nIn the case of a CBDC, a central bank can directly determine the instrument’s design and the return that its holder receives. If a CBDC is designed as a substitute for cash, for example, with relatively low maximum holding limits and zero interest, it may have a relatively limited impact on monetary policy implementation.\n\nOn the other hand, a zero-interest CBDC that could be easily employed for large-scale payments may have greater impact. For example, in higher-interest-rate environments, the opportunity cost of holding a CBDC with these design features could be high, resulting in it being used only for modest transactional purposes. Conversely, in lower-interest-rate environments, a zero-interest CBDC without holding limits could compete more strongly with existing money market instruments, and demand for a zero-interest CBDC in lower-interest-rate environments could be hard to predict.\n\nA zero-interest CBDC could also interact with policy rate setting. For central banks that seek to maintain a zero lower bound on interest rates, a zero-interest CBDC could benefit monetary policy implementation, as a widely available zero-interest instrument could help reinforce the lower bound. For other central banks, a zero-interest CBDC could constrain their ability to achieve negative rates.\n\nThe alternative that central banks might consider is an interest-bearing CBDC, for which the natural question is: what rate of interest should be paid? If a central bank decided to remunerate a CBDC, the incentives created within the monetary policy implementation framework would need to be considered. As a broad principle, research suggests that a CBDC should be structured with rates of remuneration at or below rates on central bank reserve balances, as a higher rate could create direct competition for deposits, risking disintermediation of the banking system. 9 How much lower would need to be considered in the context of a specific central bank’s policy implementation framework, its policy rate target, and the incentives that an interest-bearing CBDC could create in money markets. Some have suggested tiered remuneration for different holding amounts in order to influence incentives and ensure appropriate integration into the monetary system. 10\n\nIn the case of stablecoins, central banks don’t directly control interest that might be paid on these instruments. However, incentives created by remuneration policies could have important influences on the structure and relative demand for private and public digital currencies. Depending on how the regulatory and policy environment for financial innovation evolves, stablecoins could be issued by banks or other regulated entities that could have access to interest-bearing accounts at central banks. In this case, the rate of remuneration stablecoin issuers earn on their accounts might influence the rate paid to stablecoin holders, and the role of the instruments in the broader monetary ecosystem. 11\n\nOf course, implementation issues are not the only important consideration for remuneration of digital currencies, but it should be one consideration. Choices about the remuneration of new central bank liabilities, like CBDC, and of the accounts of private stablecoin issuers, could have an important influence on the incentives created by monetary policy implementation frameworks. Given this, central banks should take a holistic approach to considering the impact of their remuneration policies on the ecosystem of both private and public currencies.\n\nPillar 2: Liquidity supply This brings me to the second pillar of interest rate control: liquidity supply. In order for central banks’ remuneration rates to effectively achieve interest rate control, central banks supply reserves in appropriate quantities to achieve the interest rate target. In some environments, this requires central banks to forecast demand for liabilities and execute open market operations to supply needed reserves.\n\nIn recent years, the demand for many central bank liabilities has become higher and less predictable. However, most central banks have been operating with abundant liquidity surpluses, which has limited the impact of this reduced predictability on implementation. 12 As central banks embark on balance sheet reduction, however, understanding demand for liabilities may become more important.\n\nThe demand for digital currencies is not well understood, as these are instruments for which there is no precedent or experience. For a CBDC, central banks would have to understand the behavior of the demand for this new liability. If stablecoins were to be issued by commercial banks, it would also be important to understand drivers of growth in these coins and how that growth might affect banks’ demand for reserves. Trend growth in these central bank liabilities could be quite different than it is for other liabilities, such as cash or reserve holdings of traditional banks. And, the variability in demand could potentially be high, driven by shifts in the market environment or in response to geopolitical developments or other exogenous events. This variability could be amplified if digital currencies were available internationally, potentially leading to larger flows. The variability could create new challenges for supplying the appropriate amount of reserves to the banking system to ensure that administered rates continue to control rates, and could lead to a need for larger liquidity surpluses to ensure interest rate control.\n\nOne way to manage growth or variability in demand, and the associated impact on demand for reserves in the banking system, could be to impose limits on how much of a CBDC individuals or institutions could hold. Some central banks are actively considering such limits. 13 However, these could also diminish the use cases for CBDC and reduce the potential for consumers and businesses to take advantage of the payment benefits.\n\nStablecoins may not have the same types of holding limitations, which could lead to faster growth or more variability in demand. At least one jurisdiction is considering the potential use of holding limits or transaction limits on stablecoins on a temporary basis, to manage the possible shift from commercial bank deposits during a transition to new forms of digital money. 14 Central banks could also contemplate putting some limits on balances at the central bank associated with stablecoin issuance to manage the unpredictability associated with these flows.\n\nI have spent some time discussing the potential need for greater supply of liquidity; however, the direction is not all one-way. As payments become faster, the demand for some central bank liabilities may decline. For example, in some jurisdictions, payment innovations have led to a substantial decline in the amount of currency in circulation. 15 Banks may also find that more efficient payment systems bring about liquidity efficiencies, and could reduce their own demand for reserves in response.\n\nFrom my vantage point, the key takeaway for liquidity provision is to consider how, in the context of the remuneration paid on these instruments and other features, demand for central bank liabilities might evolve and how it could shift in different environments. Again, this requires holistic thinking about the ecosystem in which both private and public digital currencies operate.\n\nPillar 3: Liquidity facilities and backstops The third pillar of interest rate control is liquidity backstops. In most frameworks the supply of central bank liabilities and their rates of remuneration are the primary means of interest rate control. However, occasional shocks occur in money markets, and central banks provide liquidity backstops that promote interest rate control and smooth market functioning.\n\nIn an environment with new public and private digital currencies, liquidity backstops for traditional banks may become even more important. As I noted, digital currencies could create competition for commercial bank deposits. This could enhance market efficiency and improve transmission of monetary policy, but it may also lead to swings in deposit flows that could unexpectedly shift a commercial bank’s liquidity position. This could in turn increase the potential for occasional variability in overnight rates and the need for central bank liquidity facilities.\n\nHowever, liquidity risk will also be an important consideration for new entrants, such as stablecoin issuers. Stablecoins backed entirely by central bank reserves would be less susceptible to liquidity risk than those backed with other assets. But this design may not ultimately be the most efficient use of central bank liabilities for the financial system, because an important role for commercial banks in the two-tier monetary system is their ability to support the provision of credit in the economy. 16\n\nStablecoins backed by other instruments, such as high-quality liquid assets, could moderate growth in the central bank’s balance sheet relative to a stablecoin backed entirely by central bank reserves. However, this structure would also give rise to liquidity risk for stablecoin issuers, which might in turn give rise to a need for a backstop source of funding.\n\nThese considerations raise important questions for how best to integrate digital currencies and ensure smooth market functioning and interest rate control in times of stress.\n\nHow might the central bank’s balance sheet adapt? Possibly the biggest question over time for monetary policy implementation is how much of the central bank balance sheet should be used to support innovation in currencies.\n\nThe current two-tier system of money and payments has central bank balances at its center, but also features an expansive set of private money offered through bank deposit balances. Innovation in payment systems may have clear benefits for consumers and businesses, and private currencies backed by safe central bank balances or other highly liquid safe assets are certainly better than alternatives created by less regulated firms and backed by lower quality or illiquid assets. However, to the extent that stablecoins or CBDCs supplant private bank money or expand overall demand for central bank liabilities, they could also increase the size and potentially change the nature of central bank assets.\n\nA larger balance sheet could cause some central banks to adapt approaches to asset composition to manage the influence of a larger balance sheet on the policy stance. For example, a central bank could buy short-duration assets to support the new demand for central bank liabilities and differentiate these asset purchases from those intended to foster accommodative financial conditions.\n\nThese issues may also require new operational approaches for central banks. In some circumstances, the balance sheet could need to adjust rapidly because of unexpected large shifts in liability demand. This could require new thinking by central banks on the appropriate approaches to implementation with potentially a different mix of assets or tools to add liquidity to the system. Short-duration assets or temporary liquidity providing operations would also allow flexibility if an increase in liability demand is expected to be short term.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe innovation occurring in money and payments has the potential to alter the existing two-tier monetary system upon which current monetary policy implementation frameworks are designed. How things evolve from here is uncertain, and the impact of these innovations could be revolutionary, or more evolutionary. But imagining an environment in which new forms of private and public money and payments could coexist is helpful in adapting implementation frameworks that will enable central banks to continue to achieve their desired policy stance in the future.\n\nExpanding central bank liabilities in an incremental way to support new forms of money could create a safer payment system—one that promotes innovation, mitigates potential risks, and ensures money continues to function well in an increasingly digital economy. Adapting the implementation framework to incorporate new private forms of money and potentially central bank digital currencies is complex and will require substantial further study of key issues, some of which I have raised today.\n\nThis calls for an integrated approach, one that considers each instrument and its role in the monetary ecosystem. Central banks must draw on broad expertise within their institutions so that payments experts, monetary policy practitioners, financial stability and supervision colleagues explore and understand important intersections. We will also need to continue to engage a broad range of market participants, academics, and colleagues across the international central banking community as we adapt to be prepared for the road ahead. Workshops like this one help us learn from one another. Thank you all for your participation in such a rich and important set of discussions.",

    "text": "Thank you  for the kind introduction. While preparing these remarks, I learned that the  Money Marketeers organization was founded by Dr. Marcus Nadler, a gifted  educator who challenged market participants to deepen their understanding of  the forces that move markets, and that it was born out of a popular lecture  series he regularly held at NYU. This spirit of continual learning is a core  value at the Federal Reserve, and that has been particularly important in  recent years as the Fed has been operating in a new monetary policy  implementation regime. 1\n\nI last had  the pleasure of speaking about monetary policy implementation at this forum two  years ago. At that time, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had yet to  make a decision on what the long run operating regime would look like. Substantial  progress has been made since then. My intention tonight is to share some thoughts  on what the FOMC’s recent decisions could mean for the manner in which the New  York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) implements policy. In  particular, I would like to discuss the Federal Reserve’s ongoing process for  learning about the banking system’s demand for reserves and money market  dynamics more broadly. I will also outline how the Desk could supply reserves  through open market operations as the Federal Reserve transitions from implementing  policy in an ample-reserves regime driven by the asset side of the balance  sheet to one driven by demand for liabilities.\n\nI will  bring an operational perspective to these topics, given my position as head of the  Desk and Deputy Manager of the Federal Reserve System Open Market Account. I  should also say now that the views I express tonight are my own and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nAn Operational Framework for an Ample-Reserves  Regime\n\nLet me begin  by reviewing the FOMC’s recent decisions about the operating regime. In January,  the FOMC communicated its intention to continue implementing policy in a regime  in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the federal  funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the  Federal Reserve’s administered rates and in which the active management of the  supply of reserves is not required. 2 This type of regime is often  referred to as a “floor system” because the administered rates—including IOER (the  rate of interest paid on excess reserves) and the ON RRP rate (the offered rate  at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility)—place a floor under the  rates at which banks and other market participants will lend. 3 I’ve illustrated this  framework in the stylized graphs showing the relationship between the interest  rate and banks’ demand for reserves in Figure 1 . Before the crisis, the Desk operated  along the steep part of the demand curve to achieve its directive from the FOMC,  whereas in an ample-reserves regime, like the one we’ve used in recent years, we  operate along the flatter part of the curve. 4\n\nOver the past  decade, the Federal Reserve has learned a great deal about operating in the  current regime, and during recent deliberations about the long-run  implementation framework the FOMC highlighted several key benefits of the  current regime as supporting its decision. 5\n\nFirst, the  ample-reserves regime has been very effective at controlling short-term  interest rates because the Federal Reserve’s administered rates provide strong incentives  in money markets. As shown in Figure 2 , overnight interest rates moved in line  with changes in these administered rates, even as the FOMC lifted rates from  near zero in late 2015 to over 2 percent more recently. During this same period,  there were sweeping changes in banks’ liquidity management practices and in money  market fund regulation that transformed the structure of money markets, and the  floor system proved resilient to those changes. 6 Looking forward, this  regime should provide stable interest rate control if unexpected situations  arise in which large amounts of liquidity need to be added to relieve stress in  the financial system or large-scale asset purchases are needed to provide  macroeconomic stimulus because short-term rates are at their effective lower  bound. 7\n\nSecond, from  an operational perspective, an ample-reserves regime achieves this  effectiveness in a simple and efficient manner. For example, it reduces the  need for active management of reserve supply because shocks to the supply of or  demand for reserves can be absorbed without the need for sizable daily  interventions by the central bank. In the U.S., the ability to accommodate variability  in non-reserve liabilities is particularly important because those liabilities—such  as the Treasury General Account (TGA), Foreign Repo Pool, and balances held by  Designated Financial Market Utilities—provide benefits for the economy and the global  financial system. 8\n\nAlthough reserves  will continue to be ample going forward, the level will be significantly lower  than has prevailed in recent years. In March, the FOMC issued an updated  “Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans” in which it stated that the longer-run  level of reserves will be a level consistent with “efficient and effective”  implementation of monetary policy. 9 To support a smooth  transition to the longer-run level of reserves, the FOMC also stated that the  reduction in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings will slow this spring  and then stop in September. When balance sheet runoff stops in September, the FOMC  expects the level of reserves to be somewhat higher than necessary for  efficient and effective monetary policy implementation. If so, the total  balance sheet will be held constant for a time, and trend increases in non-reserve  liabilities, such as those shown in Figure 3 , will gradually reduce the average  level of reserves until it reaches a level consistent with efficient and  effective implementation of monetary policy.\n\nAs Chair  Powell noted in his January press conference, the level of reserves consistent  with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy will be  principally determined by financial institutions’ demand for reserves, and an  additional buffer so that interest rate control continues to be exercised  through administered rates. 10 The stylized framework I showed  earlier in Figure 1 illustrates that banks demand different levels of reserves depending  on the prevailing levels of interest rates. However, for purposes of the discussion  today, I will define the banking system’s demand for reserves as a level that  is just to the right of the steeper portion of the demand curve, representing  the lowest quantity of reserves that banks demand in aggregate at rates near  IOER. This corresponds to the minimum level of reserves needed to continue  operating in a floor system, and supplying reserves at or above this level  would be consistent with a floor system.\n\nIn  practice, assessing banks’ demand for reserves will be a continual process  because the factors determining that demand are complex and may change over  time. Federal Reserve staff survey banks, analyze vast amounts of data, and  gather intelligence across the market to better understand this demand. Slowing  the runoff in securities holdings this spring and stopping in September will reduce  the pace of reserve decline, allowing this detailed assessment to adapt  appropriately as reserves decline to levels that were last seen almost a decade  ago. The behavior of money markets with this lower—albeit still ample—level of  reserves will feed back into the Desk’s thinking about the design of operations.  And being operationally flexible will allow the Desk to adapt to changing economic  and market conditions, as well as to the FOMC’s assessment of the appropriate level  of reserves consistent with efficient and effective implementation.\n\nThe Banking System’s Demand for Reserves  in an Ample-Reserves Regime\n\nLet me  take a step back and provide some observations on the banking system’s demand  for reserves. Banks engage in a variety of activities that create uncertainty  about their liquidity positions. These uncertainties include a risk that depositors  will want their money back sooner than expected. To manage this liquidity risk,  banks need access to cash, which can  come from several sources, including reserves already held at the Federal  Reserve, money borrowed either in the private market or from the Federal  Reserve’s lending facilities, or proceeds from asset sales or maturities.\n\nReserves are  the most reliable and safest source of liquidity because they are immediately  available for payments and do not have a changing market value. Nevertheless,  before the crisis, banks typically tried to minimize reserve balances because reserves  earned zero interest, whereas other highly liquid assets, such as Treasury  bills, earned a sizable positive yield. Given this high opportunity cost,  demand for reserves was relatively close to reserve balance requirements prior  to the crisis. 11\n\nToday, reserves  are less expensive to hold than they were before the crisis because the Federal  Reserve now pays IOER, which is the principal tool used to control short-term  interest rates. 12 However, demand for reserves has also shifted in other important ways. In  particular, there are new factors driving reserve demand, and that demand is,  and will likely continue to be, much higher than it was before the crisis. To  start, the crisis appropriately changed attitudes toward risk and increased  focus on managing liquidity risk. The subsequent creation of a liquidity regulatory  framework for larger banks reinforced the benefits of holding unencumbered  liquid assets for both domestic and foreign banks. While these liquidity  regulations do not themselves impose any specific requirements to hold central  bank reserves, many banks now use internal models that also estimate the very  short-term liquidity they need to hold in order to be prepared for a stress  scenario. 13 These models make assumptions about a bank’s reduced access to funding and ability  to sell securities during earlier stages of a stressed period. The bank may  therefore decide to hold a portion of its liquidity buffer as reserves on an  ongoing basis as a precautionary measure. Through our outreach to banks, we  also hear that some are more reluctant to borrow from the Federal Reserve than  they were prior to the financial crisis. For some banks, this reluctance increases  the precautionary demand for reserves to meet large intraday payment  obligations and manage unexpected volatility in deposits.\n\nTo get a more  systematic reading of the factors driving reserve demand as well as the size of  this demand, the Federal Reserve conducted a Senior Financial Officer Survey (SFOS)  in September 2018 and again this February. 14 The respondents to the September  2018 survey held two thirds of all reserves and about 60 percent of assets in  the banking system, and they encompassed a diverse set of business models,  including foreign banks and domestic banks of different sizes.\n\nThe survey  results revealed that a number of important sources of reserve demand are  present. As shown in Figure 4 , which presents September 2018 survey responses, the  majority of both domestic and foreign banks cited internal liquidity stress tests and  meeting intraday payment flows as important or very important drivers of  reserve demand. In addition, meeting potential deposit outflows specifically was  important or very important for almost three quarters of domestic banks, compared  to around a third of foreign banks. 15 In addition, it is worth  highlighting the considerable variation in survey responses, which reinforces my  earlier point that the pre-crisis framework in which all banks had similar  reserve management strategies no longer applies. The diversity of drivers also highlights  how demand for reserves could change if banks move from one strategy to another  or refine an existing one over time.\n\nThe survey  can also be used as an input for quantifying the banking system’s demand for  reserves. The surveys asked each bank to report the level of reserves it would  hold (at the prevailing constellation of rates) before taking active steps to  maintain or increase its reserve balances. 16 This lowest comfortable  level of reserves, or “LCLoR,” corresponds, conceptually, to the part of a  bank’s demand curve where the slope could start to steepen. In the September 2018  survey, total LCLoR of all the respondents was $617 billion, and extrapolating  the survey responses to the banking system as a whole resulted in estimates of U.S.  banking system demand for reserves ranging from $800 billion to $900 billion. 17 When we surveyed banks  again in February, those results yielded estimates in the same range. Figure 5 shows total LCLoRs for foreign respondents and domestic respondents, and the  extrapolated demand for the rest of the banking system. As you can see, each  group has considerable demand for reserves, although this demand is still well  below current reserve levels and far below the peak reserve levels reached in  2014.\n\nTo connect this back to the stylized  framework, in a world  with perfect information and no financial market frictions, an estimate of aggregate  reserve demand derived from summing and scaling the reported demand of  individual institutions might correspond to a level just to the right of the steeper portion of the  demand curve. However,  there are reasons why the amount of reserves a central bank needs to supply to  remain in a floor system could deviate from such an estimate. First, an  estimate of demand for reserves is simply an estimate; the true amount could be  higher or lower. Second, an individual bank’s demand curve could change over  time, both for reasons specific to the bank and because of changes in the  economic or market environment. Third, the banking system’s demand for reserves  could be higher than the sum of each bank’s individual demand if reserves are  not distributed efficiently. This scenario could occur if there are financial  market frictions to redistributing reserves that result in some banks  persistently holding a surplus of reserves above their LCLoR. For example, banks  now suggest that they face higher balance sheet costs to lend in federal funds,  making it possible that this market would not be as efficient at redistributing  reserves late in the day as it was prior to the crisis. 18\n\nIn  practice, assessing the lowest level of reserves necessary to remain on the  flat, or flatter, part of the demand curve will entail not only periodically  conducting the SFOS in collaboration with the Board of Governors, but also broader  monitoring and analytical efforts in order to continuously inform our assessment  of the demand for reserves and reserve conditions. The Desk’s current  assessment is that reserves remain ample overall. Transacted rates in the  federal funds market are relatively stable, and the vast majority of trades are  within the target range. Additional monitoring of bank microdata also suggests  that reserves are well supplied. 19\n\nLet me walk  through some observations based on the Desk’s ongoing monitoring and analysis. Though  rates transacted in the federal funds market are relatively stable, the EFFR has  risen one basis point relative to IOER in recent weeks and is now above IOER.  Since mid-March, overnight repo rates have generally traded above federal funds  rates, providing an attractive investment opportunity for the Federal Home Loan  Banks (FHLBs) that invest a portion of their liquidity portfolios in both  markets. As the dominant lenders in the federal funds market, FHLBs may have  been able to negotiate higher overnight lending rates with banks that regularly  use federal funds to fund non-reserve assets or meet payments, and on occasion with banks  that borrow to improve their Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR) by borrowing from  government sponsored enterprises. 20\n\nIn line  with a slightly higher EFFR, the overall share of above-IOER borrowing in markets  underlying the overnight bank funding rate has been growing somewhat, as shown  in Figure 6 , although a large majority of activity is still transacted within a  couple of basis points of IOER. As long as these rates remain relatively stable  and at modest spreads above IOER, we don't see this as indicating that reserves  are not well supplied.\n\nIndeed, an  examination of daily reserve levels of individual banks shows that currently  most banks remain well above their reported LCLoRs, suggesting that reserves remain  ample. In fact, some banks with surplus reserves have been redistributing these  reserves by shifting the composition of their HQLA (high quality liquid assets)  by lending in repo markets when rates are attractive, suggesting secured  markets are providing a means to redistribute reserves.\n\nIf competition  for reserves were to increase, we might expect to see a more meaningful day-to-day  relationship between changes in the level of reserves and overnight rates. Figure 7 shows a scatterplot of daily changes in reserve balances against daily  changes in the spread between EFFR and the IOER rate. There continues to be no  discernable relationship.\n\nIn sum, a  wide range of information contributes to the Federal Reserve’s assessment of  reserve demand and reserve conditions.  The  Desk’s current view is that reserves remain ample and well above the level the  banking system demands at rates near IOER at this time. Our assessment of  reserve demand is likely to change over time as we continue learning, and could  move higher or lower based on new information from analysis of data, surveys, and  outreach.\n\nSupplying Reserves in  an Ample-Reserves Regime\n\nI will now  look ahead and turn to how the Desk could supply reserves through open market operations to maintain an ample-reserves  regime. After balance sheet runoff ends in September, the average level of reserves  will decline more slowly, although there will be some meaningful transitory  swings in reserve levels because of normal variability in the Federal Reserve’s  other liabilities. As the level of reserves declines, the Desk will monitor  medium-term forecasts of reserves and other indicators of reserve conditions. At  some point, the FOMC will decide that the system has reached a level of  reserves consistent with efficient and effective implementation.\n\nOnce this  determination has been made by the FOMC, the Desk will need to conduct outright  purchases of Treasury securities to supply reserves in order to offset the  general decline in reserves from trend growth in non-reserve liabilities and ensure  that reserves remain ample. 21 In this regard, these purchases  will have the same purpose as they did prior to the financial crisis—expanding  the size of the SOMA portfolio to accommodate growth in currency and other  liabilities. However, the size of these purchases will likely be larger in  nominal terms because the growth of non-reserve liabilities is larger. For  example, in 2018, currency increased by almost $100 billion, as shown back in Figure 3 , compared to average  increases of $40 billion a year in the early 2000s before the crisis.\n\nThese purchases  could also be structured in size and timing to supply a sufficient amount of  reserves so that normal variability in non-reserve liabilities would not  require predictable repo market operations to offset the corresponding reserve  level changes. 22 The size of this “buffer” of reserves would depend on the Desk’s forward-looking  assessment of the expected volatility in non-reserve liabilities. A buffer of  reserves executed through Treasury purchases would diminish the need for the  Desk to conduct frequent, sizable repo operations, which might be difficult to  implement given reduced elasticity of primary dealer balance sheets for tri-party  repo in the post-crisis era. 2 Nonetheless, even with  this type of approach to managing a buffer, there might be some occasions in  which unanticipated changes in reserve conditions would still require the Desk  to conduct repo operations to maintain reserve levels or keep the effective federal  funds rate in the target range consistent with the directive from the FOMC.\n\nLet me make  the discussion of the buffer more concrete by focusing on the TGA. The TGA is  an account the Federal Reserve provides to the U.S. Treasury which, similar to  a checking account, allows Treasury to deposit or withdraw cash every day. When  Treasury takes in cash (for example, tax receipts), money is withdrawn from a private  bank account that in turn comes out of that bank’s reserves holdings. So, when  the TGA increases—and assuming there are no other changes on the Federal  Reserve’s balance sheet—this corresponds to a decrease in the level of  reserves. Figure 8 shows a scatterplot of weekly changes in the TGA against  weekly changes in reserves over the past two years. There have been times when  the TGA has increased by around $100 billion over the course of a week and  there has been a similarly large decline in reserves. 24 Figure 9 shows the  distribution of weekly changes across all non-reserve liabilities. These  changes have grown since the crisis and last year were as large as $100 billion.  Managing a buffer of reserves above the banking system’s demand for reserves would  help absorb these fluctuations in non-reserve liabilities.\n\nAs the  level of reserves falls, the Federal Reserve will continue to learn and enhance its thinking about an  efficient approach to open market operations that could incorporate both the  trend growth and transitory volatility in non-reserve liabilities to maintain  the excellent interest rate control experienced with higher levels of reserves.\n\nWhile my discussion tonight  has focused on the structure of open market operations from the perspective of  supplying sufficient reserves in an ample-reserves regime, the FOMC also  announced in its March Principles and Plans that the Desk will be conducting  Treasury purchases in the secondary market to reinvest mortgage-backed  securities (MBS) principal payments starting in October (subject to a maximum  of $20 billion per month).  The size of  these purchases will vary over time based upon MBS prepayments.  Of course, these purchases will be altering  the composition but not the overall size of the System Open Market Account  portfolio and Federal Reserve balance sheet. At least initially, the FOMC will  direct the Desk to conduct these MBS reinvestment purchases across a range of Treasury  maturities to roughly match the maturity composition of securities  outstanding.  The Desk will provide more  details on these operations in May. 25\n\nClosing Thoughts on Continually Learning  and Remaining Flexible\n\nIn  conclusion, the FOMC made an important decision in January to continue to  implement policy in an ample-reserves regime. Whereas the size of the balance  sheet and the level of reserves have, for many years, been driven by Federal  Reserve asset policies, at some point they will be determined by the demand for  Federal Reserve liabilities, taking into account both the banking system’s  demand for reserves and volatility in non-reserve liabilities.\n\nThrough  outreach, surveys, and regular monitoring we have increased our understanding  of the banking system’s demand for reserves. This learning is ongoing, and we expect  the factors driving reserve demand to evolve over time. The Desk’s current  assessment is that reserves are ample, and we will continue to monitor  conditions closely to further enhance our understanding of reserve conditions  and reserve demand. 26\n\nLooking  ahead, after balance sheet runoff ends in September, average reserve levels  will likely continue to gradually decline. When the FOMC judges that reserves have  reached a level consistent with efficient and effective implementation, the Desk  will begin to execute gradual and mechanical purchases of Treasury securities  in order to ensure that reserves remain ample. The size of these purchases will  need to be larger than similar pre-crisis operations simply because trend  growth in non-reserve liabilities is larger in nominal terms, and because proceeds  from maturing MBS also will be reinvested.\n\nThese are unprecedented  times, so active learning and maintaining operational flexibility will continue  to be core principles that guide the implementation of monetary policy. The ample-reserves  operating framework I have described today has auxiliary mechanisms, such as an  ongoing process for assessing reserve demand, that allow for flexibility and  adaptation for continued successful control of interest rates going forward.\n\nThank you.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "It  is a pleasure to join you virtually today. I’m grateful to SIFMA for the kind  invitation to discuss the Federal Reserve’s ongoing asset purchases and to all  of you here today for your interest in the smooth functioning of financial  markets. 1\n\nIn  response to the severe economic shock associated with the Covid-19 pandemic,  the Federal Reserve is committed to using all of its tools to achieve its goals  of maximum employment and price stability. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  has cut the target range for the federal funds rate close to zero. Additionally,  the Fed has taken a wide range of steps—many in coordination with the U.S. Treasury—to  support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local  governments. These steps have targeted many different parts of the financial  system and economy. Liquidity tools are supporting funding markets. Credit  facilities are helping to ensure that small businesses, corporations, and state  and local governments have access to credit. And, regulations have been  temporarily adjusted to encourage bank lending. Another important measure, and the  focus of my talk today, is the asset purchases that we have conducted at an  unprecedented scale and speed to support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury  and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS)—both of which play crucial roles in  the American financial system and economy.\n\nIn  early to mid-March, amid extreme volatility across the financial system, the functioning  of Treasury and agency MBS markets became severely impaired. Given the  importance of these markets, continued dysfunction would have led to an even  deeper and broader seizing up of credit markets and ultimately worsened the  financial hardships that many Americans have been experiencing as a result of  the pandemic. 2 The FOMC responded quickly and decisively with substantial purchases of  Treasury securities and agency MBS, and then demonstrated an even more forceful  commitment to market functioning by directing the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) to make purchases “in the amounts needed to support the  smooth functioning of markets” for those securities. 3\n\nAsset  purchases are a standard tool of monetary policy implementation. Traditionally,  the Desk has used Treasury purchases to maintain the supply of reserves in  accordance with the FOMC’s policy implementation regime. Following the Global  Financial Crisis, the FOMC used asset purchases primarily to exert downward  pressure on longer-term interest rates, or in the case of MBS to ease mortgage rates,  when the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound. The purchases during  this most recent episode have been distinct in both their purpose, to address  disruptions in market functioning, and their scale and speed, which have been  unparalleled. As shown in Figure 1 , System  Open Market Account (SOMA) securities holdings grew at an extraordinary pace, with  purchases totaling more than $100 billion on some days. Cumulatively, the purchases since mid-March have totaled $1.7 trillion of Treasuries and more than $800 billion of agency MBS, 4 which represents the vast majority of the overall $2.6 trillion increase in the  Federal Reserve’s balance sheet since then, as shown in Figure 2 .\n\nTo  assess the pace of purchases needed to support market functioning, we used  extensive metrics along with our best judgment. The initial rapid pace of  purchases was motivated by a severe breakdown in the functioning of these  markets. As market functioning improved, we substantially slowed our pace of  purchases. Most recently, at its June meeting, the FOMC decided to increase  holdings of Treasuries and agency MBS “at least at the current pace to sustain  smooth market functioning.”\n\nToday,  I’d like to talk about the disruption we saw and the steps we took in response.  I will focus on three broad questions. First, what is smooth market functioning  and why does it matter? Second, how have our asset purchases supported smooth market  functioning? And third, how will we structure purchases to sustain market  functioning over coming months and remain vigilant against renewed  deterioration? Let me note that the views I express are my own and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat  Is Smooth Market Functioning, and Why Does it Matter?\n\nBefore  I describe our response to the recent crisis, I want to share how we think  about smooth functioning in Treasury and agency MBS markets, and why it is so  critical to the U.S. economy. I’ll focus on what we perceive as two important  characteristics of smoothly functioning markets: liquidity and efficient  pricing. 5\n\nLiquidity comes in many forms.  One form of liquidity is the availability of financing for existing or new  positions. I think of this as funding  liquidity . Another form of liquidity is the ease with which assets can be  bought and sold, often called market  liquidity . Although these concepts are distinct, they are related and  reinforcing. 6 When funding liquidity is abundant, market participants can finance the  transactions that produce market liquidity. My comments today focus on how we  have used asset purchases to support market liquidity, but I do want to note  that the steps the Federal Reserve took at the same time to support funding  markets almost certainly contributed to market liquidity. In fact, funding  markets are now functioning quite well. As a result, as you can see in Figure 3 , which is a close-up of my  previous chart, our repo book has rolled off over recent months and is now down  to zero, and usage of most other funding programs has also diminished.\n\nLiquid markets allow participants to transact quickly  and at low cost, so they can easily adjust their positions in response to their  own changing circumstances or broader economic developments. In normal conditions,  the markets for Treasury securities and MBS are highly liquid. Confidence in  the liquidity of Treasuries persuades investors to accept lower yields on these  securities, 7 and because Treasury interest rates are a benchmark for many other rates, these  lower yields ultimately reduce borrowing costs for families, businesses, and state  and local governments. Similarly, the liquidity of agency MBS helps investors  to transact quickly and efficiently in residential mortgage loans, which  results in lower mortgage interest rates for households. Supporting the  liquidity of these markets has been an important component of the Federal  Reserve’s actions to bolster the flow of credit and the effective transmission  of monetary policy during the pandemic.\n\nTurning  to efficient pricing, one can always  debate whether any given asset price is right. However, we generally expect  prices of instruments with identical or very similar cash flows to be closely  connected, so opportunities for arbitrage are limited, and relative value  spreads are small. In smoothly functioning markets, if prices of related  instruments diverge, arbitrageurs sell the securities with high prices and buy  those with low prices, profiting from the difference and pushing the prices back  together. When arbitrage breaks down, the resulting mispricings make financial  markets less useful for risk management and investment, which can ultimately  restrict the flow of capital in the economy.\n\nIn  practice, market liquidity is never perfect, and pricing discrepancies are  never entirely eliminated. Liquidity providers—who buy securities from clients  who wish to sell, and then look for other clients who wish to buy—are  compensated for this service in the form of bid-ask spreads or other transaction  costs. Likewise, investors do not exploit all arbitrage opportunities, because  arbitrage typically requires capital and funding and entails transaction costs,  as well as the risk of loss if the price difference widens rather than narrows.  As a result, prices of closely related securities can sometimes diverge. Still,  when the Treasury and agency MBS markets are functioning smoothly, transaction  costs and price divergences should typically be small.\n\nMarkets  are complex. No one indicator can show whether a given market is functioning  smoothly. On the Desk, we use a suite of complementary categories of indicators  to assess the functioning of Treasury and agency MBS markets. Without diving too  deeply into these indicators, I’ve summarized the categories in Figure 4 . The first category includes direct measures of liquidity , such as  bid-ask spreads, price impact coefficients and market depth. 8 The second category  includes direct measures of relative  value , such as the Treasury cash-futures basis, on-the-run spreads, spline  errors, and MBS-Treasury yield spreads . The  remaining categories contain indirect metrics. Instead of showing how well  markets are functioning, these metrics reveal forces that can lead to  breakdowns of liquidity and efficient pricing. In particular, we look at measures of trading pressure, which can  show whether there is an imbalance between the volume of sales and the volume  of purchases, and at the results of our  open market operations, which can provide signals about the intensity of  market participants’ desire to sell securities as well as other market  conditions.\n\nHow Have  the Federal Reserve’s Asset Purchases Supported Smooth Market Functioning?\n\nThe  extreme shock to the economy and financial markets as the pandemic spread in  early March led to a swift and severe deterioration in the functioning of the  Treasury and MBS markets. Pessimism and uncertainty about the economic outlook  as large segments of the economy were shut down, combined with concerns about  markets’ ability to keep functioning in a remote environment, resulted in a  strong desire for cash. In addition, the extreme volatility and its effect on  risk metrics and margins meant that some normally profitable trades were no  longer viable.\n\nInvestors  and asset managers responded by rebalancing their portfolios, deleveraging, and  acquiring the most liquid short-dated assets. In this environment, we saw a  historically large flow of investor sales of Treasuries, as shown in Figure 5 , as well as MBS. There were  also notable sales by foreign reserve managers, whose Treasury securities held  in custody at the Fed, shown in Figure 6 ,  fell sharply during March. The flow strained the capacity of dealers and other  liquidity providers to intermediate on normal terms. The challenges were  particularly notable in off-the-run Treasuries, a sector where some dealers at  times were reportedly reluctant to make markets at all. As a result, market  functioning indicators were quite poor, as illustrated in Figure 7 . Bid-ask spreads for Treasuries, in the left panel , and for agency MBS, in the right panel , both showed extraordinary  increases. Relative value measures also widened notably, with prices appearing  to diverge from fundamentals in some cases, as demonstrated by the Treasury cash-futures  basis in Figure 8 . 9\n\nAt  the FOMC’s direction, the Desk rapidly ramped up asset purchases to address these  conditions. For the first few weeks, we had much to learn about how to maximize  the effectiveness of purchases. We quickly adjusted operations based on our  observations, and although it’s fair to say that at first we were mostly  stabilizing market functioning, the purchases soon began to make meaningful  improvements. As I’ll discuss in a moment, I think our flexibility itself  played an important role in supporting market confidence.\n\nI’ve  been pleased to see that the functioning of Treasury and MBS markets has now rebounded  notably. I was also pleased to see that, in the end, financial markets and  infrastructures were able to continue operating even as the industry shifted,  en masse, to working from home. Measures of market liquidity have uniformly  improved and are now well below their worst points, though some remain more  stressed than at the start of the year. In talking with our contacts, we hear  that the lingering effects of the extraordinary volatility in March and the  uncertain financial environment are limiting improvements in some liquidity metrics  by reducing the appetite to take the risks associated with making markets. Relative  value spreads have also narrowed substantially, though as with liquidity, some  metrics remain higher than before the pandemic.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve’s purchases have supported smooth market functioning through  multiple channels. The purchases absorbed some of the flow of sales and helped  restore two-way trading, which supports liquidity. In addition to absorbing a flow of securities, the purchases changed  the stock of assets held by the  private sector. Because the Desk accepts offers on securities with attractive  prices, our operations can have the effect of buying undervalued securities and  reducing price distortions. 10\n\nBut  these direct effects are not the only channels through which we think our  purchases helped. The design of the purchase program also appeared to reduce market  stress. I’d highlight two key aspects of the program in this regard: commitment and flexibility. The FOMC’s unlimited commitment to purchases “in the amounts needed” to support smooth  market functioning was essential. Our market intelligence indicated that some  investors had been selling not because they needed liquidity immediately, but  because they wanted to take precautions against a further deterioration in  market functioning. By providing confidence that the Treasury and MBS markets  would remain liquid, the FOMC’s commitment to purchases reduced this motive for  sales and helped calm the market.\n\nFlexibility , as I noted  earlier, has been another hallmark of our purchases that has helped to support confidence  in smooth functioning of the Treasury and agency MBS markets. For most of the  spring, we issued calendars for our purchases one week at a time, rather than  our usual monthly calendars, and revised these plans even daily when necessary.  As our indicators showed changes in market functioning, we adapted by adjusting  the size of our purchases, the distribution of purchases across sectors, and  even the settlement timing of our agency MBS operations. 11 This flexibility has  allowed us to maximize support for smooth market functioning. Once we saw  improvements in market functioning, we began reducing the pace of our purchases  starting in late March—but we did so gradually to reduce the chance of renewed  disruptions, and we have remained watchful for conditions that would warrant an  increase in purchases.\n\nHow  Will We Sustain Smooth Market Functioning?\n\nBy  the time of the FOMC’s June meeting, we had reduced the pace of purchases to  the equivalent of around $80 billion per month in Treasuries and about $40  billion per month, net of reinvestments, in MBS. 12 The FOMC directed the  Desk in June to continue increasing SOMA holdings at least at this pace to  sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of  monetary policy to broader financial conditions.\n\nAlthough  market functioning has improved markedly since the period of extreme stress in  mid-March, uncertainty about the course of the pandemic makes it prudent to  protect against further shocks. There also are still sectors of the market  where liquidity and pricing have not fully returned to pre-pandemic conditions.  The continued work-from-home posture at many firms, and ongoing uncertainty in  the outlook, appear to have made liquidity providers somewhat more cautious. Purchases  over coming months will help mitigate risks of renewed stress and sustain continued  smooth market functioning.\n\nWith  the shift to a program focused on sustaining smooth market functioning, we are now announcing a monthly purchase amount and  have lengthened our purchase schedules to semi-monthly periods for both  Treasuries and MBS. These longer calendars provide greater foresight into our  purchase plans, allowing dealers to prepare for this activity in the context of  their customer flows. Importantly, though, we will remain vigilant for signs of  deterioration in market functioning and flexible in adjusting our operations as  needed. This strategy will allow us to safeguard the gains we’ve made and support  the continued flow of credit to American families and businesses.\n\nI’d  emphasize in this regard that our assessment of market functioning is focused  on indicators of market liquidity and efficient prices— not on the level of yields. It is certainly the case that the FOMC’s purchases have been absorbing duration and prepayment risk from the market. The total duration included in our Treasury purchases so far represents the equivalent of about $1 trillion in 10-year securities. Although term premiums do not appear to have come down significantly relative to just before the pandemic, our usual analysis indicates that our purchases have offset some upward pressure that could otherwise have occurred, for example as a result of the recent increases in Treasury debt issuance. I expect that the ongoing purchases  will continue to absorb interest rate risk from the market, and that a wide  range of factors other than our purchases will also continue to influence yields  as our current purchases proceed.\n\nOverall,  I am confident that the full range of Federal Reserve programs, including the Treasury  and MBS purchases, will mitigate the ongoing risks to market functioning and sustain  the progress we have seen. The economic and financial shocks resulting from the  pandemic have been truly extreme. The Federal Reserve’s commitment to smooth market  functioning should provide continued confidence amid the ongoing public health and  economic uncertainties.\n\nStill,  considering the crucial role of the Treasury and MBS markets in the financial  system, and their growing size, it is important to ensure that these markets  remain resilient to future shocks. What factors made these markets vulnerable  to the abrupt deterioration in functioning that we saw in March? Could changes  in regulations, data availability, or market infrastructure make market  functioning more robust to future shocks? What role do funding markets play?  These are challenging questions. They will require careful research and  analysis, and they may not have simple answers. Still, the official and private  sectors should be prepared to work together to assess them, and to do what it  takes to ensure the continued strength and good functioning of these important  markets.\n\nThank  you.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Welcome to the 2021 Annual Primary Dealer Meeting.\n\nPrimary dealers play an important role as counterparties in open market operations, providing a key link in the implementation of monetary policy—a core responsibility of the New York Fed as the Reserve Bank selected to operate in financial markets on behalf of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  In addition, primary dealers serve as important participants in U.S. Treasury auctions. I'm glad that we're back together—even  if only virtually—to participate in this annual forum. These meetings  provide an opportunity to strengthen our relationship and communicate our  expectations.\n\nIt was just over a year ago  that the global economy and financial markets were upended by the COVID-19  pandemic, and the Federal Reserve undertook extraordinary actions to respond to  the crisis. Today, I'd like to reflect on the operational approach of  the New York Fed's Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) during the past year,  and some of the lessons I take away from this experience. Moreover, I'd like to  highlight how our operations have transitioned since the onset of the pandemic,  and some of the ways they will continue to evolve to ensure that we implement the FOMC's directives for open market operations in an  effective and efficient manner.\n\nBefore proceeding, let me note that the views  presented here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York  Fed or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe Pandemic Response: Flexible and Adaptive\n\nIn my remarks to this group at the end of 2019, I focused on the FOMC's  approach to implementing an ample reserves regime. 2 We  had set a course to gradually reduce repurchase operations and eventually  maintain an ample level of reserves with regular Treasury purchase operations.\n\nEvents overtook those plans. Our focus shifted abruptly when the onset of the pandemic triggered extraordinary  economic stresses and dislocations in the global financial system. 3 The  Federal Reserve responded with swift and integrated action to support smooth market  functioning and ensure the flow of credit to U.S. households, businesses, and  state and local governments. In addition to conducting large repo  operations and purchasing substantial amounts of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed  securities (MBS), the Federal Reserve expanded FX swap lines and Discount  Window lending, and extended liquidity to critical parts of financial  markets and the economy through special lending and credit facilities. Also,  regulations were temporarily adjusted to encourage bank lending.\n\nOn the Desk, responding to the crisis required an exceptionally  high degree of adaptability and flexibility. For open market operations—both repo  operations and outright purchases—the Desk was broadly directed by the FOMC to  support smooth market functioning. 4 For  Treasuries, agency MBS and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS),  the FOMC directed us to purchase securities in the amounts needed for this  purpose. To comply with these directives, we responded to fast-moving market  developments and adjusted operations as conditions evolved. In reflecting on  the crisis, I believe that both the FOMC's full commitment to market  functioning and the speed, scale and flexibility of our operations were essential  components to a successful response.\n\nOver time, market functioning has improved markedly, and we have  gradually returned to more normal operations: asset purchases now proceed at a  steady pace, regularly-scheduled term repo operations and agency CMBS  operations are no longer being conducted, and the lending authority for all but  one of the 13(3) facilities has expired. Of course, even as some of the  extraordinary measures have been wound down, the FOMC remains committed to using  its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy.\n\nOn the Desk, we continue to adapt our operations to ensure  the effective implementation of the FOMC's directive. Today, I would like to  share some thoughts on how we have returned to more normal operations and how  they will continue to evolve.\n\nAsset Purchases: Ongoing Adjustments to Ensure Efficient and  Effective Implementation\n\nThe FOMC's objective for asset purchases has evolved since  the beginning of the pandemic; whereas purchases were initiated to support  smooth functioning in the markets for Treasuries and agency MBS, over time the  Committee has expanded the objective of purchases to include helping to foster accommodative  financial conditions. Since its meeting in December of last year, the FOMC has directed  the Desk to increase the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities by  at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per  month and has stated that it will continue to increase these holdings until  substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum  employment and price stability goals.\n\nAs the Desk considers how to  approach operations, we first and foremost seek to carry out the FOMC  directive in an efficient and effective manner. In doing so, there are  important operational choices to be made. The Desk's  approach to these choices is guided by key principles, a few of which I would  like to highlight today. First, we aim to be transparent, providing information  to market participants and the public to ensure fairness and promote  understanding of our purchase operations. We also seek to obtain securities at  competitive and appropriate prices for the Federal Reserve, as this will  ultimately benefit the U.S. taxpayer. In addition, unless otherwise appropriate  for efficient and effective implementation under the directive, we endeavor to  operate in a manner that is relatively neutral to the securities available for  purchase and in a way that limits the potential for our operations to affect normal  market functioning. In practice, we follow this principle by purchasing  Treasury securities across sectors in approximate proportion to the universe of  Treasury securities outstanding and by concentrating our purchases of agency  MBS in recently produced securities. I would like to discuss a few changes that  we have made or are planning in the Desk's Treasury, agency MBS, and agency  CMBS operations that help us adhere to these guiding principles.\n\nTreasury Purchase Operations\n\nLast March, when conditions were highly disrupted in the  U.S. Treasury market, we purchased a wide range of securities to address broad  market dysfunction—and, at times, we weighted purchases more heavily toward sectors  in which conditions were especially strained. Adjustments made to the size and  composition of purchases were announced in the Desk's purchase calendars, often  released multiple times a week.\n\nAs market conditions stabilized, we adjusted purchase  allocations to be roughly proportional to the amounts outstanding across the  nominal Treasury coupon and TIPS coupon curves, and we lengthened the purchase  calendars to provide more predictability in our planned operations.\n\nAs our Treasury purchases transitioned to a more  proportional allocation, there were still sectors of the curve that we  refrained from purchasing. For example, the Desk generally has avoided purchasing  bills, both to avoid increasing scarcity value in these securities arising from  strong investor demand and because bill purchases have relatively little impact  on financial conditions. 5\n\nEven in this steadier operating regime, we continue to adjust  our purchase approach consistent with our principles. For example, we conduct  periodic reviews of our allocations across purchase sectors and make modest changes  in response to the evolving market environment. During the past year, issuance of  Treasury securities has increased markedly as the U.S. Treasury has sought to  fund pandemic-related fiscal stimulus expenditures. Even with this new issuance,  the distribution of Treasury coupons outstanding has been fairly stable given  the large outstanding stock of Treasury debt. However, modest shifts have occurred.  In particular, the introduction of the 20-year Treasury bond has increased  amounts outstanding around the 20-year maturity point. In addition, the pace of  increase in TIPS issuance has been slower relative to nominal coupon securities.  With net issuance expected to remain high in the near term, we anticipate that the  composition of outstanding supply will continue to evolve. As a result, we plan  to make minor technical adjustments to our purchase sectors and increase the  frequency at which we update purchase allocations to remain roughly  proportional to the outstanding supply of nominal coupon securities and TIPS. We  expect to announce these as a part of a normal purchase calendar release in coming  months.\n\nAgency MBS\n\nOur agency MBS  operations starting last March were also initially driven by the need to support  smooth market functioning. Purchases focused at first on a broad range of  coupon securities in the outstanding universe of agency MBS that came under intense  selling pressure. Our operations also included purchases for near-term  settlement to help ease pressures on dealer balance sheets, which is different  than the Desk's usual practice of purchasing in the forward-settling market.\n\nAs conditions  normalized, agency MBS purchases returned to a more neutral allocation roughly in line  with recently produced agency MBS coupons in the to-be-announced (TBA)  market. These agency MBS coupons represent the most liquid and readily  available supply and their purchase is least likely to cause settlement frictions  in the agency MBS market. Their yields are also most closely tied to primary  mortgage rates. The recent rise in longer-term Treasury yields and primary  mortgage rates has shifted origination into agency MBS with relatively higher  coupons, and our purchases have followed suit.\n\nThe recent increase  in interest rates will also have implications for the timing of purchases and the  amounts of securities purchased relative to supply. We reinvest our monthly agency  MBS proceeds after paydowns are received, and in the near term these purchases  may continue at a robust pace. In contrast, agency MBS origination volumes are  expected to decline because of the recent increase in mortgage rates. This temporary  difference between the amount of our reinvestments and origination volumes will  diminish as the prepayments in our portfolio also slow down because of higher mortgage  interest rates. However, in the meantime, we will be closely monitoring for possible  signs that market participants are experiencing difficulty delivering enough  agency MBS pools into forward TBA contracts and will adjust the forward settlement  date of our purchases accordingly.\n\nIf needed, the  Desk can also conduct dollar roll transactions to facilitate the orderly  settlement of securities purchases. These operations help limit the potential  for the Desk's purchases to disrupt normal market functioning by rolling forward  the settlement month of securities that may be showing signs of short-term  scarcity. 6 We recently enhanced the transparency  of dollar roll operations by releasing the  results on the  New York Fed's website on the same day that the operations occur, rather than  weekly. This change provides more timely information to all market participants.\n\nFinally, it is fitting to conclude  the discussion of our asset purchases by noting the end of regularly scheduled agency  CMBS operations. During the pandemic, the FOMC directed the Desk to purchase  agency CMBS for the first time to help address the dislocations in that market.  Given the ongoing stabilization in this  market, we recently ceased regularly scheduled operations in agency CMBS.\n\nEven as the  crisis has receded and our operations have normalized, we remain ready to adjust  our operations as needed to sustain smooth market functioning, as directed by  the FOMC. This could include changing the size or composition of our Treasury  and agency MBS purchases or even recommencing purchases of agency CMBS, if  needed. As I noted earlier, fulfilling the directive from the FOMC is our first  priority.\n\nMoney  Markets: The New Normal\n\nI'd like to turn now to money markets. Many of the extraordinary measures taken to address dysfunction in dollar funding markets associated with the pandemic have also gradually wound down. The Desk's remaining term repo operations were phased out in February, the frequency of some central bank swap line operations was reduced last summer, and the lending authority of the 13(3) funding facilities related to money markets has expired.\n\nNonetheless, the  FOMC's ongoing asset purchases continue to lift bank reserves to new  highs, and an environment of elevated reserves is likely to be the new normal  for an extended period. 7 Fortunately, the Federal Reserve's ample reserves framework is well-suited for  managing short-term interest rates in environments associated with a wide range  of reserve levels. In fact, the rapid increase in assets and the resulting  expansion of reserves that have occurred during the pandemic are the types of  actions the FOMC contemplated when choosing an ample reserves regime. While this  shift to operating at much higher reserve levels has been smooth, the Federal  Reserve is always prepared to make adjustments to ensure effective policy  implementation.\n\nMost recently, the growth in reserves has contributed  to a decline in overnight rates relative to interest on excess reserves (IOER).  The effective federal funds rate and other overnight unsecured rates have  softened modestly, while we have observed more pronounced downward pressure on  overnight repo rates. The large size of secured market investors, such as  government money market funds (MMFs) and government sponsored enterprises,  combined with recent reductions in the investments available for these  investors, such as Treasury bills, have put particular downward pressure on  repo and bill rates.\n\nIn this environment, the overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility  is likely to become an increasingly important element of our operating  framework. The ON RRP facility helps place a floor on overnight rates by offering a  broad range of money market investors an alternative risk-free investment option.  The availability of this facility is especially important because nonbanks  represent a substantial proportion of the U.S. financial system and money  markets, but do not have access to interest-bearing reserves at the Federal  Reserve. Additionally, the facility can alleviate downward pressure on money  market rates associated with reserve growth by broadening the liabilities that  support balance sheet expansion. The ON RRP has historically been an effective  floor for the federal funds rate and has also supported other short-term  interest rates, and we expect it will continue to do so in the future.\n\nAs a measure of prudent planning, the Desk recently conducted a review of key  design features of the ON RRP to ensure that the facility supports effective policy  implementation. Notably, assets under management at government MMFs—a major  group of money market investors—have increased significantly and become more  concentrated at the largest funds since the facility's $30 billion per-counterparty  limit was set in 2014. In light of these changes, the FOMC recently increased the per-counterparty limit on ON RRP usage to $80 billion which restores the capacity of the facility relative to the assets under management at our MMF counterparties to roughly the level that existed when the $30 billion limit was established.\n\nStaff also  reviewed access to the facility and concluded that the existing counterparty  types are still representative of the universe of repo market investors. However,  the review also presented an opportunity to consider potential adjustments in  line with the New York Fed's broader efforts to ensure that our counterparty policies  promote a fair and competitive marketplace—a topic that we'll be exploring  further in today's panel discussion. Expanding counterparty eligibility can  reduce barriers to entry and foster inclusivity by potentially making our  operations accessible to smaller firms. A more vibrant and diverse marketplace  could, in turn, strengthen the effectiveness of monetary policy implementation  tools. In this regard, we expect in  coming months to reduce the size and activity thresholds for ON RRP counterparty  eligibility, which will help achieve these goals.\n\nThis is part of  the Federal Reserve's ongoing commitment to support diversity, inclusion, and  opportunity, following the expanded counterparty access for certain 13(3)  facilities and agency CMBS operations. Relaxing eligibility criteria helps bring  a diverse set of firms by size, business model, and ownership into our  counterparty base, and we look forward to leveraging these new business  relationships to also broaden our market intelligence efforts.\n\nAs a final note on money markets, in addition to ensuring  that the ON RRP's terms continue to support effective policy implementation,  the Federal Reserve may consider adjusting administered rates if undue downward  pressure on overnight rates emerges, as noted in the minutes of the March FOMC  meeting released yesterday. The Federal Reserve has adjusted administered rates  within the target range on numerous occasions in recent years as conditions in  overnight markets have changed. Such adjustments are purely technical steps to  support effective policy implementation and to maintain the federal  funds rate well within the target range.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, we have gradually returned to more normal operations amid greatly improved financial market conditions. The Desk has continued to adapt its  operations to ensure that it meets the FOMC's directive. In addition, we have sought  to adjust the way open market operations are carried out to be consistent with  our principles of transparency, transacting in a way that will ultimately  benefit the U.S. taxpayer, and limiting the potential to  disrupt normal market functioning as a result of our operations.\n\nAs will be discussed in a panel later today, the New York  Fed also remains engaged with efforts to advance the important goal of enhancing  market resiliency through both our sponsorship of the Treasury Market Practices  Group (TMPG) and our support of the LIBOR transition as co-convener of the  Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) and producer of the Secured  Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). Our partnership with each of your institutions  remains an important part of the effective and efficient implementation of  policy and of ensuring financial market stability and resiliency.",

    "text": "Thank you to the Money  Marketeers of New York University for inviting me to speak today. 1\n\nMoney markets are  vital to the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses, and central to  the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy implementation. For nearly 75 years, the  Money Marketeers has been an essential forum for discussing critical issues  related to money markets. I am pleased that this group is continuing to meet  virtually in these challenging times, allowing this important dialogue to continue.  I look forward to our discussion.\n\nWhen I last spoke with  this group in April 2019, I talked about the recent decision by the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC) to maintain an ample reserves regime as its  long-run framework for implementing monetary policy. 2 An ample reserves regime is  a version of a “floor” system in which reserves are supplied in sufficient  quantity to ensure that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term  interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal  Reserve's administered rates. At the time, I noted two key benefits that the  FOMC highlighted in choosing this framework. First, it provides effective  control over short-term interest rates in a broad range of environments, including  during periods when large amounts of liquidity are needed to relieve stress in  the financial system or large-scale asset purchases are required to support the  U.S. economy. 3 And, second, from an operational perspective, a steady-state ample reserves  regime can be simple and efficient to operate.\n\nHowever, in March, the  global financial system experienced an extraordinary shock, triggered by the  coronavirus pandemic, and our focus shifted rapidly. The Federal Reserve took  swift and decisive action to address the shift in the economic outlook and  deteriorating conditions in financial markets. The FOMC cut the target range  for the federal funds rate close to zero, and directed the Desk to conduct repo  operations and purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities  (MBS) to support market functioning. The Federal Reserve undertook a wide range  of additional steps—many in coordination with the U.S. Treasury—to support the  flow of credit to the U.S. economy, and coordinated with foreign central banks  to stabilize dollar funding conditions. Some regulations were also temporarily  adjusted to encourage bank lending. These measures, alongside swift and  forceful fiscal policy action, succeeded in stabilizing financial markets and  averted an even deeper collapse in economic activity. 4\n\nAlthough the pandemic  shock itself was unprecedented, the responses that it required—a rapid increase  in assets and expansion of liquidity—were the type of actions the FOMC contemplated  when choosing an ample reserves regime. And, as expected, the shift to operating  at much higher reserve levels has been smooth, allowing the FOMC to focus on  supporting the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Today I’d like  to talk about this shift to higher reserve levels and our observations on money  markets so far, and explain why the Federal Reserve’s framework is well suited to  implement policy in this environment.\n\nLet me note that the  views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Impact Has the Federal Reserve’s Pandemic Response Had on the Balance  Sheet and Reserve Balances?\n\nI  would like to start with a review of changes in the Federal Reserve’s balance  sheet since March. It is the size of the balance sheet and composition of  liabilities that determine the level of reserves in the banking system, which,  in turn, has a meaningful influence on money market rates and policy  implementation.\n\nAs  shown in Figure 1 , the Federal Reserve’s balance  sheet grew at a historic pace between  March and June of  this year as a result of the FOMC’s critical actions to support market  functioning and the flow of credit to the U.S. economy. Most of the increase resulted from  purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS, shown in dark and light  blue. Expanded repo operations and  central bank liquidity swaps, as well as credit and liquidity facilities  established with the support of the U.S. Treasury—collectively shown in gray—also contributed to this growth. 5 More recently, the rate of growth  in the balance sheet has slowed. With market functioning significantly improved,  outstanding balances across funding operations and credit and liquidity facilities  have gradually declined, and the pace of net Treasury and agency MBS purchases  has been steady since June.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve expands its assets, reserves in the  banking system increase. This is  mechanical; for example, when the Desk purchases securities from dealers, the  Federal Reserve funds these purchases by crediting the reserve accounts of  dealers’ custodian banks. 6 As shown in dark blue in Figure 2 , reserves in the banking system grew rapidly  during the spring, and have reached a level of over $3 trillion, exceeding the prior  peak in reserves, which occurred in 2014. 7\n\nIn addition to supplying reserves to the banking system, the  Federal Reserve maintains an account for the U.S. government, known as the  Treasury General Account (TGA), as well as accounts for other domestic and  foreign official entities. 8 Increases in the balances held in these accounts alter the composition of  liabilities on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and reduce the level of  reserves in the banking system. For example, when investors purchase Treasury  debt, funds are transferred from their bank accounts to the TGA.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2 , the  TGA has risen dramatically since March, as the Treasury Department built cash  balances to prepare for potentially unprecedented outflows related to the  pandemic response. 9 Treasury’s cash management policy is motivated by precautionary risk management  and calibrated to allow Treasury to cover outflows in case of a temporary  interruption to market access. 10 The  TGA currently stands at roughly $1.5 trillion, nearly four times its largest size  prior to this year. This  balance is generally expected to fall in the coming months and, while the  extent of the decline is uncertain, most expect the balance to remain well  above historical norms.\n\nCurrency in circulation is another liability that affects  the level of reserves. The pandemic increased the public’s demand for currency,  likely for both precautionary and transactional purposes. As a result, currency  has grown at a rapid pace compared to prior years, increasing by approximately  $250 billion since March.\n\nGrowth in the TGA, currency, and other non-reserve  liabilities has muted the growth in reserves since March; reserve balances  would have been about $1.6 trillion higher had these other liabilities remained  unchanged. In effect, this increase in non-reserve liabilities has broadened the  funding of the expansion in Federal Reserve assets beyond reserves held by the banking  system.\n\nBefore I move on, I want to highlight one other Federal  Reserve liability: the overnight reverse repo, or ON RRP, which currently has  no outstanding balance. Unlike other  non-reserve liabilities, the overnight reverse repo is used directly as a tool in  the Federal Reserve’s operating framework to ensure effective interest rate  control. A broad range of money market participants can invest funds in the ON  RRP at a fixed rate, placing a floor under overnight interest rates.\n\nHow Has the Historic Increase in Reserves Affected Money Markets?\n\nTo highlight how reserve supply influences money market rates, Figure 3 shows a stylized depiction of the relationship between the overnight interest  rate and banks’ demand for reserves.\n\nPrior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the Federal Reserve operated  a regime in which just enough reserves were supplied to meet banks’ reserve  requirements and payment needs. In this environment, depicted to the left, the  marginal bank borrowed at rates above the interest rate earned on reserves—which  at the time was zero—to ensure sufficient balances were maintained to cover  payment needs.\n\nIn an ample reserves framework, reserves are instead supplied in an  amount that leaves most banks with reserve balances above what they need for  payments purposes. As a result, many are comfortable investing excess balances  when the return on other high-quality liquid assets is above the interest paid  on excess reserves (IOER), and also taking deposits at rates near IOER. 11 In  effect, IOER sets a benchmark for short-term lending and borrowing. This  environment is represented by the part of the reserve demand curve that flattens  out with rates near IOER, depicted to the right. 12\n\nHowever, when reserves are supplied well beyond what banks require  for payments purposes, many may perceive increasing balance sheet costs associated  with taking on additional reserves. In this environment, the marginal bank borrows  at overnight rates below IOER, as it requires additional compensation to grow its  balance sheet further. 13 We  might consider reserves at this point to be in abundant supply. Even when  reserves are abundant, IOER retains its strong influence on rates, although federal  funds and many other overnight money market instruments trade at a spread below  IOER.\n\nSo where are we currently on this graphic?\n\nAs I’ve described, the supply of reserves has been shifting significantly  to the right along this curve. Given this, we may have expected money market rates  to be lower than they currently are, reflecting more of an abundance of  reserves. However, as shown in Figure 4 , the effective federal funds rate has  remained relatively close to IOER in recent months—much closer than it was when  reserves were at similar levels in 2014.\n\nI’d highlight two main factors that are contributing to this  difference.\n\nFirst, banks’ reserve management practices appear to have shifted since  March. Figure 5 shows federal funds rates relative to IOER for different levels  of aggregate reserves, over the last 10 years, with observations this year shown  by the light and dark red dots. Since March, rates have been higher relative to  IOER than was the case during the earlier period of abundant reserves, shown by  the light blue dots representing observations in 2014 and 2015.\n\nSome of the light red dots represent observations during the highly  uncertain days of March, when some banks paid elevated rates to maintain precautionary  reserve balances in the face of extraordinary customer demand for liquidity. To  better understand this dynamic, the Federal Reserve Board included new questions  in the most recent Senior Financial Officer Survey (SFOS), which is a survey of  commercial banks that collectively hold around three-fourths of the reserves in  the system. Banks that increased their reserve balances from February to April  confirmed that a strong desire to hold precautionary liquidity against  potential customer credit line draws or deposit outflows drove the increase. 14 The results of this survey were released to the public yesterday and are  available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website.\n\nInterestingly, even as this elevated market uncertainty has receded  and reserve levels have continued to increase, rates have remained near IOER,  as indicated by the dark red dots. It could be that a greater comfort among  domestic banks to hold higher reserve balances, at least for now, is  contributing to rates continuing to trade near IOER. In the SFOS, the banks  with higher reserve holdings since April indicated that their increase was  motivated by a desire to maintain a buffer against deposit outflows, as well as  the absence of attractive risk-adjusted investment alternatives. 15 As  shown in Figure 6 , the growth in reserve balances has been particularly notable  for the U.S. global systemically important banks (GSIBs) and large domestic  banks that typically accumulate deposits. 16 These  banks collectively hold a much higher share of reserves than during the post-GFC  period, when foreign banking organizations (FBOs) absorbed a greater share of  the reserve increase. 17\n\nA second,  and likely important factor, contributing to the higher level of rates relative  to IOER is the significant increase in Treasury’s net bill issuance this year  to fund fiscal stimulus, shown in Figure 7 . Although Treasury bills are  external to our stylized reserve demand curve, they are highly liquid and safe investment  instruments, and an increase in the supply of Treasury bills tends to raise  rates on a range of money market instruments that lenders consider to be  substitute investments.  Indeed, analysis by New York Fed colleagues finds that, controlling for changes in  reserves, an increase of $1 trillion in the supply of short-term Treasury  securities raises the spread of the effective federal funds rate relative to IOER  by about three basis points. 18 This helps explain some of the firmness in money market rates in recent months.\n\nIt is  also possible that the configuration of the Federal Reserve’s administered  rates within the target range has influenced the relative firmness in rates at  times. The current spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates is narrower than  during the earlier period of abundant reserves. Because of this, it would not have  been possible for the effective federal funds rate to trade as far below IOER  as it did during the 2014 to 2016 period, although this does not likely explain  why rates are as close to IOER as they currently are.\n\nWhere Do Money Market Rates Go From Here?\n\nReserves over the near term seem likely to continue to grow,  albeit at a slower pace than during the spring of this year. The degree and rate  of growth will depend, in large part, on the path of asset purchases that the  FOMC chooses. For example, in the Desk’s November Surveys of Primary Dealers  and Market Participants, the median respondent expected net Treasury and agency  MBS purchases to continue at the current pace through the end of next year  before slowing in subsequent years. In addition, as I noted above, most market participants  expect the Treasury Department to draw down the TGA balance over the medium  term. Together, changes in Federal Reserve assets and liabilities such as these  could add significant reserves to the banking system.\n\nEven as aggregate reserve levels are expected to grow, many  banks have suggested they will increasingly take actions to limit the growth in  their own reserves. We have already heard from some banks that compression in net  interest margins and changes in their regulatory ratios associated with higher  reserve levels are making additional reserve growth less attractive for them. 19 Indeed, even as market participants broadly expect reserve levels to increase  in coming months, the majority of SFOS respondents expected their own reserve  levels to be stable or decline, as shown in Figure 8 . Many of these respondents  reported that they intend to let wholesale funding and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB)  advances run off, and to lower the rates they offer on certain deposits. It is  important to note that these types of business changes take time to implement. So,  even if reserves were to stay near current levels, these actions could put  downward pressure on market rates.\n\nOf course, as I described above, reserves  remain in the banking system unless they are absorbed by growth in another  Federal Reserve liability, or Federal Reserve assets decrease. The system is  closed. Actions taken by individual banks to limit reserve growth can redistribute  reserves to banks that have more capacity to absorb them, and money market  rates adjust until banks in aggregate eventually demand the total amount of reserves  being supplied.\n\nDuring the 2010 to 2014 period, as  rates declined, FBOs absorbed a significant amount of reserves, in part by  taking on additional deposits from money market mutual funds. FBOs are natural  borrowers in wholesale deposit markets and faced lower balance sheet costs  associated with reserve growth than domestic depository institutions. 20 It remains to be seen, however, if these banks will be as comfortable taking  additional reserves in the current environment, or if other banks will step in  to absorb reserve growth should rates fall.\n\nGoing forward, it seems likely that some of the factors that  have been supporting rates this year—the increase in the TGA, highly elevated  bill issuance, and domestic banks’ apparent comfort with reserve growth to date—will  moderate or reverse. We will continue to monitor money markets closely to assess  evolving conditions.\n\nHow Will the Fed’s Tools Work to  Maintain Interest Rate Control?\n\nAs I noted above, the Federal Reserve has two important  tools that can help maintain control over the federal funds rate and other short-term  rates in this environment. IOER sets a benchmark against which banks evaluate short-term  borrowing and lending opportunities, and this in turn passes through to other  money market rates. When rates fall below IOER, the ON RRP maintains a floor on  overnight rates by offering a broad range of money market investors an  alternative risk-free investment option. 21\n\nOn occasion, the Federal Reserve has adjusted these  administered rates to influence where the effective federal funds rate falls  within the target range. Since 2018, the Federal Reserve has made five such adjustments  to IOER and, as shown in Figure 9 , each time the effective federal funds rate moved  in line with the adjustment, demonstrating IOER’s strong influence. In instances  where rates have drifted lower relative to IOER, the ON RRP has maintained a  strong floor. 22 Since  2016, the effective federal funds rate has not traded below the target range, even  on balance sheet reporting dates when there can be strong downward pressure on  rates.\n\nAs shown in Figure 9 , IOER is currently set at 10 basis  points, well below the top of the target range. If undue downward pressure on  rates were to emerge, the Federal Reserve could adjust IOER higher to lift  overnight rates. Even if this downward pressure persisted, the ON RRP would  maintain a strong floor by providing an alternative investment for money market  participants and, if needed, by reducing the quantity of reserves held by the  banking system to relieve pressure on bank balance sheets. The Desk has over 120  counterparties to the ON RRP, representing a large majority of investors in the  triparty repo market, giving this tool broad coverage to accomplish these  objectives. 23\n\nOf  course, we will respond to the environment as it evolves. The Federal Reserve  stands ready to adjust the terms of the ON RRP and parameters of other tools as  needed to ensure their efficacy.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nIn conclusion, I have been pleased that the FOMC’s implementation  framework was able to support actions taken to address the pandemic, by  smoothly accommodating a shift to much higher reserve levels. Given this significant  increase in reserves, we might have expected money market rates to trade lower  in the FOMC’s target range relative to IOER than they have, similar to the earlier  experience with abundant reserves.\n\nHowever, the factors that supported rates this year—the  increase in the TGA, highly elevated bill issuance, and domestic banks’  apparent comfort with reserve growth to date—may moderate in 2021. As a result,  rates could fall, reflecting an abundance of reserves. If this softness in  rates emerges, it could help the financial system accommodate the growth in  reserves by encouraging some banks to take on additional balances. Even if more  persistent downward pressure on rates emerges, we are confident that the Federal  Reserve has tools to ensure effective control over the federal  funds rate and other short-term interest rates across the broad range of  potential outcomes.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Good  afternoon. As members of the Foreign Exchange Committee, you are all well aware  of the importance of well-functioning financial markets. I would like to thank  you for the commitment you have shown to supporting the smooth functioning of  the foreign exchange market. Your continued leadership is especially important  in these challenging times. And we are all grateful to those who are putting  themselves in harm’s way on the front lines to take care of others during this  unprecedented public health emergency.\n\nIn  early to mid-March, amid extreme volatility across financial markets triggered  by the coronavirus pandemic, several markets at the center of the U.S.  financial system were severely disrupted. In short-term funding markets, it was  difficult to borrow for longer than overnight. In the usually very liquid  markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS),  trading became impaired. In investment-grade credit markets, even healthy  borrowers found that credit was unavailable or very expensive.\n\nThese  markets matter not only for those who participate in them, but also—because of  their central role in the financial system—for workers and families throughout  the United States. Continued disruptions could quickly make it more difficult  for families to obtain mortgages at reasonable interest rates, for businesses to  fund their operations and pay their workers, and for local, state, and federal governments  to pay for essential services. Such a credit crunch would exacerbate the  hardships many are experiencing in this period of economic constraint necessary  to fight the spread of the coronavirus, and reduce the odds of a strong  recovery afterward.\n\nTherefore,  it was important for the Federal Reserve to act quickly and decisively to support  market functioning and the flow of credit. Over a period of a few weeks, the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the federal funds  rate to near zero. The Federal Reserve also announced a sequence of strong  actions to support the flow of funding in short-term markets, the functioning  of Treasury and MBS markets, and the availability of credit to households,  businesses, and state and local governments.\n\nToday,  I will provide an overview of these actions to date from my perspective as manager  of the System Open Market Account and head of the New York Fed’s Open Market  Trading Desk. The Fed’s recent actions have involved an unprecedented array of  tools—from standard open market operations conducted by the Desk and deployed  on a larger scale than ever before, to new facilities that use the Federal  Reserve’s emergency powers with the consent of the Treasury Secretary and  financial backing from the Treasury and Congress. Some actions targeted problems  in a single market, while others worked to support functioning across many  markets. In addition, because they were deployed in close succession, the  actions reinforced each other, with improvements in each market supporting the  functioning of other markets and the financial system overall. I will speak  about recent actions to support liquidity and the flow of credit in four areas:  domestic short-term funding markets, international dollar funding markets,  markets for Treasuries and MBS, and credit markets.\n\nBefore  I proceed, let me note that the views I express are my own and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the  Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nDomestic  Short-Term Funding Markets\n\nFunding  markets transfer funds from households and businesses that seek safe, easily  accessible short-term investments to firms that have short-term borrowing  needs. For example, a manufacturing company with a temporary surplus of cash  might invest in a money market mutual fund, planning to take the money back out  in a few weeks to invest in new equipment. In turn, the money market fund might  buy commercial paper issued by another company that needs to cover its payroll,  or it might use a repurchase agreement (or “repo”) to lend to a broker-dealer  that needs to finance an inventory of Treasury securities. The smooth flow of funds  in these markets allows businesses to readily finance their operations and  investors to engage in vibrant trading that keeps a wide range of other markets  working well.\n\nIn  mid-March, short-term funding markets became severely impaired. In repo and  commercial paper markets, there was little term funding available. Even for  overnight borrowing, some market participants paid much higher rates than  usual. Figure 1 shows the Secured  Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is the median rate on certain overnight  repos against Treasury collateral, as well as the 75th and 95th  percentiles of the distribution of these Treasury repo rates. Ordinarily, this distribution  of rates is very tight. However, in the second and third weeks of March, it  widened notably, with some borrowers paying dozens of basis points above the  median, and well above the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate.\n\nThe  initial pressures in funding markets led to further strains. Investors became  reluctant to buy the commercial paper of healthy issuers, for fear that when  the paper came due, the issuers would have difficulty rolling it over into new  paper. Prime money market funds—which invest in commercial paper—saw outflows  of about $150 billion over the month of March as some investors worried that difficulty  selling holdings would eventually prevent the funds from satisfying  withdrawals.\n\nStarting  March 9, the Federal Reserve launched a series of actions to stabilize funding  markets. The first two actions involved expanding the use of standard tools: repo  operations by the Desk and discount window lending by all 12 Reserve Banks.\n\nShortly  thereafter, several additional actions used emergency tools, based on the  Board’s authority to act in unusual and exigent circumstances with consent of  the Treasury Secretary and, in some cases, funding as well:\n\nInternational  Dollar Funding Markets\n\nAs  the world’s preeminent reserve currency, the dollar plays a leading role in  trade and investment far beyond our country’s borders. Banks around the world  borrow dollars in international markets to finance these activities. In  addition, global banks borrow dollars to finance investments in the United  States—lending, that is, to American families, companies, and the U.S. government.  As members of the FX Committee, you are well versed in the importance of  international dollar funding markets.\n\nThese  markets, too, came under severe strain in March. Shown in Figure 2 , the yen-dollar swap basis spread—a measure of the premium  paid to borrow dollars using yen in the foreign exchange market—soared by roughly  200 basis points. Other foreign exchange swap basis spreads also rose sharply,  and foreign exchange swap trading volumes declined. These pressures had the  potential to spill over to domestic funding markets, as international banks can  compete to borrow  dollars in the U.S., as well as the potential to disrupt the flow of credit  from international financial institutions to domestic borrowers.\n\nTo  ease strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets, the Federal Reserve and  other central banks took coordinated actions in March to enhance the provision  of U.S. dollar liquidity through central bank swap lines around the world. These  swap lines are designed to improve liquidity conditions in the United States  and abroad by providing foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver  dollar funding to institutions in their jurisdictions during times of global  funding market stress. This supports activities that rely on access to U.S.  dollar funding, including supplying credit to U.S. borrowers. The Federal  Reserve and the central banks of Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Switzerland,  and the euro area agreed to lower the pricing on the standing swap lines, to supply  dollars at longer tenors in addition to regular one-week operations, and to increase  the frequency of one-week operations. The Federal Reserve also established  temporary swap lines, limited in size, with nine other central banks around the  world.\n\nIn  addition to the swap lines, the Federal Reserve established a temporary repo  facility to allow foreign and international monetary authorities to temporarily  exchange U.S. Treasury securities held in their accounts with the New York Fed for  U.S. dollars. This facility provides those central banks with an alternative  source of dollar funding that they can then lend to institutions in their  jurisdictions. The facility also helps to support the smooth functioning of the  market for U.S. Treasury securities by reducing foreign central banks’ need to  sell these securities outright when private cash and repo markets become  stressed.\n\nMarkets  for Treasury and Mortgage-Backed Securities\n\nThe market for U.S. Treasury  securities is commonly described as the deepest and most liquid in the world. Ordinarily,  it is easy for investors to sell Treasuries quickly and at low cost. This  liquidity adds significantly to the value of Treasury securities, helping the  U.S. government to borrow at low interest rates. As many other interest rates  are priced relative to the safe interest rate on Treasuries, the liquidity of  the Treasury market ultimately reduces financing costs for families and firms  throughout the economy.\n\nAlthough  not as liquid as the Treasury market, the market for agency MBS—pools of  residential mortgages backed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac—is also  ordinarily very liquid. This liquidity makes MBS a more attractive investment,  supporting low mortgage rates and the flow of mortgage financing to American  households.\n\nHowever, in mid-March, liquidity in  Treasuries and MBS dried up. The Desk’s market monitoring and data analysis  suggest that two key factors were at work. First, amid large moves in asset  prices and uncertainty about access to liquidity, many investors sought to sell  bond holdings. Some of these investors, such as asset managers that might need  to meet redemptions, were seeking to raise cash. Others were rebalancing their  portfolios after the sharp fall in equity prices, or exiting positions that  were no longer viable in the highly volatile market conditions. These large  sales of bonds drove up dealers’ inventories of Treasuries and MBS; facing  balance sheet constraints and internal risk limits amid the elevated volatility,  dealers had to cut back on intermediation. Second, volatile market conditions  led some trading firms to step back from the market, further reducing  liquidity. Figure 3 shows the  consequences: The average bid-ask spread for Treasury securities, a measure of  transactions costs, rose by a factor of about 13 over the first few weeks of  March. Many other measures of functioning in the Treasury and MBS markets also  deteriorated.\n\nIn response, the Desk, at the  direction of the FOMC, is undertaking extensive purchases of Treasuries and MBS  to support the functioning of these critical markets. Although asset purchases  are a standard Desk tool, the scale of these purchases has been unparalleled,  totaling about $1.6 trillion in the past four weeks. Also, we are now buying  agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which are pools of  mortgages on apartment buildings and other commercial properties that are backed  by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. As important as the volume of  purchases is the FOMC’s commitment, announced March 23, to purchase whatever  amounts are needed to support smooth market functioning and effective  transmission of monetary policy. 8 Extending a strong commitment  to support market functioning has calmed trading conditions and allayed  the potentially self-fulfilling fear that conditions might deteriorate further.\n\nI should note that supporting smooth  market functioning does not mean restoring every aspect of market functioning  to its level before the coronavirus crisis. Some aspects of liquidity—especially  aspects related to transactions costs and market depth—are importantly affected  by fundamental factors such as how the current extraordinary uncertainty about  the economic outlook influences trading behavior. These aspects of market  functioning may not return all the way to pre-crisis levels for some time, even  as our purchases slow.\n\nNor does supporting smooth market  functioning mean eliminating all volatility. In well-functioning markets,  prices will respond rapidly and efficiently to new information. During the  unprecedented disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, a great deal of  new information arrives every day about the outlook for specific markets, such as  housing, and for the economy as a whole. These changes in the outlook should move  the Treasury and agency MBS markets irrespective of the Federal Reserve’s  purchases.\n\nCredit  Markets\n\nIn normal times, credit markets allow  households and businesses to finance a vast array of activities: buying a car  or a house, attending college, covering a short-term gap between revenue and  expenses, or making a long-term investment in new products or factories. In  this time of economic stress, credit markets are all the more critical, helping  families to borrow rather than forgo necessities, and helping businesses to  keep going, cover their payrolls, and, eventually, make the investments needed  for a strong recovery.\n\nYet  credit markets have come under substantial pressure in recent weeks. For  example, the spread of interest rates on investment-grade corporate bonds  relative to Treasury securities widened by about 250 basis points from late  February to mid-March, as illustrated in Figure 4 .\n\nMuch of that pressure results from significant  changes in the economic outlook: With many businesses temporarily closed and  millions of people losing their jobs, lenders see a greater likelihood that some  borrowers will be unable to repay. But impaired market functioning has also  contributed to the pressures. For example, borrowers often repay their debts by  borrowing anew, but rolling over debt is difficult in a stressed market, so  lenders may conclude that market dysfunction will lead to defaults even by financially  sound borrowers and respond by reducing lending or seeking higher interest  rates. We saw several signs that poor market conditions were contributing to  credit stress in March, including a drop-off in corporate and municipal bond  issuance and large outflows from bond mutual funds.\n\nMany of the Federal Reserve actions  in funding and asset markets that I described earlier are also helping to support  credit markets. For example, the PDCF, CPFF, and MMLF can all provide funding  for loans to creditworthy borrowers such as households, businesses, or local governments,  while MBS purchases support a key market for credit to households.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve Board,  with the consent of the Treasury Secretary and backing provided by the Treasury  and Congress under the CARES Act, has used its emergency authority to announce numerous  steps targeted at other major credit markets. The Primary Market Corporate  Credit Facility (PMCCF) will buy newly issued corporate bonds and syndicated  loans, while the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) will give  investors an outlet to sell corporate bonds—in both cases supporting a key  market for credit to large employers. 9 The Board has also  announced a Main Street Lending Program that will purchase up to $600 billion  in loans to small and midsize businesses, as well as a facility that will  support the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)  by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that make PPP loans to small  businesses. 10 In addition, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) will support  the issuance of securities backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card  loans, small business loans, and other debt, while the Municipal Liquidity  Facility (MLF) will lend up to $500 billion to state and local governments. 11 All of these steps will  help keep credit markets working and credit flowing to qualified borrowers in  response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nConclusion\n\nModern  financial markets are closely connected to one another. Stresses in one market can  easily lead to stresses in others, raising the risk that the financial system  as a whole becomes significantly impaired. For example, if short-term funding  markets are disrupted, otherwise creditworthy borrowers may have difficulty  rolling over their debts—which can make the borrowers more risky and create  pressures in credit markets. The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-’08 showed how  rapidly problems can spread across financial markets and ultimately damage the  economy.\n\nToday’s  crisis is different, having originated outside the financial system, in an  enormous challenge to public health. Yet the lesson of the previous crisis  still applies, and the Federal Reserve has taken it to heart in responding to  the recent stresses in funding markets, Treasury and MBS markets, and credit  markets. By acting quickly and forcefully to support all of these markets at  once, we have been able to stabilize market conditions. Many challenges surely  lie ahead for the economy and financial markets. But the past month demonstrates  that the Federal Reserve will use its tools aggressively to keep markets working  so that credit can flow to households, businesses, and state and local  governments throughout our economy.\n\nThank  you.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me to join this  panel.\n\nThe panel’s topic—what we are normalizing to—is a key issue  facing central banks as they normalize monetary policy after the crisis, and I  hope to bring to this discussion an operational perspective from my position on  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Open Market Trading Desk.  I will highlight three points:  First, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet,  once normalized, is likely to be smaller than it is today but considerably larger  than it was before the crisis, regardless of the type of operating regime the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC or Committee) adopts in the long run.  Second, while the FOMC could maintain  interest rate control through a corridor system for its longer run monetary  policy implementation framework, it would require a lot of learning by doing  and would be unlikely to look like our pre-crisis corridor system.  And third, based on what we’ve learned from  operating a floor system thus far, it appears that this type of system can provide  effective control of rates with operational simplicity.  Before I continue, I should note that the  views presented here are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nLast October, the Federal Reserve began the process of  reducing the size of its balance sheet—a significant milestone in the ongoing  monetary policy normalization process.  Using  a program of progressively increasing caps, we are gradually reducing the Fed’s  securities holdings, which will reduce the supply of reserve balances in the  banking system. 2 This process will continue until reserves  fall to a level that reflects the banking system’s demand for reserve balances  and the FOMC’s decisions about how to implement monetary policy “most efficiently  and effectively,” as noted in the FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and  Plans.\n\nHowever, there remains much uncertainty over what the  “normal” size of the Fed’s longer-run balance sheet will be and how long it  will take to get there.  This uncertainty  arises from numerous sources:  We don’t  know how fast our MBS holdings will pay down, how quickly currency outstanding  will grow, how many bank reserves will be required for the efficient and  effective execution of monetary policy, or how other liability items on the  Fed’s balance sheet will evolve.  The  economic outlook also poses an ever-present source of uncertainty.\n\nAlthough the Committee has not yet specified what a  normalized balance sheet will look like, market participants’ expectations may  provide some helpful context.  The New  York Fed’s most recent annual report on open market operations (released just a  few weeks ago) presents a set of projections for possible paths of the Fed’s  securities portfolio. 3 As seen in Figure 1 , the report shows three scenarios constructed from distributions  of market participants’ surveyed expectations for the future size of the  balance sheet. 4 Survey-based expectations for the path of  interest rates and some staff modeling fill in additional details.  While these scenarios by no means embody the  full range of possible outcomes, they suggest the domestic securities portfolio’s  size could normalize at $2.5 trillion to $3.3 trillion, with the larger end of  that range projected to be reached within two years.  After its normalized size is reached, the  portfolio is assumed to incrementally grow again as Treasury securities are  purchased to keep pace with trend growth in liabilities, mainly currency. 5\n\nThe projection exercise illustrates a key point:  The Fed’s future balance sheet will likely be  considerably larger than its pre-crisis level.   This outcome is likely regardless of the design of the operating regime  that the Committee ultimately uses to manage short-term interest rates.  The normalized size will be determined by the  liability side of the Fed’s balance sheet, which will reflect two driving factors:  Growth in non-reserve liabilities, and a potential  shift in the structural demand for reserves.\n\nFirst, there has been substantial growth in the Federal  Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities in recent years, and some factors are  expected to grow further, as seen in Figure 2 .  U.S. dollar currency in circulation tends to grow  over time and has more than doubled since the start of the global financial crisis,  to a current level of $1.6 trillion. 6 The median survey response implies an  expectation for currency to grow to around $1.8 trillion at the time the size  of the portfolio normalizes—in other words, the portfolio will need to be $1  trillion larger than before the crisis just to back currency in  circulation.  Meanwhile, various account  holders—including the Treasury Department, foreign and international official  institutions, government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), and designated financial  market utilities (DFMUs)—have increased their balances held in Federal Reserve  accounts or investment services, which currently represent over $700 billion in  additional liabilities.\n\nSecond, it is likely there has been a shift in the structural  demand for reserves, driven largely by banks’ response to changes in  regulations and risk appetite that favor safe assets, particularly  reserves.  If the demand curve for  reserves has indeed shifted out, the amount of reserves the Federal Reserve  will need to supply to achieve a given interest rate target will be comparably  larger than it once was.\n\nThe FOMC acknowledged in last June’s addendum to its Policy  Normalization Principles and Plans that it anticipates a future level of  reserve balances that is “appreciably below that seen in recent years but  larger than before the financial crisis.” 7 In the three projection scenarios I’ve shown,  reserve balances (as derived from market participants’ expectations) are  assumed to be around $400 billion, $600 billion, and $750 billion once a  normalized balance sheet size is reached, well below the current level of $2 trillion  and consistent with the Committee’s statement.   However, we have insufficient information to identify what factors  inform these views.\n\nTaking reserves and non-reserve liabilities together, I see virtually  no chance of going back to the pre-crisis balance sheet size of $800 billion.  Thus, discussion of whether to have a large  or small balance sheet in the long run partly misses the point.  The conversation is really about the relative  amount of reserves, which will be governed both by the banking system’s demand  for reserve balances—something we will learn more about during the process of  balance sheet normalization—and by the Committee’s future decisions around how  to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively.\n\nDebates about monetary policy implementation regimes generally  center on two frameworks, illustrated in stylized form in Figure 3 .  The traditional framework—a  version of which the Fed used before the crisis—is a corridor system, which is  generally associated with a scarce supply of reserves.  Policy is implemented through frequent  adjustments to the supply of reserves, such that the supply intersects the  steep portion of the reserve demand curve at the desired overnight interest  rate.  Fluctuations in reserves stemming  from autonomous factors are borne by the private sector through the central  bank’s open market operations.  In  contrast, the framework used to implement policy today is a floor system, which  is associated with an abundant supply of reserves and policy implementation  that is achieved through periodic changes to administered rates.  A floor system is generally associated with a  relatively larger balance sheet than a corridor system because the central bank  needs to supply enough reserves to satisfy demand on the flat part of the  reserve demand curve, perhaps with an additional buffer to accommodate reserve  supply shocks.  Such shocks typically  stem from fluctuations in other liabilities. 8 However, we do not really know how large or  small a difference in the amount of reserves would be needed to run an  effective and efficient floor versus a corridor in the longer run.  The answer will depend critically on the shape  of the demand curve, which we will learn more about over time, as well as the specific  design parameters of either framework.\n\nI would  emphasize that central banks have successfully implemented both types of  frameworks, or variations of them, and that the Fed can achieve interest rate  control with either one.  Leaving aside some  of the broader policy considerations, I’d like to make a few points about the technical  operation of each framework in the longer-run.\n\nFirst, some observers see a return to the Fed’s pre-crisis,  reserve-scarce corridor system as the natural conclusion to the normalization  process, highlighting that system’s familiarity.  But it is important to note that fundamental  changes in the money market landscape over the past decade would likely make monetary  policy implementation in a future corridor system look substantially different  than before the crisis.\n\nIn the Fed’s pre-crisis regime, hitting the target federal  funds rate each day was a technically challenging exercise.  Demand for reserves was driven largely by  reserve requirements, in addition to intraday payment clearing needs.  We started with a banking system that on most  days was short of reserves.  Then, using staff  forecasts of various factors affecting the supply of and demand for reserves  over multiple days ahead, we calibrated open market operations with the dealers  in the repo market to bring the aggregate supply of reserves into balance at  the target rate.  With this aggregate  balance achieved, individual banks distributed them. Banks facing a  deficiency of reserves needed to find and trade with banks holding reserve  surpluses, each balancing the costs associated with holding too many or too few  reserves. 9 , 10 We were reliably proficient in hitting the  FOMC’s target rate in normal times, but interest rate control was more  challenging at times when factors affecting reserves were harder to predict.  This was particularly true in the early  stages of the crisis, when large changes in reserve demand caused significant  intraday and interday swings in federal funds rates (Figure 4) . 11 , 12\n\nToday, with greater uncertainty and variability in factors  affecting the day-to-day demand for and supply of reserves, it would be more  difficult to anticipate fluctuations and achieve the necessary balance in  reserve conditions even in normal times.   In aggregate, reserve demand is likely to be guided by a more complex  set of drivers, including post-crisis liquidity regulation, supervision,  resolution planning, and intraday payments risk management.  These needs have the potential to contribute  to higher and more variable demand for reserves than banks had before the  crisis. 13 Estimating reserve demand would need to take  into account these factors, as well as banks’ propensities to substitute between  reserves and other relevant assets—something that may vary according to an  individual institution’s business strategy.   Knowledge about the shape, position, and stability of banks’ reserve  demand curve will likely emerge only with experience.\n\nAdditionally, we would need to consider shocks that affect the  supply of reserves, such as those stemming from changes in the Fed’s non-reserve  liabilities. As seen in Figure 5 , net changes in non-reserve liabilities have become more variable  in recent years. 14\n\nEven if fluctuations could be accurately forecast, in a  corridor system, they would need to be offset through open market operations to  maintain interest rate control.  Larger  fluctuations would likely require larger operations. 15 In the years before the crisis, the average  size of daily overnight repo operations was around $5 billion—a relatively  small amount given the size of the repo market and dealers’ net securities  financing needs.  Roughly 95 percent of  these operations were for less than $10 billion, and the maximum operation size  in normal times was $20 billion.  Looking  just at recent variability in non-reserve liabilities and assuming overnight  operations were used to offset their fluctuations, daily temporary operations  in a corridor system might routinely need to be around $25 billion, but could  go as high as $100 billion. 16 We would need to consider whether the Fed’s repo  and reverse repo operations could be dependably scaled to that degree, and  whether their effects would be transmitted to other rates.\n\nOne consideration in this regard is that there appear to be  greater frictions across funding markets today.   Dealer balance sheets have shrunk and become less elastic in the face of  changes in regulation and risk management. 17 While dealer caution contributes to the overall  safety and soundness of the banking sector, it could mean we would need more or  different types of counterparties for traditional repo operations, or perhaps different  types of operations altogether—particularly if federal funds trading became  idiosyncratic or disconnected from other rates.   In sum, a reinstated corridor might look less familiar than some expect.\n\nFor comparison, let me make a few observations about our  experience with the floor system that the Fed is currently using.  The FOMC has successfully raised its target  range for the overnight federal funds rate six times since December 2015, and,  as seen in Figure 6 , the effective  federal funds rate has reliably printed in the prevailing target range over  that time.  The policy stance has  transmitted to a broad constellation of money market rates.  The system is simple and efficient to operate.  The interest rate the Fed pays on excess  reserves serves as the primary policy implementation tool, with support from a  standing facility that offers overnight reverse repos (ON RRPs) at an  administered rate. 18 There is no need to forecast specific factors  affecting reserves or to conduct discretionary open market operations each day;  overnight reverse repos are offered every day based on price, not quantity.  Day-to-day fluctuations in factors affecting reserves  are accommodated by the elastic reserve demand given that reserve needs are  widely met.  Market forces keep the federal  funds rate in the FOMC’s target range by allowing a wide range of  counterparties to price trades against the alternative option of investing with  the Federal Reserve.  And in the  aggregate, use of the Fed’s balance sheet is efficient by allowing private and  official sector market participants to determine their preferred distribution across  the range of Fed liabilities. 19\n\nThis system could continue to work well with considerably  lower levels of reserves, so long as the supply continued to intersect the flat  part of the demand curve.  If reserves  fell too low, we could see high volumes of fed funds borrowing at interest  rates well above the interest rate on excess reserves, which would indicate  that we were no longer operating at the flat part of the demand curve. 20 As I noted earlier, maintaining a buffer of excess  reserves to absorb reserve-draining shocks could prevent this outcome.  An important trade-off arises between the  size of that additional buffer and the frequency and size of open market operations. 21\n\nTo sum up, the FOMC could choose to retain the floor system  to implement policy in the longer-run or it could choose to shift back to a  corridor system.  However, a reinstated  corridor system may be less familiar than some expect.  Such a framework would involve uncertainties  about reserve demand and greater variability in factors affecting reserve  supply, and would likely require operations that are larger, more variable, or even  very different from those used before the crisis.  Meanwhile, those who favor a floor system may  be encouraged by the performance of our current framework to date.  We’ve learned that the floor system has  proven to be highly effective at controlling the effective federal funds rate  and other money market rates, is resilient to significant shifts in market  structure, and is efficient to operate.  Under  either framework, the balance sheet will likely normalize at a level  substantially larger than it was before the crisis to accommodate higher demand  for reserves and non-reserve liabilities in the post-crisis landscape.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Welcome to the 2019 Annual Primary  Dealer Meeting.  Each of your firms plays  an important role as a trading counterparty in the implementation of monetary  policy—a core responsibility of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the  operating arm for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  This is an area that has generated  increased operational activity over the past year.  These annual meetings provide us an  opportunity to strengthen our relationship and communicate the New York Fed’s expectations  of its counterparties.\n\nOver the course of the year, there  have been important developments in the Federal Reserve’s framework for  implementing monetary policy, and the markets in which we operate have continued  to evolve.  I’d like to focus today on  what  the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) is currently  doing to implement the FOMC’s ample reserves regime, particularly over the next  several months.  In mid-October, the FOMC  directed the Desk to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the  level that prevailed in early September, and we recently began Treasury bill  purchases to achieve that objective.   Since it will take some time to accumulate securities holdings, we also continue  to conduct temporary repurchase agreement (repo) operations in order to ensure  that the supply of reserves remains ample and to mitigate the risk of money market  pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation.  Although money market conditions have calmed  since the mid-September volatility, the Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring reserves  conditions and money market developments, and the Desk will continue to use its tools and adjust operational plans  as needed to maintain the federal funds rate in the FOMC’s target range.\n\nIn addition to discussing  open  market operations today, I would also like to focus briefly on another key  development in money markets—the transition away from LIBOR.  I will highlight today’s announcement about  the New York Fed’s proposal to produce averages for the Secured Overnight  Financing Rate (commonly known as the SOFR).\n\nBefore I begin, I will remind you  that the views presented here are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect  those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nOpen Market Operations in an  Ample Reserves Regime\n\nI’d like to start with some context  about how the FOMC planned its transition to an ample reserves operating regime  for monetary policy implementation.\n\nIn January, the FOMC announced its  intention to continue  implementing monetary policy using an ample reserves operating regime.  This means that the supply of reserves is sufficient  to ensure that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term  interest rates is exercised primarily through the Federal Reserve’s  administered rates, and active management of the supply of reserves is not  required. 2 This last clause is an important feature of  the framework and means that, over time, the level of reserves will be large  enough to absorb short-term changes in factors affecting the supply of reserves  without the need for frequent, sizeable interventions to offset these changes ( Figure 1 ).\n\nIn March, the FOMC indicated that the longer-run level of reserves will be a  level consistent with “efficient and effective” implementation of monetary  policy. 3 To support a smooth transition to the  longer-run level of reserves, the FOMC also stated its intention to slow the  pace of the decline in reserves—which had  been coming down as a result of normalizing the balance sheet—over subsequent quarters, first by slowing and then  by stopping the reduction in the Federal Reserve’s aggregate securities  holdings.  The end of balance sheet  runoff occurred in August, and the FOMC continued to monitor a  wide range of information to reach a judgement about the level of reserves most  consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation in an ample  reserves regime. 4\n\nIn mid-September, upward pressure emerged in  funding markets as corporate tax payments and the settlement of Treasury  securities increased demand for securities financing and sharply reduced reserves in the system.  Consistent with the directive from the FOMC, the Desk responded with temporary open market operations to foster conditions that would maintain the federal funds rate within the target range.  In mid-October, the FOMC directed the Desk to maintain over time reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September in order to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample. 5 The FOMC judged this level more supportive of smooth market functioning and effective control over the federal funds rate, and we have seen money market pressures stabilize.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the quantity  of reserves needed to maintain an ample reserves framework is  subject to uncertainty and may change over  time.  Banks’ demand for reserves is not  static.  It shifts in response to changing  financial conditions and will evolve through time as banks adjust their  business models and respond to changes in the economic and regulatory  environment.  In addition, the level of  reserves needed to maintain an ample reserves regime is more than the sum of  individual banks’ reserves demand, particularly when there are frictions that  result in inefficient redistribution of reserves.   The measurement of these factors is complex,  and the FOMC will continue to monitor a broad range of information to assess the  level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective implementation of  policy.\n\nI’d like to turn now to how the  Desk will supply reserves to carry out the FOMC’s directive to maintain reserves  over time “ at or above ” the level  that prevailed in early September.  This directive  requires provision  of a supply of reserves that can sufficiently absorb normal fluctuations  in non-reserve liabilities, so shifts in these balances do not bring reserves  below desired levels and potentially compromise effective interest rate control.\n\nThe Desk has been directed to  purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year to  achieve the FOMC’s objective, and we are currently executing those reserve  management purchases at the initial pace of $60 billion per month. 6, 7 I’d like to share some thoughts on the  composition and sizing of those purchases.\n\nFirst, why Treasury bills?\n\nAs I noted earlier, the goal of the  reserve management purchases is to maintain an ample supply of reserves to  support effective and efficient monetary policy implementation.\n\nBecause Treasury bills are  short-dated instruments, purchases of these securities can help  maintain the  supply of reserves while limiting the impact on financial conditions.  Moreover, bills are liquid instruments with  deep markets, and the  Federal Reserve doesn’t currently hold many of them.  The Federal Reserve traditionally held a  relatively large portfolio of Treasury bills (in addition to holdings across  the coupon curve) in its System Open Market Account (SOMA), but sold or redeemed  that bill portfolio during the Global Financial Crisis and in the Maturity  Extension Program.  While the FOMC has  not yet made decisions about the long-run composition of its domestic  securities portfolio, current bill holdings in the SOMA are low by any measure. 8 Treasury  bills represent less than 3 percent of the SOMA’s Treasury  portfolio, compared to  15  percent of the outstanding Treasury universe ( Figure  2 ).  From a portfolio  composition perspective, these purchases will incrementally add bills back to  the portfolio as the FOMC continues to consider its desired long-run  maturity composition.\n\nSecond, how do we approach the  design of our purchases?\n\nAt present, three elements are  driving the overall size of the reserve management purchases:\n\nIn practice, this will mean looking out over several months and sizing reserve management purchases to offset expected reserve declines.  For example, reserve balances tend to decline notably in late April as the TGA grows with the collection of individual taxes, and the  Desk’s planned purchases  over the next several months will help to offset the anticipated decline in reserves associated  with those flows.\n\nBesides estimating the total amount of  purchases, the Desk also needs to determine the pace at which it  will execute those purchases.  The amount and timing of the  operations take into account market functioning considerations and allow for  some adjustments around periods with sharp expected declines in reserves or  liquidity conditions.\n\nSo far,  reserve management  purchase operations have proceeded smoothly.   The Desk has purchased $52.5 billion of the initial $60 billion in monthly  purchases, through seven purchase operations of roughly $7.5 billion each.  To date, those operations have generated  strong offer-to-cover ratios, pricing that has been favorable relative to  market and theoretical prices, and broad participation and awards from your  firms.  Moreover, the Treasury bill  market is accustomed to shifting  amounts of securities available for  purchase due to seasonal dynamics related to TGA inflows and outflows and the  debt ceiling, and we’ve seen market prices adjust as we expected given the flow  of our planned purchases.  With roughly  $2.4 trillion of Treasury bills outstanding and daily turnover of around $95  billion, the bill market has substantial capacity to support our activity, and  we expect to  be able to maintain  the current pace of Treasury bill purchases  for  some time. 10\n\nThat said, the Desk is prepared to  adjust the pace and other parameters of the reserve management purchases as  necessary to maintain an ample supply of reserves and based on money market  conditions.  We’ll be closely monitoring  the attractiveness of propositions and indicators of market functioning to assess  whether operational adjustments are appropriate.\n\nIn the meantime, because it will take some time for  the bill purchases to sustain the supply of reserves at or above levels prevailing  in early September, the FOMC has also instructed the Desk to continue offering  term and overnight repo operations at least through January.  Repo operations foster conditions to  maintain the federal funds rate within the target range through two  channels.  First, they supply reserves in  support of the FOMC’s operating regime, helping to ensure that reserves are maintained  over time in amounts at or above the early September levels, even in the face  of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities. 11 Second, they provide funding  in repo markets to damp repo market pressure that  could otherwise pass-through to the federal funds market and adversely affect  policy implementation.\n\nThe repo operations have successfully  offset supply changes and money market pressures associated with big  anticipated drops in reserves, such as around mid-month and month-end  settlements.  In doing so, they have been  effective at restoring calm in money markets and maintaining control over the  federal funds rate.  Overnight and term  money market rates have moderated, on average, relative to IOER, and the  effective federal funds rate has stayed well within the FOMC’s target  range.  Participation in the repo  operations has been robust and the transmission to broader money markets has  been good.\n\nOn October 23, the Desk announced an increase in the amount offered in overnight repo operations from  at least $75 billion to at least $120 billion.   We also increased the amount offered in the remaining term repo  operations spanning the October month-end from at least $35 billion per  operation to $45 billion, raising the total amount of term repos offered over  this period to up to $180 billion.  This  increased capacity was supportive to  money markets,  and the federal funds rate was   stable over October's month-end.\n\nAs we head into year-end, the Desk will continue to make adjustments as needed to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation.  It is good to  see firms starting to address year-end funding needs, and we understand that,  as firms manage their balance sheets more carefully in December, rates can be  somewhat more variable and dealers may adjust their approach to our  operations.  We will monitor conditions closely  and will be prepared to adapt open  market operations as needed to meet the directives  from the FOMC.\n\nAverages of SOFR Rates and the  Transition from LIBOR\n\nBefore I wrap up, I’d like to say a  few words about reference rates.  As I  noted to this group last year, the New York Fed is committed to producing  robust and resilient reference rates and to supporting the transition away from  LIBOR. 12 New York Fed President John Williams has emphasized this issue, noting that while progress has been made, there  is still much work to do, and with no guarantee of LIBOR’s existence  beyond the end of 2021, the clock is ticking. 13\n\nThe New York Fed helps advance these  objectives  as the administrator and producer of the SOFR,  which was selected by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) as its  preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR, and also, in coordination with the  Federal Reserve Board, through  support of the ARRC.  The SOFR, which launched in April 2018, is a  measure of the general cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by  Treasury securities in the repo market—a rate that broadly reflects how  financial institutions fund themselves.   Importantly, it reflects underlying transaction volumes averaging more  than $1 trillion per day over the past year, and its production is compliant  with IOSCO’s Principles for Financial Benchmarks.  Over the past year-and-a-half, SOFR futures  markets have demonstrated promising growth in notional volumes traded and  liquidity, even if volumes remain low compared to both federal funds and  Eurodollar futures.  Additionally, there  has been meaningful issuance of SOFR-linked cash products like floating rate  notes.\n\nA next step in  supporting broader adoption of the SOFR as a LIBOR alternative will be to meet  the need expressed by market participants—particularly financial and corporate  issuers of securities and loans—for a set of SOFR averages that can be used in  a wide range of financial products. 14 To this end, today, the New York Fed released  a solicitation for public comment on a plan to publish daily, starting in the  first half of 2020, a set of three compounded averages of the SOFR, as well as  a daily SOFR index that would allow users to calculate compounded averages over  custom time periods. 15\n\nAn expansion to the suite of reference rates we  produce is an important next step that further demonstrates the Federal  Reserve’s commitment to support  the usefulness of adopting the SOFR.  I also urge you to commit to this critical  endeavor.  The comment period for the  public solicitation will close on December 4, and I encourage you to review the  proposal and provide feedback, including about the tenors and compounding methodology  for the new products.  While the response  to preliminary socialization of the program parameters has been positive, we  recognize the importance of getting these averages right.  Market participant feedback was critical as the  New York Fed  began producing Treasury repo reference rates to support the transition, and  your continued input will help ensure that the rates we produce best meet the needs  of the financial system.  More generally,  every market participant needs to understand their LIBOR exposures and use all  available tools to transition to robust alternative rates, such as the SOFR, as  they prepare for a world without LIBOR.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, the  Desk continues to operationalize  the FOMC’s ample reserves regime.  We are  doing this by conducting Treasury bill purchases to maintain a supply of reserves  consistent with the FOMC’s directive to maintain reserves at or above  early-September levels.  Also, since it  will take some time to accumulate securities holdings to achieve that  objective, the Desk is continuing to provide reserves temporarily through overnight  and term repo operations.  We are monitoring  market conditions closely, have tools to effectively and efficiently support  monetary policy implementation, and will make adjustments as needed.  Both in the execution of open market  operations and support for the transition from LIBOR, it is a very active time  on the Desk, and our partnership with each of your institutions remains  important to the smooth implementation of this work.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Thanks very much for that kind introduction.  I would like to thank Dick Berner and Venky  Venkateswaran for  organizing this event. 1 As Dick would likely recall, I was supposed  to give a talk about implementing policy here at NYU Stern two years ago,  almost to the day. We had to cancel that speech as it became clear that the  emerging pandemic and the efforts to contain it would disrupt the global  economy and lead to unprecedented strains in financial markets. Today, the world faces an extraordinary new challenge.  I would like to acknowledge the tragic events  in Ukraine and the terrible hardship this places on the Ukrainian people. The economic and financial impact of these events  will take time to become clear.  On the Desk,  we are monitoring global developments carefully.\n\nMy  remarks today will begin by looking back at the pandemic crisis and the historic  policy response.  Starting in March 2020,  the Federal Reserve took a set of extraordinary measures in response to the extreme  economic stresses and dislocations in the global financial system that were triggered  by the pandemic.  These  actions—many taken in close coordination with the U.S. Treasury, and alongside  a forceful fiscal response from the U.S. government—were successful in providing  accommodation to the U.S. economy during a very vulnerable and uncertain period. 2\n\nIn light of recent  strength in the labor market and elevated inflation, the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) has decided to end net purchases of  Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in early March.  The Committee also stated that it expects it  will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,  and released principles for significantly reducing the size of the Federal  Reserve’s balance sheet. 3\n\nWith net asset purchases coming to  an end, it is an opportune time for reflection.   In my remarks today, I’ll first review the asset  purchases the Fed conducted over the past two years, exploring how the  Committee’s evolving objectives for these purchases influenced the Desk’s implementation  approach. I’ll then highlight how these purchases shaped  the SOMA portfolio today and discuss some considerations ahead for policy implementation, in the context of the FOMC’s recently issued Principles  for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet .\n\nAs always, the views I express today  are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Fed’s Asset Purchases: Objectives  and Implementation\n\nNext week,  the FOMC’s net purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS will come to an  end, marking the conclusion of this historic program, in which net purchases  totaled roughly $4.6 trillion, as shown in Figure 1 . These purchases were  instrumental in supporting the flow of credit to the U.S. economy and fostering  accommodative financial conditions—and, along with other significant policy  measures, prevented a much deeper economic downturn.\n\nThe onset of the pandemic resulted  in an unprecedented “dash for cash” as heightened uncertainty in the outlook  and shifts to a remote trading posture prompted extreme price volatility, sudden  portfolio de-risking, and strains in market functioning.  In this environment, even the most liquid  securities, like Treasuries, were being sold broadly and in large quantities,  overwhelming the market’s intermediation capacity. 4\n\nBy mid-March 2020, Treasury and  agency MBS market functioning had deteriorated to levels not seen since the Global  Financial Crisis.  In this truly exceptional  environment, the Fed stepped in to buy securities at an unprecedented scale and  speed to restore market functioning and maintain the vital flow of credit to  the U.S. economy.  This entailed  purchasing record amounts of securities to address one-way selling flows and meet  the immediate demand for liquidity.\n\nThe flow of these  purchases helped to alleviate private sector balance sheet constraints and meet  this demand for market liquidity.  Over  time, purchases restored two-way trading and more normal market functioning. The FOMC’s full commitment to purchase Treasuries  and agency MBS “in the amounts needed” to support smooth market functioning  also had the effect of stabilizing precautionary sales and forestalling a  spiral in liquidity demand. 5\n\nDuring this period, flexibility was  a hallmark of our implementation approach.   The Desk adjusted purchases in response to shifting market conditions  and sized them to address dysfunction.  We  closely monitored and assessed market functioning metrics and targeted sectors  in which conditions were especially strained.  In the MBS market, operational  adjustments included purchasing a broad range of securities that came  under intense selling pressure and purchasing for  near-term settlement, which helped ease pressures on dealer balance sheets.  This differed from the Desk’s typical practice of purchasing recently produced  coupons in the to-be-announced (TBA) market for forward  settlement.\n\nGiven the depth of the strains, market  functioning improved only gradually at first.  However, with the Committee’s full commitment to supporting  market functioning and the Desk’s continuous operational adjustments, market functioning metrics improved  considerably over the course of several weeks, and the Desk reduced purchase  amounts commensurately. 6 In the Treasury market, bid-ask spreads  narrowed and market depth rebounded, as shown in Figure 2 .  Similarly, agency MBS market liquidity  conditions, as represented by the effective bid-ask spread shown in Figure 3 ,  improved markedly.\n\nAs market functioning improved and  conditions stabilized, the Committee shifted its focus to fostering  accommodative financial conditions to support the economy as it recovered from  the pandemic shock, and to sustaining the gains made in market functioning. While asset purchases conducted to support  market functioning were used during the pandemic to address extraordinary and  acute stresses, asset purchases aimed at fostering accommodative financial  conditions are a standard part of the Committee’s monetary policy toolkit,  employed when the federal funds rate is constrained by its effective lower  bound (ELB).\n\nBy reducing the stock of securities and duration risk held by  private investors, Fed asset purchases lower term premiums and longer-term  interest rates, easing financial conditions broadly.  In  addition, purchases of agency MBS reduce the amount of prepayment risk held by  investors, leading MBS spreads to fall and resulting in lower mortgage interest  rates for homeowners.  Asset purchases can  also convey information about the FOMC’s policy intentions, as market participants  believe the Committee would be unlikely to raise its policy rate while  conducting asset purchases.\n\nAs  the FOMC’s objectives for asset purchases evolved, so too did the operational  approach.  Purchase  amounts were quickly scaled back as conditions improved, dropping from a  daily average of over $100 billion in late March 2020 to around $10 billion by the  summer, as shown in Figure 4 .  Without the need for high-frequency  adjustments to address market strains, the Desk extended  the horizon for purchase calendars to provide more predictability in planned  operations.  Purchase allocations  also became more standard and were distributed relatively neutrally to the universe of securities outstanding.  In this case, Treasury purchases were allocated proportionally to the amounts outstanding across the nominal Treasury coupon and TIPS coupon curves. 7 In the MBS market, the composition of purchases was adjusted to be roughly in line with recently produced coupons in the TBA market.\n\nOverall, the asset purchases, and the  operational approach used to implement them, were effective at achieving the  Committee’s objectives. The flow of  purchases substantially improved market functioning by meeting immediate  demands for market liquidity in strained conditions.  The total stock of Fed asset holdings—resulting  from both purchases initiated to address market functioning and those conducted  with a focus on providing accommodation—worked to put downward pressure on  longer-term yields and ease financial conditions.  And, the Committee’s communications about asset  purchases had important signaling effects about its commitment to supporting the  economy.\n\nWhat I take away from this experience is  that the FOMC’s toolkit for addressing both severe market functioning  disruptions and economic downturns is comprehensive and effective.  Nonetheless, while asset purchases used to  support market functioning and those employed to foster accommodative financial  conditions may be broadly similar in nature, I do not view them as equal parts  of the monetary policy toolkit.  I expect  circumstances warranting sizable intervention to support market functioning to  be extraordinarily rare.  In this respect, the ongoing work to better understand  vulnerabilities in the U.S. Treasury market and to develop potential reforms to  further enhance its resiliency is critical. 8 In  contrast, the Committee has indicated that  asset purchases to provide accommodation are a standard tool when the federal  funds rate is constrained by the ELB. 9\n\nConsiderations  for Policy Implementation Ahead\n\nLooking ahead,  as I noted, with a strong  labor market and elevated inflation, the FOMC has stated that it  expects it will soon be appropriate to raise its target range for the federal  funds rate, and has indicated that it intends to significantly reduce  the size of the balance sheet. 10\n\nFor now, the FOMC has directed the Desk to  continue to reinvest all principal payments from the Fed’s Treasury and agency  MBS holdings following the conclusion of net purchases, which will maintain the size and broad composition of the SOMA portfolio. 11 However, in recent meetings, the FOMC began deliberations on its approach to reducing the balance sheet, and following its January meeting the Committee issued principles to provide information on its planned approach. 12 These principles are high-level tenets, and not specific plans.  They build on the experience gained from reducing monetary policy accommodation over 2014 to 2019, and, importantly, also reflect the Committee’s assessment of the current environment.\n\nThe principles start by  affirming that the FOMC sees changes in the target range for the federal funds  rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy, and that reducing the balance sheet will occur  after the process of raising the target range has begun.  The principles further state  that when the Committee decides to begin reducing its securities holdings, it  intends to do so over time in a predictable manner, primarily through  adjustments to reinvestments, so that securities holdings decline with  principal payments.  In addition, the  principles affirm the FOMC’s choice of an ample reserves operating regime, and  an intention, in the longer run, to hold primarily Treasury securities.\n\nLet  me turn to a couple of considerations ahead for policy implementation, in the  context of these principles and the current contours of the SOMA portfolio.\n\nSOMA  Portfolio Contours\n\nFirst, the SOMA portfolio is  substantially larger than it was at the end of the last round of large-scale  asset purchases (LSAPs), reflecting the extraordinary pandemic shock and the  purchases needed to support market functioning and the economic recovery.  As shown in Figure 5 , at about $8.5 trillion and 35 percent of nominal GDP, the SOMA  portfolio is roughly double the size in dollar terms and about 10 percentage  points higher as a share of GDP than in late 2014.  Given  the large size of the SOMA, the Committee has suggested that a significant  reduction in the balance sheet would likely be appropriate. 13 This assessment reflects the view that, with  the overall elevated size of the balance sheet, SOMA securities holdings have  more room to decline than during the prior period of runoff before reaching levels  consistent with efficient and effective implementation in an ample reserves  regime.\n\nIn  addition to the much larger size of the SOMA, the weighted average maturity (WAM)  of Treasury holdings is about two years shorter than in late 2014.  This is because asset  purchases over the past two years have been conducted across the Treasury  curve, whereas purchases under previous LSAP programs and the maturity  extension program (MEP) targeted longer-dated Treasuries.  It also reflects the effect of sales of shorter-dated  securities conducted during the MEP. 14\n\nAs shown in Figure 6 , the portfolio  will have sizable principal payments from Treasury holdings over the next few years, ranging  from $40 billion to $150 billion per month, and averaging around $80 billion.  These could be rolled over or allowed to  mature, depending on the Committee’s decisions.   During the prior period of balance sheet reduction, shown in Figure  6b, the Committee directed the Desk to phase in a cap for monthly Treasury redemptions  of $30 billion per month, to limit the pace and variability of redemption  amounts, particularly around the middle month of each quarter when maturities are  greater. 15 Often, principal payments were below the caps,  and the average pace of Treasury redemptions was less than $20 billion per  month.\n\nAgency MBS principal  payments, shown in Figure 7a , are also expected to be modestly larger  than those experienced during the prior runoff period and could average nearly $25  billion per month over the next few years. However,  there is considerable uncertainty around mortgage prepayments; a  downward shift in mortgage interest rates could increase prepayments  substantially, as indicated by the gray bars. 16 During the prior reduction period, shown  in Figure 7b , the Committee phased in a monthly redemption cap of $20  billion for MBS.  This made the decrease  in agency MBS holdings more predictable, and also limited the possibility of procyclical  reductions in SOMA holdings during periods when interest rates fell in response  to a worsening economic outlook.  In 2019, as the Committee eased policy, the cap did limit the  pace of agency MBS redemptions.\n\nIn summary, Treasury  principal payments in coming years will be much larger and more variable than  they were following the LSAP programs.   MBS principal payments will likely be modestly larger and are subject to  considerable uncertainty.  The FOMC has not  decided on its plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet.  However, the minutes from the December FOMC meeting  noted that many Committee participants judged that monthly caps on redemption  amounts could help ensure that the pace of reduction in the SOMA portfolio would  be predictable over time. 17\n\nAmple Reserves Regime\n\nA second observation  is that the Committee’s affirmation of its ample reserves operating framework  provides broad insight into the longer-run supply of reserves, a key determinant  of the longer-run size of the balance sheet.\n\nDuring  the prior period of balance sheet reduction after the LSAPs, the Committee had  not yet decided on its operating framework.   Even after the Committee announced the ample reserves regime, heightened uncertainty existed about the underlying demand for reserves given the substantial changes in banks’ liquidity management practices since the Global Financial Crisis.\n\nToday, the operating framework is well  established, and we can draw on the prior experience with balance sheet  reduction in assessing the demand for reserves.  That said, the underlying demand for reserves is still uncertain  and varies over time.  Most large reserve holders assess their need for reserve  balances based on intraday payment flows and projected outflows under stressed  market conditions, and each bank has a different profile based on the composition  of its liabilities and the outflow assumptions it makes. 18 Moreover, the supply of reserves needed to  maintain ample conditions is not just the sum of individual banks’ demand, due  to frictions that limit the rapid redistribution of reserves.\n\nAs the  Committee reduces the balance sheet, staff will carefully monitor developments  in money markets to understand changes in reserve conditions and inform the  Committee's assessment of the appropriate path for the balance sheet in the  longer run.  Importantly, the prior  experience with balance sheet reduction offers a useful guide to money market  conditions that reflect ample reserves.  The  FOMC is committed to maintaining sufficient reserves to ensure that  administered rates—the interest on reserve balances (IORB) and overnight  reverse repo facility (ON RRP) rates—exercise control over the federal funds  rate.  However, should  pressures in overnight markets unexpectedly emerge, the new Standing Repo  Facility (SRF) that the Committee established last year is also  available, providing an important backstop to support effective policy  implementation and smooth market functioning.\n\nFlexibility  in Implementation\n\nAs the Committee turns toward  reducing the high level of accommodation provided during the pandemic, the Desk  will focus on implementing the Committee’s plans as they develop.  Overall, the FOMC’s principles provide helpful  guidance on the approach to reducing the balance sheet; similar principles  communicated in advance of decisions or actions during the prior episode enhanced  understanding of the Committee’s approach, supporting effective policy  implementation. 19 This  time around, FOMC participants generally noted that current  conditions likely warrant a faster pace of balance sheet runoff than during the  previous period. 20\n\nGiven  the experience implementing the last balance sheet reduction, it seems likely  that redemptions could proceed smoothly at a somewhat faster pace than before.  However, a significant reduction in SOMA holdings  will require meaningful adjustments to private-sector balance sheets—as  investors absorb the net increase in Treasury and agency MBS issuance and money  markets transition to lower levels of liquidity — and these  adjustments could take time.  And while the Fed has some experience shrinking its  balance sheet, this process is still relatively novel.  So, the Desk will continue to monitor  markets closely to inform the FOMC’s policy deliberations.  The Committee is prepared to adjust its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet, should economic and financial developments warrant.\n\nPotential  for Liftoff is Near-Term Focus\n\nFinally, as  the principles note, the FOMC will first increase the target range for the  federal funds rate before it begins reducing the size of the balance  sheet.  And, at its January meeting, the Committee  stated that it expects it will soon be appropriate to increase the target range.   So, I am also focused on liftoff and adjustments in money markets that  might occur.  Let me offer some concluding  thoughts on that.\n\nThe Committee last lifted the  target range off of the zero lower bound in 2015.  At that time, the Fed had no experience lifting  short-term interest rates in an environment with abundant reserves, and there  was significant uncertainty about the dynamics we’d see in money markets.  Ultimately, the policy  implementation framework—including the administered rates and associated operations—was very successful in managing  the federal funds rate within the target range and lifting the  constellation of overnight rates.  And as we’ve seen over the past several years, the framework has continued to support effective policy implementation across a range of environments.\n\nEven as the current environment is characterized  by higher levels of liquidity than in 2015, I am confident that administered  rates will again be effective at lifting the federal funds rate when the  Committee increases the target range.   Administered rates create strong incentives in overnight markets, and  the ON RRP provides a broad range of money market investors an alternative  investment to support the federal funds rate and other overnight rates.  My sense is that the current setting of  administered rates relative to the target range has been working well and that  it could continue to support effective policy implementation following any  increase in the target range in coming months, although adjustments could be  warranted over time.\n\nWith the high levels of liquidity in money  markets, take-up at the ON RRP facility could increase as rates rise.  Flows  between bank reserves and ON RRP balances depend, in part, on relative levels  of interest rates on bank deposits versus other money market investments, such  as money market mutual funds (money funds).   Some banks may use rising rates as an opportunity to  reduce reserve holdings by shedding deposits. 21 If, when the FOMC increases the target range,  banks raise deposit rates by less than money funds increase net yields to investors, funds could flow from banks into money funds, which could in turn increase take-up at the ON RRP.\n\nThat said, while  many expected an increase in the ON RRP in 2015, this did not come to pass, and  it could be that ON RRP balances remain relatively steady following liftoff or  even decline.  Regardless of what happens  following liftoff, over time, as the Committee reduces the size of the balance  sheet, I expect usage in the ON RRP to decline.\n\nIn sum,  the administered rates working together should maintain the federal funds  rate within the FOMC’s target range.  I  am confident our tools will promote smooth implementation of the Committee’s  policy stance.  But as always, we will monitor  conditions closely and consider adjustments to our approach as appropriate.\n\nFigures Data for Figures 6 and 7",

    "text": "Thank you to the Yale Program on Financial  Stability and to the Bank for International Settlements for the invitation to speak at today’s forum. 1 Financial crises can have deep and lasting  effects on the economy.  They disrupt the  vital flow of credit, damage business and household balance sheets, and result  in lost jobs and income for the American public.  Given these costs, it is critical that we learn  the lessons of past crises and continue to build knowledge about the tools  and interventions that will help us respond effectively in the future.  Discussions like the one we’ll have today are  valuable opportunities to evolve our thinking on policy implementation and  crisis management.\n\nToday, I’ll share some lessons I’ve  taken from two crises that occurred during my time implementing monetary policy:  the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the coronavirus pandemic shock.  I’ll discuss liquidity shocks and how central  bank actions address them.  In  particular, I’ll focus on a recent decision by the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) to establish two standing repo facilities to support the  effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning: the  Standing Repo Facility and the FIMA Repo Facility.\n\nBefore I begin, let me say that my  comments today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the New York  Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Crises: Divergent Shocks; Similar  Hallmarks\n\nFinancial crises emanate from  shocks, which often are amplified by vulnerabilities or imbalances in the  financial system.  Each crisis unfolds in  its own way, challenging policymakers to respond to evolving conditions.  Still, there are recurring elements to most  crises.  And in these similarities we can  find valuable lessons that help us better prepare for the future.\n\nThe GFC and the pandemic crisis  resulted from very different events.  The  GFC was precipitated by a housing market shock that was amplified by weak  underwriting standards and highly leveraged financial intermediaries—in  particular, in subprime mortgage finance.   The crisis unfolded over an extended timeline, punctuated by events that  revealed significant vulnerabilities among financial institutions, including in  the banking sector.  In contrast, the  pandemic  crisis was caused by an extraordinary exogenous shock to the economic outlook as  measures taken to control the coronavirus pandemic threatened to disrupt  activity worldwide and raised concern about the ability of financial markets to  operate smoothly.  The sudden and  unprecedented uncertainty resulted in a “dash for cash” that began in  the markets for the most liquid and safe investments and unfolded with  astonishing speed. 2 Although banks were a source of strength  during the pandemic, the event still revealed vulnerabilities in market  structure and among some financial firms.\n\nEven with these very divergent  origins, the GFC and pandemic crisis impacted financial markets in some similar  ways.\n\nFirst, both resulted in an extraordinary  increase in the demand for dollar liquidity.   The demand arose out of both immediate funding needs and the desire to  raise precautionary liquidity. 3 The supply of liquidity was also curtailed as firms  that normally lend instead stockpiled liquidity to meet potential future payment  needs.  During both crises, this surge  in demand for U.S. dollars was global in nature and had significant spillovers  to domestic funding conditions.\n\nSecond, each crisis revealed  vulnerabilities in short-term funding markets—notably among prime money market  funds—in which maturity transformation created an unstable source of liquidity during  periods of stress, propagating funding strains. 4\n\nThird, as a result of strained  liquidity conditions, credit markets became severely disrupted, threatening the  flow of credit to the economy.  In both  crises, extreme stress in credit markets resulted in elevated risk premia and  reduced access to credit, with the potential for harmful effects on aggregate  demand and output.\n\nEven with the divergent shocks precipitating  each crisis, these common elements resulted in negative feedback loops that led  to sharply deteriorating conditions.  As  funding conditions worsened and volatility increased, investors divested assets  to increase liquidity, which in turn resulted in declining prices and a further  need to deleverage or raise liquidity.\n\nThe Response: Some Things Old;  Some Things New\n\nAs I’ve discussed in previous  remarks, the  Federal Reserve responded to dislocations from the pandemic crisis with swift  and decisive actions—many in coordination with the U.S. Treasury—to support  smooth market functioning and the flow of credit to the U.S. economy.  Bearing in mind lessons from the GFC, policymakers announced  actions to address conditions quickly in order to restore confidence.  Fortunately, many tools used during the GFC—including  expanded U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines, enhanced terms of Discount Window  lending, and 13(3) facilities—were able to be revived, with good results.  Indeed, the Commercial  Paper Funding Facility ( CPFF), Money  Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF), Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF),  and Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) were all substantively  similar to facilities employed during the GFC. 5 And,  during the pandemic, the CPFF and MMLF in particular were highly effective at  stabilizing money funds and short-term funding markets.\n\nHowever, we also developed new approaches and tools to  address the unique circumstances associated with the pandemic.  The Desk conducted large-scale and  effectively full-allotment repo operations to stabilize short term funding  markets. 6 Purchases of U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed  securities (MBS)  were initiated with unprecedented speed and scale to address severe dysfunction  in the markets for these securities. 7 The Federal Reserve also introduced a temporary  FIMA repo facility to support global dollar funding conditions and to stem  sales of Treasury securities. 8 New lending facilities were established, in  coordination with the U.S. Treasury, to directly support the flow of credit to small-  and medium-sized businesses and nonprofit organizations, corporations, and  state and local governments. 9\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s actions—many  in close coordination with the U.S. Treasury, and alongside a forceful fiscal  response from the U.S. government and the temporary adjustment of regulations  to encourage lending—brought confidence back in  financial markets. 10 I believe it was this broadly  integrated approach, the swift and agile response, and the unwavering  commitment by policymakers to using their full range of tools that ultimately  helped restore market functioning.\n\nLessons  for the Future: Announcement Effects and Liquidity Needs\n\nAs I look  back, one thing I reflect on is the notable differences across the various  tools in terms of the scale needed to achieve success.  In some cases, the announcement of a program  or facility was sufficient to inspire a strong positive response in the target  markets.  Meanwhile, other tools required  large-scale usage to achieve desired results.   In particular, repo operations, swap lines, and asset purchases all expanded  the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet on a large scale.\n\nWhat were  the factors that gave rise to these differences, and how can we apply the lessons  from this experience?\n\nAnnouncement  effects are a critical element of most central bank actions.  Asset prices are forward-looking, and a credible  commitment to lend or to purchase assets alleviates strains in the  present by shifting expectations about future financial conditions.  In financial crises, announcements that central  bank liquidity will be available soon can temper asset sales and other actions  to raise liquidity.  Announcements can  also enhance the supply of funding and market liquidity.  If intermediaries or end investors are  confident that liquidity will be available in the future, either in the form of  funding or asset purchases, they may perceive market-making and investing as  less risky today—restoring the flow of transactions before any central bank operations  are conducted.\n\nAs an example, the announcements of credit facilities  during the pandemic, including the Corporate Credit Facilities (CCFs) and  Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF), were generally effective at reducing risk  premia and restoring the flow of credit in private markets. 11 The success of facilities despite limited  actual take-up demonstrates that when announcement effects are powerful,  take-up is not the best measure of a central bank program’s impact. 12 During the GFC, the announcement of the first  large-scale asset purchase program in November 2008 substantially improved  conditions in MBS markets even before asset purchases began in January 2009. 13\n\nOn  the other hand, in my experience, policy announcements are less effective when market  dysfunction arises from an immediate demand for U.S. dollars.  For example, a firm that needs to meet margin  calls or an investor that faces redemptions today must actually obtain the  cash; the prospect of cash at some future date is not enough. In these  circumstances, the underlying demand for liquidity may not be satisfied by  enhancing confidence and limiting negative feedback loops with expectations for  future central bank interventions.  When  this is the case, it is only actually delivering liquidity—through asset  purchases or lending—that calms conditions.\n\nAt the onset of the pandemic crisis, the immediate and intense demand  for cash required substantial interventions.   We were fortunate to have repo operations in place at the time that  helped limit the intensity of potential pressures.  However, it took successive increases in the  size of those operations to stabilize repo market conditions.  Similarly, initial announcements establishing  large-scale Treasury and agency MBS purchases did little to quell pressures,  and it was not until actual purchases were increased in size that conditions  slowly began to improve. 14 , 15\n\nTo summarize, shocks can create rapid  shifts in the demand for liquidity that lead to severe financial market  dysfunction.  To the extent that  announcements of central bank actions can reduce that liquidity demand and encourage  a return to normal investing and market-making activity, they can significantly  improve conditions even with little or no actual activity.  However, the most immediate liquidity needs are  unlikely to be resolved by announcements alone and thus require active  operations to address them.  In both of  these crises—as well as during other liquidity shocks, such as the one that  occurred in September 2019—we learned that when immediate liquidity needs  arise, the time needed to put in place a response, even one that is fairly  ready for deployment, risks worsening a fragile situation.  Central banks should maintain a comprehensive  set of tools, some of which are available to meet the most immediate needs, to  address these circumstances.\n\nTwo New Standing Facilities\n\nSo, what does this mean for the  future?  Certainly, these events will continue  to be studied by academics and practitioners for years to come, and the lessons  will be many and varied.  Today, however,  I would like to highlight a few recent decisions by the FOMC.\n\nAs many of you may be aware, the  FOMC has discussed standing repo facilities for a number of years in the  context of its monetary implementation framework. 16 Based on recent experience with repo operations  and their ability to support policy implementation, particularly during periods  of stress in overnight markets, the FOMC renewed its deliberations in recent  meetings. 17\n\nAt its July meeting, the FOMC established  two standing repo facilities as tools in the Fed’s policy implementation  framework: a domestic standing repo facility (SRF) and a repo facility for  foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facility). 18 These facilities will serve as backstops in  money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and  smooth market functioning.\n\nThe SRF enhances control over the  federal funds rate by limiting pressures in the repo markets that could spill into  other overnight money markets. 19 The facility is positioned and priced as  a backstop with a minimum bid rate of 25 basis points, corresponding to the top  of the target range for the federal funds rate.   This pricing allows for robust private activity to occur under most  market conditions, but limits the potential for spikes in repo rates to move  the effective federal funds rate outside of the target range.  SRF counterparties include primary dealers  and will be expanded to include depository institutions that will be able to access  liquidity through this facility and at the discount window. 20 Treasuries, agency debt, and agency MBS will  be accepted to ensure the facility can effectively address pressures that arise  in markets for repo backed by high-quality liquid collateral. 21\n\nThe FIMA Repo Facility establishes a standing facility  to address global dollar funding pressures that may affect U.S. financial  conditions.  The facility provides  foreign official accounts with a temporary source of liquidity against their  holdings of U.S. Treasury securities held in custody at the New York Fed,  presenting an alternative to outright sales of those securities.  This facility complements the existing U.S.  dollar liquidity swap lines by extending access to dollar funding to a broader  range of central banks and foreign official institutions.  The rate is the same as on the SRF to create  alignment across facilities to support effective policy implementation.\n\nThe presence of these facilities should  create confidence that liquidity at a backstop rate will be available in  overnight money markets as needed, potentially limiting the demand for  precautionary liquidity and the run-like dynamics that can occur.  Equally important, they will be available on  a standing basis to meet immediate liquidity needs should they arise.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile I hope we can avoid future  shocks to the financial system and the disruptions to the economy that they  cause, history teaches us that unpredictable events will challenge financial  markets from time to time.  Central banks  will need to respond to new environments and new shocks.  Nonetheless, there are some recurring  elements of liquidity shocks from which we can learn.  The SRF and FIMA Repo Facility will provide  backstops in overnight money markets that help address immediate demand for  dollar liquidity, both domestically and internationally, when shocks  occur.\n\nI hope that the continued study of  crisis events will yield further lessons for central bankers looking to shield  economies from the effects of shocks to the financial system.",

    "text": "Thank you for inviting me to speak and  for that kind introduction.  For years I  have had the privilege to be a part of the audience at these events, and it’s  an honor to be asked to address the group.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Implementation Framework Is Working  Well\n\nThe Federal Reserve has  successfully raised the overnight federal funds rate three times since December  2015 in the gradual process of normalizing the stance of monetary policy.  During this time, the effective federal funds  rate has printed within the prevailing target range set by the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC).  These results  have been achieved with an abundant supply of reserve balances created in the  banking system by large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) from 2008 through 2014 and  amid significant changes in U.S. money markets. 2\n\nA central bank’s operational framework  for implementing monetary policy is designed to control policymakers’ selected  target, typically a short-term interest rate.  Since December 2015, the Federal Reserve has  been using a floor-style framework that allows us to change short-term interest  rates while maintaining an abundant supply of reserve balances that has  fluctuated in a wide range, mostly above $2 trillion.  We can illustrate this framework with a stylized  graph showing the relationship between the interest rate and banks’ demand for  reserves (Figure 1) .  When reserves are  scarce, the curve slopes steeply downward, and small variations in the supply  of reserve balances produce sharp moves in interest rates.  But when reserves become plentiful enough, banks’  demand flattens out, and interest rates become effectively insensitive to  shifts in reserve supply.  The interest  rate at which the curve levels out reflects the return that banks receive on  reserves held at the central bank.  Thus,  in a floor system, undesired upward movements in rates are prevented by making  the supply of reserves abundant enough to intersect the flat part of the demand  curve, while undesired downward movements are prevented by establishing the rate  of interest paid on reserves held at the central bank.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s implementation  of a floor regime is unique in featuring two tools that help prevent the  effective federal funds rate from falling appreciably below the FOMC’s target  range.  The primary tool—interest on  reserves (IOR)—applies to the reserve balances held by banks in their accounts  with the Federal Reserve. 3 In principle, the federal funds rate should  not fall below IOR, because depository institutions have no incentive to lend federal  funds at interest rates below what they could earn simply by leaving the funds  in their reserve accounts.  However, a  number of frictions have caused the effective federal funds rate to print  moderately below IOR, leading the Federal Reserve to use a supplementary tool—a  facility that offers overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs) at a  specified offering rate to a wide range of counterparties. 4\n\nThe ON RRP facility helps to  reinforce the floor under market interest rates by providing an outside  investment option to a broad group of nonbank market participants that are not  eligible to earn IOR. 5 We’ve observed that a high volume of actual ON  RRP usage has not been necessary to achieve interest rate control.  In the first half of 2016, for example, average  daily usage of the facility was $63 billion.   In principle, even with zero usage, the ON RRP facility can support market  rates by ensuring that counterparties demand rates on other investments at  least as attractive as the rate offered on the Federal Reserve’s ON RRPs.\n\nThe ON RRP facility also serves as  a flexible shock absorber that helps to maintain interest rate control when transitory  shifts occur in the supply and demand for short-term market instruments.  For example, around key month- and quarter-end  reporting dates, some financial institutions shrink their balance sheets, a  measure that reduces the availability of private money market investments, puts  downward pressure on money market rates, and produces higher ON RRP take-up.  Last fall, the ON RRP facility also helped to  maintain rate control during the implementation of money market fund reform by temporarily  absorbing heightened demand for safe, overnight investments by government money  market funds.\n\nThus, with almost a year and a half  of experience with a federal funds target above the zero lower bound, our current  approach has so far proved to be both effective and resilient to structural  changes in the market.  The new framework  is also quite simple and efficient from an operational perspective.  To fully appreciate this, it’s useful to look  back at the conduct of open market operations before the global financial crisis.\n\nOpen Market Operations in Money Markets Pre-Crisis\n\nPrior to the crisis, the Federal  Reserve’s operational framework was similar to a corridor system based on  reserve scarcity. 6 At that time, the Federal Reserve did not pay  interest on reserves.  Banks’ demand for  reserves balanced the costs of falling short of their reserve requirements  against the opportunity cost of holding too many non-interest-bearing reserves  or of borrowing reserves at a penalty rate.   This trade-off created a steeply downward-sloping demand curve for  reserves (Figure 2) .  Facing that demand  curve, the Desk conducted daily open market operations to bring the system’s aggregate  supply of reserves to a level where it would meet the estimated demand at or  near the FOMC’s target federal funds rate. 7 Active interbank trading distributed these reserves  within the system, between banks with a surplus of reserves and those with a  deficit.\n\nManaging the supply of reserves at  levels that kept the federal funds rate from moving too high or too low was a  technically challenging exercise that required both market knowledge and expert  judgment. 8 Reserve forecasters on the Desk and at the Federal  Reserve Board of Governors projected various elements that could affect the  supply of and demand for reserves over multiple days ahead.  Anticipating changes in the supply of  reserves required a detailed understanding of numerous factors, many of which  were driven by forces outside the control of the Federal Reserve—so-called “autonomous  factors,” such as balances held by the Treasury in its account at the Federal  Reserve or physical U.S. currency held by the public.  To determine the demand for reserves, staff gathered information to estimate banks’ reserve needs  and plans for meeting them over each two-week reserve maintenance period. 9 Using this information, staff planned open  market operations—specifically, overnight and term repurchase agreements, and purchases  of Treasury securities—to affect reserve conditions throughout each maintenance  period.  Uncertainty about various  factors, such as swings in banks’ clearing needs, meant that fluctuations in  banks’ demand for reserves could not be completely forecasted, especially on a  daily basis, but even predictable variations resulted in the need for open market  operations on most days.\n\nIn normal times, we were reliably  proficient in hitting the FOMC’s target rate.   However, interest rate control was more challenging at times when  autonomous factors or the demand for reserves was harder to predict.  These challenges were particularly acute during  the early stages of the financial crisis, when large changes in reserve demand caused  significant intraday swings in federal funds rates. 10 A framework based on actively managing the  supply of reserves was, from an operational perspective, also a discretionary and  interventionist approach, albeit one that required only small adjustments on  most days.  Moreover, the pre-crisis framework created costly  cash management regimes for banks, which had to meet reserve requirements and  avoid overnight overdrafts in an environment with reserve scarcity and the high  opportunity costs entailed by holding reserves.\n\nOpen Market Operations in Money Markets Today The Desk’s role now is quite  different.  With reserve balances far in  excess of banks’ reserve requirements, the Desk cannot meaningfully influence  the federal funds rate by changing the supply of reserves, so the Federal  Reserve achieves control over the federal funds rate by setting rates on  various central bank liabilities.\n\nThe Desk’s operational charge for maintaining  the federal funds rate in the FOMC’s target range is now centered on running the  ON RRP facility.  On a daily basis, the  Desk auctions ON RRPs at an offering rate and aggregate offering limit set by the  FOMC.  The operation is based on price,  not quantity, so there is nothing to forecast ahead of time. 11 Market forces then keep the federal funds  rate within the FOMC’s target range by pricing private trades against the  alternative option of investing with the Federal Reserve, rather than by having  interbank trading redistribute reserves throughout the system, as it did before  the crisis.  However, this approach  relies on the Desk maintaining a larger and more heterogeneous set of counterparty  relationships than before the crisis.\n\nWe support this framework with  substantial market analysis, but the nature of the analysis has changed.  The current framework does not require  high-frequency forecasts of factors affecting the supply of and demand for reserves.   Instead, we analyze trading dynamics and  relationships among a broad set of market participants to build knowledge about  how our tools affect private sector trading incentives and how market developments  might affect policy implementation.  This  knowledge helps us to better understand the first steps in the transmission of the  monetary policy stance, to assess the efficacy of policy implementation, and to  provide advice on how the Federal Reserve could adjust the framework and tools  if needed to ensure they remain effective. 12\n\nWhat Could the Monetary Policy Implementation Framework Look Like in  the Future?\n\nThe current framework was developed  as a means for the Federal Reserve to normalize the stance of monetary policy after  the extraordinary balance sheet expansion that was undertaken in the aftermath  of the crisis, but policymakers have begun to consider what framework to use in  the longer run. 13 In a preliminary discussion about the long-run  monetary policy implementation framework held in November 2016, FOMC  participants commented on the advantages of an approach to policy  implementation similar to the one currently in use, in which active management  of the supply of reserves would not be required.  They noted that such an approach could be compatible  with a balance sheet that was much smaller than the current one, though likely at  least somewhat larger than the pre-crisis balance sheet.  Such an approach was seen as “likely to be relatively  simple and efficient to administer, relatively straightforward to communicate,  and effective in enabling interest rate control across a wide range of  circumstances.” 14 However, policymakers made no decisions on  these issues and acknowledged that they expected to learn from additional  experience before making such judgments.\n\nIn the meantime, I believe it is  important that we continue to consider what a “new normal” might look like in  order to ensure operational and analytical readiness—just as we spent several  years preparing to raise the federal funds rate away from zero by expanding  counterparties, developing and testing ON RRPs and various types of term reserve-draining  operations, and enhancing our collection of data on money market activity.\n\nWhat Might the Balance Sheet and Open Market Operations Look Like in  the Future?\n\nThe FOMC’s statement on Policy  Normalization Principles and Plans notes that in the long-run, the FOMC intends  to “hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy  efficiently and effectively.”  It is challenging  to determine far in advance what balance sheet size would accomplish this  objective.  However, it is probable that the  normalized balance sheet will be considerably larger than its pre-crisis level,  even before considering the volume of reserves that the FOMC would decide to  supply.  The reason is that recent growth  trends in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities will augment the  necessary size of the normalized balance sheet independent of the operational  framework adopted by the FOMC in the long run.   To understand this point, it’s useful to consider the liability side of the  Federal Reserve’s current balance sheet (Figure 3) .\n\nFirst, currency in circulation—a  central bank’s traditional liability—remains a large and growing balance sheet  item.  Federal Reserve notes outstanding  have nearly doubled since the start of the crisis, with a current level of  about $1.5 trillion, implying that currency demand alone requires a much larger  balance sheet than before the crisis.  A  simple assumption is that U.S. currency in circulation will grow in line with  nominal U.S. GDP growth.  However, it is easy  to imagine shocks that could materially affect currency growth, either positively  or negatively.  For example, with heavy  usage of U.S. paper currency overseas, demand for dollars appears sensitive to  changes in global growth and financial and geopolitical stability. 15 In addition, it is hard to know what  longer-term implications financial technology will have for currency demand.\n\nSecond, the U.S. Treasury holds  cash balances at the Federal Reserve in the Treasury General Account (TGA), its  primary “checking account.”  Before the  crisis, Treasury targeted a TGA balance of $5 billion on most days; those balances  increased during the global financial crisis.   In May 2015, the Treasury announced plans to hold a level of cash  generally sufficient to cover one week of outflows to help protect against a  potential interruption in market access. 16 Since that cash management policy went into  effect, TGA balances have averaged around $250 billion, reaching as high as $440  billion.\n\nThird, designated financial market  utilities (DFMUs) can now establish and hold cash deposits in Reserve Bank  accounts. 17 The buildup of DFMU balances has prompted “other  deposits” on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to grow steadily over recent years to a current level of about $85  billion, compared to a pre-crisis average of less than $1 billion.  The other deposits category also includes balances  held by GSEs and international and multilateral organizations. 18\n\nFourth, the Federal Reserve has  long offered an overnight repurchase agreement investment to foreign official  and international account holders—a service known as the foreign repo pool.  The foreign repo pool has grown from an  average level of around $30 billion before the crisis to an average of about $250  billion now.  The rise reflects foreign central  banks’ preferences to maintain robust dollar liquidity buffers, reduced  availability of alternative low-risk investment options with private  counterparties, and the New York Fed’s removal of constraints on account  holders’ ability to vary the size of their investments.\n\nIn projecting the size of the  normalized balance sheet, one can make assumptions about the long-run trends  that will determine future levels for each of these non-reserve liabilities,  subject to various kinds of uncertainty.   Even taken at today’s levels, the TGA, other deposits, and the foreign  repo pool alone account for about $600 billion of the Federal Reserve’s current  balance sheet size.  Adding on currency  outstanding brings this set of non-reserve liabilities to $2.1 trillion today,  and this set is likely to grow as the economy continues to expand.  This sum does not yet consider reserves or ON  RRPs.\n\nThe ON RRP facility, which has averaged  around $165 billion this year, is another non-reserve liability that one might need  to factor into balance sheet projections.   The FOMC has said that it plans to phase out the ON RRP facility when it  is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.  However, as mentioned earlier, the facility  has been a useful shock absorber amid structural changes in money markets, and  it may be that some such facility would be helpful in maintaining effective  interest rate control should the FOMC decide to remain in a floor system in the  longer run.  Of course, a decision to  maintain an ON RRP facility would require longer-term choices about  counterparty relationships and consideration of possible financial stability  risks. 19\n\nFinally, to complete projections  for the normalized size of the balance sheet, we must consider reserve balances,  currently the Federal Reserve’s largest liability.  Two components will help shape the long-run  level of reserve balances:  banks’ demand  for reserves and what, if any, additional supply of reserves might be deemed  appropriate for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.\n\nThe precise shape and position of banks’  demand curve is not currently known, but we generally understand the key forces  that are likely to influence it.  Changes  in bank liquidity regulation and supervision since the crisis will be  particularly important. 20 In this new environment, we will need to  consider the relative attractiveness of rates paid on reserves and close  substitutes, such as Treasury securities, as well as banks’ propensity to  substitute between these assets in meeting their liquidity requirements.  Other characteristics of reserves may boost  their inherent appeal—for example, intraday liquidity that supports clearing  and settlement activities, or perceptions that holding reserves makes an  institution safer.  These factors are likely  to contribute to higher and more variable demand for reserves than banks had  before the crisis.  If the demand curve  for reserve balances has indeed shifted out, then a greater supply of reserves  will be needed to attain a given interest rate target.\n\nMoreover, it is important to take  into account how uncertainty and increased variability in the non-reserve liabilities  I’ve discussed could warrant an additional supply of reserves (Figure 4) .  For example, TGA balances exhibit significant  day-to-day variation stemming from the settlement of securities and the receipt  of tax payments.  All else equal, changes  in non-reserve liabilities have the opposite effect on the supply of  reserves.  What these variations will  mean for the amount of reserves the Federal Reserve decides to supply—and also  for the size of the normalized balance sheet and the types of open market  operations that will be employed—will depend heavily on the operational framework  the FOMC chooses in the longer run.\n\nTo remain in a floor system, the  Federal Reserve would need to supply enough reserves to satisfy bank demand  along the flat portion of the reserves demand curve.  It would also need to ensure that even amid  shocks to non-reserve liabilities, the supply of reserves would stay on the flat  part of the demand curve.  There are  essentially three ways to accomplish that objective.  First, as in the past, the Federal Reserve could  establish limits for the overall size of or daily variations in non-reserve account  balances.  Second, the Desk could carry  out open market operations to offset fluctuations in reserve-absorbing factors,  similar to what we did in our pre-crisis framework but at a lower frequency.  Third, the balance sheet could include an  additional buffer of excess reserves sufficient to ensure that most shocks  would still leave us safely to the right of the steep part of the demand curve.  Providing this additional buffer would  require that the Federal Reserve retain a corresponding amount of assets.\n\nAn important trade-off in a floor  system arises between the size of that additional buffer and the frequency and  size of open market operations.  In the  current floor framework, the buffer is more than large enough to absorb shocks without  the need to conduct offsetting open market operations.  In fact, the level of reserve balances has  fluctuated by as much as $700 billion since the start of 2016 with no material impact  on federal funds market dynamics.  To  project the balance sheet’s long-run size, one could try to estimate the size  of a conservative buffer by examining the distribution of changes in currency, the  TGA, other deposits, and the foreign repo pool.  Data since January 2016 suggest an additional  buffer of reserves of about $145 billion would absorb 99 percent of changes in  the daily average holdings of these liabilities from week to week (Figure 4) .  Accounting for variability in ON RRPs could  add another $215 billion to the buffer. 21\n\nIn a floor system with a buffer  that would sufficiently accommodate swings in non-reserve liabilities, IOR  would continue to be the primary tool to maintain interest rate control,  perhaps supported by ON RRPs if needed.   In addition, the Federal Reserve would still need to conduct some reserve-adding  open market operations, but only periodically, to accommodate trend growth of  balance sheet items like currency; otherwise, the quantity of reserves would  eventually be smaller than that needed for efficient and effective policy  implementation.\n\nHowever, if the FOMC wanted to  maintain a somewhat smaller balance sheet, it might prefer to operate a floor  system with a smaller buffer.  In this  case, the Desk would have to use regular reserve-adding open market operations  to offset transitory shocks to reserve-absorbing factors in addition to secular  trends.  The smaller the buffer, the more  the Desk’s operational schedule and supporting analysis would need to focus on  short-run changes in demand for the Federal Reserve’s liabilities.\n\nReturning to a corridor system, in  which we operate on the steep part of the demand curve, would mean an even  smaller balance sheet.  Daily forecasting  and frequent open market operations would once again be required to manage the supply  of reserves in the face of either reserve-adding or reserve-absorbing shocks in  order to maintain interest rate control.\n\nOne could put together all of these  elements—one’s projected levels for the range of non-reserve liabilities and assumptions  about the supply of reserves—to arrive  at some rough estimates of the range of balance sheet sizes that would be  required under these different operational frameworks. 22 However, the uncertainties surrounding these  factors at this stage are very large.  Furthermore,  the variability of these factors over time suggests that the size of the  balance sheet that best balances the trade-offs will evolve as the structure of  money markets and other factors change.  In  practice, it will likely be necessary for the Federal Reserve to closely monitor  the behavior of money markets as its balance sheet shrinks, and to use that information  to enhance our understanding of the evolution of the demand for reserves and  the other, non-reserve liabilities.\n\nHow Might We Know When We Are Getting Close to a Normalized Balance  Sheet Size?\n\nThe FOMC is currently maintaining  the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by reinvesting payments of  principal on its securities holdings and has said that it anticipates  continuing to do so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate  is well underway.  When the FOMC reduces  its securities holdings, the supply of reserves will also shrink.  As that process occurs, understanding evolving  money market dynamics and the structure of the reserves market will be a  central component of the Desk’s analytical agenda—regardless of whether the  FOMC decides to remain in a floor system or return to a corridor system.  A key focus for interest rate control will be  assessing the shape and position of the reserve demand curve and interpreting financial  market conditions to gauge how far we are from the steep portion of it.  Our thinking on this is still evolving, but  let me offer a few thoughts.\n\nUpward pressure on overnight  interest rates is the most direct indicator that reserves are becoming scarce.  If the FOMC were to return to a corridor  system, this would be the main indicator we would need.  An increase in rates would likely suggest that  reserve supply had moved onto the steep part of the demand curve, exhibiting  the desired reserve scarcity that is associated with this type of operational  framework.  In assessing when to stop  reducing the balance sheet to remain in a floor system, however, upward  pressure on rates might not be as useful an indicator.  Although brief increases in rates might not be  materially adverse, a longer-lasting rise in rates would be a sign that  reserves had already become scarcer  than needed to maintain interest rate control.  Thus, for a floor system, it will be important  to develop and assess more forward-looking indicators to signal impending  reserve scarcity.\n\nData from the Federal Reserve’s Report of Selected Money Market Rates (FR  2420) provide visibility into transactions in a range of unsecured funding  markets and could be leveraged to develop some such indicators.  Changes in the distribution of traded funding  rates or in the nature of trading in the federal funds market might be signs that conditions  in money markets were becoming more directly influenced by the amount of reserves.   For example, most market activity today  is characterized by banks borrowing from nonbanks to earn IOR.  As reserves are reduced, a shift towards banks  borrowing reserves to cover unexpected shortfalls could be a sign of mounting  reserve scarcity.  Banks needing to cover  shortfalls might borrow from nonbanks at rates closer to IOR or from banks,  likely at rates above IOR (since banks are unlikely to lend reserves at a rate  below what they could earn if they left the funds in their reserve account). 23\n\nMonitoring correlations between  trade volumes and rates might also be informative.  Higher volumes accompanied by lower rates—a  negative correlation—could suggest an increase in arbitrage activity as banks  try to earn the spread between market rates and IOR, while a positive  correlation between volumes and rates could indicate that banks need to borrow  reserves at relatively high rates at the end of the day to cover reserve  shortfalls. 24\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up:  The Federal Reserve’s framework for implementing  monetary policy has evolved quite substantially since the financial crisis. The  unique floor system we’ve adopted to influence short-term interest rates, which  uses interest on reserves and overnight reverse repos as support, has given the  FOMC excellent control of the federal funds rate and supported efficient  transmission to other money market rates.\n\nIn the longer run, the Federal  Reserve could choose to retain the floor system to implement monetary policy or  shift back to a corridor system.  Under either  operational framework, the balance sheet would decline significantly from its  current size, but remain substantially larger than it was pre-crisis in order  to accommodate its non-reserve liabilities and to supply an appropriate  quantity of reserves.  Moreover, the balance  sheet’s size will change over time, driven by changes in longer-run demand for various  Federal Reserve liabilities.\n\nIf the Committee remains in a floor  system, the Federal Reserve will need to supply enough reserves to satisfy  demand along the flat portion of the reserve demand curve plus, perhaps, an  additional buffer to absorb variability in demand for non-reserve liabilities.  These considerations would contribute to a  larger balance sheet than in a corridor system.   The size of the buffer would influence the need to conduct open market  operations to offset temporary shocks, so policymakers would need to consider a  trade-off between a larger balance sheet that accommodates this buffer and the  complexity associated with more active forecasting and open market operations.\n\nOnce the Committee begins to reduce  the balance sheet, we will track market dynamics to gauge the impact of  declining reserve balances. Given the uniqueness of the current operational  framework and the substantial ongoing changes in money markets, this task will  present an interesting challenge for the staff, and one that we are preparing  for as we carry out our operational and analytical responsibilities.\n\nThank you.  I would be happy to answer any questions.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Good morning, and thank you to the  Brookings Institution-Chicago Booth Task Force on Financial Stability for  convening this discussion on such a critical topic. This has been a year marked  by tremendous human suffering related to the pandemic and unprecedented  challenges for the global economy and financial markets. The events that  unfolded in March and April underscored the importance of understanding market  functioning and liquidity so that financial markets continue to serve their  important role in supporting the economy. 1\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the  global financial system experienced an extraordinary shock, triggered by the coronavirus  pandemic. Asset prices adjusted sharply, reflecting increasing pessimism and  uncertainty about the economic outlook as large segments of the economy began  to shut down. A spike in financial market volatility, combined with concerns  about markets’ ability to function in a remote work environment, resulted in a surge  in the demand for cash.\n\nThe Federal Reserve took swift and  decisive action in response to both the shift in the economic outlook and  deteriorating conditions in financial markets. 2 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut the target range for the federal  funds rate close to zero, and directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) to  conduct repo operations and purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed  securities (MBS) to support the smooth functioning of these markets. The  Federal Reserve undertook a wide range of additional steps—many in coordination  with the U.S. Treasury—to support the flow of credit to households, businesses,  and state and local governments. Regulations were also temporarily adjusted to  encourage bank lending. These  comprehensive actions, alongside swift passage of the CARES Act to support the  U.S. economy, were essential for stabilizing U.S. financial markets and  averting an even deeper collapse in economic activity.\n\nThe disruption in the U.S. Treasury  market was especially notable, as measures of market functioning deteriorated  at unparalleled speed to levels not seen since the Global Financial Crisis. The  Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid fixed-income market in the world.  It serves as a critical benchmark for all other dollar fixed-income markets,  both in the U.S. and abroad, including the mortgage, corporate debt, and  municipal bond markets that are essential to the flow of credit. Given the  importance of the Treasury market, continued dysfunction could have led to an  even deeper and broader seizing-up of credit and ultimately worsened the economic  hardships that many Americans have been experiencing.\n\nThe Desk initially responded to the  severe dysfunction by expanding repo operations, and then, at the direction of  the FOMC, by buying a substantial quantity of Treasury securities and agency  MBS. The FOMC then demonstrated a more forceful commitment by directing the  Desk to purchase these securities “in the amounts needed” to support smooth  functioning of these markets. The speed and scale of these actions—and the  flexibility with which they were deployed—stabilized and eventually restored market  functioning, and in June the FOMC transitioned the objective of purchases to sustaining smooth market functioning. During  the period from March to June, the Federal Reserve purchased a total of around $1.6  trillion of Treasuries and $700 billion of agency MBS, as shown in Figure 1 . 3\n\nIn recent months, the public and  private sectors initiated broad-based efforts to better understand the dynamics  that led to the Treasury market dislocation in March and April. Ongoing research  is helping shape our views of what happened, and last month the New York Fed, along  with other Joint Member Agencies, co-hosted the sixth annual U.S. Treasury Market  Conference. 4 Participants  focused on the causes of the Treasury market disruption and potential measures  that could be taken to ensure the market’s resilience going forward.\n\nToday, I want to share some observations  from our experience executing open market operations on the Desk during this  period, and from the developing body of research and discussions. I would note that  the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of  the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Have I Taken Away  from the Data and Research So Far?\n\nData and developing research offer  perspective on important elements of the events of last spring. Though many  aspects of what occurred warrant further study, I would like to focus my  remarks on insights that the data and research provide about the exceptional desire  to sell Treasury securities, and the capacity of the Treasury market  infrastructure to manage these flows.\n\nOn the Desk, we certainly heard  from our contacts and observed in the data available to us at the time that  there was an extraordinary volume of selling by Treasury investors. Since then,  data have confirmed that the size of those sales was unprecedented. As shown in Figure 2 , customer transaction  volumes reported by primary dealers spiked from an average level of around $400  billion per day in February to a peak of around $650 billion per day in mid-March—an  increase of more than 50 percent. The more granular data from the Trade  Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) confirm that the size of the risk being  transferred was exceptional. The top half of Figure 3 shows the volume of daily customer sales of off-the-run Treasury  securities expressed in “10-year equivalents,” a measure of the dollar amount  of securities normalized by their interest rate risk. 5 The bottom half shows customer purchases, net of the Federal Reserve’s  purchases. The difference between these, in red, highlights the extraordinary degree  of market liquidity being demanded by customers.\n\nWe also observed in March and April  that these sales of Treasury securities were coming from a wide range of investors. While some commentary since then has  focused on the role of certain investor types and strategies, recent data and work  by academics help to dimension the broad-based nature of the selling. 6\n\nMutual funds appear to have sold in  exceptionally large volumes, as these funds monetized their most liquid asset holdings  to prepare for potential redemptions and rebalance their portfolios. As shown  in Figure 4 , net sales of Treasuries  by domestic mutual funds totaled almost $200 billion in the first quarter, the  largest quarterly decline on record. 7\n\nForeign official accounts, some of  which were raising funds to meet actual and anticipated local needs for U.S.  dollars, were also large net sellers, as shown by data from official accounts  held at the New York Fed depicted in Figure 5 . According to data from the Federal Reserve’s Financial Accounts of the  United States, shown in Figure 6 , foreign  accounts, both official and private, sold a meaningful amount of Treasuries in  the first quarter, although these data also include funds that operate in the  U.S. but are domiciled offshore.\n\nThere has been significant attention  on hedge fund sales of Treasury securities, and whether these amplified the stresses  in the Treasury market. We heard in March and April that the sharp increase in  volatility and futures margins resulted in relative value funds and other levered  strategies reducing their positions. 8 According to the U.S. Financial Accounts data, net sales of Treasury securities  by households—a category that includes private investors domiciled in the U.S.—were  notable in the first quarter, shown in Figure 7 . 9 We also observed that the reduction in net short positions in Treasury futures held  by levered accounts accelerated sharply in March, as shown in Figure 8 . Some research papers  attribute a significant degree of the stress to hedge funds unwinding cash-futures  basis positions, while others question whether these strategies were a meaningful  contributor to the dynamics. 10 This is difficult to judge, in large part because the available data on hedge  fund holdings and transactions are incomplete. In the context of broad-based  selling pressure, though, I think of these sales as an important contributing  factor, but not the sole source of the challenges.\n\nIn addition to giving greater  insight into the historic size and breadth of sales, data and recent research shed  light on how the Treasury market responded to these extraordinary flows.\n\nBefore diving into this, I’d like  to start with some background on the ecosystem of Treasury market intermediation.  Broadly speaking, trading takes place in two separate but connected market segments:  the dealer-to-client segment, where dealers transact with end-investors, and  the interdealer segment, which is generally comprised of dealers and principal  trading firms, or “PTFs,” trading with one another in the most liquid  securities and largely on electronic limit order books. 11 The interdealer segment is critical to the intermediation process, as it allows  participants to manage risk and adjust positions rapidly and serves as an  important source of price discovery in Treasuries. These features support the intermediation  of customer flows and the smooth functioning of the Treasury market overall. 12\n\nOur observations in March and April  were that these intermediation channels became highly strained. The data show that  dealers entered March with inventories of Treasury securities that were already  high by historical standards, and, as depicted in Figure 9 , those inventories grew as investors sold securities. Our conversations  with dealers suggest that, amid a sharp increase in perceived risk, it became  increasingly challenging to hold these positions and absorb new ones. In March,  volatility in Treasury markets soared to levels not seen since the Global Financial  Crisis, as shown in Figure 10 . 13 Heightened volatility increases the risk that dealers face in intermediating  markets, as prices have greater potential to move during the period between the  purchase and sale of securities. In this environment, dealers noted that risk  measures rose sharply, and many suggested that internal risk management processes  developed to ensure compliance with regulations limited the nimbleness with  which they could respond to rapidly evolving circumstances.\n\nIn an environment of extraordinary  volatility and large Treasury sales, the terms on which dealers were willing to  make markets deteriorated sharply. For example, in less liquid off-the-run Treasury  securities, bid-ask spreads, which are a measure of the price that investors  pay to transact, rose to almost 30 times their normal levels and reached  historic wides, as shown in Figure 11 .\n\nDeteriorating conditions in the  interdealer market likely exacerbated the challenges that dealers faced  providing market liquidity to their customers by limiting their ability to efficiently  manage risk. As highlighted in a recent note by Federal Reserve economists  Dobrislav Dobrev and Andrew Meldrum, market depth in on-the-run Treasury securities  fell dramatically compared to typical levels, and standing orders near the top  of the order book on electronic systems were not replenished rapidly enough to  keep pace with increased trading volumes. Figure 12 , reproduced from their note, illustrates this sharp drop in  market depth, showing the top level and top three levels of the order book on a  normal day, on the left, and on a highly stressed day in mid-March, on the  right. 14 , 15 Liquidity providers in this market—both dealers and PTFs—faced high and  unpredictable volatility and flows that made it riskier to maintain or quickly restore  standing orders. Overall, PTFs, which are more thinly capitalized and do not  typically hold positions overnight, appear to have reduced the competitiveness  of their intermediation to a somewhat greater degree, as their share of transaction  volume fell, depicted in Figure 13 . 16\n\nNonetheless, it seems important to  note that while the terms on which Treasuries were intermediated deteriorated  dramatically, a much higher-than-normal volume of private transactions still  occurred. So, while liquidity was severely strained, the volume that  intermediaries were managing was still quite high, even in the less liquid  market segments such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and  off-the-run Treasury securities.\n\nIn sum, I interpret the work to date  as confirming our observations at the time that unprecedented demand for cash led  to selling that was historic in size and broad-based in nature. Intermediation  activity expanded, but was unable to keep pace, and the market came under severe  strain. As a result, the Fed stepped in to buy securities at unprecedented  scale and speed, ultimately restoring and sustaining effective market  functioning.\n\nWhat Ideas Have Been Raised  That Could Make the Market More Resilient?\n\nAt the U.S. Treasury Market Conference,  there was an insightful and robust discussion among industry professionals,  academics, and policymakers about Treasury market resilience. 17 While participants acknowledged that there is still much more to learn about  the events of March and April, many shared early ideas on how the resiliency of  this critical market might be enhanced over time.\n\nFinancial  markets are always evolving in response to changes in the environment,  including technology, regulation, and business models. Participants at the  conference noted that, in recent years, we have seen substantial growth in the share  of electronic intermediation, significant changes in the regulation of key  intermediaries, and a meaningful shift in both the outstanding size and holders  of Treasury debt.\n\nParticipants highlighted how each  of these has brought substantive benefits, but may also present new considerations.  Increased volume of electronic trading on central limit order books has  contributed to reductions in transaction costs and lowered barriers to entry  for new liquidity providers. However, available liquidity can diminish in  highly volatile markets, as market makers manage risk and may have less  relationship incentive to maintain liquidity provision on anonymous platforms. Regulations  have enhanced financial stability by making banks and their broker-dealers more  resilient, but conference participants suggested that the manner in which firms  implement regulations may reduce their flexibility to respond to rapidly evolving  conditions.\n\nFinally, participants highlighted  that growth in Treasury issuance has been essential for the U.S. government to  support U.S. households and businesses during the pandemic, but, as Darrell  Duffie noted in a recent paper, ongoing increases in the stock of Treasuries  may result in greater peaks in the demand for intermediation. 18 These peaks may be amplified by the reliance of some investors on Treasuries to  provide liquidity in portfolios with natural liquidity mismatches, and by the  use of leverage in some Treasury investment strategies. 19\n\nI was pleased that conference participants  also offered some early ideas for enhancing the resiliency of the Treasury  market in this evolving environment. Of course, given the complexity associated  with changes to Treasury market infrastructure, I would highlight that these  ideas are preliminary and all would require further analysis.\n\nFirst, several conference  participants suggested that, while Treasury market data has improved markedly  in recent years, continuing to enhance transparency could bolster confidence in  the ability to transact fairly, particularly in volatile markets. 20 For repo markets, providing public data on the opaque uncleared bilateral segment  could improve visibility into the size of levered Treasury positions, and data  on term repo might give market participants more confidence in pricing. In the  Treasury cash market, continuing to refine and increase the availability of the  TRACE data would improve our understanding of the market, including the types  and prevalence of trading strategies and the methods of execution. 21\n\nSecond, conference participants  suggested ways to increase the capacity for and flexibility of liquidity  provision, so the market can manage peaks in liquidity demand. Expanding access  to trading venues and central clearing were both highlighted as potential ideas.  Increased central clearing can help market participants manage settlement risk and  facilitate more efficient balance sheet usage, and may also pave the way for  more direct trading among Treasury market participants. 22 , 23 Separately, several conference participants thought it might be helpful to explore  whether adjustments to certain regulations might enhance banks’ flexibility,  while still maintaining their resiliency.\n\nThird, and finally, participants highlighted  steps that could help stem the volume of sales during periods of high  volatility and stress. Several indicated that greater uniformity or enhanced  transparency in margin practices could reduce the need for funds employing certain  levered trading strategies to unwind positions amid higher volatility. In  addition, some thought further study may be warranted on the role of nonbank  financial institutions in this market. With regard to the Federal Reserve,  participants suggested that existing repo backstops could be fortified, as  these facilities provide confidence in the liquidity of Treasuries, thus reducing  the need for outright Treasury sales during stress events. 24\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, the pandemic created  exceptional uncertainty about the economic outlook and concern about financial  market functioning, resulting in an intense demand for cash. This desire to  raise cash rapidly, combined with extraordinary financial market volatility,  resulted in an unprecedented volume of Treasury sales and stresses in the  Treasury market. In response, the Federal Reserve stepped in to support the smooth  functioning of this vital market in order to maintain the flow of credit to  U.S. households and businesses.\n\nThis was truly an exceptional  event. However, while it is tempting to dismiss it as a once-in-a-lifetime shock,  it is important to take time to reflect and assess if lessons can be learned  that could make the Treasury market even more resilient to future shocks. The situations  that require policy intervention should be extraordinarily rare.\n\nIn this regard, I have been heartened  by the energy that academics, industry professionals, and public sector  officials have brought to understanding the underlying drivers of the stress in  March and April. The developing research and discussions are already producing  vital insights, and I encourage continued engagement on these issues. I also look  forward to working together with other agencies and industry professionals to explore  ways to enhance the resilience of the U.S. Treasury market, so that it  continues to be the deepest and most liquid fixed-income market in the world.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to the discussion.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nWelcome to  this year’s primary dealer meeting.  Primary  dealers play several important roles as trading counterparties in the  implementation of monetary policy, as participants in Treasury auctions, and as  providers of information on financial markets.   These annual meetings provide us an opportunity to strengthen this  relationship and communicate our expectations.  We also have a shared interest in ensuring  that markets function efficiently, effectively, and fairly.  To help achieve these goals, the official  sector employs a variety of channels, including legal, regulatory, and  supervisory.  Additionally, officials  work with market participants to help guide private-sector solutions.  Today, I will speak about our shared efforts  in the reform of reference interest rates, focusing the discussion on the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s (New York Fed) part as an administrator and  producer of reference rates.  The views  presented here are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the New  York Fed or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nResponding to LIBOR’s Uncertain Future\n\nReference  rates serve a number of purposes in financial markets.  They facilitate trading in standardized  contracts, which can lower transaction costs and improve market liquidity.  They can reduce information asymmetries by  providing a transparent, independent pricing source.  A robust and reliable reference rate can also  reduce moral hazard by limiting incentives to misreport pricing for settling a  contract.  However, a reference rate that  is not well designed may increase moral hazard by creating incentives to  manipulate the rate. 2\n\nNo reference  rate is more ubiquitous than the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  U.S. dollar LIBOR is estimated to be  referenced in $150 to $200 trillion of financial contracts, including loans,  interest rate swaps, and mortgage-backed securities. 3 Many market participants, including the  primary dealer community gathered here today, have exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR.  However, as Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  Chief Executive Andrew Bailey noted in a speech last July, the lack of activity  in the wholesale unsecured funding markets that underlie LIBOR means the  sustainability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed. 4 In fact, existing LIBOR panel banks have only  agreed with the FCA to support LIBOR through the end of 2021. 5 While U.S. dollar LIBOR may exist past 2021,  prudent risk management implies preparing for a world without it.\n\nFor several  years, the Federal Reserve—in conjunction with others in the official sector—has  supported private-sector efforts to identify viable alternatives to U.S. dollar  LIBOR, reduce reliance on LIBOR, and strengthen financial contracts to better  address the risk of a cessation of LIBOR.   Until relatively recently, this work has focused on the interest rate  derivatives market, which represents a very large proportion of total gross  notional exposure to LIBOR.  But, as  Governor Powell noted in a speech in November, the risks to LIBOR highlighted by  Andrew Bailey emphasize the need for all participants in the markets where  LIBOR currently is referenced to seriously consider how best to transition away  from its use. 6\n\nFurther, as  you are aware from previous meetings, in 2016 the Treasury Market Practices  Group (TMPG) incorporated recommendations in its Best Practices that market  participants should understand their vulnerabilities in using financial  benchmarks.  The TMPG recommends that  where current benchmarks are inconsistent with the Principles for Financial Benchmarks ( Principles ) published by the International Organization of  Securities Commissions (IOSCO), market participants should develop plans to use  alternative benchmarks that are consistent with the Principles . 7, 8 It is important that market participants  fully assess their exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR given both its weaknesses as a  benchmark and the risk that it may not always be published, and that they take  steps to mitigate their exposure by adopting more robust contract language and  transitioning to alternative rates.\n\nThis past June,  the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) selected an overnight Treasury  repo reference rate that the New York Fed plans to produce—the secured  overnight financing rate (SOFR)—as “best practice for use in certain new U.S.  dollar derivatives and other financial contracts”. 9, 10 The ARRC’s selection of this rate is part of the  motivation behind my comments on the New York Fed’s role as an administrator  and producer of reference rates.\n\nOver the  last two years, the New York Fed has enhanced the calculation of the effective  federal funds rate (EFFR) and launched an entirely new rate, the overnight bank  funding rate (OBFR).  We also announced  plans to begin producing three Treasury repo reference rates, including the SOFR  that was selected by the ARRC.  At the  core of these developments are investments the Federal Reserve has made in all  aspects of the administration and production of reference rates to ensure that our  rates are reliable measures of market activity.   These rates are anchored in active underlying markets, are based on a  comprehensive set of transactions that incorporate controls to mitigate risk of  errors and manipulation, and are capable of being published every day, even in  adverse circumstances.\n\nThe New York  Fed produces reference rates primarily to inform monetary policy implementation  by developing a better understanding of money market dynamics and to aid market  functioning by providing transparency.  For  example, collecting the transaction-level data necessary for producing robust  reference rates enhances the Federal Reserve’s ability to analyze market  developments.  While we have not historically  produced rates with the explicit goal of having them referenced in financial  contracts, we understand that they often are used that way. 11 And, we are committed to the continued  production of durable rates that market participants can have confidence in  over the long run.\n\nIn the  remainder of my remarks, I will first describe the improvements the New York  Fed has made to our production process and how those improvements ensure that  the rates we produce today are reliable.  I will then discuss how our three new rates  will help deepen our understanding of money market dynamics and provide  transparency for secured money markets.  Finally,  I will address how we plan to maintain the relevance and reliability of our  reference rates as markets evolve.\n\nEvolution of the Effective Federal Funds Rate\n\nAdministering  and producing reference rates is not a new activity for the New York Fed.  Daily calculation of the EFFR dates back at  least to the 1950s.  Today, changing the  target range for the federal funds rate is the Federal Open Market Committee’s  (FOMC) primary means of communicating adjustments in the stance of monetary policy,  and the EFFR serves as a measure to assess whether conditions in money markets  are consistent with the policy stance.   However, when the New York Fed first produced the EFFR, the federal  funds rate was not the FOMC’s policy target. 12 Like the OBFR today and our forthcoming repo  rates, the EFFR served as a useful indicator of conditions in an important  money market.\n\nFrom the  1950s until early 2016, the EFFR was calculated as a volume-weighted mean based  on data collected voluntarily from federal funds brokers.  While we continue to be confident in the  integrity of the EFFR production process employed during those years, the  international focus on best practices in the production of reference rates following  revelations about the manipulation of LIBOR hastened our efforts to review all  aspects of the EFFR production process.  This  review included an assessment of whether the EFFR could be strengthened by  switching to a more robust data source that better reflected activity in the  federal funds market, and whether a volume-weighted mean remained the most  appropriate measure of central tendency.\n\nAs a result,  in March 2016, we began calculating the EFFR using the Report of Selected Money  Market Rates (the FR 2420 report), which collects transaction-level data directly  from a large set of domestic banks and agencies of foreign banks operating in  the United States. 13, 14 The FR 2420 report offers a wider breadth of  market coverage, higher transaction volumes, and more granular information for  better data monitoring than the brokered data used previously.  At the same time, the measure of central  tendency employed was switched to a volume-weighted median, after analysis  indicated a median is less likely to be materially impacted by erroneous data  and outliers than a volume-weighted mean. 15, 16\n\nAdditional changes  were implemented to further strengthen the EFFR.  We invested in a sophisticated production  platform to ensure a well-controlled end-to-end production process, from collection  of the data to rate calculation and publication.  We refined our framework for regular review  by oversight bodies, and enhanced our ethics and conflict-of-interest policies  for staff involved in reference rate production.  We also put in place a resilient backup production  process—including geographic dispersion of staff and platforms involved in data  collection, administration, and publication—and developed a data contingency  plan that features a backup source of transaction data.\n\nReflecting  our commitment to producing rates aligned with international best practices, we  will publish a statement for all reference rates the New York Fed administers  and produces documenting their compliance with IOSCO’s Principles .  We anticipate  publishing such a statement for the EFFR and OBFR in the next few weeks, and we  will release similar documentation of compliance with IOSCO’s Principles for the three planned  Treasury repo rates likely around the time of their initial publication.\n\nDevelopment of a New Overnight Bank Funding  Rate\n\nAs we worked  to enhance production of the EFFR, we also developed the OBFR—the New York  Fed’s first reference rate designed from the outset to be compliant with IOSCO’s Principles .  The OBFR was created to increase the amount  and quality of publicly-available information about overnight unsecured funding  costs of U.S.-based banks.  The OBFR is  calculated using both federal funds and Eurodollar transactions, as reported in  the FR 2420 report. 17, 18 Many U.S.-based banks are active in the federal  funds and Eurodollar markets, so having a measure of borrowing costs across  both markets provides a more complete picture of overnight unsecured borrowing  costs than looking at the federal funds market alone.\n\nWhen we  launched the OBFR in the first quarter of 2016, daily Eurodollar volume was in  excess of $200 billion.  Today, however, volume  is nearly 50 percent lower.  The decline  largely reflects two factors: less investment by prime money market funds, and  a substitution from offshore to onshore wholesale deposits by some banks.  The former is a function of the more than $1  trillion decline in prime money market fund assets under management in 2016 associated  with the implementation of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) money  market fund reforms. 19 The latter reflects some U.S.-based banks  shifting from taking deposits in their Caribbean branches to taking similar  deposits onshore. 20 Eurodollar deposits currently are captured in  the FR 2420 report, and included in the OBFR.   However, onshore wholesale deposits are not captured.  The Federal Reserve is considering enhancing  the FR 2420 report to capture such “onshore Eurodollar” deposits, where the  motivation, counterparty, and pricing are similar to the Eurodollar deposits  included in the FR 2420 report.  If these  transactions are collected in the FR 2420 report, we will consider including  them in the OBFR as well.\n\nConsistent  with our ongoing analysis of the scope of transactions underlying the OBFR, creating  a durable reference rate that is reliable over the long run involves some need  for flexibility.  Financial markets are  not static; they evolve.  And, for a  reference rate to remain relevant over the long run, it must have the  flexibility to evolve with the market that underlies it.  Of course, changing the calculation of a rate  too frequently may create excessive volatility and uncertainty as to exactly  what the rate measures, potentially contributing to a loss of confidence in the  integrity of the rate.  For this reason,  we believe it is important to be clear in describing what each reference rate  we produce is meant to measure.  We do  not wish to make frequent changes to the rates we produce, but we are committed  to making necessary ones.\n\nExpanding Production to Treasury Repo Rates\n\nSecured  markets—the Treasury repo market in particular—also play a critical role in the  efficient functioning of financial markets and the implementation of monetary  policy. 21 However, historically there have been limited  data available to the public on the Treasury repo market. 22 In November 2016, the New York Fed announced  that, in cooperation with the Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Research  (OFR), we were considering publishing three reference rates based on overnight  Treasury repo transactions to improve repo market transparency.  Publication of these rates should improve  market functioning and our insight into monetary policy implementation.  Additionally, the ARRC had expressed interest  in a repo rate produced by the public sector as a possible alternative to U.S.  dollar LIBOR. 23\n\nWhy Produce Three Treasury Repo Rates?\n\nHaving  identified an opportunity to provide greater transparency into conditions in  the Treasury repo market and support reference rate reform, we decided to  produce not just one new repo rate, but three.   Why three?\n\nFirst and  foremost, we wanted to produce a rate reflective of a broad swath of activity  in the Treasury repo market.  At the same  time, we recognized that one broad rate might not consistently reflect differing  conditions in various segments of the market.   Dynamics in the overnight Treasury tri-party repo market—the segment of  the market characterized by cash-rich investors such as money market funds  lending to government securities dealers—may not always be the same as dynamics  in the blind-brokered, largely interdealer GCF Repo service offered by the  Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).  For example, greater opportunity for balance  sheet netting resulting from a single central counterparty in the GCF Repo  market, and the blind-brokered nature of trading in that market are two  differences between the tri-party and GCF Repo markets that impact the set of counterparties  active in each market and incentives for trading.  Both of these factors could manifest in a  divergence in rates. 24\n\nTrades in  the tri-party and GCF Repo markets are made against pools of “general”  collateral.  In a general collateral (GC)  repo trade, the cash provider stipulates a population of acceptable  collateral—for example, all Treasury securities—but does not stipulate the  specific securities that must be pledged to settle the transaction.  However, in the bilateral repo market, where  the services of a tri-party agent are not used, the counterparties themselves  identify specific securities to settle each trade.  As a result, the bilateral repo market can be  used to temporarily acquire specific securities, which can create different trading  incentives than simply investing cash against a pool of securities.  In particular, demand for specific securities—the  supply of which may be relatively scarce—can have a significant impact on rates  in the bilateral repo market.\n\nThe money  market funds eligible to participate in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse  repurchase facility (ON RRP) predominantly lend cash in the tri-party market. 25 As such, a rate focused only on the tri-party  repo market may be useful when evaluating money market fund participation in  the ON RRP.  On the other hand, a broad  measure of the cost of financing Treasury securities in the repo market—one not  just limited to GC trades—may be a better fit for other purposes.  For example, a broad measure may be a better  reflection of the average secured funding cost for a bank holding company that  participates across the tri-party, centrally-cleared interdealer, and bilateral  repo markets. 26\n\nOur choice  to produce three overnight Treasury repo rates recognizes this “fit for  purpose” issue.  Given existing market  segmentation and the potential for activity to shift across segments as the  repo market evolves, one rate likely is not a perfect fit for all needs.  However, producing a vast number of very similar  rates is not practical either.  From the  public feedback received, we believe that producing these three rates will strike  the right balance.\n\nWhat are the Three Rates the New York Fed  Will Produce?\n\nI will  provide an overview of each rate’s “Interest,” the term in IOSCO’s Principles for what a rate conceptually  is intended to measure.  Transactions in  which the Federal Reserve is a counterparty will be excluded from all three  rates, as the rates are meant to reflect private-market transactions, and the  Federal Reserve’s motivation for transacting in the repo market tends to be  different than for other participants. 27\n\nThe first  rate—the tri-party general collateral rate, or TGCR—is intended as a measure of  rates on overnight, tri-party Treasury GC repo transactions where the  counterparties involved know each other’s identity at the time of the trade.  The terms of all tri-party trades are bilaterally  negotiated between the security and cash providers before using the services of  a tri-party agent to clear and settle trades.   Based on recent data, the TGCR would include around $280 billion of  daily tri-party repo transactions.\n\nThe second  rate—the broad general collateral rate, or BGCR—is intended to capture all trades  where the specific securities provided as collateral are not identified until  after other terms of the trade are agreed.   The BGCR will include all trades in the TGCR plus other GC trades, such  as those that are blind brokered.  Given  the addition of approximately $15 billion in overnight Treasury GCF repo  transaction volume, if calculated today the BGCR would capture nearly $300  billion in daily transaction volume.\n\nThe third  rate—SOFR—is the broadest measure of the cost of borrowing overnight in the  repo market using Treasury securities as collateral.  The first two rates—the TGCR and BGCR—both focus  exclusively on the GC repo market, but, as I noted earlier, not all repo trades  are for “general” collateral.  Many  trades in the bilateral repo market are at rates similar to those on GC repo  trades in the tri-party repo market, with the cash providers’ motivation for  lending in the bilateral market very similar to the motivation of a cash  provider in the tri-party repo market.  However,  in some bilateral repo market trades the cash provider is seeking to acquire specific  Treasury securities, and the specific securities to be delivered are determined  at the outset of the trade, before a rate is agreed.  When such trades occur at rates below  prevailing rates on GC trades, the securities collateralizing the repo are said  to be trading “special.” The more demand for a specific security exceeds the  supply available to be lent, the greater the “specialness” premium for that security,  and the lower the rate on repo trades for that security.  A cash provider’s motivation for entering GC  and “specials” repo trades is different—investing cash in the case of a GC  trade and acquiring specific securities in a “specials” trade.  However, irrespective of the motivation of  the cash provider, both types of trades provide the cash borrower a means to  borrow funds with Treasury securities as collateral.\n\nSOFR is  intended to reflect the general cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized  by Treasury securities, regardless of the motivation of the cash providers  participating in the trades.  However, a  limited number of Treasury securities often trade with a significant “specialness”  premium—i.e., at rates considerably lower than those prevailing for GC trades  and most “specials” trades.  A  significant “specialness” premium implies that the supply-demand dynamics for a  particular Treasury security are very different than for the vast majority of  Treasury securities.  To mitigate the  potential influence of Treasury securities trading very “special,” we will  remove a portion of the lowest-rate transactions in the bilateral repo market  from the calculation of the SOFR.\n\nGiven the significant activity in the bilateral repo market cleared by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), transaction volume  underlying the SOFR would be in the neighborhood of $800 billion if calculated  today, more than double the volume underlying the BGCR.\n\nStarting in the  second quarter of this year, the New York Fed expects to begin producing and  publishing the three repo rates on a daily basis, alongside the EFFR and  OBFR.  We have explored how best to  calculate each of the three rates—also incorporating public comment received through  the Federal Register Notice process—and arrived at a calculation methodology  for each rate.  I will not discuss every  aspect of each rate, as that detailed information is already available, but there  are four key points that are important to highlight. 28\n\nFirst, all  three repo rates will be calculated as volume-weighted medians. 29 We selected the volume-weighted median as the  most appropriate measure of central tendency for these rates for the same  reasons we selected it for the EFFR and OBFR.   A median is more robust to submissions of erroneous data and is more  likely to reflect a transacted rate, as compared with a volume-weighted mean. 30\n\nSecond, we  have put in place various measures that should mitigate the risks associated  with data collection for all three rates.   While some have expressed concern that a portion of the data underlying  the rates is collected under a commercial agreement, the production of a  transaction-based rate necessitates the collection of transaction data, and there  are inherent risks in any data collection.   I would also note that in November, OFR announced plans to issue a  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking this year to collect the cleared repo data  underlying the BGCR and SOFR. 31 Simply put, if the markets underlying the  three repo rates are active, I do not anticipate that acquisition of necessary  data will be an impediment to the ongoing production of the rates.\n\nThird, I  want to provide further clarity around our method for identifying the set of  bilateral trades to be excluded or “trimmed” from the SOFR, and discuss why we  settled on this particular approach.\n\nOur use of a  volume-weighted median helps to ensure that “specials” will not have an undue  influence on the rate; however, we have taken additional precautions to ensure  that this is the case.  All transactions  in the FICC-cleared bilateral data set with rates below the 25th  volume-weighted percentile will be removed, and the remaining bilateral  transactions will then be combined with the tri-party and GCF Repo transactions  to calculate the SOFR.  In selecting this  trimming methodology, we sought a method that would remove transactions for  securities trading with an extreme “specialness” premium, consistent with the  concept of the SOFR I outlined earlier, while also being relatively easy to  communicate.  We explored a variety of  potential trimming methods and settled on the one we feel is the simplest that still  gets the job done.\n\nFinally, we  are working to determine what additional historical data we can provide for all  three repo rates, which is reflective of the requests for such data received  through the public comment process.  There  has been particular focus on data for the SOFR, as some have suggested that providing  a time series of the SOFR extending back prior to 2007 and the onset of the  financial crisis would ease adoption of the rate as an alternative to U.S.  dollar LIBOR.  We have previously released  indicative rates for the TGCR, BGCR, and SOFR from August 2014 forward based on  transaction-level data provided by the tri-party clearing banks and DTCC, and we  are looking into producing similar indicative rates for dates earlier than  2014. 32, 33 However, the calculation of these rates  utilizes some information that first became available after the financial  crisis as part of reforms to the tri-party repo market infrastructure.  While we may be able to provide additional  historical data beyond what we have already published, it is unlikely such data  will reach prior to the onset of the financial crisis for any of the three  rates.\n\nHowever, for  nearly two decades, the New York Fed has collected daily summary data from the  primary dealers on their borrowing across all segments of the overnight  Treasury general collateral repo market.   A rate based on these summary data may serve as a useful indicator of  the behavior of rates in the overnight Treasury repo market, and the New York  Fed is considering a one-time release of a time series of this primary dealer  survey rate.  While a rate based on the  primary dealer data would cover similar segments of the repo market as the  SOFR, the rate would not be a perfect substitute for the SOFR.  For example, the primary dealer survey rate  would be a volume-weighted mean, would only cover the GC segment of the repo  market, and would not cover activity by non-primary dealers.  Additionally, the rate could not be produced  in a process aligned with international best practices.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nTo conclude,  I hope that I have provided you with a brief history of the New York Fed’s role  as an administrator and producer of reference rates while highlighting various  aspects of the Treasury repo rates we plan to begin producing later this year,  including the role these rates play in mitigating risks from overreliance on  U.S. dollar LIBOR.  In the end, I hope  you walk away with two key messages.\n\nFirst, the  New York Fed is committed to producing durable reference rates.  That is, we are committed to producing rates  that are robust and resilient, both now and in the future.  These rates are compliant with IOSCO’s Principles , and best practice dictates  that administrators periodically review the rates they produce to assess  whether changes in the underlying markets require changes to those rates.  The New York Fed plans to perform such  reviews periodically for the repo rates, as well as for the EFFR and OBFR.  We do not anticipate frequent changes to how  we calculate the rates we produce, but if we believe changes are necessary, we  are committed to making them, and to doing so in a transparent fashion that  provides an opportunity for public input.   The integrity of the rates we produce is of the utmost importance,  whether they are used for analytical purposes or as reference rates in  financial contracts.\n\nSecond, recognizing  that the long-term availability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed, it is critical  that market participants with exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR assess their associated  risk and take steps to mitigate their exposure.   While individual firms must decide on the most appropriate way to manage  LIBOR-related risk, we encourage all to take two steps at a minimum: (1) adopt  contract language capable of addressing the cessation of a reference rate, and (2)  reduce reliance on U.S. dollar LIBOR by transitioning to robust alternative  rates, such as the SOFR.  In addition to  being in the best interest of individual financial institutions, greater  reliance on robust alternative reference rates aids the transmission of  monetary policy and reduces financial stability risks.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Restoring price stability requires careful calibration\nSeptember 07, 2023\nThank you for that kind introduction, Dom [Haskett].\nI  was just at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, where the Kansas City Fed  gathers central bankers and researchers at Grand Teton National Park to discuss  the latest global economic issues.\nVisiting  the Wyoming mountains reminded me of being in the Girl Scouts growing up. I  cherished evenings around the campfire with my friends. But you can stay  up only so late and eat only so many s’mores. Eventually, you have to  put the fire out.\nNow,  as every Scout knows, when you put out your campfire, you must make sure it is  “cold out”—so completely extinguished that you feel no heat when you touch the  ashes with your bare hands. Any warm embers could reignite later.\nThe  traditional way to make sure a fire is cold out is to pour water on it— lots of water —until you have  eliminated every last bit of heat.\nThat  is a good way to put out campfires, but I will argue today that it is not a good way to put out inflation.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is strongly committed to our 2 percent  inflation target. After the unacceptably rapid price increases of the past  several years, I’m not yet convinced that we’ve extinguished excess inflation.  But in today’s complex economic environment, returning inflation to 2 percent  will require a carefully calibrated approach—not endless buckets of cold water.\nBefore  I go any further, I’ll just note that the views I express are mine and not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the FOMC.\nThe  inflation outlook\nLet  me start with why we need to put out  inflation. Congress has charged the FOMC with setting monetary policy to pursue  maximum employment and stable prices.\nWhile  the labor market is very strong, inflation over the past several years has been  much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the  price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. But prices rose 6  percent in 2021 and 5.3 percent in 2022 and continued to rise, at a 3.2 percent  annual rate, in the first seven months of this year.\nPeople  count on the Federal Reserve to keep our commitment to price stability. When  inflation is high, people’s incomes fall short of the rising cost of living.  Businesses can’t plan well because they don’t know what they’ll pay for  materials or be able to charge their customers. And, over time, high inflation  tends to make the business cycle more volatile, undermining the long and stable  expansions that particularly benefit the most vulnerable in society.\nTo  help bring the economy into better balance, the FOMC has raised the target  range for the federal funds rate by 5.25 percentage points since early 2022.  We’re also reducing our asset holdings. The significantly lower inflation in  recent months is encouraging. But lower inflation isn’t necessarily low-enough  inflation. We have to ask whether monetary policy is now sufficiently  restrictive to return inflation all the way to 2 percent in a sustainable and  timely way or whether the FOMC still needs to do more.\nForecasts  are inherently uncertain. My base case, though, is that there is work left to  do.\nThe  monthly inflation rate has been around 2.5 percent for the past couple of months.  But monthly inflation data can be volatile, and extreme changes in prices for  one good or another can also push the numbers around. To get a clearer signal  of where overall inflation is headed, it’s helpful to filter out some of the  more volatile prices. For example, we can take out the  prices of food and energy and look at the core inflation rate. Over the past  three months, it was 2.9 percent. And the Dallas Fed trimmed mean inflation  rate was 2.8 percent over that period. These numbers indicate it is too soon to  confidently say inflation will trend to 2 percent in a timely way.\nLabor  market conditions also suggest we haven’t finished the job of restoring price  stability. To sustain low inflation, supply and demand need to be in balance.  Last year, labor demand greatly outpaced supply. Payroll growth and job  openings soared. The unemployment rate fell to a half-century low. Today, some  indicators, like job openings and the percentage of workers quitting their jobs  each month, show substantial progress toward better balance. Yet, overall, the  labor market remains very strong. For example, the U.S. economy is adding an  average of about 150,000 jobs per month. That’s more than enough to keep pace  with trend growth in the labor force.\nWage  data show that many employers still have to compete hard to attract and retain  workers. Wages nationally have been growing at an annual rate of more than 4  percent by a variety of measures, compared with 3 percent in 2019. Respondents  to the Dallas Fed’s business surveys tell us significant wage pressures remain,  though they’re less severe than a year ago. To sustain 2 percent inflation over  time, wage growth will need to fall, or trend productivity growth will need to  rise.\nMoreover,  the early data for the current quarter suggest economic activity is picking  up—contrary to expectations all year that the economy would slow down. Retail  sales and real consumption both came in high in July. Residential construction  seems to be rebounding from the effects of higher interest rates.\nThe  initial data on a quarter can be noisy. The picture could change. But if  stronger economic activity continues, it could lead to a resurgence of  inflation.\nMonetary  policy strategy\nSo, if the job doesn't appear to be done, why do we need to proceed carefully? The economic outlook isn’t certain. Tighter financial  conditions might slow the economy without much further action by the FOMC. And  there are risks to doing both too little and too much.\nThe  strong July data might be a blip. If the economy cools, inflation would be more  likely to fall. The economy’s strength might not even be a bad sign for  inflation if that strength reflects improvements in labor supply or increases  in productivity.\nFinancial  conditions also tightened noticeably in the weeks after the July FOMC meeting.  The 10-year Treasury yield rose by nearly 50 basis points before retracing  partway. And the average 30-year mortgage rate at one point was up 42 basis  points, reaching the highest level since 2001.\nPart  of these moves came in response to strong economic data. Market participants  understand that the FOMC may need to offset economic strength with higher  interest rates. If, as in my base case, stronger growth poses risks to  inflation, the FOMC will need to follow through on that expectation.\nBut  news unrelated to monetary policy also pushed market rates up. That means  households and businesses face more-restrictive financial conditions for the  same setting of the federal funds rate. To the extent that tighter conditions  from this source persist, they should slow the economy and, potentially,  require less additional tightening of monetary policy.\nIn  this environment, the stance of policy needs to be calibrated carefully. Tightening  too little would allow above-target inflation to persist. If high inflation  becomes entrenched, restoring price stability could require much larger and  more costly rate increases. However, excessively restrictive policy would also hurt  households and businesses and might even lead inflation to undershoot our 2  percent target.\nA  year ago, we were raising interest rates very rapidly—by 75 basis points at  each of four consecutive FOMC meetings—to catch up after inflation had surged  far too high. But the FOMC cannot safely throw bucket after bucket of cold  water on the economy  just in case inflation catches fire again. If we  did that, not only inflation but economic activity itself would soon be “cold  out”—which is not an outcome we want.\nSo,  at this stage, I believe we must proceed gradually, weighing the risk that  inflation will be too high against the risk of dampening the economy too much.  You might say we need to drizzle water on the firepit and watch closely for  signs that the coals are heating up again.\nLast  fall and winter, we slowed the pace of rate increases to 50 and then 25 basis  points per meeting. The slower pace allowed us to carefully assess the data and  reduce the risk of an abrupt and nonlinear deterioration in the economy.\nWe  further slowed the pace by skipping a rate increase at our June meeting before  increasing again in July. And another skip could be appropriate when we meet  later this month.\nBut skipping does not imply stopping. In coming months, further evaluation  of the data and outlook could confirm that we need to do more to extinguish  inflation. The FOMC will need to keep the water bucket close at hand, and we  must not hesitate to use it as necessary. But we must also gather the necessary  information to use our tools well. This carefully calibrated approach can help  us to sustainably achieve our goal of maximum employment and price stability.\nThank  you.\nLorie K. Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Preventing and responding to dysfunction in core markets\nMarch 03, 2023\nThank you for the introduction, Anil [Kashyap] , and thank you for organizing  this workshop and bringing focus to this important topic. I’m looking forward  to sharing perspectives with Andrew [Hauser] , drawing on our unique  experiences in recent years as well as work that we led together for the  Markets Committee at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). [1]\nI’m pleased that so many experts have  joined us today to discuss central bank responses to financial market  dysfunction. The repeated severe stresses in core markets around the world in  recent years emphasize the need for two types of change. The public and private  sectors must work together to enhance market resilience so that these episodes  will be far less frequent going forward. And, to be prepared for those rare  occasions when extreme stresses in core markets threaten financial stability or  the macroeconomy, central banks must continue to develop the toolkit for  mitigating dysfunction. Finding the best approaches will require a wide range  of perspectives, and I’m looking forward to today’s conversations. Before I  proceed, let me note that these views are mine and not necessarily those of my  Federal Reserve colleagues.\nCore bond markets, such as those for  government debt, are crucial to the economy—not only because national  governments obtain financing in these markets, but also because these markets  are used for implementing monetary policy, provide a safe source of collateral and  establish a benchmark yield curve that underpins financing for households,  businesses, and state and local governments. [2]\nBreakdowns of trading and price discovery  in core markets thus put a vast array of economic activity at risk. But I would emphasize that the type of dysfunction I have in  mind is more extreme than merely low liquidity. I am referring, rather, to  fundamental failures in the process of intermediating between buyers and  sellers, or lenders and borrowers, and identifying a market-clearing price for  their transactions.\nThe U.S. financial system has become  increasingly vulnerable to core market dysfunction because the supply of  intermediation has not kept pace with demand as the Treasury market’s size and  complexity have grown. [3] Treasury debt held by the public rose  from 35 percent of GDP at the end of 2007 to about 95 percent of GDP in late  2022. And a growing share of the debt is held by investors  such as hedge funds and mutual funds that trade more frequently or rely on the  ability to quickly monetize assets when needed. Meanwhile, primary dealers,  which are major intermediaries in these markets, have not increased the balance  sheet devoted to Treasury holdings and Treasury repurchase agreements (repos)  since 2007—even in nominal terms. The rise of electronic trading has also  shifted intermediation toward principal trading firms, which typically hold  less capital with which to absorb shocks, and increased the pace at which  market developments unfold.\nThese themes are similar globally, and  core markets around the world have repeatedly experienced dysfunction that  posed risks to the broader economy. [4] The source of each stress episode has  been unique, and each central bank intervention has been crafted to address the  specific problems of the day. Yet, despite the varied initial shocks, central  banks have faced a common problem: how to support market functioning without  undermining the features that make these markets so important in the first  place.\nThat central problem is the first of three  topics I’ll address today. I’ll then offer three guideposts that I believe  should shape central bank interventions given this problem: transparency,  backstop pricing and distinguishing support for market functioning from  monetary accommodation. And finally, I’ll assess our March 2020 operations in  light of these guideposts and draw out some implications for market regulation  and infrastructure and for the central bank toolkit.\nThe central problem\nCentral banks should rarely intervene to  support the functioning of core markets, but when such interventions are  needed, they must be effective. At one level, intervening effectively should be  straightforward. Central banks have powerful tools and, in principle, need only  deploy them in sufficient size. But at another level, it is not at all  straightforward to intervene in a way that ensures core markets continue to  serve their crucial roles in the financial system.\nAs the Inter-Agency  Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) indicated in its 2021  principles for the Treasury market, good market functioning is multifaceted. [5] In a well-functioning market, participants  can efficiently buy, sell and borrow against assets. These transactions take  place at prices that reflect economic and financial fundamentals. And there are  minimal price distortions due to technical factors, externalities or frictions  between closely related markets.\nIf, say, a rush of sales in the government  bond market overwhelms intermediaries’ capacity to absorb the sales and find  buyers, it is straightforward in principle for the central bank to step in and  purchase some of the assets. But such an intervention may create risks and  spillovers that would undermine other aspects of market functioning. Excessive  purchases might crowd out private buyers. Poorly calibrated purchases could  also push prices—of the specific securities purchased  or of other securities—to a different level than would prevail in a  well-functioning market. By removing duration from the  market, the central bank’s purchases could reduce term premia and create a  degree of monetary accommodation that policymakers might view as inappropriate  given the macroeconomic fundamentals. And the mere potential for central  bank intervention may create distortions, especially if market participants  become overconfident and do not appropriately manage their own risks.\nIn  the end, an intervention that substitutes one form of dysfunction for another  may not represent an improvement. The problem is simply that avoiding this is  easier said than done, because an intervention that improves the market’s  functioning in one respect may change incentives in ways that impede the  market’s functioning in other respects. Yet, in severe circumstances, refusing  entirely to intervene would put the central bank’s fundamental macroeconomic  and financial stability objectives at risk.\nGuideposts\nCentral banking is an imperfect art, often  practiced under great time pressure and with incomplete information. So it is  useful to have some guideposts to aim for in designing interventions in those  rare instances when they are needed—though I do not view these guideposts as  rigid rules that can or must be achieved in every instance.\nThe  accumulated knowledge of central bankers and scholars provides a wealth of such  guideposts. From my own experience, three stand out as particularly important  for mitigating the side effects of market functioning interventions:\nTransparency is fundamental across many  central bank activities. We must be transparent about how we carry out our  responsibilities so that we remain accountable to the public we serve.\nAnd transparency has special importance  for promoting smooth market functioning. By clearly explaining how it is  designing and carrying out its operations, a central bank can help ensure that  all market participants have an equal opportunity to trade and have equal  information about how the operations will influence the market. This is a  matter of basic fairness. It promotes diversity in the market ecosystem. And by  reducing uncertainty about the central bank’s activities, transparency helps  ensure that prices reflect economic and financial fundamentals.\nThe second guidepost, backstop pricing, is  one that we also emphasized in the report Andrew and I led for the Markets Committee.  If a central bank’s operations are out of the money relative to normal market  prices, then, when the market is functioning normally, no one will transact  with the central bank. And when the market is not functioning normally,  transactions with the central bank will generally push prices back toward the  normal level. Thus, the risks of distorting prices or crowding out private  activity are mitigated. Operations at a backstop price will naturally wind down  when market functioning recovers. And pricing an operation as a backstop helps to  make it transparent and distinguish it from monetary accommodation.\nThe third guidepost, distinguishing  support for market functioning from monetary accommodation, recognizes that  central banks have multiple goals. A central bank’s tools for supporting market  functioning involve lending against assets or buying them. These are the same  operations that are used to provide monetary accommodation. But, while smooth  market functioning is critical to good macroeconomic outcomes, the scale of  lending or asset purchases that is appropriate to support market functioning  may not be the same as the scale appropriate to support aggregate demand.\nThe need to distinguish support for market  functioning from monetary accommodation is most obvious when monetary  policymakers are trying to tighten financial conditions to reduce inflation. However,  even when policymakers are trying to ease financial conditions to boost  economic growth, they may benefit from the ability to adjust the amount of  monetary accommodation separately from actions to support market functioning.\nImplications\nThree years ago this month, the Federal  Reserve took forceful steps to respond to disruptions in core markets at the  onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other actions, we offered up to $1  trillion per day in overnight repos with primary dealers, plus additional term  repos. And we purchased Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at  an unprecedented speed and scale.\nThe scope and purpose of our operations  evolved. In March 2020, with purchases peaking at more than $100 billion per  day, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said the program’s goal was to  support smooth market functioning and the transmission of monetary policy. By  June, as market functioning improved, we reduced the pace of purchases to $80  billion per month in Treasuries and $40 billion per month in MBS. The FOMC also  changed its statement in June 2020 to say the purchases were meant to “sustain”  rather than “support” smooth market functioning, and in September 2020, the  FOMC added a second goal: to foster accommodative financial conditions.\nHaving led the Fed’s trading desk during  this period, I may not have an unbiased perspective, but I don’t think there is  any doubt that our actions succeeded in restoring smooth functioning of core  markets. Still, it is appropriate to reflect on what the experience teaches us  about how to better support market functioning in the future. The guideposts I  just described provide a helpful framework for this reflection.\nRepos measure up nicely, in part because  their duration is short and in part because they can be priced as a backstop to  the monetary policy target. The offering of practically unlimited repos was  also straightforward to communicate transparently. These characteristics  minimize the potential negative side effects of repos. In fact, the side  effects of repos can be so well mitigated that the FOMC decided in 2021 to make  backstop repos a standing part of our operations through the Standing Repo  Facility (SRF) and the Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) Repo  Facility. [6]\nHowever, repos do not solve all problems. Smooth  market functioning requires both funding liquidity, or the ability to borrow  against an asset, and market liquidity, or the ability to easily buy and sell  the asset. Repos directly support only funding liquidity. Moreover, repos  directly provide funding only to the central bank’s counterparties. A central  bank’s ability to support funding liquidity for the broader market depends on  its counterparties’ willingness and ability to serve as intermediaries, which  may be particularly limited during stress episodes.\nThus, as we saw in March 2020, purchase  operations can be necessary both to directly support market liquidity and to  influence market conditions for participants beyond the central bank’s  counterparties. But purchases can pose challenges relative to all three  guideposts.\nMonetary policy does not provide a  benchmark for backstop prices on longer-term securities, unless a central bank  is engaged in yield curve control. In addition, the deterioration of market  functioning in March 2020 reduced the reliability of market indicators that  could have helped derive a backstop price.\nIn consequence, we offered to buy fixed  quantities of securities, evaluating the offers received in a multiple-price  auction against both market prices and measures of relative value. While this  approach was extremely effective in addressing dysfunction, it was not easy to  provide a transparent link between the operation sizes and the degree of  dysfunction.\nMoreover, while our market functioning  purchases aimed to affect the flow of transactions, we could not avoid also  changing the amount of duration risk held by the private sector and thus having  some effect on term premia through a portfolio balance channel. The resulting  monetary accommodation was appropriate following the large negative shock from  the pandemic. But it did blur the signals about how we calibrated the size of  our purchases.\nTo me, this experience has three  implications.\nFirst, because both actual interventions  and the potential to intervene can have side effects, central banks and other  authorities should strive to reduce the need for intervention.\nI’m pleased by the  relevant authorities’ ongoing focus on enhancing Treasury market resilience. Importantly,  the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed to expand the scope of  central clearing of Treasury transactions. [7] Research  by the Dallas Fed’s staff highlights that expanded central clearing would have  four key benefits: uniform risk management standards, reduced balance sheet  intensity of repo intermediation, reduced settlement risks and improvements in  transparency. [8] In addition, the Financial Industry  Regulatory Authority last month began releasing daily statistics on Treasury trading volume and average  prices, while the Office of Financial Research has proposed to close gaps in  the collection of data on bilateral repos—both steps  that will enhance transparency in the market—and the Federal Reserve Board’s  holistic review of bank capital standards is evaluating, among other factors,  the effects of leverage ratio requirements on Treasury market liquidity. [9] , [10]\nI am optimistic that with continued  reforms, we can make core markets resilient enough that interventions to  support market functioning will be extraordinarily rare.\nSecond, because repos typically have far  fewer drawbacks than outright purchases, central banks should work to enhance  the efficacy of repo tools. While repos directly provide only funding  liquidity, improvements in funding liquidity can enhance market liquidity as  long as the funding liquidity reaches the right market participants, whether as  direct counterparties of the central bank or through onward lending from direct  counterparties.\nFor example, in March 2020, some foreign  official holders sold Treasury securities for precautionary reasons to ensure  they would have cash if needed. Only at the end of that month did the Fed  establish a temporary FIMA Repo Facility—since made into a standing facility—to  provide funding to foreign and international monetary authorities. [11] Had the facility been available sooner,  it could have reduced precautionary sales and thereby improved the balance  between the supply of and the demand for market liquidity. Transparency about  the availability of the FIMA Repo Facility makes our repo operations more  effective and should reduce the likelihood of needing to employ purchases to  support market functioning in the future. The SRF does the same for domestic  counterparties.\nCentral banks can also enhance the reach  of repo operations by reducing existing counterparties’ cost of intermediating  to the broader market. For example, the FOMC could further consider the  potential benefits of centrally clearing SRF operations, as several committee participants  suggested in a 2021 meeting. [12] Central clearing would reduce our  counterparties’ balance sheet costs by allowing them to net funding received  from the facility against onward lending to other market participants.\nFinally, when purchase operations are  appropriate to support market functioning, it would be desirable to have  options for clearly distinguishing these operations from monetary  accommodation.\nOne approach, following the recent example  of the Bank of England, could be for a central bank to separately track assets  purchased to support market functioning and sell these  holdings in a timely way once market functioning has normalized—independent  of the direction of monetary policy at that time. The expectation of timely  sales would limit the asset purchases’ effect on term premia.\nBut this approach could be complicated if  the central bank were simultaneously buying assets to provide accommodation. And  even if assets purchased to support market functioning are held in a separate  portfolio, there remains the difficult question of what price to offer for  them—both to ensure purchases take place at a backstop price and to distinguish  market functioning interventions from operations to provide monetary  accommodation.\nTo see why this question is difficult,  it’s helpful to start with some cases where it is less difficult. MBS are  typically priced at a spread to comparable-duration Treasuries, for example,  using option-adjusted models. Option-adjusted spreads vary within a relatively  limited range when the market is functioning smoothly. It would therefore be  possible in theory—though even this would be operationally complex, so I mean  this only as a thought experiment and not as a policy proposal—to support the  functioning of the MBS market by offering to purchase MBS at a much higher  spread to Treasuries than the range that normally prevails. Such a backstop  price for MBS would avoid crowding out normal private transactions in MBS and  allow monetary policy and private market trading to continue to influence the  Treasury yield curve. Similarly, if severe market dysfunction caused large  deviations between the prices of economically similar instruments, such as two  Treasury securities of similar durations, it would be possible in theory to  establish a backstop price for one of those securities by reference to the  market price of the other.\nBut this process cannot go on forever. Eventually,  we will run out of other securities to refer to. There will be one last  security, or one last core group of securities, for which we have no other  reference price. As the philosophers say, it can’t be turtles all the way down.\nThere is, as I alluded to earlier, one  case where the central bank has a price to use as a reference even for those  very last securities. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of Japan have  at times implemented monetary policy through yield curve control. In that case,  the yield caps established by monetary policy provide a natural reference point  for backstop market functioning purchases. But this example simply shows why  choosing the reference price is so consequential. At least in some  circumstances, it may require determining where the yield curve belongs, which  is the opposite of distinguishing market functioning from monetary  accommodation and of letting the private market discover the price based on  fundamentals.\nSo, in the spirit of a research workshop,  let me conclude with some questions for further investigation. How should  central banks establish prices when they buy securities to support market  functioning? What methods can be employed to establish a backstop price for  some core securities by referring to market prices of other securities? How  effective would this be? And are there ways to establish backstop prices across  the entire yield curve while still distinguishing that operation from monetary  accommodation? Turning to broader topics, what further innovations can make  central banks’ lending tools more effective? And what additional reforms,  besides the ambitious road map that the U.S. authorities have laid out, can  further enhance market resilience?\nThank you.\nNotes\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for  assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Opening remarks for panel on ‘Future challenges for monetary policy in the Americas’\nFebruary 06, 2025\nThank you, Frank [Smets], for the kind introduction. And thank you to the BIS for inviting me to participate on this distinguished panel. International dialogues like today’s generate so many valuable insights about how central banks can navigate the current environment.\nThe theme of this panel is “future challenges for monetary policy in the Americas.” Where to begin? One challenge is simply to note all of the important challenges when I’ve been asked to keep my opening remarks to five minutes!\nI would like to highlight three topics in particular: the reconfiguration of global trade patterns and supply chains; the shift to a higher-interest-rate environment; and the need to keep inflation expectations well anchored after the surge in inflation following the pandemic. Let me note that these views are mine and not necessarily those of my Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) colleagues.\nIn recent years, companies worldwide began to reorganize their supply chains in response to disruptions experienced during the pandemic as well as geopolitical developments. Government policy changes in this space are ongoing, and the resulting changes in trade patterns could leave a substantial imprint on economic activity. For example, a Dallas Fed economist and a colleague at the Banco de México found in their research that tariffs on China drove growth at Mexican firms integrated into global supply networks. Central bankers will need to parse what these shifts mean for the inflation and employment outlooks and for capital flows. At the Dallas Fed, we recently launched our Global Institute to study these and other questions, and we look forward to generating insights that can advance the missions of the Federal Reserve and other central banks.\nTurning to my second point, following the Global Financial Crisis, many experts thought a core challenge of modern central banking was downside risk to inflation resulting from the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound. While a return to the lower bound remains one scenario to prepare for, the past few years show we must be equally well prepared to achieve our goals when rates are well above zero and inflation risks are to the upside.\nRelated, and this brings me to my third point, central banks will need to ensure inflation expectations remain well anchored following the recent global inflation surge. High inflation has been costly for households and businesses. It would be surprising if this episode didn’t cause people to reevaluate how they expect inflation to behave going forward. In the U.S., while market- and survey-based estimates of long-term inflation expectations have remained largely stable, survey measures of inflation uncertainty rose sharply at the start of the pandemic and remain elevated. I take this as a reminder that expectations won’t stay anchored forever on their own. In the end, monetary policymakers have to achieve what the public expects.\nAnd—as we all know—well-anchored inflation expectations are critical to success in monetary policy. History teaches that when inflation expectations become unanchored, central banks often can restore price stability only at a great economic cost.\nThis lesson figures centrally in my thinking about monetary policy for the U.S. in the near term. I think the possible policy strategies for the FOMC in 2025 boil down to two key alternatives. In some scenarios, it will soon be appropriate to resume reducing the federal funds target range. In other scenarios, we’ll need to hold rates at least at the current level for quite some time.\nInflation made progress toward the FOMC’s 2 percent target in 2024, while the labor market remained strong and stable. If these trends continue, the U.S. economy will have achieved a soft landing.\nYet we have been here before on inflation. It cooled substantially in late 2023, then resurged in early 2024. And January 2023 was unusually strong as well. My team’s analysis and conversations with business contacts suggest these bumps may result from an interaction between annual pricing decisions and the business cycle. Many businesses set prices once a year in January, and they have more pricing power when the economy is strong, as it has been in recent years.\nWe don’t yet know whether 2025 has brought another such bump. But if inflation rises, it will be a signal that monetary policy has more work to do both to restore price stability and to keep demand in balance with supply so we can sustain price stability.\nWhat if inflation comes in close to 2 percent in coming months? While that would be good news, it wouldn’t necessarily allow the FOMC to cut rates soon, in my view.\nSuppose, for example, that as the first quarter unfolds, monthly inflation figures come in at a 2 percent annualized rate, labor market indicators hold right where they were all fall, and consumer spending and business investment also stay strong.\nI’d find it hard to say monetary policy was meaningfully restrictive in that scenario. One aspect of the global higher-rate environment is that the neutral interest rate appears to have moved up—though it’s uncertain exactly how much. On-target inflation alongside two quarters of stability in the labor market and demand would strongly suggest that we’re already pretty close to the neutral rate, without much near-term room for further cuts. On the other hand, if the labor market or demand cools further, that could be evidence it’s time to ease.\nThere are many uncertainties right now beyond the near-term inflation and employment data. I mentioned trade policy, and as we’ll probably come back to later in the panel, financial conditions have been volatile. But to me, the monetary policy implications of these uncertainties generally come down to whether sustainably restoring price stability requires keeping rates at least at the current level or moving lower. And in choosing a path, we should be guided by the need to maintain well-anchored inflation expectations, which are fundamental in the long run to achieving both sides of the FOMC’s dual mandate for monetary policy.\nThank you.\nAdditional comments on financial conditions and the neutral interest rate (delivered in panel discussion)\nI’d like to discuss the role of the neutral interest rate in determining monetary policy and the key factors influencing that rate in the U.S. and globally right now.\nEven though I brought up the neutral rate in my opening remarks, that’s often not my starting point in thinking about monetary policy, because my background is in financial markets, and I think the nuances of markets matter. Households and businesses don’t usually borrow, save or invest at an overnight risk-free rate like the fed funds rate. Instead, most borrowing, saving and investing takes place at longer tenors, and often in forms that incorporate various risk premia. So when I think about whether monetary policy is in the right place to accomplish our macroeconomic goals, I tend to think about whether broad financial conditions are appropriately restrictive or accommodative, or whether broad financial conditions need to move.\nYet the central bank doesn’t control overall financial conditions. We control an overnight policy rate, and that overnight rate’s relationship to broader financial conditions can vary over time. It’s like driving a car with some occasional slippage in the transmission. So I don’t usually try to judge whether the policy rate itself is restrictive or accommodative, but instead I think through how moving the policy rate will affect broader financial conditions.\nAll that said, it’s helpful to have some benchmarks for the policy rate over time. Estimates of the neutral rate, or r-star—the policy rate that would be neither restrictive nor accommodative—are one such benchmark. Let me emphasize the word “estimates.” The neutral rate can’t be directly measured, but instead has to be estimated by consulting models and observing the evolution of the economy.\nEstimates like these depend on many assumptions. It’s also necessary to specify a time horizon. The neutral rate in the long run can differ from its value today.\nAs a result, estimates of r-star for the U.S. vary widely. Looking across a suite of publicly available models, estimates of the neutral real interest rate for the U.S. range from three-quarters of a percent to two and a half percent. And in the December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), FOMC participants’ estimates of the long-run real fed funds rate ranged from 0.4 to 1.9 percent.\nBut one thing these estimates generally have in common is that most of them have moved up substantially since before the pandemic. For example, five years ago in the December 2019 SEP, estimates of the long-run real fed funds rate ranged from 0 to 1.3 percent.\nAs I think about the economy, that shift makes sense.\nConceptually, the neutral rate depends on the balance between the supply of investment and the demand for investment. Factors that move investment supply or demand also move the neutral rate. I would categorize those factors into four main buckets:\nDemographics change slowly and have weighed on neutral rates for many years. But the other factors can move more quickly. And postpandemic, many of them point in the direction of higher investment, lower savings and thus higher neutral rates—just as the models and estimates suggest.\nBecause global capital markets are relatively open, I tend to think these factors operate globally and affect neutral rates across economies. Indeed, model estimates of r-star have tended to move in parallel across developed markets for the past half-century. But country-specific developments can also matter. For example, large capital flows into one country from the rest of the world would shift out the supply of investment in the recipient country and have the opposite effect on the neutral rate in that country as elsewhere.\nThis brings me back to where I started, with the importance of broad financial conditions. While some of the drivers of the neutral rate are purely economic, others such as risk premia and capital flows relate to financial markets. Adjusting neutral rate estimates to account for these financial factors is an inexact science. And so while measures of r-star are a helpful benchmark, it will always be important to take broad financial conditions into account in determining how to set the policy rate to achieve a central bank’s goals.\nNotes\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and other Dallas Fed colleagues for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Discussion of ‘Quantitative Tightening Around the Globe: What Have We Learned?’ by Wenxin Du, Kristin Forbes and Matthew Luzzetti\nMarch 01, 2024\nI’m grateful to Anil Kashyap for inviting me to participate  in this U.S. Monetary Policy Forum and to discuss this year’s paper by a  distinguished set of authors on a very timely topic. The paper assesses the  recent experience with quantitative tightening (QT) across seven advanced  economies. After cataloging central banks’ QT strategies, the paper assesses  the effects of QT on asset markets and money markets across several dimensions—including  prices, liquidity and portfolio holdings of different types of market  participants. There’s a wealth of valuable information here. I highly recommend  reading the entire paper.\nI’ll focus on a few aspects that I see as particularly  relevant to policy decisions facing the Federal Reserve in coming months and  years. As always, these remarks represent my own views and not necessarily  those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nA central theme of the paper is that the effects of  quantitative easing (QE) and QT appear asymmetric. For example, while QT  announcements tend to increase government bond yields, the effect as measured  in this paper is significantly smaller in magnitude than the typical decrease  in yields associated with QE announcements. And while large-scale asset  purchases have at times contributed to dramatic improvements in market  functioning during stress episodes, QT episodes do not appear to have  significantly reduced the liquidity of government bonds.\nThe paper mainly emphasizes an asymmetry in magnitude: by and large, the effects of QE as measured in the simple framework of this  paper are notably larger than those of QT. This finding aligns with my own  perspective on what we’ve seen in markets. Today, I’ll lay out the framework  that I use to think about the effects of QE and QT. I’ll then draw on that  framework to consider why the magnitudes of QE and QT effects as measured here  are so different and how what we measure relates to the underlying mechanisms.  Finally, I’ll turn to a second asymmetry, between effects on asset markets and  funding markets, that’s important for understanding the path forward on QT in  the United States.\nFramework\nResearch and practical experience suggest that changes in  central bank asset holdings influence financial conditions through a variety of  mechanisms. For purposes of today’s discussion, I’ll categorize those  mechanisms into three broad channels: portfolio balance, signaling and  liquidity. [1] For each channel, we can distinguish announcement effects, which  happen when the central bank communicates a plan to change its asset holdings,  from implementation effects, which happen when the asset holdings actually  change.\nWhen the central bank holds more of a given asset, private sector  portfolios hold less of that asset, all else equal. To the extent that assets  are not perfect substitutes, for example because they embody different risks or  serve different purposes in investors’ portfolios, asset prices must move to  induce private sector investors to change their holdings. The most prominent  example of this portfolio balance channel is the duration risk effect. If the  central bank holds more duration risk by acquiring long-term securities, term  premiums are likely to fall, all else equal. Conversely, if the central bank  reduces its holdings of duration risk, term premiums are likely to rise.  Because financial markets are forward looking, the portfolio-balance channel  operates mostly through announcement effects, as formal statements or informal  communications shift market expectations about upcoming changes in the central  bank’s assets. However, the portfolio-balance channel can also have  implementation effects, as prices may adjust when the central bank actually  changes its holdings to induce market participants to change their holdings at  that time.\nSecond is the signaling channel, which fundamentally operates  through announcement effects. For instance, when the policy rate is at the  effective lower bound (ELB), a central bank’s plans to buy assets can send a  signal that policymakers intend to keep the policy rate at the lower bound for  some time. This signal can reinforce other forward guidance and move market  expectations of the policy rate path.\nFinally, the liquidity channel refers to the effect of the  central bank’s transactions on trading conditions in the asset market and the  resulting liquidity risk premia. The liquidity channel can narrowly affect the  specific securities the central bank acquires or sells, or it can affect a  broader set of securities if these transactions change general pressures on  intermediaries. Although the liquidity channel often operates through  implementation effects, a central bank’s purchase plans can also reassure market  participants and support market liquidity upon announcement, as we observed,  for example, with the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility. [2]\nAsymmetry in magnitudes\nDistinguishing these channels is helpful in making sense of  the asymmetric magnitudes of measured QE and QT effects.\nAt first glance, the asymmetry could seem puzzling. If it’s  true, as the paper says, that the effects of QT are “far less than simply  reversing the effects of quantitative easing,” doesn’t that violate some kind  of law of nature? What if what goes up does not come down? Could cycles of QE  and QT be some kind of economic perpetual motion machine?\nBut the puzzle goes away when we recognize that any empirical  study of the effects of QE or QT faces two fundamental challenges.\nThe first challenge arises because financial markets are  forward looking. It’s difficult to measure the effect of a well-anticipated  policy action. Mostly, what we can measure is the effect of unanticipated  actions. And, as the paper acknowledges, QT tends to be much better anticipated  than QE, in part because central banks tend to telegraph that QE is temporary.\nImagine a hypothetical central bank that announced it would  buy assets at a fixed monthly pace for two years and then allow those assets to  mature without reinvesting, and that it would not reconsider this plan under  any circumstances. Term premiums would move when the central bank made this  announcement, reflecting market anticipation of the entire path of asset  purchases and maturities. If the central bank then happened to announce at the  two-year mark that purchases had ended and runoff had begun, that “QT”  announcement would convey no new information and, as an announcement, should  have no effect on term premiums. Nevertheless, in this hypothetical program, QT  would eventually fully unwind the term premium effects of QE. Part of the  unwind would actually happen up front: the effect of the QE announcement would  be dampened by the certainty that assets would start to run off in two years.  The QE announcement would contain the seeds of its own undoing. And the rest of  the unwind would happen gradually as the assets ran off and market prices  shifted to accommodate larger private sector holdings.\nOf course, real-world QT isn’t preplanned in such a rigid  way, but its onset still tends to be better anticipated than QE. QT typically  starts when the economic recovery is clearly underway and usually isn’t a big  surprise. In the current cycle, the Bank of England even provided a nearly  mechanical rule relating the start of QT to the policy rate. [3]\nBy contrast, central banks typically launch QE in unusual  circumstances—an economic crisis or financial stress episode when adjusting the  policy rate isn’t adequate or isn’t possible. I don’t like to call QE “unconventional”  policy because it’s now a firmly established part of the central bank toolkit.  Nevertheless, QE is used infrequently enough and in unusual-enough  circumstances that there is no simple and predictable pattern to how it’s used.  Even when market participants expect a central bank to deploy QE in some form,  they typically have a broadly dispersed distribution of expectations about the  size and timing of the program. QE announcements collapse that uncertainty.  Thus, the measured effect of QE announcements tends to be larger than the  measured effect of the widely anticipated onset of QT.\nThis brings me to the second challenge facing studies like  today’s and the second explanation for the asymmetry in magnitudes: QE and QT  are the result of central banks’ deliberate policy choices. Central banks  deploy QE when they believe QE will have desirable effects and QT when they  believe QT will have desirable effects. The circumstances are different, and  intentionally so.\nCentral banks usually launch QE  programs when markets are under severe stress or policy rates are at the ELB. By  contrast, QT announcements typically come when markets are calm and policy  rates are above the lower bound. The liquidity channel operates very  differently in these two types of environments, and to some degree, so do the  signaling and portfolio-balance channels. In other words, the asymmetry in  measured effects is at least partly an asymmetry in the contexts where QE and  QT are announced—not simply an asymmetry in the effects that QE and QT would  have if they were counterfactually announced in identical contexts. [4]\nIt’s easiest to see the asymmetry across environments in the  case of the liquidity channel. Some programs under the broad umbrella of QE  have specifically aimed to address dysfunction in asset markets. Consider, for  example, the Fed’s purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) during  our first QE program amid the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) or our historically  large and rapid purchases of Treasury securities and MBS at the onset of the  pandemic. In the stressed trading conditions that prevailed at the start of  both of these episodes, the Fed’s purchases restored normal market liquidity. I  suspect that if a central bank were to announce QT during a severe stress episode,  the liquidity effects would be at least as large as those usually observed for  QE (though with the opposite sign). But since central banks generally wait to  initiate QT until the underlying sources of market dysfunction have been mitigated,  QT doesn’t typically trigger new rounds of dysfunction that would reverse the  liquidity gains from QE. [5] To summarize, the main reason we measure larger  liquidity effects on average from QE than QT is because central banks don’t use  QT when it would have large liquidity effects.\nThe asymmetry across environments also applies, to a degree,  to the signaling and portfolio-balance channels. Forward guidance about the  policy rate becomes more important when the policy rate is at the lower bound  and can’t be lowered further. Correspondingly, the signaling channel’s ability  to reinforce forward guidance is more powerful at the lower bound.  Additionally, central banks often state explicitly that QT actions convey no  signal about the future path of the policy rate, being motivated instead by a  desire to normalize the balance sheet. [6]\nAs for the portfolio-balance channel, remember that the term  premium is the compensation investors require to bear duration risk. All else  equal, that compensation is higher when there is more uncertainty about future  interest rates. This implies central bank asset holdings are likely to have a  larger effect on term premiums at times of relatively higher interest rate  uncertainty. The key question is when those times are, and in contrast to the  asymmetry that the conference paper emphasizes, research has found that such  times often include the start of QT. That may be because QT tends to occur when  rates are away from the ELB and front-end rate volatility is mechanically higher. [7] But measuring these effects can require controlling in a detailed way for  interest rate uncertainty and the magnitude of the surprise in a central bank’s  QE or QT announcement, which could be challenging in a broad cross-country  analysis of the type the conference paper undertakes. [8]\nUnpacking the asymmetry that the paper describes goes some  way toward understanding why QE is such a powerful element of the central bank  toolkit at critical moments and yet is possible to unwind later without undoing  the benefits that QE provided. When the economy suffers a severe negative  shock, or when markets experience severe dysfunction, central bank asset  holdings can have a large influence on financial conditions through the  portfolio-balance, signaling and liquidity channels. Deploying QE at such times  can support the economy and market functioning. As the economic and market  stressors diminish, the relevance of the central bank’s asset holdings for  financial conditions will moderate on its own, even before the central bank  begins normalizing its balance sheet. And that means the eventual initiation of  QT typically has much less impact than the onset of QE.\nAsymmetry across asset and  funding markets\nSo far, I’ve focused on asymmetries in how QE and QT affect asset  markets. Now, let me turn to an asymmetry on the other side of the balance  sheet, one that receives less attention in the paper but that I see as  important to the continued success of the Fed’s ongoing balance sheet  normalization.\nBecause changes in central bank assets also change the  central bank’s liabilities—such as reserves—QE and QT also affect funding  markets. I’d argue, and we see some evidence for this in the paper, that the  effects on asset markets are more prominent during QE, while the effects on  funding markets are more prominent during QT. One reason is that the measured  asset market effects are typically larger for QE than QT. But in addition, the  funding market implications of QE and QT differ, especially in the floor system  that the FOMC began using to implement monetary policy post-GFC.\nIn a floor system, the Fed controls money market rates  primarily by adjusting the administered rates that we pay on liabilities such  as reserves and the overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility. These  administered rates create a floor under market rates regardless of the quantity  of reserves we supply. One significant benefit of a floor system is that it  allows us to maintain rate control while acquiring assets when necessary to  achieve our economic and financial stability objectives. By contrast, at the  onset of the GFC, we operated with scarce reserves and controlled money market  rates primarily by adjusting the supply of reserves to move up and down the  demand curve. That meant the reserve growth resulting from our initial asset  purchases in the GFC generated significant money market volatility. [9] In a  floor system, reserve growth during QE can produce some modest downward  pressure on money market rates, but that pressure is limited.\nThe flip side of a floor system’s ability to absorb reserve  growth, though, is that the regime works only when reserves are sufficient to  meet banks’ demand at close to market rates. If reserves drop too far, we would  fall out of the floor system and see substantial upward pressure on money  market rates. While our ceiling tools such as the Standing Repo Facility (SRF)  and discount window provide significant backstops against such a scenario, the  response of money market conditions to reserve levels in the floor system is fundamentally  asymmetric. There’s more upside rate risk from reserves falling too low than  downside rate risk from reserves rising too high.\nThe challenge today is knowing how far to go in normalizing  the balance sheet. In 2019, the FOMC decided that it would operate in the long  run with a version of the floor system where reserves are “ample.” [10] The word  “ample” suggests comfortably but efficiently meeting banks’ demand. As I’ve  argued elsewhere, the Friedman rule provides a guide to the efficient supply of  reserves in the ample-reserves regime. [11] Banks’ opportunity cost of holding  reserves should be approximately equal to the central bank’s cost of supplying  reserves.\nMost analysts view the cost of  supplying reserves as small. So, since banks’ opportunity cost of holding  reserves is the spread between money market rates and the interest rate on  reserve balances (IORB), the ample level of reserves is one where spreads of  money market rates to IORB are generally small. Comfortably meeting banks’  reserve demand at close to market rates also puts them on the flat part of the  demand curve for reserves. Hence, when reserves are ample, money market rates  should not move much with fluctuations in reserve supply due to changes in  autonomous factors such as the Treasury General Account. [12] In light of the  substantial volatility of autonomous factors, this implies the ample level  includes a buffer of reserves above the minimum needed to meet banks’ demand.\nWhen money market spreads to IORB are small, banks will avoid  economizing excessively on reserves and taking inappropriate liquidity risk. By  contrast, when reserves are below ample and money market rates are meaningfully  above IORB, banks face an implicit tax on liquidity. This can make the  financial system less safe and less efficient. More-than-ample reserve levels  are also inefficient. Currently, for example, money market rates are running as  much as 10 basis points below IORB, tilting the liquidity playing field away  from nonbanks that can’t hold reserves. While it was necessary and appropriate  to temporarily expand the Fed’s balance sheet in response to the economic and  financial stresses of the pandemic, it’s important to normalize the balance  sheet and remove these inefficiencies now that the stresses have passed.\nI know that everyone is really hoping I’ll go one step  further and say what level of reserves corresponds to the ample level. I’m  going to disappoint you. Banks’ demand for reserves varies significantly over  time as the economy and financial system evolve. For example, the liquidity  stresses last March inspired many banks to reevaluate how they manage reserves,  and supervisory or regulatory developments could lead to further changes in  reserve demand. So, I don’t think we can identify the ample level in advance.  We’ll need to feel our way to it by observing money market spreads and  volatility.\nTo me, the need to feel our way means that when ON RRP  balances approach a low level, it will be appropriate to slow the pace of asset  runoff. As long as there are significant balances in the ON RRP facility, we  can be confident that liquidity is more than ample in the aggregate. But once  the ON RRP is empty, there will be more uncertainty about how much excess  liquidity remains. Moreover, the current pace of runoff is about twice what it  was in the first half of 2019. This hasn’t yet reduced reserves because funds  have come out of the ON RRP facility instead. After the ON RRP is drained,  asset runoff will reduce reserves 1-for-1, all else equal. In this environment,  moving more slowly can reduce the risk of an accident that would require us to  stop too soon.\nReserves don’t necessarily come out of all banks equally.  Some firms can approach scarcity well before others. So, as reserves fall, the  system has to redistribute them. And banks can’t perfectly anticipate their  outflows. The faster the Fed’s balance sheet shrinks, the larger are the  outflow surprises that banks confront, the more challenging the redistribution  becomes, and the greater the risk that we go too far and see undue money market  pressures.\nSlower runoff, therefore, is a way to approach the ample  point more gradually, allowing banks to redistribute funds and the FOMC to  carefully judge when we have gone far enough. This strategy will mitigate the  risk of undesired liquidity stresses from QT.\nI want to emphasize that slowing, to me, doesn’t mean  stopping. In fact, I believe that proceeding more gradually may allow the Fed  to eventually get to a smaller balance sheet by providing banks with more time  to adjust. As I said earlier, the eventual stopping point should depend on what  we observe in money market volatility and spreads.\nIn that regard, I’d emphasize that ample reserves doesn’t  mean eliminating all rate volatility or collapsing all money market spreads to  precisely zero. Money markets and their participants are real-world  institutions, not a theoretical ideal. It’s not the role of monetary policy to  eliminate the various small frictions that arise in reality, and I expect we’ll  continue to see minor spreads and rate fluctuations even when we operate with  ample reserves in the long run.\nI also want to note that while the ample level of reserves is  unknown, I see considerably less uncertainty about the appropriate long-run  level of ON RRP balances in the ample-reserves regime. The Fed’s operating  regime is intended to supply ample reserves to banks—but only ample reserves  and not more than that. In an environment with persistent and meaningful ON RRP  balances, money market rates would tend to fall well below IORB, meaning that  liquidity would be more than ample. While some observers have argued that maintaining  significant ON RRP balances in the long run could provide a buffer against  money market volatility, that buffer would come at the expense of supplying  more than the efficient level of reserves and creating an unlevel liquidity  playing field between banks and nonbanks.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, I would like to again thank the authors for this  informative paper and the organizers for the opportunity to comment on it. Not  only is the topic fascinating in its own right, but this discussion provides an  important public service. To achieve the Fed’s goals of maximum employment and  stable prices, we must continuously deepen our understanding of how our tools  affect financial conditions and the broader economy. I am grateful to the  authors and all of you involved in this conference for your contributions to  this knowledge.\nThank you.\nNotes\nLorie K.

    "text": "Opening remarks at the Panel on Policy Challenges for Central Banks, 2023 annual meeting of the Central Bank Research Association\nJuly 06, 2023\nThank you for that kind  introduction, Trish [Mosser]. It’s great to be back at the School of  International and Public Affairs and to have the opportunity to discuss current  policy challenges with you, Don [Kohn] and Guillermo [Ortiz].\nI’d like to begin with some thoughts on the economic outlook  and the monetary policy response. These views are mine and not necessarily those  of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nTo put it  concisely, I remain very concerned about whether inflation will return to  target in a sustainable and timely way. And I think more-restrictive monetary  policy will be needed to achieve the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) goals  of stable prices and maximum employment.\nThe economic outlook\nBoth inflation and  the labor market came in hotter than expected over the first half of 2023. As of December, professional forecasters expected  year-over-year core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation to slow  to 4.3 percent in the first quarter of 2023, and the unemployment rate to rise  to 3.9 percent. In actuality, core PCE inflation for the first quarter was 4.7  percent, and the unemployment rate averaged 3.5 percent.\nWhile  the final data for the second quarter aren’t in yet, it was clearly pretty hot,  too. Core and trimmed mean inflation measures continued to run  around 4 percent—twice our target. Statistics like these that filter out  especially volatile prices give an important signal of where overall inflation  is headed. And  while labor market indicators have eased, the overall pace of rebalancing  remains slower than previously expected.\nThe economy has  added an average of 314,000 jobs per month this year. Job openings remain far  above the 2019 level. Layoffs remain low. There is no indication of an abrupt  deterioration in labor market conditions.\nWage growth remains  around 4.5 to 5 percent. The Dallas Fed’s business survey respondents expect  roughly 5 percent wage growth over the next year, similar to what they expected  at the end of last year. And they cite labor costs as a key driver of higher  selling prices.\nSome people  say a lot of further cooling is in store from lagged consequences of the rate  increases the FOMC has already made over the past year and a half. I’m  skeptical about the potential for large additional effects from this channel.\nThe lags have to be measured  from the right starting point. Broad financial conditions matter more for  economic activity than the policy rate itself. Of course, financial conditions  respond to the policy rate and, in particular, to market participants’  expectations for the future path of the policy rate. And so, in the  current cycle, financial conditions began to tighten in early 2022—a year and a half ago, and a few months before the FOMC  began actually raising rates—as soon as market participants started to expect  rate increases. The last major tightening in financial conditions came around  the FOMC meeting last September, more than nine months ago. So, although some  sectors of the economy will be slower to respond, we have already had a fair  amount of time to see the overall effects of monetary tightening.\nMoreover, the  housing market even looks like it may have bottomed out. Housing starts and  home prices have trended up since January. Market rents had been roughly flat  at the end of last year but rose at around a 4 percent annual rate in the first  four months of this year. While housing inflation will likely continue to  soften in the near term as a result of progress on rents last year, a rebound  in housing would pose an upside risk to inflation down the road.\nMonetary policy\nThe continuing outlook for above-target inflation and a  stronger-than-expected labor market calls for more-restrictive monetary policy.\nCredit conditions  are continuing to evolve, but based on what we’ve seen so far, tighter credit  conditions don’t seem likely to fully offset the need for a higher policy rate.  While banking stresses captured headlines this spring, bankers have been  cutting back on credit availability since the fall. And the Dallas Fed’s  banking contacts say the main reason is tighter monetary policy, not banking  stresses. So, at this point, I view credit conditions mainly as the result of  the FOMC’s policy stance, not as a separate factor to adjust for. Moreover,  banking stresses have calmed since March. Commercial real estate remains a risk,  but not uniformly; the challenges are concentrated at some banks and some types  of properties, especially office.\nWhile the Fed must  remain ready to respond if banking stresses reignite, we have strong liquidity  tools, and we know how to use them. Our actions in March showed that. These  liquidity tools give us the space to continue setting monetary policy  appropriately for our dual-mandate goals.\nI also don’t expect  the near-term dynamics of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to create  liquidity pressures that would call for a change in monetary policy strategy.  Following the resolution of the debt ceiling, some market participants argued  that the rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) balance—coming on top of the ongoing runoff of the Fed’s asset  holdings as we return to a more normal level of monetary accommodation—would drain regional banks’ reserves, pose a new risk to  financial stability and meaningfully tighten financial conditions. But that  wasn’t my expectation, and it hasn’t happened so far. In the weeks since the  debt ceiling was resolved, Treasury has issued more than $450 billion in net  new marketable debt—mainly Treasury  bills—to rebuild the TGA  and finance government spending. As investors such as money market funds and  foreign central banks buy that debt or lend against it in repo markets, they  have pulled a net $340 billion out of the Fed’s overnight reverse repo (ON RRP)  facility and foreign and international monetary authorities’ reverse repo pool.  Those shifts have largely offset the $360 billion growth in the TGA through  last week and, in combination with other balance sheet components, left reserve  balances little changed. [1]\nMy base case is  that most of the TGA rebuild will continue to come from ON RRP balances or from  reserves at very large banks. We’ve seen over time that even modest yield  differentials are enough to encourage money market funds to move balances from  the ON RRP facility to T-bills or private sector repos. And large banks have  excess reserves that they’ll likely be comfortable allowing to run off as the  TGA grows. So, while I’ll be vigilant in case the balance sheet dynamics play  out differently, a large drain of reserves from regional banks doesn’t seem  like the most likely scenario.\nWe could still see  some temporary upward pressures on money market rates over time as the TGA  grows and the Fed’s balance sheet normalization continues. Banks can’t  perfectly predict deposit flows. They may have to pay more for short-term  funding at times as liquidity redistributes through the financial system. As  long as significant balances remain in the ON RRP facility, I wouldn’t see such  rate pressures as a sign that liquidity was becoming scarce. Rather, the rate  pressures would provide the incentive for funds to leave the facility and move  to banks. And the Fed would have plenty of tools for maintaining interest rate  control in such a scenario, including the standing repo facility, discount  window lending or a technical adjustment in the ON RRP rate. The balance sheet  outlook should not affect decisions about monetary policy at this stage.\nAnd history has shown the dangers of  central banks easing off too soon on inflation. We are all familiar with the consequences of the Federal  Reserve’s insufficiently resolute response to inflation in the 1970s. And  recently, a number of central banks have had to resume or accelerate rate  increases after pausing or slowing. The example of the Bank of Canada is  instructive. The Canadian mortgage market uses more flexible rates that result  in faster transmission of monetary policy to the economy. So, uncertainty about  lags isn’t complicating the economic picture as much there. As an open economy,  Canada appears to be getting a read on the persistence of global inflation. And  what they’re seeing, in the Bank of Canada’s words , is that inflation  is “stubbornly high.”\nIn this environment, the FOMC needs to make policy more  restrictive so we can return inflation to target in a sustainable and timely  way.\nIn my view, it would have been entirely appropriate to raise  the federal funds target range at the FOMC’s June meeting, consistent with the  data we had seen in recent months and the Fed’s dual-mandate goals.\nBut in casting my  vote, I was mindful of several factors. In a challenging and uncertain  environment, it can make sense to skip a meeting and move more gradually. And  as I said earlier, financial conditions matter more for the economy than the  precise path of the policy rate. Financial conditions depend not only on how  fast rates rise but also on the level they reach, the time spent at that level,  and, importantly, the factors that determine further increases or decreases. So,  my hope was that the overall package of communications coming out of the June  meeting would deliver a strong signal to financial markets and meaningfully  tighten financial conditions.\nAt this point, it is  important for the FOMC to follow through on the signal we sent in June.  Two-thirds of FOMC participants projected at least two more rate increases this  year. Significant unexpected events could always provide a reason to change  course. But inflation and the labor market evolving more or less as  expected wouldn’t really change the outlook. To have confidence that inflation will  return to target on an appropriate timetable, we need to see more than some continued  very modest rebalancing.\nIf we lose ground  in our effort to restore price stability, we will need to do more later to  catch up. The rate increases we’d need to keep inflation expectations anchored  in that scenario would be far worse for workers, communities, households,  businesses and banks than more modest increases now.\nThank you. I look  forward to our conversation.\nNotes\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Financial conditions and the monetary policy outlook\nOctober 09, 2023\nThank you, Greg, for that introduction, and thank you,  Julia, for inviting me to speak today. Good morning and welcome to Dallas and  the Eleventh Federal Reserve District. It was great to see so many of you at  last night’s reception and personally welcome you to the region.\nAs some of you may know, I am proud to have Pia  Orrenius, who is just completing her service as a NABE director, and Roberto  Coronado, who is starting his term as a director, on my leadership team at the  Dallas Fed. Two of our former research directors, Harvey Rosenblum and Mine Yücel,  have served as president of NABE. Together with my colleagues, I am working to  continue the Bank’s thought leadership in economics. And we greatly value our  collaboration and partnership with NABE.\nThe Eleventh District in 2023 is a highly diversified  and globally connected economy—transformed from the heavy concentrations in  cotton, cattle and oil as recently as the 1980s. The region has grown to  include a sizable high-tech industry in Austin, solid manufacturing in Fort  Worth and Arlington, a global energy capital in Houston, and a vibrant finance  and professional services sector here in Dallas.\nIt’s been a little over a year since I came here as  president and CEO of the Dallas Fed. In that time, I have visited with business  owners and community leaders from small towns, oil drillers and solar farm  operators in the Permian Basin, tech executives in Austin, and CEOs of some of  the biggest companies in our largest metro areas. These conversations are so  important because they provide a deeper understanding of the region’s economic  landscape as we work to advance an economy where everyone has opportunities to  thrive.\nIn diversifying its economic base, the Eleventh  District has in many ways become more similar to the nation over time. The oil  booms and busts that once ruled the region have diminished in impact, and the  region’s business cycle looks more similar to the nation’s. But the region  still has many unique features that set it apart from the rest of the country.  The dynamism here is visible every day, driven by in-migration of people and  businesses and adding to the economic growth that consistently outperforms the  national average.\nUnderstanding the trajectory of our regional economy  and connecting with regional businesses have been particularly valuable to me in  my role contributing to the formulation of monetary policy on the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC). Aggregate statistics can get us only so far in  understanding the economy. They are often backward looking and subject to revision.  Information from business contacts provides context on the reasons underlying  economic developments. And reports from these contacts can be more timely than  aggregate statistics, especially when the economy is near turning points. So,  the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys and my conversations with  business leaders provide a critical complement to the hard data. This has never  been more true than in recent months as the economic picture has become more  complex.\nToday, I’d like to share how I’m seeing the economic  outlook and how financial conditions are influencing my perspective on monetary  policy. As always, the views I share are not necessarily those of my FOMC  colleagues.\nThe economic outlook\nI remain focused on returning inflation to our 2  percent target. People count on the Federal Reserve to keep our commitment to  price stability. When inflation is high, people’s incomes fall short of the  rising cost of living. Businesses can’t plan well because they don’t know what  they’ll pay for materials or be able to charge their customers. And, over time,  high inflation tends to undermine the long and stable expansions that  particularly benefit the most vulnerable in society.\nOver the summer, we saw welcome progress on inflation.  However, the monthly inflation data have been somewhat uneven. Smoothing  through the monthly fluctuations can give a more accurate picture. Of course,  waiting to declare victory until 12-month inflation rates get all the way back  to target would be a recipe for undershooting our inflation target. So, I see  averages over three or six months as a sensible middle ground to watch.\nIn formulating my inflation outlook, I also focus on  measures like core and trimmed mean that drop volatile categories and one-off factors.  These measures typically give a more reliable sense of where headline inflation  will trend.\nThe most recent release of the FOMC’s preferred  inflation gauge, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE,  showed some further improvement. Through August, the three-month PCE inflation  rate excluding food and energy, or core PCE inflation, was 2.2 percent. The three-month  Dallas Fed trimmed mean was 2.6 percent. Measured over six months, core has  fallen to 3 percent and trimmed mean to 3.1 percent. These developments are  encouraging, but it is still too soon to say with confidence that inflation is  headed to 2 percent in a sustainable and timely way.\nThe labor market is also an important input to my  assessment of the economic outlook. Employment is important in its own right as  one leg of the FOMC’s dual mandate. And restoring balance in the labor market  after the pressures of recent years will be important to restoring price  stability and sustaining it over time.\nWhile the job market isn’t as hot as it was a year  ago, it remains very strong overall. The U.S. economy has been adding more than  250,000 jobs per month. That’s significantly more than enough to keep pace with  trend growth in the labor force. My Eleventh District business contacts  continue to report tight hiring conditions. Of those seeking more workers, more  than half still say a lack of applicants impedes hiring. Data such as the quits  rate, the ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers, and surveys of consumers and  businesses show progress toward better balance. Many of these measures are near  or at 2019 levels. However, 2019 was a very strong labor market. Conditions  like those of 2019 don’t necessarily mean labor supply and demand are in  balance.\nAnd wage growth remains solid. Many national and  regional statistics continue to show that wages are rising faster than would be  consistent with 2 percent inflation in the long run, given typical estimates of  trend productivity growth. In the Dallas Fed’s latest regional survey on labor  costs, Texas businesses penciled in 5 percent wage growth for this year. That’s  down slightly from the last time we asked the question. But higher labor costs  are now tied with higher input costs as our survey respondents’ top reason for  raising their selling prices.\nOutput and spending have come in surprisingly strong  in 2023. GDP growth has been at or above 2 percent for the past year. Growth in  the third quarter is tracking to be even stronger. The strength is broad based.  Consumption is robust, business investment is solid, the drag from the housing  sector has declined, and recession fears have faded.\nSome of my contacts highlight a significant increase  in manufacturing and nonbuilding construction, both nationally and in this region.  The number of manufacturing construction projects in Texas is the highest in 22  years. With so many projects in the pipeline, construction contract values are  also at record highs. Some of this activity appears related to initiatives to  spur clean energy, infrastructure and the domestic semiconductor industry.\nBut my business contacts do report mixed outlooks for  the consumer. Some anticipate continued strength, while others are finding it  difficult to pass through cost increases or are noticing softer growth.\nPutting all this information together, I expect that  continued restrictive financial conditions will be necessary to restore price  stability in a sustainable and timely way. I remain attentive to risks on both  sides of our mandate. In my view, high inflation remains the most important  risk. We cannot allow it to become entrenched or reignite.\nThe role of financial conditions\nYou’ll note that I referred to restrictive financial  conditions rather than to the setting of the federal funds rate. That’s  because, while the FOMC controls the overnight fed funds rate, households and  businesses usually borrow at longer tenors. Longer-term rates therefore  influence economic activity more directly than does the fed funds rate. Yet the  relationship between the fed funds rate and longer-term rates is not fixed. So,  in setting the stance of monetary policy, the FOMC needs to account for how  that stance will translate to the broader financial conditions, including  long-term rates as well as credit spreads and other factors, that influence  economic activity. In addition, broader financial conditions can contain  important information about how market participants are seeing the economic  outlook.\nFinancial conditions tightened substantially in recent  months. Much of the tightening came from movements in longer-term interest  rates. Higher long-term interest rates have also contributed to equity price  declines and dollar appreciation over recent months. In the remainder of my  remarks, I’ll discuss how I interpret the rate moves and what they might mean  for monetary policy.\nSince the  July meeting, the yield curve has steepened notably. The market-implied peak  fed funds rate is little changed, and policy-sensitive rates through 2025 are 60  basis points higher. But the 10-year Treasury yield is up roughly 90 basis  points, and the five-year yield, five years forward, is almost 130 basis points  higher.\nImportantly,  the rise in rates has come almost entirely in real interest rates. Inflation  compensation has hardly moved. Market participants remain confident, as they  should, that the FOMC will achieve the inflation target.\nInterpreting the rate increases\nA term interest rate can be broadly decomposed into  the expected average level of overnight rates plus a term premium that  compensates for the risk of interest rate fluctuations.\nConceptually, therefore, there are several reasons why  longer-term rates may have risen. First, market participants may anticipate  that the economic data will call for a higher fed funds rate target in the next  few months or years. Second, market participants may judge that overnight rates  will be higher, on average, over the long term, as a result of lasting changes  in the structure of the economy or financial system. And, third, term premiums  may have increased.\nA rise in term premiums can itself have many drivers, including  increases in the stock of debt relative to investors’ demand for debt, changing  correlations between the returns on different asset classes—which can influence  the portfolio diversification properties of long-term bonds—and reductions in  expectations for the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings.\nThe July FOMC minutes indicated that  runoff of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet “need not end when the Committee  eventually begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate.” In my  view, while it is far too soon to think about rate cuts in our monetary policy  strategy, there will presumably come a time when we are returning the fed funds  rate to a neutral level from above. Normalizing the fed funds rate in that way  would be entirely consistent with continuing to normalize our asset holdings.  Additionally, the more than $1 trillion of balances in the overnight reverse  repurchase agreement facility leave plenty of room to reduce our balance sheet  without making bank reserves scarce. As market participants have taken on board  these perspectives on the balance sheet, market expectations for the end of  runoff have shifted out. In turn, the expectation of lower Federal Reserve  asset holdings over time implies that other investors will need to hold more  long-duration securities, which appears to be one factor among the many  contributing to higher term premiums.\nThe decomposition of changes in yields into near-term  rate expectations, long-term rate expectations and term premiums matters for  monetary policy.\nNear-term policy-sensitive rates rose on a number of  occasions in recent months in response to strong economic data. Market  participants understand that, to the extent stronger economic growth poses  risks to inflation, the FOMC may need to offset that strength with higher  interest rates.\nEconomic data can also lead market participants to  reassess their outlooks for the average level of overnight rates that will be  consistent with achieving the FOMC’s goals over the long run. For example, the  economy has shown surprising resilience over the past year in the face of  sustained real interest rates north of 1.5 percent. I’m starting to take some  signal from that resilience, not only about the rates needed to restore price  stability in the next few years, but also about the rates that will need to  prevail to sustain price stability and maximum employment over a much longer  horizon.\nAnd higher term premiums have a different implication  altogether. Higher term premiums result in higher term interest rates for the  same setting of the fed funds rate, all else equal. Thus, if term premiums  rise, they could do some of the work of cooling the economy for us, leaving less  need for additional monetary policy tightening to achieve the FOMC’s  objectives.\nThe persistence of all these changes also matters. If  technical factors are temporarily raising term premiums, for example, monetary  policy shouldn’t overreact.\nDecomposing yield changes\nAlthough the decomposition of yield curve moves is an  important input into appropriate monetary policy, calculating this  decomposition is anything but straightforward. Surveys, term structure models, event studies and anecdotal information  from market participants can all shed light on the decomposition. But each of  these techniques requires critical assumptions, and they ultimately deliver  mixed results.\nSurvey-based  decompositions suggest a limited rise in expected overnight rates and a large  role for term premiums. The simplest way to identify the expected overnight  rate is to survey informed professionals. In fact, the New York Fed’s surveys  of primary dealers and market participants ask this very question. A term  premium can then be estimated by subtracting the surveyed expectation of  overnight rates from a  zero-coupon Treasury yield. In July, the median modal primary dealer  expectation for the average fed funds rate over the next 10 years was just  under 3 percent, implying a 10-year term premium of 80 basis points based on  market rates at the time of the survey. The September survey has not yet been  publicly released. But market contacts mostly say their expectations for the  average fed funds rate changed little over the summer, suggesting a good share  of the rise in longer-dated yields reflects increased term premiums.\nOf course, the survey-based approach has shortcomings. Modal expectations don’t reflect the  distribution of risks. If that distribution skews up or down, the expected  value of the overnight rate could differ from median modal expectations.  Respondents to the Open Market Trading Desk’s surveys may not be representative  of the market more broadly. And survey results tend to be inertial. Respondents  may be disinclined to adjust their reported expectations until they have high  conviction that a change is warranted.\nTerm structure models  can overcome some of these drawbacks, but estimates can vary dramatically  depending on model specification and inputs. Two commonly cited models were  built by current and former Fed economists: the Kim-Wright model and the Adrian, Crump and  Moench, or ACM, model . The  Kim-Wright model estimates that about one-third of the increase in 10-year  Treasury yields since the July FOMC meeting is from a higher expected policy  rate path, with the other two-thirds reflecting higher term premiums. The ACM  model, on the other hand, estimates a decline in the expected path of  future short-term rates and an increase in the 10-year term premium of 115  basis points. That includes a roughly 55-basis-point increase since the  September meeting. The marked divergence in signals provided by these two  models underscores just how sensitive model-based results are to modeling  decisions, especially over short windows. In this case, the key difference is  that the KW model incorporates Blue Chip surveys of short rate expectations in  the data used for estimation.\nA third approach is to evaluate whether yield moves on specific days or  in specific time intervals were driven primarily by changes in the expected  path of short rates or by shifts in the price of duration risk. Yield changes in response to economic data  surprises or to Fed communications on rate policy might reasonably be assigned  to changes in interest rate expectations. Yield moves on news unrelated to Fed  rate policy might be chalked up to term premiums. This approach is subject to a  great degree of judgment but can deliver ballpark results. My  back-of-the-envelope estimates using this approach suggest that more than half  of the total increase in long-dated yields since the July FOMC reflects rising  term premiums.\nMarket participants’ perspectives can supplement these calculations. My staff and I are in frequent touch with  contacts including investors and traders at pension funds, leveraged funds and  other firms that are part of Texas’ growing financial market industry.\nPutting together  analytic estimates with the information I have gathered through these channels,  I see a mixed story. There is a clear role for increased term premiums in  recent yield curve moves. But the size and persistence of the contribution are  subject to uncertainty.\nConclusion\nSo, what does this mean for monetary policy? As I said  earlier, inflation remains too high, the labor market is still very strong, and  output, spending and job growth are beating expectations. I anticipate that we  will need continued restrictive financial conditions to return inflation to 2  percent in a timely way and sustainably achieve our goals of maximum employment  and price stability.\nFinancial conditions have  tightened notably in recent months. But the reasons for the tightening matter. If  long-term interest rates remain elevated because of higher term premiums, there  may be less need to raise the fed funds rate. However, to the extent that  strength in the economy is behind the increase in long-term interest rates, the  FOMC may need to do more. So, I will be carefully evaluating both economic and  financial developments to assess the extent of additional policy firming that  may be appropriate to deliver on the FOMC’s mandate.\nThank you.\nNotes\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLorie K.

It is wonderful to see Dr.  Ruth Simmons here today. Dr. Simmons is chair of the Dallas Fed’s Houston board  as well as a member of the GHP board. And we’re so pleased that Daron Peschel,  senior vice president and our Houston regional executive, is able to serve on  the GHP board as well.\nIt’s always great to visit Houston. This is an incredible  city and a vital contributor to the U.S. and global economies. Houston is the  energy capital of the world and an international hub for energy innovation. Its  geography, infrastructure and workforce also make it a vibrant center for  industries including logistics, aerospace, health care and biotechnology.  Houston was the very first city I visited outside Dallas when I began a  listening tour of the region after joining the Dallas Fed as president and CEO  two years ago. And every time I return, I’m more impressed with the city’s  dynamism, the powerful partnerships between business and community leaders, and  the innovation taking place here.\nAs you’d expect in such a dynamic place, a lot has changed  since my first visit to Houston in early October of 2022—new solar, wind and  carbon capture projects; the Energy Department’s selection of Houston as a  hydrogen hub; continued expansion at the Texas Medical Center; and ambitious  lunar plans at NASA. Still, the foundational elements of energy, geography,  infrastructure and workforce that I learned about in 2022 have stayed in place.\nThe same is true for the national economy since 2022; a lot  has changed, but a lot remains the same. Today, I’ll share with you how my  thinking on the economy has evolved and how I’m continuing to apply some  foundational considerations to the economic challenges we face today. As  always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe Federal Reserve\nWhen I think about what we do at the Federal Reserve, it’s  all about advancing an economy where everyone has opportunities to thrive.\nAt the Dallas Fed, we describe our work as “Building a  Strong Economy Together.” The Dallas Fed is one of the 12 reserve banks that,  along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal  Reserve System. We are the nation’s central bank, and we perform five functions  to support a strong economy for everyone in the United States:\nProgress on inflation and the start of monetary policy normalization\nAs I’m sure you recall, inflation two years ago was much too  high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price  index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. But as of mid-2022, prices  had risen more than 7 percent since a year earlier. Soaring prices strained the  budgets of families and businesses and had the potential to destabilize our  economy over time.\nAt the same time, the labor market was incredibly strong—by  many measures, unsustainably so. With companies adding jobs faster than the  labor force was adding workers, wages surged. While those higher wages weren’t  enough, for many workers, to keep pace with the cost of living, the wage  pressures threatened to cause businesses to raise prices even more.\nThe FOMC responded by rapidly tightening monetary policy. We  raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 5.25 percentage points  from early 2022 through mid-2023. We also began running off securities holdings  that we had accumulated to support the economy during the pandemic.\nThese measures helped bring the economy into much better  balance. The most recent annual PCE inflation reading was 2.2 percent. Progress  on inflation has been broad based; it’s not just a few outlying price  categories that have cooled. You can see that in the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean  PCE inflation rate, which removes outliers and has fallen from a peak of 5  percent two years ago to 2.67 percent on an annual basis in August. And, while  the labor market remains healthy, it has cooled as well.\nIn light of this progress, I supported the FOMC’s decision  last month to begin normalizing the stance of monetary policy by lowering the  target range for the fed funds rate. Less-restrictive policy will help avoid  cooling the labor market by more than is necessary to bring inflation back to  target in a sustainable and timely way.\nThe path ahead\nTo recap, the economic and monetary policy picture today is  entirely different from two years ago:\nWhat haven’t changed are the key considerations I’m applying  in thinking about the FOMC’s policy choices. First among those, of course, is  my commitment to sustainably achieving both of our dual-mandate goals: maximum employment and stable prices. I also  continue to carefully consider the risks and uncertainties we face. The  appropriate policy strategy depends on whether the path ahead is clear or  cloudy. And I continue to pay close attention to financial conditions and to  the information I receive from business and community contacts and the Dallas  Fed’s regional surveys. While the FOMC controls the overnight fed funds rate,  households and businesses usually borrow at longer tenors. Understanding how  our monetary policy stance translates to broader financial conditions and the  day-to-day experiences of households and businesses is crucial for  understanding the economic outlook and how monetary policy may need to respond.\nIn the rest of my remarks, I’ll share how I’m thinking about  the economic outlook and upcoming monetary policy decisions in light of those  considerations. I’ll discuss inflation and employment in turn. And I will argue  that, following last month’s half-percentage-point cut in the fed funds rate, a  more gradual path back to a normal policy stance will likely be appropriate  from here to best balance the risks to our dual-mandate goals.\nInflation outlook and risks\nThe Fed’s inflation target is for overall inflation,  including the prices of all consumer goods and services. But to get a handle on  where overall inflation will head in the future, I like to focus on measures  that exclude volatile outliers and unusual shocks, such as the Dallas Fed  trimmed mean that I described earlier. The drop in the trimmed mean since 2022  demonstrates that we’ve reduced inflation for most goods and services. The  trimmed mean has continued to move down recently, though progress has become  more gradual. The 12-month measure remains somewhat elevated even as  shorter-term trimmed mean measures have approached 2 percent.\nTo understand whether monetary policy is restrictive enough  to return overall inflation all the way to 2 percent, I have been paying  particular attention to the inflation component that economists refer to as  “core services.” This category includes services other than those related to  energy, which are usually quite volatile. Because services are generally  produced flexibly and domestically, core services inflation is typically more  responsive to U.S. economic conditions and helps assess how monetary policy is  influencing price pressures.\nWhile measures of inflation for both housing services and  other core services remain above their prepandemic levels, recent trends have  been encouraging. I expect that a couple of factors will help bring these  components down to levels consistent with 2 percent overall inflation over  time. The stance of monetary policy is still restrictive and should continue to  restrain demand for both housing and other services. And longer-term inflation  expectations reflected in surveys and financial market prices remain close to  our 2 percent target, anchoring decisions by price and wage setters.\nThe healing of supply chains since the pandemic has reduced  inflation, too. Energy and food inflation, two categories that are susceptible  to supply shocks, contributed to the inflation surge in 2021 and 2022 but are  now holding down overall inflation. Core goods inflation has returned to its  slightly negative prepandemic level. That’s a result not only of healthier  supply chains but also of cooler goods demand.\nAll that said, while the upside risks to inflation have  diminished, they have not vanished. I continue to see a meaningful risk that  inflation could get stuck above our 2 percent goal.\nOne way such a scenario could play out would be if aggregate  demand proves stronger than most forecasts currently assume. The ongoing  resilience in consumption and gross domestic product (GDP) hint at the  potential for unexpectedly strong demand, as do recent upward revisions to data  on gross domestic income and the savings rate.\nFinancial conditions could also boost demand beyond what the  economy can sustain. As I mentioned earlier, the fed funds target influences  economic activity only indirectly, because most households and businesses pay  longer-term interest rates that also reflect their creditworthiness. Financial  conditions have eased notably from a year ago. Mortgage rates have dropped,  equity prices are near all-time highs, and credit spreads are near historic  lows. Even if the current assessment of demand is on target, an unwarranted  further easing in financial conditions could boost spending and push aggregate  demand out of balance with supply.\nThese risks suggest the FOMC should not rush to reduce the  fed funds target to a “normal” or “neutral” level but rather should proceed  gradually while monitoring the behavior of financial conditions, consumption,  wages and prices.\nA related upside risk to inflation stems from uncertainty  regarding what the “neutral” level of the federal funds rate even is. Besides  examining broad financial conditions, economists often consider whether  monetary policy is boosting or slowing growth and inflation by comparing the  policy rate to a theoretical level that would represent neither a headwind nor  a tailwind. That neutral rate is notoriously uncertain and difficult to  measure. But you can get a sense for it from economic fundamentals, models, surveys  and market prices. And all of  these suggest the neutral rate may be higher than  before the pandemic.\nStructural changes in the economy, like the energy  transition and advances in artificial intelligence, are a prime driver. These  developments are fueling strong investment demand as well as potential  increases in productivity. You can see the changes in investment firsthand  throughout Texas, in projects like the enormous liquefied natural gas plants  under construction along the Gulf Coast, the semiconductor fabs encouraged by  the CHIPS [Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors] Act, as well  as new data centers and the energy sources to supply them.\nImportantly, though, uncertainty about the neutral rate has  also risen, perhaps because these changes in the economy are quite recent and  will take time to fully assess. The FOMC’s own projections display the  uncertainty. Four times a year, we release our projections for the fed funds  rate as well as unemployment, inflation and GDP growth. Around the FOMC table,  participants’ projections for the longer-run fed funds rate now vary by more  than 1 percentage point, compared with a spread less than half that wide two  years ago. In this uncertain environment, lowering the policy rate gradually  would allow time to judge how restrictive monetary policy may or may not be and  reduce the risk of inadvertently boosting inflation by bringing the policy rate  below its neutral level.\nFinally, I remain attentive to inflation risks from supply  chains and geopolitical developments. I am closely watching the aftermath of  the recent strike at the Port of Houston and other Gulf Coast and East Coast  ports. The Dallas Fed’s contacts tell us the three-day work stoppage isn’t  likely to leave a lasting mark on supply chains. But workers and port operators  have agreed to revisit their contract in January, so risks remain. I am also  closely watching the conflict in the Middle East. As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome  Powell has said, while the human toll is devastating, the Federal Reserve’s  institutional role is a limited one: to monitor the economic implications. U.S.  and global energy markets are currently somewhat slack, which has held down  risk premiums in oil markets. However, the potential for more significant  disruptions and price impacts cannot be ruled out.\nEmployment outlook and risks\nTurning to the employment side of the FOMC’s dual mandate,  labor markets appear close to balanced. Job gains have slowed from their torrid  pace two years ago. However, as the most recent employment report showed, firms  are continuing to hire workers across a broad range of sectors. The  unemployment rate has risen from historic lows. It averaged 4.2 percent over  the past three months, which is near or just below most experts’ judgments of  the rate consistent with stable inflation.\nStill, the labor market remains healthy. There are more job  openings than unemployed workers nationally. The rise in unemployment over the  past year is due mainly to labor force growth and slower hiring rather than  more people losing jobs. Layoffs and initial claims for unemployment insurance  remain low.\nStrong consumption and investment growth continue to support  the job market. Real GDP grew at a 3 percent annual rate, seasonally adjusted,  in the second quarter. Timely measures of economic activity, such as the Dallas  Fed’s Weekly Economic Index and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker, suggest  strong growth in the third quarter as well. And results from the Dallas Fed’s  most recent Texas Business Outlook Surveys indicate that firms generally expect  activity to remain solid over the next six months.\nNonetheless, as the labor market has cooled, we face more  risk that it will cool beyond what is needed to sustainably return inflation to  2 percent or that the employment situation may even deteriorate abruptly.\nAssessing the labor market risks is challenging because the  data are unusually uncertain of late. Over the summer, the Bureau of Labor  Statistics significantly lowered its estimates of payroll job growth through  last March, due largely to changing estimates of how many businesses have  formed or closed. The bureau could further revise the figures as additional  benchmarking data become available. Faster immigration, meanwhile, makes it  more difficult to precisely judge the rate of job growth that’s consistent with  a stable labor market. And because it takes time for new immigrants to  integrate into the labor market, they could temporarily raise the unemployment  rate even if the market remains strong. Storms and strikes, meanwhile, will  complicate the interpretation of this month’s jobs report. In light of these  uncertainties, just as with inflation, I believe the FOMC can best balance the  labor market risks for now by normalizing policy gradually—neither waiting too  long to act nor moving too quickly and risking going too far.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the economy is much closer to sustainably  achieving the FOMC’s goals of maximum employment and price stability now than  it was two years ago. The changes in the economy call for a different stance of  monetary policy. But the considerations I’m applying in assessing the  appropriate stance remain the same:\nAs I consider the economic statistics, financial conditions,  and reports from business and community contacts, two takeaways stand out to  me. First, the economy is strong and stable. But second, meaningful  uncertainties remain in the outlook. Downside risks to the labor market have  increased, balanced against diminished but still real upside risks to  inflation. And many of these risks are complex to assess and measure. As we  complete the return to price stability and a well-balanced labor market, the path  ahead is cloudy, not clear.\nIf the economy evolves as I currently expect, a strategy of  gradually lowering the policy rate toward a more normal or neutral level can  help manage the risks and achieve our mandated goals. It should go without  saying, though, that the future is uncertain. Any number of shocks could  influence what that path to normal will look like, how fast policy should move  and where rates should settle. Policy should not follow a preset course. In my  view, the FOMC will need to remain nimble and willing to adjust if appropriate.\nThank you.\nNote\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and Rebecca Zarutskie for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Opening remarks for panel titled ‘Economic uncertainty and the design and conduct of monetary policy’\nNovember 21, 2025\nGood afternoon.\nThank you to the Karl Brunner Institute for inviting me to participate in this important conference. As always, the views I’ll share are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nIt is an honor to join this distinguished panel addressing a topic that is both timely and timeless: the role of economic uncertainty in monetary policy.\nThe topic is timely because this is a moment of substantial uncertainty about the economic outlook. And it is timeless because, really, there’s nothing especially new about that situation. Uncertainty is a pervasive feature of the macroeconomy and monetary policymaking.\nTheoretical models in which one knows the precise current state of the economy, fully understands the economic mechanisms and has perfect foresight about the future can sometimes provide useful baseline approximations. But these are merely approximations. The world is complex, multifaceted and ever-changing. A policymaker cannot know with certitude the current state of every relevant aspect of the economy, let alone exactly how every part of the economy works or what shocks may arrive.\nYet policymakers must still make policy decisions. Even a choice not to act is itself a decision. And we cannot let uncertainty paralyze us. Rather, it’s incumbent on policymakers to tackle uncertainty head-on.\nFirst off, policymakers can reduce uncertainty about the state of the economy by gathering economic information from a wide range of sources. For me, those sources include official statistics, private-sector data, financial market conditions, surveys of households and businesses, and reports from business and community leaders and market contacts about what they are seeing in the economy and financial system. Besides sharpening the economic picture, taking on information from a wide range of sources makes the policy process more robust to disruptions in the flow of information from any one source, such as the government shutdown in the United States that recently paused publication of many federal official statistics . But even after thorough information-gathering, some uncertainty will always remain.\nAnother important area of uncertainty is about how the economy works, and especially the mechanisms through which monetary policy influences the economy. Again, policymakers can work to reduce the uncertainty—for example, by consulting a wide range of models and experts to see where there’s consensus and by investing in research to deepen understanding over time. But as with uncertainty about the state of the economy, uncertainty about the mechanisms can only be reduced, not eliminated.\nAnd we can never know what the future may bring. The shifting winds of geopolitics and technology only add to the range of potential shocks right now.\nIn the end, therefore, policy decisions must take uncertainty into account. That can mean adjusting a policy decision to reflect risk management considerations instead of doing what would be optimal if the situation were certain. Research shows that how to make these adjustments depends crucially on the source of uncertainty. For example, if policymakers want to provide economic stimulus but are uncertain how much stimulus will come from a specified reduction in interest rates, it can be optimal to move in small steps and learn more about the size of the effect. On the other hand, if policymakers are uncertain about the persistence of shocks to inflation, it can be optimal to move more aggressively than one would under certainty so as to mitigate the danger of unanchored expectations. There are also many cases when policymakers should look through uncertainty, either because there is no benefit to adjusting in one direction or another, or because the key aspects of the economic outlook are certain enough to provide clear counsel even as some uncertainties remain.\nIn that spirit, I’ll describe the aspects of the U.S. economic outlook and monetary policy strategy that seem relatively certain to me at this time, as well as some key uncertainties I’m continuing to work to resolve. I’ll then briefly discuss the outlook for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.\nThe economic and monetary policy outlook\nThe FOMC has made two 25-basis-point rate cuts in recent months. While I supported the September rate cut, I would have preferred to hold rates steady at our October meeting.\nCongress gave the FOMC a dual mandate: to pursue maximum employment and stable prices. The labor market has remained roughly balanced and cooling slowly. Inflation remains too high, taxing the budgets of businesses and families, and appears likely to exceed the FOMC’s 2 percent target for too much longer. This economic outlook didn’t call for cutting rates.\nPayroll job gains fell markedly in 2025. But slow job gains don’t necessarily mean there’s more slack in the labor market. Labor supply has fallen at the same time as demand, particularly due to changes in immigration policy and labor force participation. In consequence, we haven’t seen a rapidly widening gap between the number of jobs available and the number of people who want work. The unemployment rate rose slowly during the year. Unemployment claims have stayed low, although I’m mindful of recent layoff announcements by some employers. And, thanks in part to financial conditions, resilient consumer and business spending continues to support employment.\nThe risks to the labor market do lie mainly to the downside. In this low-hiring environment, the job market could have difficulty absorbing any significant pickup in layoffs from the current low level. Asset valuations can sometimes snap back without much warning, which might take the wind out of consumer spending. However, the resolution of the federal government shutdown takes one near-term downside risk off the table.\nTurning to the price stability side of the mandate, inflation in the United States is still too high and too slow to return to target. The FOMC targets a 2 percent inflation rate as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. Inflation by that measure exceeded the target in each of the past four years. It’s on track to do so again this year. The index rose 1.8 percent just in the first eight months of the year, and forecasters expect it to end the year up about 2.9 percent.\nWhile inflation has come down significantly from the post-pandemic peak, it’s still not convincingly headed all the way back to 2 percent. I remain concerned about the trajectory of underlying inflation, even after accounting for temporary factors that affect prices in the near term. The Blue Chip Economic Indicators surveys dozens of private-sector forecasters about their economic outlooks. The Blue Chip consensus outlook is for 2.6 percent PCE inflation in 2026 and around 2.4 percent in 2027, followed by fluctuations between 2.1 and 2.2 percent all the way out to at least 2031—never all the way back to target.\nThe FOMC has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to the 2 percent inflation target. Our obligation to the public is to deliver on this commitment, as well as our equally serious obligation to pursue maximum employment.\nThe FOMC’s long-run strategy calls for a balanced approach to our two objectives. I carefully weigh the potential labor market costs of measures to reduce inflation. But labor demand and supply have remained in rough balance. When the FOMC met in October, it had already mitigated downside risks by cutting rates at its previous meeting in September. The remaining risks to employment are ones the FOMC can monitor closely and respond to if they are becoming more likely to materialize, not ones that currently warrant further preemptive action. For those reasons, I did not see a need to cut rates at the October meeting. And with two rate cuts now in place, I’d find it difficult to cut rates again in December unless there is clear evidence that inflation will fall faster than expected or that the labor market will cool more rapidly.\nUncertainties in the near and longer terms\nOne key uncertainty is how much more room there may be to reduce rates while still maintaining a restrictive policy stance that can further slow inflation. The gradual cooling in the labor market during 2025, among other evidence, demonstrates that policy was at least modestly restrictive before the September and October rate cuts. At the same time, economic and financial developments raise substantial doubts about whether we entered 2025 with more than 75 basis points of restriction. For example, if policy had been significantly restrictive, I would have expected to see a more rapid increase in labor market slack. And I wouldn’t have expected to see soaring asset valuations in many markets, nor corporate credit spreads compressed to historic lows. That’s not to say labor market and financial conditions are uniformly easy. Some workers are experiencing greater difficulty finding work, and financing is tighter in some sectors, such as housing. But those pockets of pressure are more consistent with modest restriction than significant or severe restriction.\nPolicy restriction is a function of real interest rates, not nominal ones. Forecasters expect about 2.7 percent inflation over the coming year. That puts the current real fed funds rate around 1.2 percent, which is toward the low end of typical model-based estimates of neutral, although all of these estimates are highly uncertain. Put another way, with inflation running persistently above target, a fed funds rate close to 4 percent isn’t nearly as restrictive as you might have thought.\nPolicy also has to account for headwinds and tailwinds hitting the economy. Elevated asset valuations and compressed credit spreads aren’t just indications that policy most likely isn’t very restrictive. They’re also indications that the fed funds rate needs to offset tailwinds from financial conditions.\nPutting it together, even in September I was not certain we had room to cut rates more than once or twice and still maintain a restrictive stance. And having made two cuts, I’m not certain we have room for more. Monetary policy works with a lag. It’s too soon to directly assess the degree of restriction from the current stance of policy, with two rate cuts already on board. In the absence of clear evidence that justifies further easing, holding rates steady for a time would allow the FOMC to better assess the degree of restriction from current policy. Taking the time to learn more can help us avoid unnecessary reversals that might generate unwanted financial and economic volatility.\nLooking further in the future, ongoing structural changes could meaningfully shift the economy’s long-run trajectory. The artificial intelligence (AI) investment boom and elevated valuations for companies involved in AI reflect investors’ hopes that generative AI will transform human work, productivity and economic growth. Should those hopes come to fruition, the implications for inflation and labor markets will be profound—especially for younger workers, who by some accounts are already being affected in some occupations. Federal, state and local agencies around the United States are also seeking to support economic growth by removing or changing regulations. If successful, these efforts could raise productivity and permit more employment growth with less inflation. Meanwhile, to the extent that higher tariff rates change trade flows, patterns of investment and work in the United States could need to adjust.\nOver time, any or all of these factors could substantially influence where the FOMC will need to set the policy rate to achieve its dual mandate goals. My team and I are closely analyzing developments in these areas. It’s crucial to identify and react in a timely way to major changes in the economy. For now, though, the potential long-run structural shifts aren’t key ingredients in my near-term monetary policy views. While the AI investment boom is supporting spending and financial conditions, for example, the direct effects on employment and productivity have so far been relatively contained. The nature of the potential labor market transformation from generative AI remains unclear: what kinds of human work will it ultimately replace, and what kinds will it complement? And big bets on new technology don’t always pan out. The sources of financing for these investments bear careful monitoring.\nWhile AI investors may be taking big risks in search of outsized returns, central bankers are famously conservative. I’ll be looking for more concrete evidence on the size, direction and timing of potential long-term structural changes as I consider how to I take them on board in my outlook.\nBalance sheet normalization\nLet me conclude with a few words on the Fed’s balance sheet. The FOMC decided in October to stop reducing the Fed’s asset holdings as of Dec. 1, ending a phase of balance sheet normalization that began in mid-2022.\nAsset runoff reduced not only the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet but also the bank reserves on the liability side of the balance sheet. This symmetry is important because the Fed implements monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves, which meets banks’ demand for reserves with market rates close to interest on reserves. As I’ve argued elsewhere, ample reserves are efficient. Reserves are the safest and most liquid asset in the financial system and one that does not cost the Fed to create. The Friedman rule therefore says it’s efficient to eliminate banks’ opportunity cost of holding reserves, and that’s what the ample-reserves regime achieves.\nIn recent months, money market rates moved up toward and sometimes above the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB). After averaging 8 to 9 basis points below IORB in the first eight months of 2025, the tri-party general collateral rate (TGCR) averaged slightly above interest on reserves in the subsequent period. TGCR is a rate on overnight repos collateralized by Treasury securities. It’s a safe rate in a liquid and competitive market, and I view it as the cleanest single measure of money market conditions. The rise in TGCR made  it appropriate to end asset runoff, as the FOMC decided to do.\nImportantly, ending asset runoff only slows but does not stop the decline in reserves. If the Fed’s assets are held fixed, trend growth in non-reserve liabilities such as currency will absorb more of the balance sheet over time. The demand for reserves will likely also change over time in response to economic growth, changes in the banking and payments businesses, and adjustments in regulation. To maintain ample reserve conditions over time, the FOMC will need to determine when to start adding to its assets.\nIn an efficient system, market rates should be close to, but perhaps slightly below, interest on reserves on average over time. “On average” is key there. Market rates can fluctuate from day to day. Bringing the average level close to IORB also requires some tolerance for modest, temporary moves above IORB.\nRepo rate spreads to IORB have receded only somewhat in recent weeks from the peaks reached in late October and early November. Looking at where TGCR and other rates are settling, I expect it will not be long before it is appropriate to resume balance sheet growth so that money market rates can average close to, but perhaps slightly below, IORB. Those reserve management purchases will be technical steps. By no means will they represent a change in the stance of policy.\nHowever, the size and timing of reserve management purchases should not be mechanical, in my view. While purchases will need to offset relatively predictable trend growth in currency, reserve demand will likely also change over time in response to economic growth, changes in the banking and payments businesses, and adjustments in regulations. Reserve supply will need to roughly track those developments to remain efficient.\nThank you.\nLorie Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Remarks on liquidity provision and on the economic outlook and monetary policy\nMay 18, 2023\nThank  you for the kind introduction, Chris [Furlow], and for inviting me to join you  for this year’s conference.\nI  understand the Texas Bankers Association is the oldest and largest association  of bankers in the United States. This is very fitting for a state that has more  community banks than any other, as well as regional and large banks that  combine to form a diverse, vibrant banking ecosystem.\nI grew up in Versailles, Kentucky, a small  town that really revolved around our community bank. Its loans were an engine  for economic and community growth. But more than that, it’s where our soccer  carpool gathered before going to games—and the bank’s name was on the soccer  jerseys. The bank also invested in the town in so many other ways, like  supporting our personal finance classes in school. The bank served the  community and was part of the community. That early experience gave me a strong  appreciation for how important banks are in our economy and how important it is  to have a strong and diverse banking system.\nToday, I would like to speak with you  about two topics. As a Federal Reserve Bank president and member of the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC), I’m often asked for my views on the economy and  monetary policy. I promise you I’ll get to that subject in a few minutes. But  first I want to discuss the Federal Reserve’s role in providing liquidity to  the financial system, particularly during periods of market stress, and what  this means for your banks. Let me note that the views I share today are mine  and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nLiquidity provision\nLiquidity  provision is one of the oldest roles of central banks around the world and an  original purpose of the Federal Reserve System. One of the first lessons we are  taught as central bankers is that to prevent stress and address crises should  they arise, a central bank should stand ready to lend freely against good  collateral.\nWhen  a central bank offers a liquidity backstop, it supports financial stability in  two ways: by reassuring the public and by actually adding liquidity to the  system.\nIn  many cases, the mere availability of ample liquidity can reassure depositors,  calm stresses and help private funding markets continue to function smoothly. The  central bank may not even need to make any loans.\nAnd  when reassurance is not enough, the central bank can relieve pressures by  delivering more funding. Over the years, across many episodes of financial  stress, loans from central banks have helped bankers meet the needs of their  customers—Main Street businesses and households—when other funding sources were  unavailable. For this mechanism to work, the funds have to get out the door of  the central bank and in the doors of commercial banks. Practical operational  details become critically important, and all the more so in an era when  liquidity needs can arise faster than ever.\nA banker I know told me how his  great-grandfather managed a run on their family’s bank in 1932. He got in the  car, drove to Dallas, borrowed $40,000, brought it back to the bank, showed  customers the cash, and the run stopped. The world moves a lot faster these  days. And I am pretty sure you couldn’t fit enough money in the car, either.\nThe  events this year at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) are only the latest example of  how liquidity needs are speeding up. We also saw an astonishingly rapid dash  for cash in financial markets at the onset of the pandemic. Liquidity needs  surged so rapidly that the Fed’s trading desk, which I led at the time, had to  respond by buying more than $100 billion of securities on some days. And the  rise of electronic trading has contributed to fast-moving shocks in securities  markets.\nMany  people have spoken about lessons learned from the recent banking stresses for  banks’ risk management, supervision and regulation. If you haven’t yet read [Federal  Reserve] Vice Chair [for Supervision] Michael Barr’s report on SVB, I encourage  you to do so. It’s a careful examination of the bank’s failings and a  transparent, candid and self-critical look at the Federal Reserve’s own role in  the matter. [1]\nToday,  I will look at lessons learned through a different lens: operational readiness.  Operational readiness was a focus of my work leading the Fed’s trading desk for  many years, and I believe it should be a priority for banks of all sizes in  this era of fast-moving stress. I’ll share some thoughts on implications for  banks, for bank supervision and regulation, and—in the spirit of a candid look  in the mirror—for our own operations at the Federal Reserve.\nWhen  phones can move money, and bank names can trend on apps on those same phones,  bankers must look at contingent liquidity sources in a new light. The  traditional ways to mitigate deposit flight, such as face-to-face conversations  and phone calls to answer questions from depositors, may not be available in  all instances. If you can’t borrow from a funding source  with almost as much speed as your depositors can push buttons on their phones,  it might not help you meet withdrawals.\nOne  important funding source for many banks is the Federal Reserve’s discount  window. The ability to borrow at the window can be particularly critical for  smaller banks that lack access to broader capital markets, as well as for  larger banks that could need funding late in the day when other borrowing  relationships may not be available.\nWhen  banks establish access to the discount window, they can also gain access to the  Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which we set up in March to respond to the  recent stresses. With backing from the Treasury Department, the program allows  banks to borrow for up to one year against Treasury and agency securities. [2] We  lend through the BTFP based on the collateral’s par value, even if rising  interest rates have reduced its market value. This additional funding, beyond  what’s available at the discount window, helps ensure banks can meet their  customers’ needs.\nDiscount window loans are priced a bit  above prevailing market rates—we call this a backstop rate—because we don’t  want to crowd out private funding. For that reason, banks generally do most of  their borrowing elsewhere. But nevertheless, I  strongly believe that every bank in Texas and every bank in our country should  be fully set up at the discount window as part of its liquidity toolkit.\nLegal  documents and collateral arrangements for the discount window should be in  place well before any funding need arises. A bank facing today’s potential  liquidity challenges may not have the luxury of waiting for setup.\nAnd  banks should test the plumbing. Take out and repay a  small-dollar loan. Practice moving collateral between the Fed and other  funding sources that you use, such as the Federal Home Loan Banks. Evaluate how  the lendable value of collateral varies across funding sources. These steps  sound simple, and they usually are. But you want to have the muscle memory, so  they’ll be easy even on a challenging day.\nThe  same need for readiness applies to other contingent funding. Well-managed banks  maintain access to a diverse set of funding sources. Maintaining access means  more than a general idea that you could access funding from some source. The  paperwork needs to be in place, and the operations need to be tested.\nAs  the authorities continue to learn from the recent episode, it will be valuable  to examine how supervision and regulation can best take operational readiness  into consideration. For example, an expectation that depository institutions  establish and periodically test access to the discount window could help make  individual firms and the financial system more resilient. Unlike requirements  for banks to hold more liquid assets, an expectation for discount window  readiness would allow banks to engage as much as always in the traditional  business of banking—taking deposits and making loans—that is so critical to our  economy. Also, if all depository institutions regularly tested their discount  window access, the traditional stigmas associated with borrowing from the Fed  would be further reduced. To be clear, healthy banks borrow from our programs  all the time. In the first quarter of 2021, the most recent period for which  data have been released, 388 depository institutions took a total of 818 loans  from the discount window. [3] Periodic borrowing by every bank would make it  even more clear that borrowing is not in any way a negative signal.\nIf  we are going to expect more of banks, we must also expect more of ourselves as  the central bank. Liquidity tools that are not ready to get money out the door  right away might not help us fulfill our responsibility to provide a liquidity backstop  for the financial system. To be sure, the Federal Reserve has taken important  steps to increase our operational readiness. [4] For example, the Standing Repo  Facility (SRF) and Foreign and International Monetary Authorities (FIMA) Repo  Facility, which we established in 2021, automatically add liquidity to the  financial system when needed. [5] That eliminates the need to decide whether to  provide liquidity and, if so, how much, a step that slowed us down in the past.  Banks are eligible to access the SRF, and I’d encourage you to consider whether  this would be another helpful funding source for your bank.\nBut  there is more the Fed can do. Some bankers have expressed concerns that our  setup process for discount window access can move slowly. We hear you. Senior  executives at the Dallas Fed are collaborating with our counterparts at other  Reserve Banks to accelerate the setup process.\nLooking  forward, the Federal Reserve should also consider expanding the hours of  operation for critical services like the discount window. Our liquidity  backstop should be available whenever banks might need it. As liquidity  increasingly becomes a 24/7/365 business, that could come to include nights,  weekends and holidays.\nAnd  while I’ve focused mainly on banks today, we should examine our readiness to  provide liquidity broadly in the financial system. Besides the recent banking  stresses, we should consider experiences from the pandemic, the repo market  pressures in September 2019 and other episodes since the Global Financial  Crisis. And we should think about potential risks not yet experienced. We  should consider how we can employ the full range of the Federal Reserve’s  tools, including emergency lending authority, support for financial market  infrastructures and open market operations. For example, the FOMC could further  consider the potential benefits of centrally clearing SRF operations. [6] Maximizing  the effectiveness of our liquidity tools is essential so we can maintain  financial stability while also taking the appropriate monetary policy actions  in today’s macroeconomic environment.\nEconomic outlook\nIn  the rest of my remarks, I’ll assess the economic outlook and describe how I  think monetary policy needs to respond.\nInflation  remains much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured  by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, but prices  rose over the past year by 4.2 percent—more than twice our goal.\nThis  high rate of inflation challenges families and businesses in the short run, and  it weakens our economy in the long run. So, restoring price stability remains a  critical priority.\nNow,  inflation in recent months has been lower than the worst peaks last year. The  labor market has cooled somewhat. And activity in some sectors, such as  housing, has slowed dramatically. The economy is not nearly as far out of  balance as when the FOMC began raising rates 14 months ago.\nBut  the question for monetary policy is not whether there has been some progress. It’s whether  inflation is on track to return all the way to our 2 percent target and to do  so in a sustainable and timely way.\nThe closer we get to a turning point in  the economy, the more difficult it becomes to answer that question. The economy  doesn’t cool uniformly. Some sectors can continue to boom even as others slow. And  inflation may not fall in lockstep with hiring or output. So, we have to parse  the statistics and qualitative information with even more care and humility  than usual.\nI’m keeping an open mind and a close watch  on economic developments as we head toward the next FOMC meeting in mid-June.\nAs of today, though, I remain concerned  about whether inflation is falling fast enough.\nPart of the slowdown in inflation in  recent months has been due to lower prices of oil and other commodities. But  while it’s a relief to see lower prices at the gas pump, energy prices can’t  keep falling forever.\nCore inflation, which excludes volatile  food and energy prices, has historically been a better guide to where overall  inflation will go in the future. And core PCE inflation was 4.9 percent  annualized for the first quarter of 2023.\nThat is higher than overall inflation over  the past year, higher than core inflation in the previous quarter and much  higher than the inflation rate the public is counting on us to deliver.\nThe  picture is the same with other statistics that filter out especially volatile  prices to get a better signal of where overall inflation is headed. For example, the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE  inflation rate is higher than headline inflation, and the 12-month rate has  leveled off above 4.5 percent in recent months.\nWe haven’t yet made the progress we need  to make. And it’s a long way from here to 2 percent inflation.\nThe labor market’s continued strength  appears to be contributing to high inflation. To be sure, some labor indicators  are no longer boiling over the way they were last year. But the job market is  still very strong. If it isn’t boiling over, it hasn’t cooled to a gentle  simmer, either.\nLast month, the U.S. economy added 253,000  jobs. That’s down significantly from the rate late last year. But it’s still  more than twice what’s needed to keep pace with the growth of the labor force  over time. And the unemployment rate last month ticked down to 3.4 percent,  tied for the lowest unemployment rate since 1969.\nLast year and early this year, job  openings were another red-hot indicator. At one point, there were two openings  for every unemployed person in the United States—a historic high. Today, the  ratio has fallen to 1.6 openings per unemployed person. That shows some  progress toward better balance, but it’s still well above the 1.2 openings per  unemployed person in the very strong labor market of 2019.\nAnd while wage growth has moderated, there  are hints that it might be leveling off at a relatively high pace. The  Employment Cost Index and average hourly earnings accelerated a bit in the  latest readings. And the Dallas Fed’s regional surveys show no clear signs of  deceleration in wages.\nIf labor productivity tracks historical  trends, wage growth of 4.5–5 percent just isn’t sustainable, because it isn’t  consistent with keeping inflation at 2 percent over time. And without price  stability, high wage growth may not even make workers better off. Taking home  more dollars doesn’t do much good if your budget is stretched thinner and  thinner.\nThis complex environment calls for  watching the data closely, interpreting the data carefully and remaining  flexible.\nI recognize the arguments that if we  tighten monetary policy too much or too fast, we risk seeing the labor market  weaken more than is necessary to control inflation. Those job losses would be  very costly, particularly for lower-income households.\nI am also attentive to the potential for  nonlinear and unexpected deterioration in financial conditions. We are still  learning how much the stresses at some banks will affect lending and economic  growth in the aggregate. The Dallas Fed’s latest Banking Conditions Survey,  which was released on Monday, found that 48 percent of responding bankers  tightened credit standards and terms over the preceding six weeks. That’s the  most since we started the survey in 2017. But it is not a huge surprise. Bankers  have been telling us since last fall that higher interest rates are causing  credit conditions to tighten. And, even now, they say the main reason for the  latest tightening is restrictive monetary policy, not stress in the banking  system.\nAnalytical  models that try to calculate the incremental effect of banking stresses predict  only a modest further drag on the economy. Most calculations so far suggest an  effect comparable to raising the federal funds rate by 25 or 50 basis points.  And it’s worth noting that other aspects of financial conditions have eased  since March. Still, the estimates from these models are highly uncertain. We  have to be prepared to respond to a range of outcomes.\nFiscal  negotiations and geopolitics could slow the economy, too.\nBut  all of these downside possibilities are risks, not likelihoods or certainties. And there are upside risks as well: The  data could come in hotter than expected, or other lenders could substitute more  for bank credit.\nMoreover, if the FOMC doesn’t stay  committed to restoring price stability, the public could come to expect  persistently high inflation. A self-fulfilling spiral of unanchored inflation  expectations would require much larger rate increases to stop. Ultimately, that  scenario would be worse for workers, households, businesses and banks than the  costs of tighter monetary policy today.\nSo, even as we consider how best to manage  the risks, they must not stop us from doing what’s necessary to achieve 2  percent inflation.\nConcluding  remarks\nThe FOMC is committed to delivering a  healthier economy, with maximum employment and stable prices. To me, because of  the potential costs of unanchored expectations, the path to that goal runs  through bringing inflation back to 2 percent in a sustainable and timely way. After raising the target range for the federal funds rate at  each of the last 10 FOMC meetings, we have made some progress. The data in  coming weeks could yet show that it is appropriate to skip a meeting. As of  today, though, we aren’t there yet.\nThank  you.\nNotes\nLorie K.

    "text": "A level playing field for deposit insurance\nJuly 18, 2024\nWelcome. Thank you, Mark [Wynne] , for the introduction. I’m excited to be here with you all today and to welcome you  to the Dallas Fed.\nThis week’s conference  will focus on how banks fund their activities. Funding is a basic aspect of banking,  and it particularly comes into focus during stress episodes, such as the one we  experienced last year. Funding models can also influence the diversity and competitiveness  of the banking system over time, and in my remarks today, I’m going to spotlight  those considerations.\nI’m so pleased that  our friends at the Atlanta Fed collaborated with us to organize and host this conference,  including my colleague President Raphael Bostic, who will speak tomorrow. I’m delighted  to be joined by so many distinguished banking and policy leaders, including Federal  Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman, who will give keynote remarks at dinner this evening;  Agustin Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, who  will give tomorrow’s opening keynote; and my colleague Mary Daly, president of the  San Francisco Fed, who will participate in a fireside chat this afternoon. And I’m  thrilled to bring together industry, policymaker and academic perspectives for this  important conversation.\nThe importance of bank funding\nFunding risk is  both one of the oldest challenges in banking and one of the most timely. The most basic activity banks do is transform deposits into  longer-term investments. Banks accept deposits, promise to return them whenever  depositors want and invest in the meantime in less-liquid assets, such as loans  that finance investment and fuel economic growth.\nSo, as I’m sure  the panelists in our history session this afternoon will discuss, bankers have long  understood the importance of being prepared to meet withdrawals—and of maintaining  depositors’ confidence so they don’t withdraw money based on unfounded fears.\nBut as we saw in  2023, maintaining depositors’ confidence can be challenging in today’s highly networked  society that allows bank runs to propagate with unprecedented speed. Now that banking conditions have stabilized and  the immediate pressures banks felt last year have passed—though we should always  remain watchful for any risks that may emerge—it’s a good time to consider whether  adjustments in banks’ liquidity risk management or in related public policies can  support a strong and vibrant banking system in the modern environment.\nI’m looking forward  to the ideas and insights all of you will share today and tomorrow. I’d like to  start with a few perspectives of my own, and I’ll note these will be my perspectives  and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nA framework for the issues\nFrom my standpoint,  there are three main ways to ensure sound liquidity risk management in banking.  First, regulations can require banks to hold a certain amount of liquid assets,  or banks can choose to do so voluntarily. This approach is important, but relying  exclusively on it would have a drawback. By limiting the amount of liquidity transformation  banks do, this approach limits the amount of banking they do.\nSecond, as a complement  to holding liquid assets, bankers and regulators can ensure banks have reliable  and ready access to contingent funding sources. Contingent funding can come from  private markets and from central bank backstops such as the Federal Reserve’s discount  window and Standing Repo Facility or from similar facilities that other central  banks offer firms in their countries with funding from dollar swap lines. We’ll  have a panel on contingent liquidity tomorrow.\nAnd third, banks  and regulators can work to stabilize the deposit and funding base. For example,  diversifying deposit sources can make a bank’s funding more resilient. And  deposit insurance can reinforce customers’ confidence that their money is safe,  thus preventing bank runs and limiting the potential liquidity outflows that banks  may need to meet.\nThese three approaches  interact. Buffers of liquid assets and sound plans for contingent funding can reassure  depositors and prevent runs, accomplishing some of the same goals as deposit insurance.  And to the degree deposit insurance succeeds in preventing runs, banks may not need  as much access to liquid assets or contingent funding.\nExperience over recent years has  demonstrated that the discount window and the Fed’s other liquidity tools are effective  in supporting the stability of the banking and financial systems and, in turn, the  flow of credit to households and businesses. However, the payments and financial  systems, the economy, and technology continue to evolve rapidly. That evolution  can create new liquidity challenges and needs, as well as new opportunities for  the Fed to serve the public efficiently and effectively.\nOur last full review of the discount  window function took place more than 20 years ago. By examining our approach to  discount window lending in the current environment and in light of recent experience,  we can ensure the window continues to provide ready access to liquidity going forward.\nA critical element, in my view,  is enhancing depository institutions’ operational readiness to use the discount  window. In my opinion, every bank in America should be fully set up at the window  as part of its liquidity toolkit. That means completing legal documents and establishing  collateral arrangements well before any funding need arises. And it means testing  the plumbing—practicing the steps needed to take out and repay a loan and to move  collateral between the Fed and other funding sources. A bank facing a rapid run  will not have the luxury of waiting for setup or learning the procedures.\nWorking together with bankers,  the Federal Reserve System has already made substantial progress toward enhanced  operational readiness at the window. More than 5,000 depository institutions have  signed the necessary legal documents. They’ve pledged $3 trillion in collateral,  up $1 trillion from last year. And we’ve launched Discount Window Direct, an online  portal that lets depository institutions more efficiently request loans.\nI’m optimistic that through further  modernization of our technology and policies, as well as ongoing partnership with  banks, we can ensure the discount window remains a powerful tool for providing the  banking system ample access to liquidity.\nDeposit insurance for a diverse and competitive banking system\nTurning to deposit  insurance, the Federal Reserve does not establish those policies. Deposit insurance  is the responsibility of Congress, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)  and the National Credit Union Administration. But deposit insurance policies do,  as I mentioned, interact with liquidity provisions by the Fed, as well as our work  supervising banks and promoting financial stability. So I’d like to offer some thoughts  on those interactions and how deposit insurance can best support a banking ecosystem  that serves our economy well.\nMy starting principle  is that deposit insurance policies, like all banking policies, should support a  level playing field and fair competition among banks. Fair competition is a fundamental element of our market economy. Across all  industries, fair competition promotes innovation, opportunity and diverse business  models that can meet the needs of many different customers. And that is just as  true in banking as in any other business.\nI grew up in Versailles,  Kentucky, a small town with a tight-knit community. In Versailles, like so many  other small towns in the United States, our community bank catalyzed economic growth. Observing this relationship instilled in me an  appreciation for how smaller banks support strong communities and local economies.\nMy conversations  with business and community leaders as I travel the Eleventh District reinforce  that appreciation. We  heard from a woman in the Rio Grande Valley who dreamed of expanding her snack  stand. She didn’t have financial statements to present to a bank for a loan. But  the bankers at a local community bank were regular customers, and they got to talking  about her ambitions. They realized she had a checking account at the bank, and  the account history of revenue and expenses showed she had a viable business. The  bankers worked with the snack stand owner to help her craft a business plan and  get a loan to expand. She now has multiple locations and even several franchisees.  That type of local knowledge and relationship-based lending is a specialty of smaller  banks.\nCommunities’ needs  vary. To maintain a vibrant banking system that can meet those diverse needs, policies  should support a level playing field. That way, the banking models that best serve  customers and communities will come out ahead in the marketplace.\nIn my view, a level  playing field is achievable when it comes to deposit insurance, but that could require  some change. Right now, a couple of factors related to deposit insurance come together  to give the largest banks a potential advantage in attracting deposits. Federal  insurance coverage is limited to $250,000 per depositor. That limit is supposed  to give small depositors confidence while creating incentives for larger depositors  to investigate their banks’ condition. While large depositors could theoretically  provide helpful market discipline, they also often perceive—rightly or wrongly—that  some banks are too big to fail and that the government will bail out those banks  or their depositors in a crisis. Such perceptions undermine market discipline and  tilt the playing field toward big banks.\nWhen I checked recently,  several of the country’s biggest banks were offering interest rates of just 1 to  6 basis points on a standard savings account. How many community banks can  attract deposits at rates like that, when money market rates are over 500 basis  points? Of course, there are many reasons why the largest banks may be able  to pay lower interest rates than other banks. For example, some customers may value  these banks’ wide range of capital markets, settlement, custodial, international  and other services or their extensive branch networks.\nBut the evidence  of a tilt goes beyond interest rates. Amid the severe banking stresses in early  2023, we heard many reports of depositors pulling their funds from smaller banks  and moving to the largest ones. Just in the second week of March 2023, deposits at the  country’s 25 largest banks rose $113 billion, while deposits at all other domestic  banks fell $172 billion. The shift was significant enough that executives at several of  the largest banks mentioned it in their quarterly earnings calls. One described “significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit  and money market fund inflows,” while another reported seeing “noticeable flight to safety.” Meanwhile, at regional banks, executives were  saying things like “68 percent of our dollars that went out, went out to larger banks,  the money center banks,” and certain customers “wanted to pull money out from all regional banks.”\nIf you step back and look at how  deposit insurance works, these actions by depositors aren’t surprising. And although the flows to larger banks ebbed as banking conditions  calmed, the underlying incentives remain.\nEspecially when  it comes to business accounts, $250,000 isn’t such a large deposit. A small business  employing 110 people at the median wage would need $250,000 in its checking account  just to cover a biweekly payroll. What small business owner has time to conduct  regular, thorough checkups on a bank’s health? So, many depositors prefer to bank  at institutions where they don’t have to think hard about whether their funds are  safe.\nAnd there’s an important  exception to the $250,000 limit. If a bank fails and the Treasury secretary and  the boards of the FDIC and Federal Reserve agree there’s a serious threat to financial  stability, the FDIC can cover all deposits, even those above the limit. The government  makes no advance commitments about when it will invoke that systemic risk exception.  The exception has sometimes been applied to cover uninsured deposits at relatively  small banks, such as when Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank failed in  2023. Still, most depositors didn’t foresee that action. If they had, they probably  wouldn’t have run on SVB and Signature in the first place. By contrast, while the  government has not provided a formal guarantee to the eight U.S. firms designated  as Global Systemically Important Banks, or G-SIBs, most market participants think  it’s pretty unlikely the authorities would let those firms’ depositors lose money.  After all, these banks are officially systemically important.\nThe perception that  certain banks are too big to fail tilts the playing field. Some people argue that  stringent regulations on big banks counterbalance any too-big-to-fail benefits.  But even if the costs and benefits of size are equal most of the time, the equation  breaks when stresses emerge and the value of a perceived guarantee is suddenly much  larger.\nConceptually, there  are a couple of possibilities for restoring balance. Regulators could adopt even  tougher regulations on the largest banks. But such regulations could put a drag  on the economy by raising big banks’ costs for some of the unique and critical intermediation  services they provide. Or, authorities could increase the deposit insurance limit  so that deposits would be more equally protected at all banks. The FDIC proposed  some interesting options along those lines in a report last year. Of course, the benefits of a higher limit have to be  weighed against potential costs, such as whether deposit insurance premiums would  need to rise or whether a higher limit could increase moral hazard and encourage banks to take excessive  risks.\nWe have a panel  on deposit insurance this afternoon, and I’m eager to hear how the panelists weigh  these and other costs and benefits. Ultimately Congress would make any decisions.  But I would offer just a few more reasons why the current limit may be too low.\nFor starters, the  economy has grown substantially since Congress last raised the limit in 2008. If  the limit had increased since then in line with nominal gross domestic product,  it would be nearly half a million dollars today.\nAnother reason is  the invocation of the systemic risk exception to cover SVB and Signature in 2023.  This was clearly the right decision to protect the economy and financial system  once the banks had failed. But the need to provide insurance after the fact to depositors  who weren’t supposed to receive it and whose banks had not been regulated as systemically  important suggests to me the insurance limit was too low in the first place.\nLastly, I’d note  the growing use of reciprocal deposit networks , which allow banks  to swap deposits in excess of the limit with each other to provide depositors more  insurance. Reciprocal deposits reached $379 billion in the first quarter  of this year, up from $157 billion at the end of 2022. The vast majority of reciprocal  deposits—89 percent—are at banks with less than $100 billion in assets. That reflects  both the funding environment for smaller banks and the less-favorable regulatory  treatment of very large reciprocal deposits.\nReciprocal deposits can cost banks  more than 10 basis points in network fees. Smaller banks’  willingness to pay this cost to work around the deposit insurance limit suggests  the limit’s too low. As a society, if we’re going to provide the insurance anyway—which  is what happens when banks use reciprocal deposits—we may as well increase the limit  so we can avoid the costs, operational risks and regulatory mirages involved in  passing deposits back and forth between banks.\nStill, there is  lots to learn here, and I’m eager to hear all of your views.\nConclusion\nTurning to our agenda,  over the next day and a half, we’ll examine not only the role of deposit insurance  in today’s financial system, but also the stressors that led to the events of last  spring; lessons from historic financial crises; and the future of the discount window  and other contingent liquidity sources. We’ll also have a roundtable discussion  on what academics, bankers and regulators see as the key risks and challenges in  bank funding.\nThese discussions  will deepen our understanding of banks’ funding vulnerabilities and help the industry  and regulators prepare better for the future.\nThank you all for  joining us today, and many thanks to the entire team here and at the Atlanta Fed  who worked so hard to make this conference happen.\nNow, let’s welcome  Arthur Lindo, who  will chair today’s first session, “A look back at the regional banking stresses  of 2023.”\nLorie K.

    "text": "Opening remarks at panel on Market Monitoring and the Implementation of Monetary Policy\nJanuary 06, 2024\nThank you, Diana [Hancock]. It’s  great to be at this important annual gathering and have the opportunity to  discuss the policy outlook with you, Viral [Acharya] and Markus [Brunnermeier].  I’ll begin with some thoughts on the  state of the economy and monetary policy and then turn more specifically to the  Fed’s balance sheet and how we are implementing policy in money markets. As  always, the views I express are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues  on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nAs we look  back over the past year, inflation today is in a much better place than last  January. But the job  of restoring price stability is not yet complete. Our challenge now is to  finish the work of bringing inflation sustainably back to the 2 percent target.\nInflation  data have generally been coming in cooler than expected, which is good news. The price index for personal  consumption expenditures (PCE) was nearly flat for November and up 2.6 percent  over the past year. The Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE  inflation rate ,  which drops outliers, is 2.6 percent for the past three and six months. And core  PCE increased at only around a 2 percent pace over the past three and six months,  an improvement from the middle of 2023 when inflation appeared to be getting  stuck at a higher level.\nAnd there’s clear evidence  that the economy is moving into better balance. While GDP grew at an unsustainably strong 4.9 percent  annual rate in the third quarter, preliminary readings suggest the fourth  quarter will be substantially slower. My  business and community contacts consistently report that growth is settling  down—not collapsing, not heading toward recession, but settling down.\nThe labor market, while  still tight, also continues to rebalance. The pace of payroll job gains over  the past several months has remained strong but is well below the pace at the  start of 2023. The ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has fallen, as  has the rate of workers quitting their jobs. And wage growth appears to be somewhat more  consistent with our 2 percent inflation target. Contacts tell me that  applicant pools are growing, and job candidates’ salary expectations are  moderating. This is a more  consistent picture than we had earlier in 2023. It gives me confidence that we  have made a lot of progress toward a more sustainable path for the economy.\nSo, what could derail this  benign outlook of inflation returning sustainably to our target as the economy  gradually rebalances? There  are, as always, plenty of risks: geopolitical threats to supply chains,  financial fragilities in sectors such as commercial real estate and just the  simple possibility that our forecasts are once again wrong, as they’ve been too  many times in recent years. A key risk related to the topic of this panel is  that a premature easing of financial conditions could allow demand to pick back  up. Restrictive financial conditions have played an important role in bringing  demand into line with supply and keeping inflation expectations well-anchored.  Yet over the past few months, long-term yields have given back most of the  tightening that we saw over the summer. We can’t count on sustaining price  stability if we don’t maintain sufficiently restrictive financial conditions.\nMuch of the easing in long-term yields since October  came in response to softer economic data or policy communications. Ordinarily,  that pattern would suggest that markets expect the FOMC won’t need as  restrictive a setting of the federal funds rate to accomplish our goals. But  the magnitude of the reactions to data was much greater than normal. Part of  what appears to be happening is that when the data are strong, as occurred over  the summer, market participants perceive a wider range of potential rate  outcomes and require compensation for that risk in the form of higher term  premiums. And when the data soften, as happened recently, that term premium  comes out because market participants perceive more of an upper bound on policy  rates. Some model-based term premium estimates remain higher than levels seen last  summer, but I’m mindful that all else equal, a lower term premium leaves more  work to be done with the fed funds target.\nFinancial conditions indexes  (FCIs) can provide a guide to how much restraint there is on the economy. I’ll  talk today about four indexes that I find particularly informative. Three of  the indexes are helpful because they weight financial variables based on their relationship  to economic activity in macroeconomic models. These are the Goldman Sachs FCI and two FCIs published by the staff of the Federal Reserve  Board :  a baseline index that allows financial conditions to affect the economy with a  lag of up to three years and an alternate index that allows lags of at most one  year. The fourth index, published by the Chicago Fed, is more statistical in  nature and doesn’t translate directly to an effect on economic activity, but it  includes a much wider range of financial variables.\nThe Board staff’s baseline  index shows a drag on GDP growth from tight financial conditions in the coming  year. But that’s because the  index assumes long lags. My staff produced an updated calculation of the Board  staff’s alternative index with one-year lags, and it shows a tailwind to growth.  The Goldman Sachs FCI shows something similar. My own view is that the right  answer is somewhere in between. These indexes include only a subset of asset  prices. Looking across the financial system as a whole, we’re still seeing  tightening from bank credit and refinancing of term corporate debt. But a lot  of the effects of higher rates are already behind us, and the recent easing in  conditions could start to push up on aggregate demand. The Chicago  Fed’s FCI , which statistically  combines 105 different financial variables, shows that conditions are modestly  less restrictive than a year ago and than their average over the past half  century.\nAs I said earlier, if we  don’t maintain sufficiently tight financial conditions, there is a risk that  inflation will pick back up and reverse the progress we’ve made. In light of the easing in financial conditions in  recent months, we shouldn’t take the possibility of another rate increase off  the table just yet.\nTurning  to the Fed’s balance sheet and policy implementation, we have reduced our  securities holdings since mid-2022 at a brisk pace consistent with the principles and plans that the FOMC announced earlier that year. While securities holdings have declined  by $1.3 trillion, bank reserve balances have actually risen by $350 billion  dollars to around $3.5 trillion.  That’s because reduced balances in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse  repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility have more than offset the decline in  securities holdings. Increased Treasury issuance and a less uncertain interest  rate path have contributed to the rapid ON RRP runoff by motivating money  market funds to invest more in Treasury bills.\nMoney markets and policy implementation are  continuing to function smoothly. As we did in 2018 and early 2019, we are  likely to see modest, temporary rate pressures as our balance sheet shrinks and  our liabilities redistribute. These rate pressures can be a price signal that  helps market participants redistribute liquidity to the places where it’s  needed. Experience shows that these pressures tend to emerge first on dates  when liquidity is unusually encumbered or is draining out of the system  especially rapidly, like tax-payment dates, Treasury settlements and  month-ends. And indeed, we saw small, temporary rises in the Secured Overnight  Financing Rate (SOFR) over the November–December and year-end turns. But on  nearly all days, broad money market rates have remained well below the interest  rate on reserves.\nThe  emergence of typical month-end pressures suggests we’re no longer in a regime  where liquidity is super abundant and always in excess supply for everyone. In  the aggregate, though, as rate conditions demonstrate, the financial system  almost certainly still has more than ample bank reserves and more than ample  liquidity overall. The most recent Senior Financial Officer Survey shows that most banks in  the sample have reserves well in excess of their lowest comfortable levels and  desired buffers. ON RRP balances remain around $700 billion. And the Federal  Reserve’s Standing Repo Facility (SRF) provides a backstop against any  unexpected pressures.\nStill,  individual banks can approach scarcity before the system as a whole. In this  environment, the system needs to redistribute liquidity from the institutions  that happen to have it to those that need it most. The faster our balance sheet  shrinks, the faster that redistribution needs to happen. I’d note that the  current pace of asset runoff is around twice what it was in the first half of 2019.  And while the current level of ON RRP balances provides comfort that liquidity  is ample in aggregate, there will be more uncertainty about aggregate liquidity  conditions as ON RRP balances approach zero.\nSo, given the rapid decline of the ON RRP, I think  it’s appropriate to consider the parameters that will guide a decision to slow  the runoff of our assets. In my view, we should slow the pace of runoff as ON  RRP balances approach a low level. Normalizing the balance sheet more slowly  can actually help get to a more efficient balance sheet in the long run by  smoothing redistribution and reducing the likelihood that we’d have to stop  prematurely.\nLastly, I want to take note of the Securities and  Exchange Commission’s adoption last month of a requirement for broader central clearing for cash and repo transactions  in the Treasury market . While  broader central clearing won’t cure all of the market’s vulnerabilities, our research at the Dallas Fed finds that it will have significant benefits. Related to my  previous comments, broader central clearing should make repo markets more  elastic as multilateral netting can reduce intermediaries’ balance sheet costs.  That will help smooth the redistribution of liquidity when balance sheets are  constrained, such as during stress episodes and at period ends. Broader central  clearing should also meaningfully improve risk management, in particular by  mitigating risks at interdealer brokers in the cash market and by addressing  the 74 percent of noncentrally cleared bilateral repos that are currently  transacted with zero haircuts. Of course, careful implementation by the  industry and regulators will be important. The SEC has established a phased  timeline, with full compliance in 2026. As the market moves toward broader  clearing, I think the FOMC should also consider the benefits of central  clearing of the Federal Reserve’s own Treasury market operations. The SEC  regulation exempts central banks, but in my view, it’s typically most efficient  and effective for us to operate in the same way as the main market  participants. And, as I’ve discussed previously ,  central clearing of the SRF could make that facility more effective in  providing backstop liquidity to the broad market.\nThank you.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Opening remarks for Fed Listens\nJune 03, 2025\nThank you, Kseniya [Benderskaya] ,  for the introduction. And thank you all for joining us this afternoon in-person  in El Paso or on the livestream.\nI am happy to be back in this important border community as  part of my  360 Listening Tour . These ongoing visits to communities throughout the  Dallas Fed’s district help me connect with the people we serve. And each person  I meet shares insights that deepen my understanding of the local and national  economies.\nDuring a visit to the Borderplex area last year, I toured a  maquiladora in Juarez that specializes in medical equipment. At the time,  official data had not yet indicated any increase in foreign direct investment  in Mexico as a result of nearshoring. But leading up to the visit, I was  hearing a very different story from our contacts in the area. Factories were  opening, new business opportunities were arising, and there was a lot of  commercial interest in the area. En route to the maquiladora, I saw this growth  firsthand: active maquiladoras, new construction and price adjustments on  existing properties that clearly signaled growing demand. Although the official  statistics didn’t yet show this trend, there was no denying what we could see  in real time.\nThat direct observation, inspired by what we’d heard from  local contacts, is just one example of how on-the-ground insights improve the  Fed’s understanding of the economy and our thinking about policy. I bring those  perspectives with me to Washington for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  meetings where we set monetary policy for the United States.\nOur goal today, as always, is to hear your perspectives on  the economy, but today’s event is special in one way. Besides being part of my  ongoing listening tour, this gathering is part of the national Fed Listens  initiative and will contribute to the ongoing  five-year review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools  and communications—what we call our monetary policy framework.  I’d like to begin with a few thoughts on that framework to frame our  discussion. As always, these views are not necessarily those of my FOMC  colleagues.\nOne of the Fed’s five  statutory functions is to carry out monetary policy to pursue two goals  established by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. Monetary  policy influences the economy gradually, over time, and its effects depend in  part on how families and businesses expect monetary policy to evolve in the  future. For example, if you’re deciding whether to buy a car or house or invest  in a business, your decision probably depends not only on how the economy looks  today but also on your expectations for the future. How secure will your job  be? How much will it pay? How much demand will there be for your company’s  products? And those long-term economic outcomes in turn depend partly on future  monetary policy.\nSo, to achieve the best long-run outcomes with monetary  policy, the FOMC must act for the long term. We must have a clear strategy and  follow it over time. We must communicate that strategy effectively, so the  public knows what we’re doing and what to expect. And we must use our tools  well, so that we can actually implement the strategy. The monetary policy  framework allows us to operate strategically in that way.\nThe FOMC first formally established its monetary policy  framework in a statement issued in 2012. Many elements of the framework have been constant since then,  in keeping with our long-run approach to policymaking. For example, the initial  framework established our long-run price stability goal of a 2 percent  inflation rate as measured by the price index for personal consumption  expenditures. That goal remains firmly established today. Communicating it  helps anchor long-run inflation expectations at the 2 percent target and  reinforces price stability.\nThe initial framework also established that the complex,  dynamic nature of the labor market means we can’t specify a fixed, numeric goal  for maximum employment. Rather, we must assess labor market conditions in a  more nuanced way. And the initial framework emphasized the importance of the  FOMC’s firm commitment to our Congressional dual mandate and of communicating  clearly with the public—both to make policy effective and to foster  transparency and democratic accountability. All of those points, too, remain  firmly established.\nHowever, while the monetary policy framework is a long-run  framework, it is not an immutable framework. The structure of the economy  changes over time, and the framework needs to adjust periodically to reflect  both those economic changes and the FOMC’s ongoing learning about which policy  approaches are most effective. For that reason, we review the framework every  five years to consider what updates may be needed.\nThe current version of the framework was written  in 2019 and 2020 , and it reflects the challenges of that time. Following  the Global Financial Crisis, the United States experienced close to a decade of  low growth, low interest rates, and below-target inflation that responded only  weakly to gains in employment. Drawing on that experience, the framework  adopted five years ago emphasized judging the labor market based on shortfalls  of employment relative to the maximum level and making up for past low  inflation by allowing inflation to temporarily overshoot the target.\nWe are now in a higher-rate environment, and the  postpandemic experience provides ample evidence of the potential for inflation  to surge far above target. So while we should remain willing to forcefully use  all available tools in scenarios of low rates and low inflation, I believe we  should also make the monetary policy framework robust to a wider range of  scenarios. Regarding inflation, it seems more appropriate to me to focus on  achieving our inflation target going forward, rather than trying to make up for  past shortfalls of inflation. In the labor market, I am inclined to pay more  attention to increases of employment above the maximum sustainable level, not  just shortfalls from that level. And I believe that, to help the public  understand how policymakers think about a range of possible environments, the  FOMC should consider how our communications can better convey key risks and  uncertainties and how monetary policy would respond to them.\nThis year’s framework review has three main elements: a  research conference held last month at the Federal Reserve Board, ongoing  deliberations at FOMC meetings and Fed Listens events such as this one. Public  dialogue like today’s is particularly important given the Federal Reserve  System’s structure.\nIn remarks last week in Waco, I discussed two unique elements of the Fed’s structure that  are crucial to how we serve you. The Fed is not one centralized organization  but rather a federated system with deep local roots. And in our monetary policy  responsibilities, the Fed operates independently while remaining accountable to  the public through elected leaders. Let me say more about each of those  characteristics and how they relate to the framework review and today’s  meeting.\nThe Fed consists of a Board of Governors in Washington as  well as 12 regional reserve banks, the one I lead in Dallas and 11 others, that  serve districts around the United States. As I mentioned at the start, this  network of operations gives us insight into communities’ unique economic  circumstances. That helps the Fed make the best economic decisions to serve the  country as a whole. And because each reserve bank is a separate corporation  with its own board of directors representing the public in the district, the  people of the region have a direct say in how we do our work and can hold us  accountable for ensuring your voices are heard in the national conversation.\nTurning to monetary policy, to have a sustainably strong  economy, a central bank has to make decisions with the long run in mind. In the  short run, a central bank could juice employment by cutting interest rates.  People might enjoy that for a little while, but over time, excessive rate cuts  would trigger a spiral of inflation. And those rising prices would wipe out  whatever temporary benefits people experienced from a hot labor market.\nCongress designed the Federal Reserve System to promote that  long-term focus while maintaining ultimate accountability to the public.  Members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the president and confirmed  by the Senate to serve 14-year terms. Reserve bank presidents, like me, are  appointed to five-year terms by our local boards of directors, with approval by  the Board of Governors. All of us serve together on the FOMC, and the long  terms for our roles allow us to think about which policies will best serve the  country over time.\nBut while the Fed’s leaders aren’t up for election, we  remain accountable to the public for achieving our assigned monetary policy  goals. That accountability comes through the Fed chair’s regular, semiannual  testimony to Congress, our extensive public dialogue and communications, and  ultimately through the regular turnover of governors and reserve bank  presidents as terms are completed and new leaders are appointed.\nToday’s conversation deepens the Fed’s local roots and  contributes to our independence coupled with accountability. It is your  opportunity to tell us how our monetary policy decisions affect you and your  communities, what economic concerns you think we should focus on, how you judge  the performance of our strategy over the past five years, and what strategic  approach you think we should take in the future. Your experiences and insights  will complement the data and models we analyze and help us form a more complete  picture of how the economy is working for the people we serve.\nOur participants today represent a wide range of critical  perspectives: nonprofit service providers, education, workforce development,  economic development, local philanthropy and business. Many thanks to all of  you who made the time to be here today and share your views.\nLorie K. Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Opening Remarks for Technology-Enabled Disruption: Lessons from the Pandemic and the Path Ahead\nOctober 4, 2022 Good morning and thank you all for joining us for the second  day of our conference on technology-enabled disruption. This conference series started in 2018 as a collaboration  between the Atlanta, Dallas and Richmond Federal Reserve Banks. The vision for  the conference series was to bring together business leaders, academics,  educators and policymakers to explore the implications of technology-enabled  disruption for business, labor markets and, ultimately, monetary policy from a  variety of angles. This model has proven remarkably effective, and we are  delighted to be able to do the event in person again this year. The broad theme of the conference series is to consider how  technological change—driven primarily by innovations in  information technology—is playing a disruptive role in economic life. Past  installments, as well as yesterday’s sessions, have focused mainly on how  technological change is disrupting existing business models and the broader macroeconomy.  We have also made a point of hearing from educators and others involved in  workforce development to better understand how education and training  infrastructure needs to evolve to meet the needs of the future. One theme we explored in the first conferences was the  disconnect between the seemingly rapid pace of technological change and the  disappointing pace of measured productivity growth. That puzzle has yet to be  resolved. Yesterday, we learned that the surge in productivity that we saw  during the pandemic did not herald a new age of faster productivity growth but  rather was just a temporary deviation. Another topic of conversation at the  earlier conferences was the disruptive potential of online education. I think  we all learned during the pandemic that although online education has a role to  play, it remains a poor substitute for in-class instruction for many students. Today, we’ll get to look at disruption in an area that’s  been a significant focus for me over many years—namely financial services. Across a range of areas, technology is allowing the  financial system to move faster, to serve new customers, but also to take on  some new risks. During the pandemic, there was a big shift from cash to digital  payments as more transactions were conducted online. [1] Trading in crypto assets has grown substantially and brought with it a range of  new use cases as well as growing operational, crime and other risks. More  central banks are experimenting with digital currencies. These developments pose important challenges for public  policy. Well-designed improvements in financial technology have the potential  to reduce frictions and make the financial system work better for all. For  example, modernized payments systems can allow people and  firms to move money faster, more securely and at lower cost both within the country and  across borders. These improvements can have benefits all across the  spectrum of income and wealth. Better cross-border payments are obviously  useful for multinational corporations and can equally help immigrants send  remittances to their families. But it’s crucial that technological improvements are, in  fact, well-designed. The computer scientist Bruce Schneier published an insightful essay last week in  the New York Times about the perverse incentives around security in new  technologies. [2] He  pointed out that a start-up must focus on growing rapidly by providing the  features its potential customers want before funding runs out or a competitor  captures the market. As a result, security takes a back seat, and before long,  the company may be serving millions of customers but without the security  needed to protect them from hacking, fraud or worse. Moreover, once the service  is under heavy use, it’s difficult to rebuild it more securely, and there may  be little commercial incentive to do so if the security flaws aren’t readily  visible. Schneier’s essay was about technology start-ups in general,  but I’d note that these incentive problems are particularly severe in financial  services and payments where network externalities increase the pressure on new  entrants to quickly gain market share. And while Schneier focused on security,  I’d argue that these incentive problems apply just as much to operational  resilience. Of course, innovation does not take place in a vacuum.  Regulations establish the playing field on which innovators compete and the  standards they must uphold. So there is a crucial role for public policy in  creating an environment where technological innovation in finance and payments  can thrive, but thrive responsibly. President Biden’s executive order on digital assets earlier  this year emphasized the need for responsible innovation, and I was encouraged  to see the Treasury Department’s recent release of three reports studying these  issues, as well as the Financial Stability Oversight  Council’s release of a report yesterday. The reports address the future of  money and payments; the implications of digital assets for consumers, investors  and businesses; illicit financing risks; financial stability risks and  regulatory gaps. Across the reports, there is a recognition that opportunities  exist for digital assets to improve the U.S. financial and payments system, but  that these opportunities come with significant risks and challenges that public  policy must address. I’d like to talk briefly about the considerations on money  and payments in particular. There are three broad strands of innovation in  payments globally. First, both the public and private sectors are developing  faster payments systems. The Fed will launch our FedNow service between May and  July of next year, providing broad access to instant payments and complementing  private sector innovations. Second, as I mentioned earlier, some central banks are  experimenting with CBDCs [central bank digital currency]. In the U.S., no  decision has been made on whether to create a CBDC, and the Federal Reserve has  indicated that issuance of a CBDC would need clear support from the executive  branch and Congress. Treasury’s recent report highlights that extensive further  research is needed. Key design choices affect a CBDC’s efficiency as a means of  payment; its accessibility to consumers, especially those who currently struggle  to access the financial system; its influence on the United States’ role in global  finance; and the risks it may pose to national security, such as through  illicit transactions, or to financial stability, such as through the potential  for destabilizing runs. Additionally, it is important to assess what benefits a  CBDC could bring over and above the benefits of faster payments through FedNow. Third, amid the overall growth of digital assets, the  private sector has invented an array of stablecoins. If these assets’ value is  indeed safe and stable, they have the potential to serve as a form of private  money—that is, a unit of account, store of value and medium of exchange. But  safety and stability are not automatic, as the high-profile collapses of some  algorithmic stablecoins have demonstrated. Even asset-backed stablecoins may  fluctuate significantly in value if the assets backing them are not  sufficiently safe or liquid, and the potential for these fluctuations can in  turn lead to destabilizing runs and fire sales. Some jurisdictions are  considering ways to bring stablecoins inside the regulatory perimeter as banks or other licensed  entities, potentially creating the ability to back stablecoins with  central bank reserves. But as I’ve discussed elsewhere, this could drive large  and variable demand for central bank liabilities or could change the incentives  created by the monetary policy implementation framework, and it is important to  take a holistic approach to these decisions. [3] This morning, we will explore how the fintech industry has  adapted and grown in the wake of the pandemic. The shift to remote work, social  distancing and online retailing in 2020 accelerated trends in payments that  were already in place before the pandemic, as I noted earlier. These changes raise  important policy questions. The cash economy is accessible to all, but digital  payments are less so. What progress has been made to make digital payments as  inclusive as cash, and what further steps need to be taken? Does the shift to  digital payments have implications for access to consumer credit, especially  among those communities that have not historically had a strong relationship  with the traditional financial sector? How should we think about balancing the  risks and benefits from digital innovation in payments and finance? Finally, let me thank our colleagues at the Richmond and  Atlanta Feds for working with us on this conference series and the Atlanta Fed  for hosting us this year. I look forward to our discussions this morning. Thank  you all again for joining us.

    "text": "Efficient and effective central bank balance sheets\nFebruary 25, 2025\nThank you, Vicky  [Saporta], for the kind introduction. And thank you to the Bank of England  for inviting me to participate in this important conference.\nThe experience of the past two decades profoundly changed  how central banks think about both sides of our balance sheets. On the asset  side, central banks learned to use asset purchases to provide economic stimulus  at the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates, as well as to  support smooth market functioning when stresses threatened financial stability.  On the opposite side of the ledger, asset purchases drove large increases in  central bank liabilities, specifically bank reserves, making liquidity abundant  or ample rather than scarce in most financial systems.\nExperience has shown that ample liquidity provides ample  benefits for financial stability, payments and monetary policy implementation. Central  banks are now pursuing strategies to maintain those benefits even as the runoff  of pandemic-era assets reduces the size of their balance sheets.\nAt times, the diversity of names and tools for these  strategies can make it seem as if central banks disagree on the fundamentals of  how to proceed. People talk about demand-driven and supply-driven floors, ample  and abundant reserves, zero corridors and wider corridors and more. But  underneath this cacophony of details, I believe central banks are applying  shared and well-founded principles for how their balance sheets should work.  The surface differences, to my mind, reflect central banks’ natural adaptation to  unique characteristics of the financial systems in which they operate.\nIn the rest of my remarks, I’ll lay out the shared  principles as I see them and highlight their implications for the Federal  Reserve’s balance sheet. I’ll focus primarily on liabilities before turning to  assets at the end. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of  my Fed colleagues.\nTwo principles\nI propose that in employing our balance sheets to accomplish  our missions, central banks should adhere to two fundamental principles. We  should be efficient. And we should be effective.\nYou may recall hearing those ideas from the Fed before. Back  in 2014, long before adopting our current implementation framework, the FOMC  said it aimed to “hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary  policy efficiently and effectively.” [1] We’ve repeated that idea  in subsequent statements. [2] Today, I’ll examine  efficiency and effectiveness as broad principles for central banks, beyond the  context of any one Fed policy decision.\nTo some, the principles I’ve offered may sound so obvious as  to mean nothing. Who could want a central bank to be inefficient or  ineffective? But I’ll argue that these principles have a great deal of  meaning. They provide substantial guidance about the design of central bank  balance sheets, and they create a clear framework for understanding central  banks’ choices. I’ll consider each principle in turn.\nEfficiency\nBy efficiency, I mean allocative or Pareto efficiency. The  central bank should design its balance sheet in such a way that no adjustment  could make someone better off (in the economy the central bank serves) without  simultaneously making someone else worse off (again, in the economy the central  bank serves).\nAllocative efficiency requires setting the price of  resources equal to their social marginal cost. Let’s apply that idea to central  bank liabilities, specifically, reserves. From the perspective of a commercial  bank considering how many reserves to hold, the price of reserves is the spread  between money market interest rates and whatever rate the central bank pays on  reserves. That is, when money market rates exceed interest on reserves, the  commercial bank pays an opportunity cost in foregone interest to hold reserves.\nThe central bank’s marginal cost of supplying reserves is  typically small. Reserves are an electronic entry on the central bank’s books.  No paper currency needs to be produced.\nSo, as I have argued previously, efficiency calls for money  market rates to land close to the interest rate on reserves. [3] If money market rates  exceed interest on reserves, banks experience inefficient pressure to economize  on reserves, the most liquid asset in the financial system. That increases  financial stability risks and can gum up the flow of payments. The opposite problem  occurs when interest on reserves exceeds market rates. Typically, only a  limited set of financial institutions, such as banks, can hold reserves. Other  financial institutions must hold their liquidity in other instruments, such as  repurchase agreements (repos) or short-dated government securities. When these  instruments pay less interest than reserves, the cost of liquidity is  inefficiently higher for non-banks.\nElsewhere, I’ve described the idea of keeping money market  rates near interest on reserves as a Friedman rule for interest-bearing  reserves. [4] There’s more than one way  to achieve this configuration of rates. A central bank can estimate the  quantity of reserves that would meet banks’ demand with market rates near  interest on reserves, then acquire sufficient assets to supply that quantity.  Or, like the Bank of England, a central bank can offer to lend reserves at the  same interest rate it pays on its deposit facility—letting banks take down  however many reserves they demand. Likewise, if an excessive supply of reserves  pushes money market rates below interest on reserves, a central bank can drain  liquidity and bring rates back up by reducing its asset holdings. Or, as with  the Fed’s Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement Facility, a central bank can  offer to absorb liquidity from market participants ineligible for interest on  reserves.\nThe optimal choices among these tactics may depend on the  specifics of a central bank’s environment, such as its counterparties, how  liquidity flows between those counterparties and other firms, the  counterparties’ willingness to borrow from central bank facilities, the central  bank’s institutional authorities, and the exogenous influences on reserve  supply and demand.\nBut, again, those choices are tactical. The strategic  decision is where to position interest on reserves relative to money market  rates. And when I look across major central banks, it seems to me our  approaches are fundamentally similar. We all aim to keep money market rates  close to interest on reserves, which is the efficient arrangement.\nYou may have noticed that I said efficiency calls for money  market rates to settle close to interest on reserves, not  necessarily equal to interest on reserves. Technical factors can  appropriately create small spreads between different money market instruments.  For example, the repo market in the U.S. has several segments. [5] Small rate spreads between  segments can reflect participants’ market power or transactions’ non-price  terms. No amount of reserve supply can compress these spreads to zero, nor  could the interest rate on reserves match all the different repo rates at once.\nSimilarly, even in an efficient configuration, temporary  frictions such as those often seen on statement dates could cause short-lived  rate movements. Such fluctuations aren’t necessarily inefficient. Suppressing  them could require supplying so many reserves as to push money market rates materially  below interest on reserves the rest of the year.\nThe cost of supplying reserves also may not be exactly zero.  Yesterday’s keynote speaker, Annette Vissing-Jorgensen, has pointed out that if  a central bank backs its liabilities with assets that carry a scarcity premium,  removing those assets from circulation is costly. [6] I’d note, though, and  I’ll return to this later, that the cost depends on whether the supply of such  assets can grow.\nSome observers have objected to keeping money market rates  close to interest on reserves, saying this suppresses trading in the interbank  money market. In the face of unexpected payment shocks, an active interbank  market helps the private sector redistribute funds across banks. By comparison,  without an interbank market, the central bank may intermediate more of that  redistribution through its deposit and lending facilities. Policy preferences  can differ about the desirability of trading off a smaller central bank  footprint against the spread of market rates over interest on reserves, and the  resulting inefficiency, that would be needed to incentivize active interbank  trading.\nWhile that’s an interesting philosophical discussion, I  don’t see much of a practical argument for the U.S., at least. When the U.S.  banking system has excess reserves, they tend to accumulate at the largest  money-center banks. The regulations applicable to such banks disincentivize  unsecured lending to other banks. As a result, only very large spreads between  money market rates and interest on reserves would likely suffice to revive the  U.S. interbank market—and that would be very inefficient. [7]\nNor would an active interbank market improve banks’  resilience to liquidity stress. Making liquidity artificially scarce and then  giving banks lots of practice managing that scarcity is riskier and less  efficient than avoiding scarcity in the first place. And there are plenty of  other ways that banks can maintain operational readiness to exercise their  liquidity tools.\nEffectiveness\nI’ll now turn to my second principle, effectiveness. A  central bank’s tools must reliably transmit the stance of policy to money  market rates and the economy. Researchers have debated how exactly to define effectiveness. [8] Is it about the  dispersion of rates within or across money markets? Volatility over time?  Robustness under stress? Transmission to broader markets? The answer to that  technical question may differ across financial systems. For purposes of  principles, it suffices to say that effective implementation keeps money market  rates close to the policy target.\nA central bank can influence market rates through its  balance sheet in two main ways. One approach supplies a limited quantity of  reserves, so that reserves carry a liquidity premium and market rates  significantly exceed interest on reserves. The banking system then typically  lands on a steep portion of the aggregate demand curve for reserves. The  central bank achieves its policy target by increasing or decreasing reserve  supply to intersect the appropriate point on the demand curve. In the  alternative approach, the central bank makes the supply of reserves ample  enough to eliminate the liquidity premium—the efficient configuration I  described with my first principle. The banking system then typically lands on a  relatively flat portion of the aggregate demand curve for reserves. Small  changes in reserves supply don’t substantially move money market rates in that  environment. Instead, the central bank moves money market rates primarily by  adjusting the interest rate on liabilities such as reserves.\nBefore the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), scarce-reserves  systems provided effective rate control for the Fed and many other central  banks. And systems with ample reserves have proven effective in controlling  rates more recently.\nWhile it remains conceptually possible to implement monetary  policy today with scarce reserves, developments since the GFC would complicate  the task of fine-tuning reserve supply to hit a point on the steep portion of  the demand curve. Changes in regulations and banks’ own risk management have  made reserve demand larger, more volatile and more difficult to predict. In the  U.S., fiscal flows also create more reserve volatility than previously.\nThe ample-reserves regime simplifies rate control because  fluctuations in reserve supply and demand don’t require frequent and precise  offsetting central bank actions. You might say this makes the ample-reserves  regime efficient for a second reason. Not only does it avoid the inefficiencies  associated with a liquidity premium on reserves, but it also saves some  forecasting and operational effort. The ample regime requires gradual  forecasting and operations to approximately track demand for central bank  liabilities over periods of months and years. The scarce-reserves regime requires  the much heavier lift of actively managing reserve supply on a daily basis to  precisely match demand.\nAmple-reserves regimes are sometimes called “floor systems,”  because when reserve supply is large enough, the main influence on market rates  is the floor established under them by interest on reserves.\nBut the “floor system” name can give a misleading impression  of how these regimes work. Even in a floor system, central bank lending tools —  which put a ceiling on interest rates—retain an important role in  policy implementation.\nCentral banks’ estimates of the quantity of reserves needed  to remain at the floor, though careful, are less than perfectly precise. As a  result, unexpected shortfalls of reserves can sometimes generate upward  pressure on money market rates. Such events arise much less frequently with  ample reserves than scarce reserves—that’s what makes the ample-reserves  approach more effective—but the incidence isn’t zero. So even in an ample-reserves  regime, reliable ceiling tools remain indispensable, at minimum as a backstop  against mistaken estimates, and potentially as a routine source of reserve  supply. Indeed, many central banks plan to routinely employ one or more ceiling  tools in their long-run implementation frameworks. While these tools’ designs  vary in response to local needs, the common principle is that they make policy  implementation more effective.\nThe Fed’s ceiling tools include the discount window, the  Standing Repo Facility (SRF), and the Foreign and International Monetary  Authorities Repo Facility, as well as the Open Market Trading Desk’s capacity  to conduct discretionary repo operations.\nAlthough these tools are time tested and have often worked  well, I believe we could further enhance their efficacy.\nThe discount window is flexible and robust, capable of  lending to banks against a very broad range of collateral throughout the day. For  this reason, I believe every bank in the United States should make sure it is  operationally ready to access the window. Banks have increased their  operational readiness since the 2023 stresses, but readiness should be a  continuing effort, not a one-time project. And it needs to be a partnership  between borrowers and lenders. At the Federal Reserve Banks, we are considering  how we can most efficiently serve our customers when they come to borrow. The  Board of Governors recently completed a Request for Information on discount  window operations. [9] I’m optimistic that feedback will help us support enhanced readiness,  particularly by considering more automation, extended hours of operation,  faster communications with depository institutions and interoperability with  other secured lending sources.\nTurning to the SRF and other open market operations that  provide liquidity, the Fed’s tools will function most effectively if they  innovate alongside the markets in which we participate. The Desk experimented  with morning SRF operations over year end and has announced an upcoming  small-value test of capabilities for morning settlements. [10] And as the U.S. repo  market continues to shift toward central clearing, I believe the FOMC should  consider the merits of centrally clearing the SRF as well as other open market  operations. Centrally clearing the Fed’s trades would support the Securities  and Exchange Commission clearing mandate for the private sector. It would also  decrease our counterparties’ cost of intermediating funding to the broader  market.\nTrade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness\nI’ve argued that, at a high level, supplying ample reserves  and positioning money market rates close to interest on reserves is both  efficient and effective. Still, when it comes to the details of implementing  such a regime, central banks can face modest trade-offs between efficiency and  effectiveness.\nThese trade-offs could fill an entire speech, or a book. Today,  I’d like to discuss just one of them, the precise positioning of money market  rates relative to interest on reserves.\nIn the U.S., the volatility of money market rates picks up  noticeably as market rates move above interest on reserves. [11] The increase in  volatility appears to stem largely from frictions in redistributing liquidity  among financial institutions. In this environment, operating with money market  rates close to, but perhaps slightly below, interest on reserves is likely to  provide more effective rate control. In my view, for the U.S. financial system,  bringing market rates all the way up to interest on reserves could reduce  effectiveness while delivering only a minimal improvement in efficiency. [12]\nSome other central banks are planning for money market rates  to converge slightly above interest on reserves. Those central banks operate in  different institutional environments and face different frictions, which can  change the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness and may support a  different configuration of rates than in the U.S.\nAssets\nSo far, I have emphasized the central bank’s liabilities.  Efficiency and effectiveness also apply to the assets backing those  liabilities.\nCentral banks vary greatly in the assets they can hold and  their relationships to fiscal authorities. Hence, asset choices could differ  more than choices about liabilities. I’ll focus my discussion on the U.S. case,  but the principles I’ll apply have broad relevance.\nThe FOMC has said it intends to hold primarily Treasury  securities in the long run. [13] This approach leaves  open two questions: Are some Treasury securities more efficient or effective to  hold than others? And, against the backdrop of a primarily Treasury portfolio,  might efficiency or effectiveness call for holding modest amounts of other assets?\nWe can think about the composition of Treasury holdings from  the perspective of the Fed’s balance sheet alone or from the perspective of the  consolidated government balance sheet.\nConsidering only the Fed’s balance sheet, efficiency  considerations counsel against holding Treasury securities that are in  particularly scarce supply. For example, the Fed has usually limited its  holdings of any one security and avoided buying in-demand securities such as  those that are newly issued or cheapest to deliver into futures contracts. If  long-term Treasury securities have a special liquidity premium, efficiency  could also suggest steering away from holding them—but, as I will discuss in a  moment, the consolidated government perspective undoes this conclusion.\nEffectiveness, meanwhile, suggests the Fed should structure  asset holdings so they normally remain in the background and do not distract  from our primary monetary policy tool, the overnight rate target. While  fluctuations in net income do not affect the Fed’s ability to conduct monetary  policy, they can become a communications challenge. Roughly matching the  duration of our assets and liabilities would reduce these fluctuations and  could, thus, enhance the effectiveness of policy communications. The Fed’s liabilities  consist primarily of currency, which pays zero interest and has very long  duration, and reserves, which pay a floating rate and have zero duration.  Asset-liability matching thus suggests holding a mix of short-term and  long-term securities. A portfolio that’s neutral relative to the outstanding  Treasury universe would be one way to approximate this.\nSome observers argue that tilting the portfolio toward  shorter-duration assets would provide flexibility that could enhance  effectiveness. Short-dated assets can run off to rapidly reduce reserve supply.  Or the central bank can trade them for longer-dated assets to absorb duration  and influence term premiums without expanding reserve supply. These forms of  flexibility were valuable in the pre-GFC scarce-reserves implementation regime,  in which we needed to maintain precise control of reserve supply. And, indeed,  we tilted the Fed’s portfolio toward Treasury bills in that regime. But the  ample-reserves regime reduces the need for precise control of reserve supply.  Our balance sheet has also grown, so even a neutral portfolio would now contain  a substantial dollar quantity of Treasury bills. In the current regime, then, I  don’t think tilting the steady-state portfolio toward short-dated assets would  materially enhance effectiveness.\nImportantly, Treasury securities the Fed holds as assets are  liabilities for the Treasury Department. They cancel out on the consolidated government  balance sheet. As a result, the consolidated perspective can shed a different  light on what’s efficient and effective. Let me give a simple example. Suppose  securities of a certain duration have a particular liquidity value in the  market. You might think it’s inefficient for the Fed to hold such securities,  since the market values them highly. However, the Treasury could conceivably  issue more such securities to meet the market’s demand. So, from a consolidated  perspective, the Fed’s actions aren’t the sole determinant of efficiency.\nIn the U.S., the Fed sets monetary policy while Congress and  the Treasury determine the fiscal costs taxpayers support. One of those fiscal  costs comes from the duration risk associated with potential interest rate  fluctuations on government debt. The Treasury determines the maturity structure  of the consolidated government debt and the associated duration risk. When certain  securities have a particular liquidity value, for example, Treasury decides  whether to supply more of them, taking account of how this action would affect  taxpayers’ exposure to duration risk.\nIf Treasury can offset what the Fed holds, does the  consolidated perspective imply anything at all for the Fed’s asset choices? I  think it does. In practice, Treasury keeps its issuance regular and predictable  to foster an attractive market for investors. Given this approach, I believe  the most appropriate strategy for the Fed is to likewise be predictable by  purchasing a neutral mix of durations relative to whatever mix Treasury chooses  to issue. Then there is nothing for Treasury to offset. The Fed-only perspective  also suggested a neutral portfolio. My bottom line, then, is that from both  angles, in the U.S., a neutral portfolio would be efficient and effective.\nAt present, the Fed’s portfolio is significantly overweight  longer-term securities and underweight Treasury bills. Our reinvestments of  maturing securities represent a small fraction of the portfolio. And when we  eventually reach an efficient level of reserves and need to begin expanding the  portfolio in line with growth in demand for our liabilities, those purchases  will also be small relative to existing holdings. In this context, it could  take many years to reach a neutral mix of holdings by structuring our purchases to be proportional to issuance. So although I view a neutral mix of purchases  relative to issuance as appropriate in the long run, it would make sense in the  medium term to overweight purchases of shorter-dated securities so as to more  promptly return the Fed’s holdings to a neutral allocation.\nFinally, while securities represent nearly all the Fed’s  assets, we’ve always held small quantities of other assets, such as discount  window loans and repos. Loans also feature prominently among the assets of  other central banks.\nIn the long term, in my view, it could be interesting to  consider whether allocating a modest share of the Fed’s long-run balance sheet  to loans or repos could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of policy  implementation. For example, auctioning a fixed quantity of discount window  loans each day could encourage banks’ operational readiness and demonstrate  that borrowing is a normal activity for healthy firms. [14]\nSuch a facility might also smooth the redistribution of  reserves around the banking system. The U.S. has about 9,000 banks and credit  unions. Unexpected payment shocks can leave some of them short of reserves at  the same time as others have a surplus. Frictions in interbank lending may slow  the movement of reserves to whichever banks need them most. But if the Fed held  a daily lending auction, the depository institutions most in need of reserves  on any given day would likely place the highest bids, automatically  redistributing liquidity away from firms with less need.\nLet me just strongly emphasize that the FOMC is not  considering any changes to its implementation framework, and even beginning to  consider such a tool would require substantial conversation, analysis and  learning from the experience of other central banks.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, central banks naturally design their balance  sheets and policy implementation frameworks to reflect institutional features  of the jurisdictions in which they operate. The resulting frameworks vary on  the surface, but there are commonalities in the underlying policy principles.  I’ve argued today that central bank balance sheets should be efficient and  effective. Those twin principles imply keeping money market rates close to the  interest rate on reserves, supplying ample reserves and maintaining strong  ceiling or lending tools. I find it heartening that central banks around the  world have converged on these fundamental approaches, and I hope we will  continue to learn from one another, as we have done the past two days.\nThank you.\nNotes\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Opening remarks for panel titled ‘The increasing role of nonbank institutions in  the Treasury and money markets’\nMay 19, 2025\nIt’s a pleasure to be back at this excellent conference.  Thank you, Raphael  [Bostic], for inviting me. And thank you to the organizers for putting  together this panel of expert speakers:\nI’m looking forward to a rich discussion.\nOur topic this afternoon is a timely one: the role of  nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) in Treasury and money markets. Before we  jump in, I’d like to offer a few remarks to frame the conversation. As always,  these are my views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nThe Treasury market and money markets sit at the very core  of the financial system. The Treasury market finances the U.S. government,  provides a safe and liquid asset relied on by investors worldwide, and creates  a benchmark for broader long-term interest rates. Money markets establish  overnight risk-free interest rates that are building blocks for all other asset  prices, they keep credit flowing through the economy by financing a wide range  of assets, and they are where the Fed implements the stance of monetary policy.  And these markets are tightly linked because one of the main money markets is  the repo market, where Treasury securities are financed.\nThese markets are extraordinarily strong, deep and liquid,  as befits their systemic role. But they are not invulnerable. Observers have  cited potential fault lines including limited intermediation capacity, buildups  of leverage and uneven risk management.\nWhen economic shocks occur, market participants often seek  to transfer large amounts of risk and raise large amounts of liquidity in  Treasury and money markets. Such a surge in demand for intermediation requires  an elastic supply of intermediation. Yet since the Global Financial Crisis, the  balance sheet capacity of bank-affiliated dealers has not kept pace with growth  in the amount of Treasury securities outstanding. So there is the potential—as  we saw, for example, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic—for the demand for  intermediation to overwhelm the supply of intermediation and create market  dysfunction.\nIn principle, approaches to enhancing the resilience of  intermediation capacity could address both banks and nonbanks. I’m sure our  panelists and I could fill an entire session with ideas on bank intermediation.  But our focus today is going to be the rest of the market: the nonbanks. I’m  looking forward to a robust discussion of the state of Treasury intermediation  by NBFIs and what can be done to strengthen it.\nExcessive leverage can amplify challenges from  insufficiently elastic intermediation in stress episodes. Perhaps precisely  because repo markets ordinarily function so well and Treasury securities are so  safe and liquid, it is possible for NBFIs to obtain large amounts of leverage  against them. Yet levered positions can be prone to unwind rapidly, adding to  intermediation demands. Buildups of NBFI leverage in trades such as the  cash-futures basis can, therefore, be cause for concern if the risks are not  managed appropriately. Some observers had voiced worries about such a buildup  earlier this year, so it was reassuring to see that the basis trade did not  materially amplify the market volatility we experienced in early April.\nStrong risk management mitigates vulnerabilities from  leverage, and the Securities and Exchange Commission mandate for broader  central clearing marks an important step to strengthen risk management in the  Treasury cash and repo markets. Data collected by the Office of Financial  Research shows that a large fraction of noncentrally cleared bilateral repos  are conducted  with no haircut . In some circumstances, other components of a cash  borrower’s portfolio may effectively provide the margin on these trades. But  that is not always the case. And repos that are margined on a portfolio basis  could be more difficult to move to different counterparties in times of stress.  Broader central clearing will ensure risk management is stronger, more uniform  and therefore more resilient.\nIn our conversation today, I’ll be interested to hear how  our panelists think the transition to broader clearing is proceeding and how  it’s influencing the overall structure and resilience of the market. I hope we  can also explore other ideas to enhance risk management, such as the recent proposal on best practices from the Treasury Market Practices Group.\nLastly, as my Fed colleague Roberto Perli, manager of the  System Open Market Account, noted in a recent speech, resilient funding liquidity makes the market as a whole more resilient. A  strong Federal Reserve monetary policy implementation framework forms an  important part of that resilience by ensuring ample liquidity will remain  available across money markets at rates within or near the target range for the  fed funds rate. In my view, rate control is not just about keeping the fed  funds rate in the target range. The fed funds market is small. And the FOMC’s  desired stance of monetary policy must transmit smoothly into larger and  broader markets—especially the repo market.\nThe Fed’s rate control framework has two main components:  The ample supply of reserves generally keeps money market rates close to the  interest rate on reserve balances. And the standing ceiling facilities—the  discount window, the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) and the Foreign and International  Monetary Authorities (FIMA) repo facility—help prevent rate spikes in the event  of large, unexpected shocks to reserve supply, demand or distribution.\nThe ceiling tools have proven their effectiveness over time.  However, I see some opportunities to strengthen them further.\nDepository institutions have greatly improved their operational readiness to borrow from the discount window. We should continue to reinforce the value of operational readiness so firms maintain these gains. And readiness is a partnership. At the Federal Reserve Banks, we are working to enhance our capacity to serve customers efficiently when they come to borrow, drawing on feedback received through a recent Request for Information by the Board of Governors. We should also continue to emphasize that borrowing from the window is an appropriate way for healthy banks to meet short-term funding needs—not something investors, ratings agencies or supervisors should criticize or question.\nWe can also enhance the SRF. As Roberto described in his  recent speech, experiments and market outreach by the New York Fed’s Open  Market Trading Desk have found that conducting and settling the SRF operation  in the morning, in addition to the current afternoon timing, makes the facility  more effective by addressing intraday funding needs. I’m pleased that, as  Roberto announced earlier this month, the Desk plans to soon introduce regular  early-settlement SRF operations.\nCentral clearing of SRF operations would also make the  facility more attractive and enhance rate control. That’s because central  clearing would allow bank-affiliated dealers to net down their balance sheets  when they borrow from the SRF and lend onward to other firms. Desk outreach has  found that the lack of netting is one of several reasons why counterparties  currently report high hurdle rates for borrowing from the SRF, along with  reporting requirements and supervisory considerations. I’d also note that, although  the SEC’s clearing mandate does not apply to the Fed, centrally clearing Fed  operations on a voluntary basis would align with and support the market  transition. I’ll be interested to hear our panelists’ perspectives on how to  make the Fed’s tools as effective as possible.\nWith that, let’s turn to our conversation. I’d like to start  with the big picture. How did markets, and especially non-bank participants,  handle the high volatility and large flows in early April? And what’s the  outlook for NBFIs in the years ahead? Deirdre, I’ll ask you to start with your  view on Treasury markets, and then we’ll turn to Lou for an assessment of money  markets.\nLorie K. Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Ample liquidity for a safe and efficient banking system\nOctober 31, 2025\nGood morning. Thank you all for joining us again today. Yesterday’s discussions were so enriching, and I’m excited to build on them this morning.\nAs you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced interest rates earlier this week and announced it would end the runoff of the Fed’s asset holdings as of Dec. 1. In my remarks this morning, I’ll discuss the stance of monetary policy. I’ll then turn to the topic of this conference and describe how the Fed’s balance sheet fosters a safe and efficient liquidity environment for the U.S. banking system. These are my views and not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\nMonetary policy\nI would have preferred to hold interest rates steady at this week’s FOMC meeting. Congress gave the FOMC a dual mandate: to pursue maximum employment and stable prices. The labor market remains balanced and cooling slowly. Inflation remains too high, taxing the budgets of businesses and families, and appears likely to exceed the FOMC’s 2 percent target for too much longer. This economic outlook didn’t call for cutting rates.\nWhile the government shutdown has reduced the availability of national statistics, a wide range of alternative data sources continue to provide visibility into the state of the economy. Those sources include private-sector indicators, continuing administrative data such as unemployment claims, regional surveys run by many of the Federal Reserve banks, and the many conversations that my colleagues and I have with business and community contacts every week.\nThe labor market remains roughly balanced. At 4.3 percent, the latest reading on the unemployment rate was up only slightly over the past year on net.\nPayroll job gains fell markedly in 2025. But slow job gains don’t necessarily mean there’s more slack in the labor market. Labor supply has fallen at the same time as demand, particularly due to changes in immigration policy and labor force participation. In consequence, despite the drop in job growth, we’re not seeing a rapidly widening gap between the number of jobs available and the number of people who want work.\nMy staff estimates that break-even payroll growth, the number of net new jobs needed to hold unemployment steady, has fallen to around 30,000 jobs per month . The Bureau of Labor Statistics has delayed its September employment report. However, private-sector data suggest September payroll growth remained near the level that would keep the market in rough balance. Likewise, layoffs and unemployment claims have stayed low, although I’m mindful of recent layoff announcements by some large employers.\nResilient consumer and business spending continues to support employment. Consumer spending growth has slowed from last year, but only to a pace that equals or slightly exceeds the longer-run trend. Stock market gains are fueling wealthier households’ demand. Large companies are investing enthusiastically in artificial intelligence and data centers. The picture for lower-income families and smaller businesses is softer than the aggregate, but it remains stable.\nThe Dallas Fed Weekly Economic Index combines 10 daily and weekly data series to deliver a rapid signal of the state of the economy. It is averaging 2.4 percent. That’s consistent with strong gross domestic product growth in the third quarter.\nThe risks to the labor market do lie mainly to the downside. In this low-hiring environment, the job market could have difficulty absorbing any significant pickup in layoffs from the current low level. Buoyant asset valuations can sometimes snap back without much warning, which might take the wind out of consumer spending. And the federal government shutdown will pose greater risks to economic activity the longer it continues. But these are all risks the FOMC will be able to closely monitor and address promptly if there is evidence they are becoming more likely to materialize.\nTurning to the price stability side of the mandate, inflation is still too high and too slow to return to target. The FOMC targets a 2 percent inflation rate as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. Inflation by that measure exceeded the target in each of the past four years. It’s on track to do so again this year. The index rose 1.8 percent just in the first eight months of the year, and forecasters expect it to end the year up about 2.9 percent.\nWhile inflation has come down significantly from the postpandemic peak, it’s still not convincingly headed all the way back to 2 percent. The Blue Chip Economic Indicators surveys dozens of private-sector forecasters about their economic outlooks. The Blue Chip consensus outlook is for 2.6 percent PCE inflation in 2026 and around 2.4 percent in 2027, followed by fluctuations between 2.1 and 2.2 percent all the way out to at least 2031—never all the way back to target.\nThe FOMC’s 2 percent inflation target is a serious commitment. We’ve reaffirmed it repeatedly, most recently in the “Statement on Longer-run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy” we issued this August. Our obligation to the public is to deliver on this commitment.\nTo be sure, inflation persistently running several tenths above the target is not the emergency that inflation persistently several percentage points above the target would be. And we have an equally serious obligation to pursue maximum employment. The FOMC’s long-run strategy calls for a balanced approach to our two objectives. I carefully weigh the potential labor market costs of measures to reduce inflation. But labor demand and supply remain in balance. The FOMC already mitigated downside risks by cutting rates at its previous meeting, in September. The remaining risks to employment are ones we can monitor closely and respond to if they are becoming more likely to materialize, not ones that currently warrant further preemptive action. For those reasons, I did not see a need to cut rates this week. And I’d find it difficult to cut rates again in December unless there is clear evidence that inflation will fall faster than expected or that the labor market will cool more rapidly.\nBalance sheet normalization\nThe FOMC also decided to stop reducing the Fed’s asset holdings as of Dec. 1, ending a phase of balance sheet normalization that began in mid-2022. In contrast to the action on interest rates, the decision to end asset runoff was one I supported. Money market conditions indicate the Fed’s balance sheet is now much closer to a normal size, following the expansion in response to economic and financial stresses during the pandemic and the subsequent runoff.\nMore than just a return to normal, the reduction in the balance sheet forms part of how the Fed promotes safe and efficient liquidity for our nation’s banks. Of course, the primary responsibility for banks’ funding and liquidity risk management rests with bankers. Still, the Fed’s balance sheet underpins some aspects of bankers’ decisions, and that’s what I’d like to talk with you about today.\nEfficient reserve supply\nThe Fed’s single largest liability, nearly half the balance sheet in total, is bank reserves. U.S. dollar reserves are the safest and most liquid asset in the world. Reserves are assets to the banks that hold them and, correspondingly, liabilities for the Fed. A dollar of reserves is always worth exactly one dollar: no more, no less. Reserves are also the only asset a bank can use immediately to meet a withdrawal or send a payment.\nIf you’re holding a loan to one of your customers, a corporate bond, or even a Treasury bill, you have to sell that asset or borrow against it to get money before you can make a payment. Reserves, by contrast, already are money. You can make a payment with reserves right away. You never have to monetize them first. In normal times, it’s straightforward for healthy banks to borrow against assets to get cash. But when markets come under stress, or when a bank needs to quickly obtain unusual amounts of liquidity, monetizing assets can be more difficult. Reserves help a bank manage its liquidity risk and serve customers efficiently through thick and thin.\nAs authorized by Congress, the Fed pays interest on banks’ reserve holdings. These interest payments have no material cost to taxpayers because, over time, the Fed covers them out of interest earnings on its assets. However, interest on reserves plays a crucial role in the efficiency and safety of the banking system.\nWhen the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB) is close to interest rates on other money market instruments, it doesn’t cost banks anything to hold reserves to meet their liquidity needs. If reserves paid less than market rates, on the other hand, or no interest at all, each dollar of reserve holdings would cost a bank the difference between market rates and IORB. Banks would have a strong incentive to avoid holding reserves.\nThe Fed didn’t pay interest on reserves until 2008, and the old system was inefficient and risky. Because reserves were costly to hold, banks tried to hold as few reserves as possible. With few reserves on hand, banks often throttled outgoing payments until they received incoming money each day. Banks also arranged their business models to reduce regulatory reserve requirements, and then they tried to minimize their actual reserve holdings by lending anything above the regulatory minimums to other banks.\nConsidering that it doesn’t cost the Fed to provide reserves, all those gymnastics represented wasted effort for the economy. And that’s the best case. If costly liquidity held banks back from providing services their customers would have valued, the old system of scarce reserves put a brake on economic growth—for no good reason. Moreover, if banks were taking unnecessary liquidity risk because they avoided holding the safest, most liquid asset in existence, the financial system was more vulnerable to shocks—again, for no good reason.\nSince 2008, the Fed has met banks’ demand for reserves with interest on reserves close to market rates. In 2019, the FOMC decided to continue implementing monetary policy in the long run in this framework of ample reserves. This is, quite simply, a better approach: better for banks, better for the households and businesses that are their customers, and better for the U.S. economy. I’m proud the Fed adopted it, and I’m committed to continuing it.\nIf reserves are so great, why did the FOMC run off asset holdings from 2022 to 2025 and, consequently, also reduce reserve supply? Like I used to tell my kids when we went to the ice cream shop, it’s possible to have too much of a good thing. The FOMC acquired large quantities of assets during the pandemic to support smooth market functioning, sustain the flow of credit and provide economic stimulus. Those purchases helped keep the public health crisis from turning into a financial crisis or recession. But among their side effects was that the purchases made reserves not just ample but abundant or super-abundant—more plentiful, that is, than the quantity banks wanted to hold with market rates near IORB.\nIt’s clear reserve supply exceeded banks’ demand because market interest rates fell significantly below interest on reserves. In 2022, rates on overnight repurchase agreements, or repos, collateralized by Treasury securities ran 10 or more basis points below IORB.\nSupplying too many reserves is just as inefficient as supplying too few reserves. When aggregate reserve supply is too high, the banking system holds reserves instead of more productive assets. And liquidity is too expensive for financial institutions other than banks. To best serve the economy in normal times, the Fed needs to strike a balance and supply an efficient quantity of reserves—neither too many nor too few.\nThe transition to ample reserves\nThere are many indicators of reserve ampleness, but the most significant one to me is the position of money market rates relative to IORB. In an efficient system, market rates should be close to, but perhaps slightly below, interest on reserves on average over time.\n“On average” is key there. Market rates can fluctuate from day to day. Bringing the average level close to IORB also requires some tolerance for modest, temporary moves above IORB.\nThose fluctuations should help, in fact, in returning the Fed’s balance sheet to an efficient size. Many banks have adapted their business models to an environment with more-than-ample reserves and market rates consistently below interest on reserves. These adaptations likely increased the aggregate demand for reserves compared with the prepandemic level. There’s a ratchet effect: To meet banks’ reserve demand in the short run, the Fed now must supply more reserves than it would have previously.\nSince late summer, market rates have risen significantly relative to IORB. The rise in market rates relative to IORB will likely make many banks want to cut back on reserve holdings. There is only so much a bank can do, though, to reduce its reserve needs from one day or week to the next. It takes time to shed unwanted deposits or to adjust the composition of assets and liabilities so the bank needs less immediate liquidity. By sustaining a period of money market rates averaging close to IORB, including some modest, temporary swings higher, the FOMC can give banks the incentive to make longer-term adjustments. In turn, those adjustments will undo the ratchet effect, allowing the FOMC to meet banks’ long-run demand for reserves, rather than the temporarily higher short-run demand. This will let the Fed operate with a smaller, more efficient balance sheet over time while continuing to foster safe and efficient liquidity for the banking system.\nHowever, it is important not to take those incentives too far. Rates averaging above IORB in a sustained way would be inefficient.\nThe FOMC has followed a two-part strategy to help banks adapt and bring the financial system to reserve levels that will be ample in the long run.\nFirst, we reduced reserve supply gradually. After beginning asset runoff in 2022, we twice slowed the pace of runoff to produce a gentler glide path for aggregate reserves. The gradual decline in reserves gave banks more time to change their business models and their own balance sheets during the transition from abundant to ample reserves.\nSecond, the Fed has established strong tools to put a ceiling on money market rates and to provide additional liquidity if needed.\nThe Fed’s ceiling tools\nThe discount window is available every business day to healthy banks, with primary credit offered against a wide range of collateral at an interest rate equal to the top of the fed funds target range. The Federal Reserve banks continue to work to make the window more usable. We’re taking on board the public feedback we received from a formal request for information last year. The industry wants transparency about the amount a bank can borrow, prompt approval of loans and seamless movement of collateral. We hear that feedback, and we’re working to modernize our operations. For example, our Discount Window Direct tool now lets bankers request loans online, and we’re working toward allowing firms to manage collateral there, as well. Yesterday’s panel addressed the interactions between the discount window and the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs). We’re collaborating with the FHLBs to streamline those connections.\nThe Fed’s Standing Repo Facility (SRF) also offers funding to eligible counterparties at the top of the target range against Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities. I was disappointed to see rates on a large share of tri-party repo transactions exceed the SRF rate at times this week. I anticipate that primary dealers will use the facility to obtain repo funding when it is economical to do so. Drawing on the SRF when the rate is economical is a sound way for a primary dealer to serve the market. With rates averaging higher than they were just a few months ago, the likelihood of the SRF rate becoming economical on some days is higher. Dealers may now need to step up their readiness to access the SRF in response to rate moves.\nBut the way the Fed implements SRF operations can also affect counterparties’ willingness to use it. This year, the Open Market Trading Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York added morning-settlement SRF operations to provide funding earlier in the day. Counterparties have responded positively to that enhancement. In my view, central clearing would further strengthen the facility’s effectiveness. The Fed’s counterparties could net down centrally cleared SRF borrowing against onward lending to other firms. Netting would reduce counterparties’ costs and risks of intermediating SRF funds to the broader market, helping liquidity to flow efficiently through the financial system. Streamlined SRF borrowing could be particularly helpful in the event of financial stress. Times of stress are the times when it’s most crucial for the Fed to be able to deliver the liquidity the system needs. Yet times of stress are also exactly when market participants try to de-risk their balance sheets by pulling back from intermediation.\nMoreover, central clearing of Fed operations would align with the private-sector repo market’s ongoing shift toward central clearing. Broader central clearing of Treasury repos will support financial stability by netting down many risks and providing strong, standardized risk management and transparency for the risks that remain. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has mandated central clearing of many Treasury repos between private sector participants by June 2027. I am pleased by the industry’s progress on the legal, operational and technological work to implement this important change, and I encourage industry leaders to maintain focus on the remaining steps to complete it.\nEffective ceiling tools will allow the FOMC to permit modest interest rate fluctuations without risking large upward spikes in rates.\nThe outlook for money market conditions and reserves\nIn recent months, money market rates have moved up toward and sometimes above IORB. After averaging 8 to 9 basis points below IORB in the first eight months of 2025, the tri-party general collateral rate (TGCR) averaged slightly above interest on reserves in September and October. TGCR is a rate on overnight repos collateralized by Treasury securities. It’s a safe rate in a liquid and competitive market, and I view it as the cleanest single measure of money market conditions. TGCR is now running at or above where I’d like to see relative to IORB for a long-run environment of ample reserves. That makes it appropriate to end asset runoff, as the FOMC decided to do.\nIt is not certain where money market spreads will go from here and how the supply of reserves will need to evolve. Temporary factors including tax payments, Treasury issuance and banks’ quarter-end and month-end balance sheet adjustments have contributed to the upward pressure on repo rates in recent months. If those pressures recede, rates could come down relative to IORB. Banks may also continue to adapt to the new configuration of rates. There might then be room for modest further decreases in reserve supply. Once runoff ends, the Fed can further reduce reserve supply by holding assets constant for a time and allowing decreases in reserves to offset trend growth in other liabilities such as currency. But if the recent rise in repo rates turns out not to be temporary, the Fed in my view would need to begin buying assets to keep reserves from falling further and maintain an ample supply of reserves.\nThe size and timing of these reserve management purchases should not be mechanical, in my view. While purchases will need to offset relatively predictable trend growth in currency, reserve demand will likely also change over time in response to economic growth, changes in the banking and payments businesses, and adjustments in regulations. Reserve supply will need to roughly track those developments to remain efficient. I currently view the average spread of TGCR to IORB as the central, though certainly not only, indicator of how reserve supply needs to evolve.\nThe FOMC’s operating target\nYou may have noticed that I focused on a repo rate, TGCR, and not the fed funds rate, even though the FOMC targets the fed funds rate in setting monetary policy. That was intentional. In my view, the fed funds operating target is outdated. The fed funds rate measures rates on unsecured, overnight loans between banks and other entities, such as FHLBs, that hold reserves. This rate made sense as an operating target given the way money markets worked in the 1990s, when the FOMC began publicly targeting fed funds. However, the world has changed since then in two crucial ways.\nOne change is the move to supplying ample, interest-bearing reserves. Because reserves now earn a competitive interest rate, banks are less motivated to lend out extra reserves at the end of the day to peers whose reserves have fallen short.\nSome say the Fed should reduce reserves to the point of scarcity to revive interbank trading. But ample reserves don’t cost anything, and they make the banking system safer and more efficient, as I discussed earlier. Creating artificial scarcity just to force banks to manage it would be wasteful. Although it would be competition of sorts, it wouldn’t be the kind of competition that matters for a vibrant economy. Banks should compete to best serve their customers, not to scrounge for liquidity that the Fed can easily provide.\nIn addition, while banks should be prepared to source contingent liquidity when needed, they don’t need to trade every day in the fed funds market to maintain that readiness. I’ve compared this before to building codes and fire drills. Modern building codes prevent many fires. People these days get much less practice escaping burning buildings. But no one suggests returning to old-fashioned, dangerous construction methods so buildings would burn down more often, and firefighters could get more experience. Fire drills work fine! In the same way, ample reserves reduce liquidity risk, and banks can employ drills and other readiness exercises to ensure they’re prepared to address the risk that remains.\nThe Global Financial Crisis (GFC) demonstrated the risks to firms on both sides of an unsecured, short-term interbank loan. The lender is at risk because if the borrower defaults, there’s no collateral to fall back on. The borrower is at risk because if lenders become worried, funding can dry up suddenly. The other key change since the 1990s is that post-GFC capital and liquidity regulations recognize these risks and create disincentives for unsecured, short-term interbank lending.\nPut it together, and fed funds is no longer a vibrant interbank market that measures the marginal cost of money for a wide range of institutions. Today, the fed funds market is dominated by an arbitrage trade. FHLBs, which don’t receive interest on reserves, lend to foreign banks, which receive interest on reserves but don’t pay for deposit insurance. This concentrated base of lenders and borrowers makes the fed funds market idiosyncratic and fragile. From July 2023 through mid-September of this year, the spread of the fed funds rate to IORB didn’t change by a single basis point even as money market conditions fluctuated meaningfully and other money market rates moved in response. More recently, the fed funds rate has come up only gradually despite large daily swings in repo rates. Fed funds appears to act more like a lagging average of past money market pressures than a timely indicator. In addition, any change in the FHLBs’ incentives or funding demand can cause fed funds volume to drop sharply, as occurred when FHLBs needed to meet higher advance demand during the March 2023 banking stresses.\nIf the connection between fed funds and broader money markets ever broke, the FOMC would need to adopt a different target. I don’t think making important changes under time pressure is the best way to promote a strong economy and financial system. As I described in a recent in-depth essay with a colleague, I believe the time has come for the FOMC to modernize the target rate. Proactively changing to a more robust target, such as TGCR, would allow time for a smooth transition so the private sector could adjust.\nLet me emphasize that modernizing the target rate would not change the FOMC’s monetary policy strategy. The operating target specifies how the FOMC measures and influences monetary conditions. It’s entirely separate from the question of how restrictive or accommodative those conditions should be to achieve the FOMC’s goals.\nTargeting TGCR would not require a larger Fed balance sheet or larger, more frequent or more complex operations than targeting the fed funds rate. For many years, the FOMC has set a target range for the fed funds rate that is 25 basis points wide. The Fed’s existing tools are generally effective at keeping TGCR within that target range. However, as I noted, dealers may need to increase their readiness to draw on the SRF in an environment where it is in the money more often, and the Fed should also continue to enhance the facility’s usability. In my view, the FOMC does not need pinpoint control of the operating target. Still, targeting a repo rate would require more tolerance for volatility within the target range than we have historically seen in the fed funds rate.\nThere are important trade-offs between potential replacements for the fed funds rate. Besides TGCR, market participants often mention the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as a candidate. SOFR is a widely adopted reference rate with well-developed derivatives markets, and it includes centrally cleared trades that seem likely to grow in volume in light of the SEC mandate. However, TGCR is a cleaner measure of monetary conditions because it’s not affected by the spread dealers require to intermediate between repo market segments. Although the TGCR market is smaller than the SOFR market, TGCR still incorporates more than $1 trillion in daily transactions among a wide range of counterparties.\nTo reiterate, these are only my views. But I believe the FOMC should modernize the target rate.\nThank you.\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Ample reserves and the Friedman rule\nNovember 10, 2023\nThank you for the kind introduction, Imène  [Rahmouni-Rousseau]. It’s great to see so many old friends, and it’s a real  honor to give a keynote address at this important conference.\nAs a policymaker, I have the opportunity to  speak on a wide range of topics, but money markets are where I grew up as a  central banker. So it’s a particular pleasure to take a deep dive into the more  technical aspects of monetary policy implementation and to do so from the  perspective of a policymaker rather than a practitioner.\nLet me note that the views I express are mine and not  necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe Friedman rule and monetary policy implementation\nIn recent decades, central banks around the world have been  shifting toward floor systems for monetary policy implementation. That shift  has been motivated by the actions central banks had to take in response to the  Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and subsequent stress episodes; by a growing  appreciation of the benefits of floor systems across a wide range of economic  and financial environments; and by post-GFC changes in bank regulations and banks’  own risk management, which increased the demand for liquidity and the costs of  interbank transactions.\nAmong the key benefits typically cited for  floor systems is that they do not put a price on liquidity. That is, in a floor  system, banks’ demand for central bank reserves is satisfied at something close  to market interest rates. Market rates are not materially higher than the  remuneration on the marginal dollar of reserves, and correspondingly there is  no incentive for banks to economize on reserves, the most liquid asset in the  financial system.\nAs a result, floor systems satisfy a version  of the Friedman rule. [1] The opportunity cost to banks of holding reserves is approximately equal to the  central bank’s cost of supplying reserves, which most analysts view as small. [2]\nIn theory, because floor systems remove  incentives to economize on liquidity, they should reduce liquidity risk in the  financial system. Yet, in economies around the world that use floor systems, we  have seen serious liquidity strains in recent years.\nThese episodes include the pressures on  liability-driven investment funds in the U.K.; the banking challenges in the U.S.  earlier this year; the repo market pressures in 2019; and, of course, the  global dash for cash at the onset of the pandemic.\nIn light of these events, some observers have questioned  whether floor systems deliver the promised liquidity benefits. Some have even  argued that floor systems make liquidity risk worse—an  idea I strongly disagree with. And some have questioned the other side of the  Friedman rule equation, asking whether central banks can in fact supply large  quantities of reserves at minimal cost to the financial system and society. [3]\nToday, I will take on both sides of those  critiques. I will argue that floor systems do reduce liquidity risk. But they  don’t eliminate it. It remains incumbent on all players in the financial system—banks,  other market participants, as well as central banks in our roles as both  regulators and financial institutions—to  appropriately manage liquidity risk. The appropriate strategies to manage  liquidity risk look somewhat different in a floor system, and I think all  players have work left to do to fully gain the benefits of these systems.\nOn the other side of the equation, the costs  of supplying reserves, it’s important to distinguish between two types of floor  systems. When the central bank’s balance sheet is only as large as needed to  meet the demand for liabilities such as reserves and currency, we call the  system a liability-driven floor. That’s the approach we’ve selected for  the long run in the United States, where our long-run operating regime will  supply “ample” reserves. The FOMC deliberated long and hard over the word  “ample,” and it contrasts with words like “abundant” and “super-abundant” that  describe higher levels of reserves. [4] I don’t see large costs of supplying the quantity of reserves needed to  establish a liability-driven floor.\nThere are also  circumstances, such as the pandemic, in which it is appropriate for central  banks to acquire additional assets to provide monetary accommodation or address  severe strains in market functioning. Such  balance sheet expansions create an asset-driven floor system. Asset-driven floors can pose some  challenges. We can mitigate these challenges when circumstances make asset  purchases appropriate, but it is better to minimize the challenges when we can.  That is one reason I think it’s important to continue normalizing the Federal  Reserve’s balance sheet. (Another reason, of course, is that we need to remove  monetary accommodation to restore price stability.)\nThe fundamentals of floor systems\nLet’s begin by fixing ideas: What is a floor  system? And how does it implement monetary policy?\nTo answer these questions, we need to consider  reserves’ special role in the financial system. Reserves are funds that  commercial banks, and sometimes other financial institutions, hold in accounts  at the central bank. Payments between banks, or between customers of two  different banks, are typically settled by transferring reserves from one bank’s  reserve account to the other’s. Reserves’ use in settling payments makes them a  unique asset. Reserves are always and immediately liquid. Other assets may be  viewed as highly liquid if market participants can usually convert them into  reserves quickly and at low cost. But no other asset is ever as safe and liquid  as reserves.\nBanks hold reserves for three main reasons. Banks  use reserves throughout the day to settle payments. They may hold additional  reserves, above typical daily needs, to manage liquidity risk by buffering  against unexpected payment outflows. And banks may hold reserves to satisfy  regulations and supervisory guidance, including formal reserve requirements, or  as part of liquid assets to meet broader liquidity regulations. Banks’  liquidity management and the resulting demand for reserves have evolved  significantly since the Global Financial Crisis, a point I’ll come back to  later.\nWhen a bank holds reserves, it forgoes putting that  money into other assets such as loans or securities that may have higher  risk-adjusted returns. Banks, individually and in the aggregate, therefore have  a downward-sloping demand curve for reserves ( Figure 1 ). At relatively  low aggregate levels of reserves, banks are willing to tolerate a large spread  between the returns on other assets and the return on reserves. As reserve  levels increase, the spread between the returns on other assets and reserves  must decrease. And when reserves reach levels that satisfy banks’ demand for  liquid balances, the demand curve levels off with a market interest rate close  to the interest rate the central bank pays on reserves.\nThere are two ways for the central bank to  implement monetary policy in this environment.\nThe central bank can provide a relatively limited—but potentially still quite large—supply of reserves, intersecting with the steep part  of the demand curve (Figure 2) . The central bank must then adjust  reserve supply so the market clears at the desired interest rate. Small changes  to the supply or demand for reserves can lead to significant changes in the  policy rate in this regime.\nAlternatively, the central bank can provide more reserves and vary  the interest rate on reserves to influence the market interest rate (Figure  3) . Such an operating regime is called a floor system because the interest  rate on reserves is intended to create a floor below money market rates. Commercial banks will not generally want to earn less  in money markets than they can earn by keeping cash at the central bank.\nHowever, the floor provided by interest on  reserves can be soft if some money market participants are ineligible to hold  interest-bearing reserve accounts or if commercial banks face costs of  expanding their balance sheets. That’s why I’ve drawn the graph with the  reserve demand curve dipping below the interest rate on reserves. To establish  a firm floor, central banks may need additional tools. The overnight reverse  repurchase agreement facility serves this purpose for the Fed.\nThe level of reserves in a floor system might  not be much larger than the level of reserves needed to implement policy on the  steep part of the demand curve. Post-GFC changes in regulations and banks’  liquidity risk management have substantially increased banks’ reserve demand.\nAs I see it, floor systems have three main  benefits.\nFirst, rate control in floor systems is more robust. [5] Since the Global Financial Crisis, both the supply of and the demand for  reserves can be subject to much larger daily shocks. For example, in the U.S.,  the Treasury Department, other official entities and central counterparties  hold accounts at the Fed that can drain reserves from the banking system.\nAs this chart in Figure 4 of daily changes in the  Treasury General Account illustrates, the supply of reserves can regularly  swing by tens of billions of dollars in a few days because of factors such as  fiscal flows. And on the demand side, changes in liquidity regulations and risk  management since the GFC have made banks’ demand for reserves less predictable.\nControlling money market rates requires  absorbing these shocks to supply and demand. In a floor system, this is  relatively straightforward. If the central bank operates on the flat part of  the reserve demand curve, the system will remain on the flat part even after  typical shifts of demand or supply, and money market rates won’t change much.  By contrast, in a scarce reserves system, the central bank must actively manage  the supply of reserves to offset the shocks—a  challenging task when the shocks are difficult to predict. [6]\nSecond, floor systems continue to effectively control  rates when the central bank expands its balance sheet to provide macroeconomic  stimulus or support financial stability. In the United States, we saw this  benefit most recently at the onset of the pandemic. The FOMC responded to  disruptions in market functioning by purchasing Treasury and agency  mortgage-backed securities at an unprecedented pace and scale. [7] Cumulatively, the Fed’s balance sheet expanded more than $2 trillion in a few  months (Figure 5) . At no point during this balance sheet expansion did  we have any difficulty keeping the effective federal funds rate within the  FOMC’s target range. [8]\nBy contrast, when we  rapidly expanded our balance sheet in 2008 in response to the Global Financial Crisis,  we often saw the fed funds rate trade significantly below the FOMC’s target—even after we began paying interest on reserves, which  proved to be only one of the components needed for a well-functioning floor  system (Figure 6) . [9]\nThird, and most closely connected to my theme today,  floor systems eliminate what would effectively be a penalty for good liquidity  risk management. As I said earlier, reserves are the most liquid asset, bar  none. The banking stresses earlier this year proved the unique value of  reserves beyond any doubt. Only reserves are immediately liquid. Monetizing any  other asset takes time. And sometimes it’s difficult to do at all:  counterparties may offer only limited balance sheet space for borrowing against  assets, while selling assets can crystallize losses and impair an institution’s  health. Holding reserves therefore reduces banks’ liquidity risks relative to  holding any other assets.\nThere are, of course, good reasons for banks to hold  assets other than reserves. By making loans, banks provide the credit to  households and businesses that is crucial for economic growth. But banks should  not pay a penalty for holding reserves when that is the right choice for their  liquidity risk management. If the interest rate paid on reserves is  meaningfully below money market interest rates, as occurs in a scarce-reserves  regime, there is a penalty to banks for managing liquidity well. Floor systems  eliminate this penalty and meet banks’ demand for reserves at market prices. This  is the sense in which floor systems implement a version of the Friedman rule.\nPolicy lessons from recent liquidity stress episodes\nThe question I now want to discuss is: If  floor systems do such a good job of reducing the cost of liquidity, why do we  keep seeing liquidity stresses? In the U.S., why did severe money market  pressures in September 2019 cause some funding rates to spike by hundreds of  basis points? [10] Why did  the dash for cash challenge markets in 2020, and why did some banks face  liquidity stress this past March? And across the Atlantic, what should we make  of the liquidity problems that liability-driven investors in the U.K.  experienced in 2022?\nMy answer is that floor systems reduce  liquidity risk, but they don’t eliminate it.\nWe have seen concrete evidence that liquidity  risk is lower in the floor regime. For example, since the Fed moved to a floor  system, peak daylight overdrafts are about one-tenth the magnitude seen in the  prior regime (Figure 7) . And interbank payments are substantially less  concentrated at the end of the day because banks are less likely to need to  wait to receive incoming payments before making outgoing ones. [11] These are both signs that banks are not seeking to economize on liquidity as  much as they used to. The floor regime has reduced the penalty for holding  liquidity, as the Friedman rule recommends. So individual banks face less risk  of lacking the liquidity needed to make outgoing payments, and the banking  system as a whole is less vulnerable to disruptions from payments congestion or  shocks late in the day.\nStill, there will always be some shocks that a  floor system can’t absorb on its own. These can take several forms, including large  shifts in the aggregate supply of or demand for reserves; idiosyncratic shocks  to individual banks that exceed the system’s capacity to immediately  redistribute funds; and shocks to nonbank intermediaries that spill over to  bank funding markets. We saw examples of these types of shocks in the liquidity  stress episodes I mentioned.\nI draw four lessons from these experiences:  First, a floor system should include strong backstop ceiling tools. Second,  market participants and central banks alike should ensure they are  operationally ready to respond to liquidity pressures. Third, regulations should  support strong liquidity risk management. And finally, some shocks are too big  for any operating regime to absorb easily.\nFirst, ceiling tools. In September 2019, as  the Federal Reserve normalized its balance sheet following the expansion during  and after the Global Financial Crisis, reserves fell below what we later  assessed to be the ample level. It was necessary to add reserves to continue  operating a floor system, and that’s what we did. Market data, particularly  related to pricing conditions, can help signal when reserves are becoming less  ample. But given the uncertainties I discussed earlier, I doubt the risk of  reserves falling below the ample level can ever be eliminated, especially if  the central bank wants to have an efficient balance sheet with ample but not  abundant reserves.\nSo, as a practical matter, central banks that  operate floor systems must be prepared to respond to tail events when reserves  fall too low and money market rates can rise above the target level. While  discretionary operations such as those we employed in 2019 can effectively  address such pressures, a standing ceiling facility at a backstop rate makes a  better first line of defense. A standing ceiling facility transparently  provides market participants with information about how the central bank will  respond and confidence that the central bank will maintain rate control. [12]\nWe could study ways to further strengthen our  ceiling tools. Such a study could examine how we can take on board the lessons  of recent years as well as ongoing changes in the structure of the financial  system. For example, the FOMC could further consider the potential benefits of  centrally clearing SRF operations. [15] Central clearing could enhance the flow of funding to the broader market by  allowing our counterparties to net funding received from the facility against  onward lending to other market participants.\nOther central banks have considered adding counterparties to their liquidity operations. [16] These choices depend on a central bank’s charter and the financial system in which it operates. In my mind, the focus for the Federal Reserve given our context should be to enhance the effectiveness of operations with our existing counterparties.\nSecond, operational readiness. One criticism  that has been leveled against floor systems is that when liquidity is ample,  interbank trading may dry up and banks may become less practiced at sourcing  funds when needed. [17] To the  extent this happens, I don’t see it as a reason to criticize floor systems.  That would be like criticizing modern building codes for reducing the risk of  fire. If a city adopts a strong building code, fewer buildings will  burn. Residents will have less experience escaping a blaze. Firefighters will  have less experience putting out flames. These are good things. And  while the lack of experience could have drawbacks, we know what to do about it:  fire drills.\nSimilarly, the lack of daily liquidity  challenges doesn’t absolve participants in the financial system from remaining  ready should liquidity pressures emerge. A variety of flexible funding sources is  available, and even in a floor system in which liquidity is usually ample,  banks should be prepared to use these sources. During the banking stresses  earlier this year, we found that some banks had not established access to the  discount window, had not pre-positioned collateral so they could borrow against  it, or had not tested the borrowing procedures. This is unacceptable in an era  when bank runs can start in minutes on social media. Ceiling tools won’t work  well if financial institutions aren’t prepared to use them.\nEvery bank in the United States should be  fully set up at the discount window as part of its liquidity toolkit. That  means setting up legal documents and collateral arrangements well before any  funding need arises. And it means testing the plumbing—like  a fire drill—so bankers have the muscle memory for  borrowing when it’s needed. [18] The same goes for other contingent liquidity sources and for non-bank market  participants.\nThe central bank, too, has a responsibility to  maintain operational readiness in a floor system. The Desk regularly tests open  market operations to ensure readiness to respond to a variety of potential  stresses.\nThe Federal Reserve should also consider  expanding the hours of critical services such as the discount window. With the  launch of instant payments services such as FedNow, liquidity in the U.S. and  other markets is increasingly a 24/7/365 business. Our liquidity backstop  should be available whenever banks may need it. Over time, that could include  nights, weekends and holidays, not just business days.\nAnd we should consider how our credit and  supervisory policies affect operational readiness. A supervisory or regulatory expectation that depository institutions  establish and test access to the discount window could help make individual  firms and the financial system more resilient. Periodic testing by all  institutions could also reduce the traditional stigmas associated with the  discount window. And if we required banks to pre-position some amount of  collateral at the window, we could reduce the risk that a bank is unable to  borrow because its collateral is in the wrong place. [19]\nWe could also study ways to make our  discount window, a  fundamental central bank function, as strong  and effective as possible. For example, we could consider the potential  benefits of what I would call collateral-based lending. A collateral-based  discount window program would lend to legally eligible depository institutions  purely on the basis of their collateral. [20] In contrast, the current program of primary and secondary credit varies the  terms of lending based on a borrower’s financial condition. Collateral-based discount window lending could strengthen the ceiling by ensuring all eligible institutions have equal access to liquidity against good collateral. It could also improve operational readiness by reducing the need to take time at critical moments to evaluate a borrower’s condition.\nI’ll now turn to my third lesson, regulations.  Strong regulations are fundamental to a financial system that serves society’s  needs. Regulations must also evolve alongside the overall structure of the  financial system, the policy implementation framework and the risks that  financial institutions face. Regulations that were well suited to a scarce-reserves  regime and a world of relatively slow-moving liquidity demands are not  necessarily ideal today.\nFor example, the Basel III leverage ratio  counts all of a bank’s assets, including reserves, in the denominator. This  rule can raise a bank’s cost of holding reserves and intermediating in funding  markets, potentially working against the goal of reducing liquidity risk. Such  costs may also add to frictions in the interbank market, reducing the system’s  capacity to quickly redistribute liquidity to individual firms that need it. [21] More broadly, it is also important to consider the interactions among regulations,  ceiling tools and liquidity risk, including how to ensure that banks are able  to use their liquidity buffers and how liquidity regulations account for banks’  access to the discount window and the SRF. [22]\nFinally, the fourth lesson: some shocks are  just too large. At the onset of the pandemic, market participants had to adapt  to a dramatically different global risk environment while shifting to remote  work. These developments triggered extraordinary financial market volatility,  one-sided trading flows and demands for cash. [23] While improvements in ceiling tools, operational readiness and regulations  could conceivably have partially mitigated the stresses, I don’t think any  steps could have eliminated the stresses entirely. We should work to ensure the  financial system is resilient and central bank intervention to support market  functioning is rarely needed. But “rare” does not mean “never.”\nIn fact, the idea that some shocks are too  large for a reasonable operating regime to absorb is built into the Friedman  rule framework. The Friedman rule balances the benefits and costs of liquidity.  It calls for providing liquidity up to the point that the benefits equal the  costs—not for going beyond that point. Conceptually,  it would be possible to further reduce liquidity risk by subsidizing banks to  hold reserves instead of merely eliminating the interest rate penalty. But such  a subsidy would have other costs. So we strike a balance and accept that some shocks  will be larger than the regime can absorb without further central bank  intervention.\nBeyond the Friedman rule: liability-driven and asset-driven floors\nThat brings me to the costs of supplying  reserves and the distinction between liability-driven and asset-driven floor  systems. Ordinarily, the policy rate is a central bank’s main monetary policy  tool, and the balance sheet plays a supporting role. The Friedman rule  describes the optimal quantity of reserves to supply in those normal times: the  quantity of reserves that banks demand at market interest rates. Because  reserve supply is determined by demand for the central bank’s liabilities, this  floor system for ordinary times is called a liability-driven floor. But a  central bank may also use its balance sheet more actively in response to deep  economic downturns or severe market dysfunction. When a central bank acquires  assets for those reasons, it also issues more reserves, creating an  asset-driven floor system. In such a system, the amount of reserves is not  governed by the Friedman rule—the tradeoff between the liquidity  benefits and costs of reserves. Rather, reserve supply in an asset-driven floor  is a side effect of the central bank buying assets in response to severe  macroeconomic or financial stress.\nThe Federal Reserve is currently in an  asset-driven floor system as a result of our post-pandemic purchases. However,  we are running off our asset holdings to return to a liability-driven floor. This  is our second such normalization cycle, following the post-GFC normalization of  our balance sheet in 2018 and 2019.\nWhy normalize our balance sheet at all? Why  not stick with a higher level of reserves? In my view, there are two reasons to  return to ample rather than abundant reserves—in  the Friedman rule framework, two costs of supplying reserves above the ample  level. [24] First, abundant reserves can distort the price of liquidity for non-bank market  participants. And second, while acquiring assets during a severe  downturn or in response to severe market dysfunction can provide much-needed  support for the financial system and economy, holding the assets too long can  undermine the achievement of monetary policy goals. In particular, maintaining  overly large asset holdings may push inflation above target or may complicate  the calibration and communication of the policy stance, which ordinarily should  center on the policy rate.\nThe first reason is relatively narrow and  focuses on money markets. Reserves can be held only by banks (or other  institutions eligible for reserve accounts). Other financial institutions must  use other instruments, such as Treasury securities, as their liquid assets. By  acquiring non-reserve assets to back reserves, the central bank adds to the  supply of liquidity for banks but may increase non-banks’ cost of liquidity.  But in an efficient system, the costs of liquidity should be similar for banks  and non-banks. Significant differences in liquidity costs imply that liquidity  is too abundant for one type of firm or too scarce for another.\nOne way to test whether the costs of liquidity are  similar for banks and non-banks is to look at money market rate spreads. [25] For example, overnight Treasury repo rates represent the overnight return on a  Treasury security. If Treasury repo rates are significantly below the interest  rate on reserves, then Treasury securities, the key liquid asset for non-banks,  have greater liquidity value than reserves. The Fed’s balance sheet expansions  in response to both the Global Financial Crisis and the pandemic pushed repo  rates below interest on reserves (Figure 8) .\nThese spreads indicated that liquidity  conditions were more abundant for banks than non-banks. In 2018 and 2019, the  gap closed as we normalized our balance sheet, and repo rates eventually  stabilized a few basis points above interest on reserves. Repo rates and  interest on reserves shouldn’t necessarily be exactly equal. There are  technical differences between repos and reserves, as well as minor competitive  frictions that could introduce a small spread. But in an efficient market, the  spread should not be large. This argument is simply the mirror image of the  idea that if money market rates are above the interest rate on reserves—if  we move up above the floor—there is an undesirable penalty on  liquidity for banks.\nSome researchers have taken the analysis of  relative liquidity costs a step further by estimating the liquidity value of  long-term Treasury securities. [26] In such models, the liquidity value of Treasuries includes a negative term  premium associated with their flight-to-safety qualities. The central bank’s  asset holdings influence that term premium, and one can attempt to calculate  the level of asset holdings at which the liquidity value of Treasuries measured  in this way would equal the liquidity value of reserves. But I am not persuaded  that monetary policy implementation frameworks should be designed around this  term premium. To the extent that long-term government debt is scarce, the  Treasury can address the scarcity by changing the maturity structure of its  debt issuance. When a central bank considers the costs and benefits of  supplying more reserves, it should focus on the effects in money markets. Money  market conditions reflect the liquidity value of reserves, a unique asset that  only the central bank can provide.\nThe second reason for balance sheet  normalization is outside money markets. Expanding the central bank balance  sheet and acquiring assets makes setting and communicating the stance of  monetary policy more complicated. The central bank must explain its use of two  tools—asset purchases and the policy rate—instead  of just one. And asset purchases are more difficult to calibrate because their  effects are less certain. These challenges are worth surmounting when the  policy rate is at the effective lower bound and further stimulus can come only  through asset purchases, or when asset purchases are the best available  response to threats to financial stability.\nBut in the absence of such needs, the benefits of  higher reserves aren’t commensurate with the drawbacks. Indeed, a large balance  sheet can even be counterproductive for our policy goals. The Federal Reserve  and other central banks bought large quantities of assets during the pandemic  for a reason: to support market functioning, the flow of credit and economic  activity in response to a severe economic shock. Circumstances are now  different. Financial markets are functioning smoothly. And our primary economic  challenge is not a deep recession but rather too-high inflation. In this  environment, it is important to remove economic stimulus by returning our  assets to the level needed to supply ample—not abundant—reserves.\nConclusion\nCentral bankers have vigorously debated  monetary policy implementation regimes for many years. And I have no doubt we  will continue to do so for many more. The Friedman rule offers a useful  guidepost in that debate. On the margin, central banks should equate the  benefits and costs to society of supplying additional reserves. A floor system  with ample reserves satisfies this criterion in my view.\nThank you.\nNotes\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks and to Antoine Martin and Patricia Zobel for valuable conversations.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Welcome remarks for the Outlook for North American Trade and Immigration conference\nApril 10, 2025\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to this conference on the outlook for North American trade and immigration, which the Dallas Fed is hosting in collaboration with the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nToday’s conversation comes at a pivotal time as the new governments both here in the United States and in Mexico adjust trade, immigration and other policies. These policies will affect the national and global economies, international relations and communities throughout the district the Dallas Fed serves. The goal of today’s conference is to discuss economic relationships across the U.S., Mexico and North America and bring forth perspectives that can help inform the public about these timely issues.\nThe Dallas Fed values the opportunity to hear from and engage with people from an assortment of backgrounds including subject matter experts, business leaders, community leaders and more. By bringing multidisciplinary views together, we deepen our collective understanding of these quickly evolving topics. Let me note that the views I share are mine  and not necessarily those of my Federal Open Market Committee colleagues.\nGiven our close proximity to Mexico, the Dallas Fed has the unique opportunity to engage in collaborative research, analysis and conversations on cross-border issues. Our long-standing relationships with our neighbors in Mexico help us to effectively gather insights on the ground and engage in conversations that inform and guide research and analysis. These interactions enhance our understanding of the U.S.–Mexico relationship and allow us to better serve the public, and these conversations allow us to hear how policy changes transmit into daily life.\nLast year, the Dallas Fed launched the Global Institute. The institute builds on the foundation of our previous Center for Latin American Economics, which played a pivotal role in enhancing public understanding of economic policy in Latin America, and of the Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, which examined how economic integration affected monetary policy. With the Global Institute, we plan to grow the Dallas Fed’s concentration and influence in the field of international economic research and to be a center of policy-related research on global trade, international capital flows and migration, with a particular interest in linkages with Mexico.\nOne way we accomplish this is by collaborating with leading economists in the field and organizations such as the Peterson Institute to produce impactful research and provide timely insights on the U.S.–Mexico relationship and broader global contexts. I encourage you to visit the Global Institute web site, where you can read our research on migration patterns, the pass-through of trade costs to consumer prices and more.\nChanges in trade and other policies will have substantial effects on the U.S. and global economies. Financial market prices have been volatile as market participants digest those implications, as well as uncertainties about the specifics of policies and about how policies will work their way through the economy.\nRegarding the economic outlook, higher-than-expected tariffs would very likely raise both unemployment and inflation. The persistence of the effect on inflation would depend on how quickly companies pass through cost increases and whether long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. A sustained burst of inflation could lead households and businesses to expect further price increases, especially following the persistently elevated inflation in recent years.\nAs mandated by Congress, the FOMC pursues both maximum employment and price stability. Both of those objectives benefit American families, businesses and communities, and missing on either dimension is costly. History teaches that when higher inflation expectations become entrenched, the road back to price stability is longer, the labor market is weaker and the economic scars are deeper. To sustainably achieve both of our dual-mandate goals, it will be important to keep any tariff-related price increases from fostering more persistent inflation. For now, I believe the stance of monetary policy is well positioned.\nI look forward to robust discussions today that can deepen our collective understanding of the U.S.–Mexico relationship, the North American economy and the implications of recent policy changes. And I look forward to continuing this conversation in the fall when we hold the second installment of this dialogue in Washington.\nThank you all for joining us here today. We are especially pleased to have community and business leaders here with us, and we look forward to hearing from you about how trade and immigration policies directly affect your companies, organizations and communities.\nNow, I’d like to introduce Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies for the Peterson Institute. Marcus has been associated with the Peterson Institute since 1985 and served as deputy director from 2009 to 2012. He is currently a senior fellow at the East-West Center, and he was previously a senior economist at the Council of Economic Advisers. He has held research and teaching positions at universities including Yale, Johns Hopkins and the University of Southern California. Marcus, thank you for joining us. And thank you to the Peterson Institute for partnering with us to develop today’s conference.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Welcome remarks for 'The Evolving Landscape of Bank Funding'\nOctober 30, 2025\nGood afternoon.\nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, I would like to extend a warm welcome to each of you. I’m required to give the official disclaimer that these are my views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues, but on the warm welcome at least, I think we are unanimous.\nI am so happy you joined us for a deep dive into a vital part of the financial system: bank funding.\nI’m a big believer in the power of diverse ideas and open debate. To properly discuss this topic—or really any important economic or financial issue—we need to hear a wide range of perspectives. That includes the voices of policymakers, academic researchers and especially experts working in the field, in this case, bankers. At the Dallas Fed, we are working to build a strong economy together, so we greatly appreciate all of you joining us from across the nation to engage in these conversations. This is our second annual conference on bank funding, and I know the discussions will only get deeper and richer as we continue each year.\nI’m also delighted to welcome my dear colleagues from the Cleveland and Atlanta Feds, Beth Hammack and Raphael Bostic. It’s always a privilege to spend time with Beth and Raphael, either at our Federal Open Market Committee meetings in Washington or anywhere else. I’m pleased we are sponsoring this conference together, and I look forward to hearing their views during their fireside chat tomorrow.\nBanking is crucial to our economy, and funding is crucial to banking.\nBy taking deposits and making loans, banks enable customers to safely save money and finance investments that grow their families, businesses and communities.\nA vibrant banking ecosystem ensures that customers of all kinds can find banks that meet their needs.\nAnd funding is at the center of this business, because funding is how a bank receives excess cash from customers who have it and transforms that cash into a loan that fuels investment and economic growth.\nFunding can take many forms, from small retail deposits to wholesale debt. That variety both helps banks meet their evolving needs and supports a variety of banking business models.\nBanks have the preeminent responsibility for managing their own funding and funding risks. However, government policies do affect the funding environment for banks.\nI’d highlight two policy issues that will be a focus this afternoon.\nFirst, the Fed’s primary credit program allows healthy banks to borrow at the discount window against good collateral. Alongside other contingent funding sources, the discount window can be an important component of banks’ overall plans for ensuring they have strong access to liquidity and can effectively serve their customers across economic and market environments. The Federal Reserve banks have been streamlining and modernizing discount window operations so we can most efficiently and effectively serve banks when they come to borrow. Among those efforts, we are working to enhance coordination with the Federal Home Loan Banks, particularly for managing collateral. I look forward to hearing perspectives during the conference on how the operational improvements to date are working and what more we might do to make the discount window more operationally effective for depository institutions.\nSecond, deposit insurance underpins the stability of bank funding by reassuring depositors their money is safe. Unfortunately, there is not currently a level playing field for deposit insurance. The public has a perception that the government will bail out too-big-too-fail banks and protect all the depositors at these giant firms. Meanwhile, at community banks, deposits are insured only up to the $250,000 limit. In normal times, customers are confident in their banks’ safety, and the insurance limit may not make much difference. But when stress emerges, customers want safety above all else, and they’ve sometimes run to the biggest banks. Or customers increasingly use reciprocal deposits, which offer added insurance but cost banks money and create operational and other risks. The unlevel playing field between community banks and too-big-to-fail giants undermines the vibrant, competitive banking ecosystem that our economy needs. There have been a variety of proposals for deposit insurance reform, and I’ll be interested to hear discussions on what steps might work best.\nThe dialogue today and tomorrow will also examine how new technology is changing depositors’ behavior and the role of bank supervision. I’m excited about this agenda and so glad you all could join us. Please enjoy your lunch, and at 1:15 p.m. we’ll begin the conference program in the auditorium.\nLorie K. Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Welcoming remarks for the Women in Central Banking Workshop\nNovember 01, 2024\nGood morning.\nThank you, Mark [Wynne] , for the kind introduction. And thank you all for joining us for the second Women in Central Banking Workshop.\nMy colleagues and I are especially pleased to co-sponsor this year’s event with the Norges Bank. The Norges Bank began this workshop last year to give women working in PhD programs an opportunity to present their research, receive feedback and network with each other as well as accomplished senior economists in central banks. We’re delighted to partner with the Norges Bank on this year’s workshop and hope this effort continues to grow.\nThis workshop means a lot to the Dallas Fed. We know that to accomplish our public mission, we need the best economists in the world to become central bankers. So, we are incredibly excited and proud to welcome women who will lead the next generation of economists to our bank today to share their research.\nScholarly economic research is integral to the work of central banks. Research deepens our understanding of the economy and financial system and enables policymakers to make well-informed decisions on all aspects of our mission. Here at the Dallas Fed, we recognize the value of your work and how it helps us achieve our mission of building an economy where everyone can participate and thrive. And I may be biased, but central banks can be a great place not only to do research but also to make an impact on the world with your research.\nWomen’s representation in economics\nThis workshop is important because while more women are serving in leadership positions, they remain significantly underrepresented in the field of economics as a whole. This is a global pattern and, unfortunately, a persistent one. In 2023, women received just under one-third of the PhDs granted in economics in the United States. That figure has been stagnant for a quarter century. And in subfields like macroeconomics, finance and quantitative methods, which are crucial for central banks, representation among women is even lower.\nWhile the underrepresentation of women isn’t unique to economics, the field has made less progress than some other traditionally male-dominated areas of study. For example, from 1998 to 2018, the percentage of engineering PhDs granted to women doubled. And in fields like medicine and law, where women made up less than one-tenth of students entering professional schools in the 1960s, the percentages of men and women entering these same programs were nearly equal by the early 2000s.\nThe progress we’ve seen in other fields gives me hope that with the right strategies, we can move the needle in economics as well. However, I still have concerns about whether we in economics are missing out on top talent. As I said at the outset, we need the very best economists contributing to our mission. How many young women who could become great economists aren’t even entering the profession?\nWomen’s representation affects not only the individual talent in the profession but our ability to form high-performing teams. A rising share of economics papers have multiple authors, and I’ve heard it said that research is a team sport. That’s even more true for public policy.\nThroughout my career, I have seen time and time again when we’re trying to innovate or solve complex problems, we do our best work when we bring diverse teams together. The different perspectives that team members bring—how we think, how we analyze information and what we know about the world—allow us to generate better ideas and more rapidly develop the best solutions. Increasing women’s representation will bring new and important perspectives to the table—ones that matter for public policy and especially for our work as a central bank.\nCentral banks are among the largest employers in the field of economics. Research from my colleague Nitzan [Tzur-Ilan] finds that although the Federal Reserve System as a whole employs more than 1,000 PhD economists, women made up only 22 percent of these economists as of 2021. Here in Dallas, women account for just 25 percent of our PhD economists. Frankly, this is an area the Dallas Fed needs to work on. A diverse workforce is key to developing the best insights so we can build an economy where everyone can participate and thrive. My leadership team and I are committed to encouraging and supporting women in the economics profession and in this bank, and today’s workshop supports that goal.\nIn late August, I attended the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. I look forward every year to this event hosted by my colleagues at the Kansas City Fed. It’s a bit like summer camp for central bankers—a time to discuss economics and policy with top experts from around the world.\nAt the very first Jackson Hole symposium in 1982, there was not a single woman on the program and precious few among the attendees. Over time, the organizers recognized that a substantial amount of talent wasn’t making it to the event and worked to include more women on the agenda and among the attendees. Today, one of the agenda items I look forward to most is a gathering of women leaders. Former Kansas City Fed President Esther George started that part of the program, and it’s been a key step in making the conference more inclusive.\nI am optimistic that with dedication and thoughtful efforts, we can bring more women into economics and central banking. From an institutional standpoint, this could include creating more diverse co-authorship networks, introducing mentorship programs, and building the pipeline in economics through efforts like the partnership we and other reserve banks have with the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession to host summer interns. We can also make a difference as individuals, by identifying opportunities for our colleagues, inviting others to share their work and perspectives, and supporting one another. The issues we’re facing are long-standing and structural in nature, but as with the women’s gathering at Jackson Hole that I mentioned earlier, even relatively small steps in the right direction can help drive lasting change. Our hope is that today’s workshop will contribute to that progress.\nConclusion\nI would like to again thank Norges Bank for their partnership in developing this workshop.\nThis event would not be possible without the work of our organizing committee: Emilia [Garcia-Appendini], Eleonora [Granziera] and Kasper [Roszbach] of Norges Bank; and Lucie [Lebeau], Pia [Orrenius], Nitzan [Tzur-Ilan], Mark [Wynne], Fang [Yang] and Ziaoqing [Zhou] of the Dallas Fed.\nI would also like to thank everyone who is presenting, our session chairs and discussants. I hope each of you is able to connect, build your networks and advance your research.\nFinally, I would like to thank you for being here and for having me. Whether you are joining us today as a PhD student, as a central banker or as someone in the field, your involvement is meaningful and makes a difference for the next generation of women in central banking.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Why I’ll be cautious about further rate cuts\nSeptember 30, 2025\nDallas Fed President Lorie Logan delivered these remarks at the Dallas Fed Survey Participants Appreciation Reception.\nLearn more about the surveys conducted by the Dallas Fed and how to participate.\nIt is a pleasure to welcome you all to the Dallas Fed and to thank you for sharing your perspectives with us. The insights you share help me form my assessment of our region’s economy and shape my overall outlook.\nThe U.S. economy is at a key moment for monetary policy. More than four years after the postpandemic inflation surge began, inflation remains above the 2 percent target set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). At the same time, payroll job growth slowed markedly this year. Against this backdrop, the FOMC recently voted to cut interest rates for the first time in nine months, and FOMC participants’ economic projections reflected a divergence of views on where policy should go from here.\nCongress gave the FOMC a dual mandate: to set monetary policy to deliver both price stability and maximum employment. I supported the FOMC’s rate cut earlier this month because it helped better balance the risk of slowing the labor market too much against the ongoing imperative to bring inflation back to the 2 percent target. However, I am also committed to finishing the job of sustainably restoring price stability.\nAs I consider the path ahead, three features of the economy stand out to me at this time.\nThe combination of persistent inflation, resilient demand and modest labor market slack indicates to me that policy is likely only modestly restrictive. There may be relatively little room to make additional rate cuts without inadvertently moving to an inappropriately accommodative stance.\nOf course, economic outlooks are inherently uncertain, and the outlook now is more uncertain than usual. In these remarks, I will lay out the key elements of my economic outlook and why they lead me to conclude that the FOMC should proceed cautiously on further rate cuts. As always, these are my views and not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\nInflationary pressures persist\nInflation remains too high. The FOMC measures price stability by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. Headline PCE inflation was 2.7 percent for the 12 months through August.\nInflation can be volatile. Measures that remove outliers or volatile categories historically have given better signals of where headline inflation is likely to go. But the signals from these measures are currently disappointing. The Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE inflation rate, which removes categories of goods or services with unusually large price changes, was also 2.7 percent in the 12 months through August. Core PCE inflation, which removes the volatile food and energy categories, was higher than headline, at 2.9 percent. Both measures are little changed from their readings a year ago.\nTariff rate increases have contributed to inflation this year. But, in standard economic theories, an increase in tariffs, all else equal, produces a one-time upward shift in the price level rather than sustained inflationary pressures. Therefore, to judge whether inflation is on track to return all the way to 2 percent, it is important to assess the underlying drivers beyond tariffs.\nMy staff investigated what has been keeping inflation elevated . They separated core inflation into three components: goods, housing services and non-housing services. When overall inflation is running at 2 percent, each of these three components tends to run at a somewhat different rate because long-run trends change the relative prices of different goods and services. However, my staff found that inflation for all three components is elevated relative to the respective levels that would be consistent with 2 percent overall inflation.\nMost worrisome for the medium-term inflation outlook, non-housing services inflation should be relatively unaffected by tariffs, yet it has hovered near 3.4 percent over the past year. Non-housing services represents more than half of Americans’ aggregate consumption. My staff estimates that the current rate of inflation in this category is high enough to keep overall inflation above 2 percent by 30 to 40 basis points. Housing services inflation should come down some as rents reset. Core goods inflation has been elevated in part due to tariffs, an effect that should also dissipate. But even then, the persistence visible in non-housing services inflation would keep overall inflation from returning all the way to the 2 percent target.\nThere are both downside and upside risks to that outlook. If the labor market slows more sharply than I anticipate, or if labor productivity growth strengthens, we could see more disinflation. On the other hand, shifting global supply chains and the re-shoring of manufacturing could continue to push up goods prices even after tariff effects are fully incorporated.\nTariffs also pose upside risk to inflation because of the way they tend to feed into prices over time. Although tariffs should produce a one-time shift up in prices, in practice that upward shift takes time to occur. The resulting lags have the potential to generate more persistent inflation. Many business leaders tell me they have not yet fully passed through higher tariff costs because they are uncertain where tariff rates will settle and fear losing market share. Other firms held the line on prices while they worked through inventories built up before tariffs took effect. But if tariff costs remain high, my business contacts tell me they will pass on more of these costs to their customers. Responses to special questions in the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Survey in August indicate a significant fraction of firms affected by tariffs had not yet passed on tariff costs but plan to do so in coming months.\nSurveys indicate that consumers’ and business economists’ inflation expectations remain elevated over the next year, as do market-based measures of inflation compensation. Measures of longer-run inflation expectations and inflation compensation have generally remained broadly consistent with 2 percent inflation. Well-anchored inflation expectations help return inflation to target and give the FOMC room to take a balanced approach to the two legs of the mandate. However, policymakers cannot take well-anchored expectations for granted. The longer tariffs take to show through into prices and the longer inflation remains above 2 percent, the greater the risk that above-target inflation becomes entrenched.\nDemand is holding up in the face of challenges\nAggregate demand has remained resilient despite an elevated monetary policy target rate and cross-currents from shifts in national economic policies. Adjusting for inflation, GDP increased at a 1.6 percent annualized rate in the first half of the year, slower than its 2.4 percent pace in 2024 but not much below its trend growth rate. As with inflation, GDP measures that exclude volatile categories often give more reliable signals than the total GDP data on the underlying momentum in overall spending and demand. Final sales to private domestic purchasers, which excludes government spending and the more volatile net exports and inventories categories, increased at a 2.4 percent annualized pace in the first half of 2025. Corporate earnings reports for the second quarter also underscored economic resilience.\nMoreover, GDP growth in the third quarter looks solid. Consumption has increased at around a 3 percent annualized pace for the quarter, and new orders suggest equipment investment remained strong in July and August.\nConsumer and business sentiment appear to be rebounding after having weakened in the spring in the face of uncertainty regarding trade and fiscal policies. The Dallas Fed’s August Texas Business Outlook and Banking Conditions Surveys found that business output, wages and loan volumes picked up since the middle of the summer, which is consistent with surveys at the national level. New orders in the Institute for Supply Management’s surveys for both manufacturing and services jumped into positive territory in August. In the Dallas Fed’s September surveys, respondents also expect manufacturing and service sector activity to continue to increase six months from now, consistent with findings in other regions.\nThe outlook for business investment in some sectors is particularly strong. Investment in data centers for both traditional cloud services and artificial intelligence continues to boom. My business contacts also cite changes in tax policy, the prospect of less restrictive regulation in banking and other sectors and, perhaps more speculatively, permitting reform that could unlock energy development and housing construction. These developments may well eventually increase productivity and aggregate supply, but the timing of those effects is uncertain. Meanwhile, the boost to demand is already here. That raises uncertainty about the balance between demand and supply in the near term.\nIncreasingly accommodative financial conditions are supporting aggregate demand, primarily through equity valuations that continue to reach new highs, but also through narrowing credit spreads and a weaker dollar. Indexes that estimate the economic impact of changes in a broad range of asset prices point to financial conditions prompting a meaningful boost to growth ahead.  For example, the Federal Reserve Board’s baseline methodology implies that current financial conditions will provide about a 1 percentage point boost to real GDP growth over the next year. More than half of the effect comes from higher equity valuations. This is largely because rising financial wealth tends to support aggregate consumption, and the last year alone saw an estimated increase in U.S.-held public equity wealth of more than $7 trillion. Of course, not everyone benefits equally or at all from increases in stock prices, and financial conditions are less supportive in certain sectors. High mortgage rates, for example, are weighing on house prices, which have been edging lower in recent months from high levels. But, overall, financial conditions are providing a tailwind to aggregate growth.\nDistinguishing labor market slowing from labor market slack\nDespite the resilience in aggregate demand, the labor market has been slowing. Payroll job growth has decreased markedly this year. The economy added an average of 111,000 jobs per month in 2024 after accounting for preliminary benchmark revisions recently published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By contrast, payrolls grew by an average of 29,000 jobs per month from June to August 2025, a number that could eventually be revised downward as well.\nYet employers are not laying off markedly more workers than before. The layoff rate in August was 1.1 percent, below the average of 1.2 in 2019, when the labor market was considered healthy. Initial claims for unemployment insurance remained around the 2019 level through mid September.\nInstead, the labor market is characterized by both low hiring and low firing. Firms are reluctant to hire, and workers seeking jobs (including those who have been laid off, those who would like to change roles and new entrants to the labor force) are having more difficulty finding positions. Although layoffs are painful in any environment, if hiring is robust, workers can find new jobs relatively quickly. The current low hiring rate makes the economy more vulnerable than usual to any increase in layoffs or weakening in demand.\nBut I’m also mindful of the difference between a slowing labor market and a slack labor market. By slack, I mean underutilization of economic resources, such as a gap between the number of people wanting to work and the number of available jobs. Monetary policy can ameliorate slack by lowering the policy rate to support demand. But not all changes in economic activity represent changes in slack, and monetary policy can do little to change supply factors. Stimulating demand when it is already in balance with supply will create price pressures without sustainably adding to employment. For example, in the 1970s, the FOMC misinterpreted slowing productivity growth and GDP growth as increasing slack, and it lowered rates only to stoke inflation.\nWhile payroll gains have slowed considerably, so has labor force growth. At the Dallas Fed, we estimate that the break-even level of monthly job gains needed to keep the unemployment rate constant fell from a peak of approximately 250,000 in 2023 to about 30,000 in mid-2025. Declines in immigration account for roughly half of the decline in the break-even estimate, and a lower labor force participation accounts for the rest. Research by my staff shows that a decline in immigration can also reduce demand, which offsets the reduced labor supply and leaves the economy smaller but overall balanced with little effect on inflation.\nUnemployment has drifted up only slowly, consistent with payroll gains only modestly below breakeven. The unemployment rate registered 4.3 percent in August, after hovering in a range of 4 to 4.2 percent from mid-2024 through July of this year. Other labor market indicators, such as job openings and wage growth, also point to continued gradual cooling but not a rapidly weakening labor market. As of August, there was one job opening per unemployed worker, just a bit lower than the average ratio of 1.1 from 2017 to 2019. Over the past year, employee compensation growth has been close to 3.5 percent, which is lower than during the peak inflation surge but higher than before the pandemic.\nThat said, while the increase in labor market slack to date has been incremental, I am mindful that the unemployment rate has rarely moved so gradually. Modest increases have often turned into large increases. As the labor market has cooled, its vulnerability to a very damaging, nonlinear deterioration has increased.\nHow restrictive is the policy stance?\nThe degree of restriction coming from monetary policy is difficult to measure precisely, especially in real time. On the whole, however, the state of the economy and financial conditions indicate to me the stance of monetary policy is only modestly restrictive. Quantitative economic models also support that view.\nInflation, though down substantially from the postpandemic peak, has not made meaningful further progress toward our target for the past year. That persistence is driven, in part, by core non-housing services inflation, which is linked to wage growth and the labor market. The labor market, while slowing, does not appear to have a large or rapidly increasing amount of slack. Consumption and business investment also remain resilient. More qualitatively, my contacts tell me of growing optimism, and they expect business activity to increase. Recent surveys also reflect improving sentiment. None of this is what I would expect to see if the stance of policy were more than modestly restrictive.\nIt is true that monetary policy works with a lag, so economic conditions today do not reflect the full impact of the current policy setting. But if substantially more cooling of the economy were in train, I would not have expected progress on underlying inflation to stall.\nFinancial conditions tell a similar story. Overall, rising asset prices and solid credit flows are supporting economic activity and signaling investor optimism for future economic growth. There is meaningful financial restraint in some sectors, especially housing. On the whole, though, these financial conditions do not indicate that monetary policy stance is exerting a lot of restraint on economic activity.\nAnother way to assess the restrictiveness of policy is to compare the fed funds target range to estimates of the neutral interest rate, the theoretical interest rate that would act as neither a headwind nor a tailwind to growth. The neutral rate is notoriously uncertain and difficult to measure, but you can get a sense for it from economic fundamentals, models, surveys and market prices.\nEconomists employ a range of models to try to estimate the neutral rate. Among widely consulted models, point estimates of the neutral real interest rate currently range from 0.84 percent to 2.15 percent. Adding in the 2 percent inflation target, those figures correspond to a neutral fed funds rate of 2.84 to 4.15 percent. Following the rate cut at the September FOMC meeting, the fed funds rate stands today at 4.13 percent, right at the top of that range.\nModel-based estimates can be slow to respond to structural changes in the economy. Market prices provide a helpful complement to the models because market prices should incorporate all available information and reflect whatever can be known about those structural changes as of today. The real interest rate on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities five to 10 years from now is currently around 2.3 percent, equivalent to a 4.3 percent nominal interest rate after adding in the 2 percent inflation target. Five to 10 years from now is far enough in the future to limit price impacts from the current monetary policy cycle and give an indication of where market participants expect the neutral rate to settle in the future. (Importantly, though, the neutral rate could be different today than in the future, and risk premiums and technical factors can also influence market measures.) Real five-year, five-year forward yields derived from interest rate and inflation swaps currently trade at around 1.4 percent, equivalent to a 3.4 percent nominal rate after adding 2 percent inflation. The market proxies from TIPS and swaps thus both suggest expectations for long-run neutral real interest rates that are comparable to model-based estimates and not far from the current policy rate.\nImportantly, the range of estimates of the neutral rate is quite large, as are the uncertainty bands around some of the individual estimates. In considering the appropriate stance of monetary policy, I believe it is important not to lean too heavily on any one estimate, and to formulate a plan that is robust to the uncertainty.\nThe FOMC’s recent action and the policy path ahead\nI supported the FOMC’s decision to lower the federal funds rate by 25 basis points at our September meeting. Moving the rate one notch closer to neutral provides some insurance against the downside risks to the labor market. At the same time, the stance of policy remains modestly restrictive and capable of continuing to reduce inflation to the 2 percent target.\nHowever, I will be cautious about further rate cuts. It is critical for the FOMC to keep its commitment to deliver 2 percent inflation. Achieving this will require carefully calibrating the stance of policy.\nThe gradual increase in labor market slack to date is what I expected and what is necessary to bring inflation down. Non-housing services inflation, in particular, is tightly correlated with wage growth and, ultimately, labor market tightness. With non-housing-services inflation running above the rate consistent with overall 2-percent inflation, a modest further increase in labor market slack is likely necessary to finish restoring price stability.\nIn turn, that requires maintaining at least a modestly restrictive policy stance. Yet the neutral rate is uncertain. Lowering the policy target too much would risk moving to a neutral or even accommodative stance that would prevent further progress on price stability. It will take time to observe how the economy is evolving and learn how much room there is for further cuts. We will also learn more over time about the persistence of underlying inflation and the degree of downside risk to the labor market. A cautious approach to policy will enable that learning and help balance both of the FOMC’s dual mandate goals and the risks to each of them.\nI approach the economic outlook and policy strategy with humility. Any number of economic or financial developments could require a more expeditious change in the course of policy or a fundamental rethink of the outlook. Handling those possibilities, too, calls for a learning mindset. I will continue to closely watch the economic data, financial conditions, economic models and what our surveys and contacts tell me as I assess appropriate monetary policy.\nLorie Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Navigating in shallow waters: Monetary policy strategy in a better-balanced economy\nNovember 13, 2024\nThank you, Kunal [Patel] , for the kind introduction. And welcome, everyone, to the Dallas Fed. I am so excited to be here today, to welcome my colleague Jeff Schmid, president of the Kansas City Fed, back to Dallas, and to welcome all of you to the Dallas and Kansas City Feds’ ninth joint energy conference. Thank you, as well, to the dedicated teams from Dallas and Kansas City who have worked so hard to make this event possible and to all of today’s speakers for sharing your expertise with us.\nBoth the Dallas and Kansas City banks have invested deeply in understanding the energy economy. Together, our districts empower the nation, contributing nearly 40 percent of the U.S. energy sector’s GDP. At the Dallas Fed, we’re committed to leading the energy conversation through our research at the intersection of energy and economics. That research includes academic publications,  analysis, surveys and extensive engagement with industry leaders through our Energy Advisory Council, individual outreach and conferences like this one.\nOur research teaches us that the energy landscape is constantly evolving. This year’s conference, for example, will focus on how the industry is meeting rising power demand from users such as artificial intelligence data centers that were hardly on the radar just a few years ago. Dialogue with experts like you is crucial to helping us stay abreast of these changes in real time, and I’m so grateful to all of you who share your insights. As the energy industry evolves, the topics we study cover an increasingly wide range. Just this year, the Dallas Fed’s energy team has published analysis on topics from oil sanctions against Russia to the potential for new nuclear generation in Texas . I encourage you to check out our website to access our research, view our survey findings and even sign up to participate in our energy survey panel if your firm is eligible.\nBesides energy itself , we’re devoting more attention to the wires, pipes and pumps that move energy from its sources to wherever it’s needed. There is an enormous amount of energy in West Texas, for example—in the hydrocarbons under the ground, in the wind and in the sun’s rays. But whether that energy can move out of West Texas to meet the world’s demand depends on the capacity and resilience of infrastructure such as ports, pipelines, electric grids and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities.\nAs part of my own learning about energy infrastructure, I recently visited some of our Texas ports and got to observe oil tankers and LNG carriers up close. Seeing these enormous ships in person brought to mind an essay I once read about how captains train to safely and effectively pilot them. [1] A key lesson was that the right way to maneuver a ship depends on the depth of the water. In shallow harbors, water becomes trapped between the ship bottom and the seafloor and drags along with the ship as it moves, making the vessel more difficult to steer. The faster the ship goes, the more water it displaces and the greater this difficulty becomes. Moreover, captains can’t always be sure precisely how deep the water is, because sometimes the depth finder registers mud on the seafloor as water. And so in water that’s shallow, or that might be shallow, captains learn to slow down, take their time and maneuver carefully.\nI may never have the opportunity to pilot a VLCC [2] —though if anyone here today can help me out with that, please see me afterward—but reading about this topic i sn’t purely recreational for me. These lessons also have relevance for me as a central banker.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has made a great deal of progress bringing down inflation and restoring balance to the economy. In light of that progress, I’ve supported the FOMC’s decisions at recent meetings to reduce interest rates toward a more neutral level—to dock the ship. But as the economy nears the harbor, it becomes more important to understand just how deep the water is. And with less room to maneuver, monetary policymakers need to be more prepared for winds and waves that could push us off course. Just like a ship captain, I think it behooves us to proceed cautiously at this point.\nIn the rest of my remarks, I’ll review the economic and monetary policy outlook, with an emphasis on how maneuvering cautiously and taking time to learn can help manage some key risks. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\nThe economic outlook\nThe first time I spoke at this conference was two years ago, and as I’m sure you recall, inflation back then was much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE. But as of mid-2022, prices had risen more than 7 percent since a year earlier. Soaring prices strained the budgets of families and businesses and had the potential to destabilize our economy over time.\nAt the same time, the labor market was incredibly strong—by many measures, unsustainably so. With companies adding jobs faster than the labor force was adding workers, wages surged. While those higher wages weren’t enough for many workers to keep pace with the cost of living, the wage pressures threatened to cause businesses to raise prices even more.\nThe FOMC responded by rapidly tightening monetary policy. We raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 5.25 percentage points from early 2022 through mid-2023. We also began running off securities holdings that we had accumulated to support the economy during the pandemic.\nThese measures helped bring the economy into much better balance. The most recent annual PCE inflation reading was 2.1 percent. Progress on inflation has been broad based; it’s not just a few outlying price categories that have cooled. You can see that in the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate, which removes outliers and has fallen from a peak of 5 percent two years ago to 2.65 percent on an annual basis in September. At the same time, that 2.65 percent reading suggests we’re not quite back to price stability yet. While the Fed’s inflation target covers the prices of all consumer goods and services, measures like the trimmed mean that exclude volatile outliers can provide a better read than the headline number on where overall inflation will head in the future.\nMeanwhile, economic activity remains resilient, according to both national statistics and more timely but less formal reports from business and community leaders. The Dallas Fed’s contacts overwhelmingly describe a strong economy with robust consumer demand and fading downside risks. And the labor market has been cooling gradually, not weakening materially. Unemployment held steady in October, and although strikes and hurricanes brought payroll job growth to a temporary halt that month, job gains from July through September averaged close to estimates of the amount needed to keep pace with population growth.\nAfter a voyage through rough waters, we’re in sight of the shore: the FOMC’s Congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices. But we haven’t tied up yet, and risks remain that could push us back out to sea or slam the economy into the dock too hard.\nThe economy, of course, is subject to a wide range  of risks. But I am paying particular attention to three that, in my view, pose the largest potential challenges for monetary policy in the months ahead.\nUpside risk to inflation\nFirst, returning inflation to target requires keeping aggregate demand in balance with aggregate supply. Yet strong demand persistently pushed real activity above forecasters’ projections in 2024. And the supply side of the economy, though currently healthy, has experienced unusually disruptive shocks in recent years. Both dynamics pose upside risks to inflation.\nIn late September, the Bureau of Economic Analysis issued its annual revision of the National Economic Accounts. Personal income turned out to be significantly higher than previously estimated. This finding helped explain why spending has been strong, and it resolved a mystery about the savings rate, which the data now show is at a relatively normal level rather than historically low. But higher incomes could also push consumption above current forecasts. The implications aren’t entirely clear-cut, however. If higher incomes and spending result from stronger productivity growth, they may not mean demand is moving out of balance with supply.\nI also keep hearing about a possible post-election surge in business investment. All fall, companies said they knew they were going to invest, but they were waiting to see the contours of fiscal and regulatory policies before deciding how to invest. With the election complete, some of that uncertainty is resolved. Just like consumption, a rise in investment could push upward on inflation.\nOn the supply side, I remain attentive to inflation risks from potential supply chain disruptions and geopolitical developments. The recent port strike was too short to leave a lasting mark, but workers and port operators have agreed to revisit their contract in January, so risks remain. Strains on electric grids represent another potential source of supply bottlenecks. I am also closely watching the conflict in the Middle East. As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said, while the human toll is devastating,  the Federal Reserve’s institutional role is a limited one: to monitor the economic implications. U.S. and global energy markets are somewhat slack, which has held down risk premiums in oil prices. But the potential for more significant disruptions cannot be ruled out.\nKeeping inflation under control also requires well-anchored inflation expectations. Market-based measures of shorter-term inflation compensation have been volatile recently, although longer-term measures remain consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent goal. If inflation expectations were to become unanchored, the upside risks would only increase.\nIn coming months, we’ll learn more about how inflation expectations are evolving and how the supply-side risks and consumption and investment are playing out—information that will be valuable for shaping monetary policy.\nDownside risk to employment\nA second key risk relates to employment. I’m not taking too much signal from the dismal October payrolls print of just 12,000 net jobs added nationwide. It’s too hard to tell how hurricanes influenced that number.\nMy base case is that the labor market is close to balanced and stable or cooling gradually. That judgment reflects the stable unemployment rate in recent months; the slowdown in job openings, quits and compensation; and positive reports from the Dallas Fed’s business contacts. For instance, employment at temporary help services has been sagging in the national statistics. Weak temp employment can sometimes be a leading indicator of a downturn. But when our team called staffing firms to check on the situation, they told us the statistics reflect post-pandemic normalization and competition from gig-work platforms, not a broader deterioration in the labor market.\nStill, I’m not ready to rule out more damaging decreases in employment. Some labor market indicators still show a bit of underlying weakness. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised down its estimates of payroll job growth for August and September, and you can’t wave off those revisions as the results of hurricanes and strikes that hadn’t yet happened.\nFinancial conditions represent another source of concern about the employment outlook. Monetary policy influences economic activity only indirectly, because while the FOMC controls the overnight fed funds rate, most households and businesses pay longer-term interest rates that also reflect their creditworthiness. So I closely monitor the evolution of those longer-term rates and other financial market indicators.\nSince the FOMC began cutting the fed funds target in September, the 10-year Treasury yield has actually risen by roughly three-quarters of a percentage point. Some of that rise reflects expectations for a higher path of policy rates. And, so far, higher equity valuations and tighter credit spreads have offset the tightening in financial conditions from higher Treasury yields. But a substantial fraction of the increase in long-term yields appears to reflect a rise in term premiums. Term premiums compensate investors for bearing the risk of future interest rate fluctuations. Higher term premiums can tighten financial conditions for any given setting of monetary policy and thereby slow the economy more than the FOMC intends. If term premiums continue to rise, the FOMC may need less restrictive policy, all else equal, to accomplish its goals.\nUncertainty about the neutral interest rate\nUncertainty about the neutral interest rate presents the opposite risk. Besides examining broad financial conditions, economists often consider whether monetary policy is boosting or slowing growth and inflation by comparing the policy rate to a theoretical level, the neutral rate or r-star, that would represent neither a headwind nor a tailwind. That neutral rate is notoriously uncertain and difficult to measure. But you can get a sense for it from economic fundamentals, models, surveys and market prices.\nA strategy of repeatedly lowering the fed funds target range toward a more neutral level relies on confidence that the neutral level is materially lower than where rates are now. When I look at the available evidence, though, I see substantial signs that the neutral rate has increased in recent years, and some hints that it could be very close to where the fed funds rate is now.\nStructural changes in the economy, such as the energy transition and advances in artificial intelligence, are prime drivers. These developments are fueling strong investment demand and potential increases in productivity. When you all, as energy experts, see a new  LNG plant, a solar farm or a data center under construction, you perhaps see sources of energy supply and demand. As a monetary policymaker, I certainly see how these projects change the energy landscape, but what I also see—what you’ll perhaps see after today—is higher investment and a higher neutral rate.\nImportantly, uncertainty about the neutral rate has also risen, perhaps because the structural changes in the economy are relatively recent and will take time to fully assess. The FOMC’s own projections display the uncertainty. Four times a year, we release our projections for the fed funds rate as well as unemployment, inflation and GDP growth. Around the FOMC table, participants’ projections for the longer-run fed funds rate now vary by more than 1 percentage point, compared with a spread about half as wide two years ago.\nEconomists employ a range of models to try to estimate the neutral rate. Like estimates from policymakers and from market participants who fill out surveys, the output of these models ranges widely. Among widely consulted models, point estimates of the neutral real interest rate currently range from 0.74 percent to 2.60 percent . Adding in the 2 percent inflation target, those figures correspond to a neutral fed funds rate of 2.74 to 4.60 percent. Following last week’s rate cut, the fed funds rate stands today at 4.58 percent, right at the top of that range.\nNow, I don’t know which estimate is right. Time will tell as the economy evolves and we see how much of a headwind or tailwind the policy stance generates. But when policymakers look at mid-range estimates that suggest there’s meaningful room to cut before reaching neutral, I think we should recall the technique of a ship captain whose depth finder might mistake mud for water. If we cut too far, past neutral, inflation could reaccelerate and the FOMC could need to reverse direction. In these uncertain but potentially very shallow waters, I believe it’s best to proceed with caution.\nConclusion\nLet me conclude. Economic activity is strong, inflation is coming down and the economy is approaching a point that can sustainably deliver both maximum employment and stable prices. I anticipate the FOMC will most likely need more rate cuts to finish the journey. But it’s difficult to be sure how many cuts may be needed and how soon they may need to happen. I am keeping an open mind, scrutinizing economic data and financial conditions, and listening carefully to business and community contacts as I assess what next steps may be appropriate for monetary policy.\nThank you for your attention and for joining us today. I look forward to learning from all of you during today’s discussions and to continued engagement with you about both energy topics and the broader economy.\nNotes\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and Rebecca Zarutskie for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Normalizing the FOMC’s monetary policy tools\nOctober 21, 2024\nThank you, Ken [Bentsen] .  It’s great to be back at SIFMA.\nThe last time I spoke at a SIFMA event, in April 2021, I was  serving as manager of the Federal Reserve’s System Open Market Account. I discussed how the expansion of our balance sheet to support the economy amid the pandemic  was influencing money market conditions and policy implementation.\nToday, I will return to the topics of money markets and the  Fed’s balance sheet, but from a new perspective as a policymaker and in a very  different economic environment.\nThe economy\nLet me start by reviewing the economic situation. As always,  these views are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe FOMC held the fed funds target range at the effective  lower bound from March 2020 through March 2022 to support the economy during  the pandemic, then raised the target range rapidly in 2022 and 2023 in response  to surging inflation. Last month, with inflation and employment both in  striking distance of the FOMC’s goals rather than seriously overheated, we  decided to lower the target range.\nLess-restrictive policy will help avoid cooling the labor  market by more than is necessary to bring inflation back to target in a  sustainable and timely way. In thinking about the policy choices ahead, I  continue to apply the same foundational considerations I’ve applied since I  became president of the Dallas Fed two years ago. First and foremost, I’m  committed to sustainably achieving both of the FOMC’s dual-mandate goals:  maximum employment and stable prices. I’m also carefully considering how the  risk environment affects our strategy. The appropriate policy strategy depends  on whether the path ahead is clear or cloudy. And I continue to pay close  attention to financial conditions and to the information I receive from the  Dallas Fed’s surveys, from business and community contacts, and from market  participants like you.\nTwo takeaways stand out to me from the current economic and  financial picture. First, the economy is strong and stable. But second,  meaningful uncertainties remain in the outlook. Downside risks to the labor  market have increased, balanced against diminished but still real upside risks  to inflation. And many of these risks are complex to assess and measure.\nIf the economy evolves as I currently expect, a strategy of  gradually lowering the policy rate toward a more normal or neutral level can  help manage the risks and achieve our goals. However, any number of shocks  could influence what that path to normal will look like, how fast policy should  move and where rates should settle. In my view, the FOMC will need to remain  nimble and willing to adjust if appropriate.\nBalance sheet normalization\nAs we begin to normalize the fed funds target range, we are  also continuing the process we began in 2022 of normalizing our balance sheet  by allowing longer-term asset holdings to mature.\nChanges in the fed funds target range are, as the FOMC has stated ,  our primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. With the target  range well away from the effective lower bound, at this time we can accomplish  our inflation and employment goals by adjusting the target range, while  allowing balance sheet runoff to continue smoothly in the background as we move  toward an efficient balance sheet size.\nIt's sometimes suggested that the reduction in asset  holdings works at cross purposes to the strategy of reducing policy restriction  by lowering the fed funds target range. I don’t see it that way, for two  reasons. First, we are moving the target range toward neutral from above .  The policy rate remains restrictive, which is consistent with also creating  restriction by reducing asset holdings. Second, we are now normalizing both of our policy tools. Normalizing  the fed funds rate means bringing it down from the elevated levels that were  needed to restore price stability and returning to a level that will be  consistent with sustaining maximum employment and price stability over time.  Normalizing our balance sheet means bringing our asset holdings down from the  elevated quantity that was necessary to support the economy during the pandemic  and returning to a balance sheet size that will be consistent with implementing  monetary policy efficiently and effectively. Those two normalization processes  work in tandem and are consistent in my view. A number of other central banks  are similarly reducing their asset holdings while lowering their policy rates  in response to the changing economic outlook.\nThe normalization process will affect both sides of the  Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. In the rest of my remarks, I will describe key  policy considerations that I expect to affect the path of the Federal Reserve’s  liabilities and assets in the long term, as well as some relatively near-term  considerations that may arise along the way.\nLiabilities\nLet me start with liabilities. In 2019, the FOMC decided to  implement monetary policy in the long run in a regime of ample reserves. In  this regime, the Fed supplies sufficient liquidity to meet banks’ demand with  money market rates close to the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB). The  ample reserves regime has three main benefits. It provides robust interest rate  control in an environment where both banks’ reserve demand and the autonomous  factors that drain reserves are less predictable than in the past. The ample  reserves regime also continues to effectively control interest rates when the  central bank expands its balance sheet to provide macroeconomic stimulus or  support financial stability. And, by remunerating reserves in line with other  money-like assets, the ample reserves regime ensures banks don’t pay a penalty  for appropriately managing their liquidity risk by holding reserves, the most  liquid asset there is.\nAt present, liquidity appears to be more than ample. Reserve  balances are around $3.2 trillion, compared with around $1.7 trillion in early  2020. The economy and financial system have grown, and the dash for cash at the  start of the pandemic as well as the banking stresses in March 2023 may have  led banks to increase their demand for liquidity. Still, I think it’s unlikely  banks’ liquidity demand has nearly doubled in half a decade.\nOne sign liquidity remains in abundant supply, and not  merely ample, is that money market rates continue to generally run well below  IORB. The tri-party general collateral rate (TGCR) on repos secured by Treasury  securities has been averaging 8 basis points below IORB. Because reserves and  Treasury repos are both essentially risk-free overnight assets – and reserves  are, if anything, more liquid – the spread of IORB over TGCR indicates reserves  remain in relatively excess supply compared with other liquid assets.\nThe spread between IORB and the secured overnight financing  rate (SOFR), which includes a broader set of Treasury repo transactions than  TGCR, has recently been slightly tighter than the IORB-TGCR spread. However,  some SOFR transactions include compensation for intermediating funds from the  triparty segment of the repo market to cash borrowers who lack direct access to  that segment. For this reason, I am watching TGCR for a cleaner read on  liquidity conditions in secured markets.\nUnsecured funding conditions also continue to reflect  abundant liquidity. The effective federal funds rate has been running 7 basis  points below IORB and remains insensitive to short-term fluctuations in reserve  levels.\nAnd the continuing substantial balances in the Fed’s  overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility provide another sign that liquidity  remains more than ample. The ON RRP facility accepts overnight investments from  money market funds and certain other market participants at a rate currently 10  basis points below IORB. Thus, the facility reinforces the floor on money  market rates created by IORB. Institutional and market frictions can influence  investors’ choices to place funds in the ON RRP facility versus other  instruments. However, should liquidity shortfalls emerge that create meaningful  upward pressure on money market rates, I would expect market participants to  move cash out of the facility in search of higher returns. For now, the  remaining ON RRP balances provide a buffer of additional excess liquidity.\nWe have started to see some temporary money market  fluctuations on statement dates such as the recent quarter end. As the supply  of liquidity declines, the financial system needs to redistribute liquidity to  the firms that need it most. That process isn’t always frictionless. The  emergence of month-end and quarter-end pressures appears to reflect temporary  intermediation frictions rather than shortfalls in aggregate reserve supply.  For example, on September 30 and October 1, the spread between SOFR and TGCR  widened by 7 to 12 basis points. This widening reportedly resulted from limited  balance sheet availability at dealers that intermediate between the triparty  and centrally cleared market segments.\nAs in the previous episode of balance sheet normalization in  2018 and early 2019, we are likely to continue to see occasional, modest rate  pressures as our balance sheet shrinks. Such temporary rate pressures can be  price signals that help market participants redistribute liquidity to the  places where it’s needed most. And from a policy perspective, I think it’s  important to tolerate normal, modest, temporary pressures of this type so we  can get to an efficient balance sheet size.\nIn the long run, I believe it will be appropriate for the  Federal Reserve to operate with money market rates close to, but perhaps  slightly below, IORB. As I have discussed elsewhere ,  operating with money market rates close to IORB is consistent with the Friedman  rule. In an environment where the central bank pays interest on reserves, the  Friedman rule calls for making the cost of liquidity similar across markets and  institutions by having roughly equal interest rates on reserves and comparable  instruments such as repos. I say rates should be roughly equal because  technical differences and minor competitive frictions between money markets can  justify small spreads. The last time we normalized our balance sheet, in 2016  through 2019, money market rates became notably more volatile as they moved  above the interest rate on reserves. A configuration of rates close to, but  perhaps slightly below, IORB may provide the best combination of efficiency and  effective rate control. [1]\nI also believe it will be appropriate in the long run to  operate with only negligible balances in the ON RRP facility. The facility is a  backstop tool to reinforce the floor on money market rates created by paying  interest on reserves. The lower interest rate on ON RRP balances than reserves  reflects the facility’s backstop nature. As such, meaningful ON RRP balances  should not form a permanent fixture on the Fed’s balance sheet, in my view.\nON RRP balances came down rapidly in 2022 and 2023, but the  pace of decline has slowed more recently. It is not particularly surprising  that the most elastic balances would leave the facility first. The remaining  balances may be stickier as some participants particularly value overnight  assets or face counterparty risk limits for repos in the private market. I  anticipate the remaining balances will move out of the facility as repo rates  rise closer to IORB, but if they do not, reducing the ON RRP interest rate  could incentivize participants to return funds to private markets.\nAssets\nTurning to the other side of the ledger, balance sheet  normalization also has implications for our policy choices about the  composition of the Federal Reserve’s assets and the design of our lending  facilities.\nThe FOMC has said repeatedly ,  most recently in 2022 ,  that we intend to hold primarily Treasury securities in the long run. At  present, however, we are rather far from that benchmark and not moving  appreciably closer. Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are running off slowly  because homeowners have little incentive to refinance with mortgage rates  higher than they were when we acquired most of the securities. Agency debt and  MBS currently represent 34.4 percent of the par value of our securities  holdings. That is actually up half a percentage point from the start of 2024.\nIn its most recent annual  report , the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk projected that the  share of MBS in the portfolio would not decline materially until balance sheet  normalization is complete and the Desk begins purchasing Treasuries to keep  pace with growth in reserve demand. MBS would remain more than 15 percent of  the portfolio through the end of the decade in those projections. As indicated  in the minutes of the May 2022 FOMC meeting, a number of FOMC participants have suggested it  could be appropriate at some point to sell MBS to move the mix of assets closer  to our goal. But that’s not a near-term issue in my view.\nEven with a portfolio consisting primarily of Treasuries,  the FOMC will face choices about which Treasuries to hold. I believe the two  most plausible options in the long run are for the FOMC to hold a roughly  neutral Treasury portfolio, meaning one with a maturity composition similar to  that of the Treasury universe, or to tilt toward shorter maturities. A neutral  portfolio would leave long-run decisions about the maturity composition of  government debt to the Treasury Department, as is appropriate under our  institutional separation of monetary and fiscal policy. A tilt toward shorter  maturities would allow more flexibility. Either way, the System Open Market  Account portfolio is significantly underweight Treasury bills, and its weighted  average maturity remains significantly longer than that of marketable debt  outstanding. The tradeoffs around how to move toward a more neutral portfolio  are complex and will require thoughtful policy deliberations.\nLending and funding transactions\nThe Federal Reserve’s assets also include loans we make to  depository institutions at the discount window and repo operations that deliver  liquidity to our various counterparties. Balance sheet runoff will influence  the policy choices on this component of our balance sheet as well.\nWhen reserve supply is closer to ample, individual banks  will be more likely to face payment outflows that leave them temporarily below  their desired liquidity levels. Money markets generally work well to  redistribute liquidity in those circumstances, but frictions can arise. All  banks should have strong contingency liquidity plans for addressing liquidity  shortfalls, including those that private markets cannot meet.\nIn particular, as I have said before ,  I believe every bank in the United States should be operationally ready to  access the discount window. That means completing the legal documents, making  collateral arrangements and testing the plumbing. As a longtime market  practitioner who has worked extensively on readiness for potential stress, I am  convinced banks should practice using the window before a need arises. Take out  and repay small-dollar test loans. And practice moving collateral between the  window and other collateralized funding sources, in case a scenario arises  where you can’t get the funding you want from those sources. The window is an  important tool for healthy banks to meet their liquidity needs, but it works only  when banks are ready to use it . Banks should also consider the potential  benefits of establishing access to the Standing Repo Facility (SRF).\nThe Federal Reserve’s discount window policies have been  largely unchanged for two decades, yet the structure of money markets and the  banking and financial systems has changed dramatically over that time. The FOMC  has moved from a scarce-reserves policy implementation regime, in which  liquidity was costly and banks routinely experienced small liquidity shocks, to  an ample-reserves regime, with much less costly liquidity and less frequent  shocks. Regulations, especially for large banks, changed significantly after  the Global Financial Crisis, calling for banks to manage liquidity risk much  more carefully. Reforms adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  reshaped the money market fund landscape, effectively requiring much more use  of secured transactions and shrinking the market for unsecured short-term  lending to banks. And in parallel with these policy changes, markets are moving  faster than ever before, culminating in the unprecedented speed of bank runs  that we saw in 2023.\nIn light of these environmental changes, it is important to  consider whether our discount window operations and policies should adjust to  ensure the window remains an effective tool for meeting depository  institutions’ liquidity needs and mitigating liquidity shocks that could lead  to broader financial and economic stress. Last month, the Federal Reserve Board  issued a formal Request  for Information seeking public views on how best to strengthen discount  window operations. I hope all market participants will consider commenting.  Your views are important and help us do the best job of serving the public.\nIn addition to the discount window, the SRF, the Foreign and  International Monetary Authorities Repo Facility and international dollar  liquidity swap lines are important tools for providing liquidity to the  financial system when temporary needs arise. As with the discount window, it is  important to ensure the continued effectiveness of these facilities as we move  toward ample reserves. I was pleased to see the SRF drawn on over the  quarter-end turn as market participants worked through frictions in the redistribution  of liquidity. To further enhance the effectiveness of our tools, the FOMC could consider  the benefits of centrally clearing SRF and other open market operations . Central  clearing would reduce our counterparties’ cost of intermediating funding to the  broader market. The SEC also adopted a central clearing mandate earlier this  year for many private-sector participants in the Treasury market. While that  mandate does not apply to the Fed, centrally clearing our operations on a  voluntary basis could reinforce this important market transition.\nThe primary benefit of the clearing mandate, in my view,  will be to strengthen risk management by applying the strong and uniform  requirements of central counterparties, instead of leaving risk management up  to individual firms. Broader central clearing in the private sector will also  enhance transparency. And it may reduce balance sheet costs for some  intermediaries, which could help mitigate the statement-date repo market  frictions I discussed earlier. As the industry works to implement the clearing  mandate, it will be important to design access models and operations to allow  efficient central clearing by a wide range of market participants so that the  mandate’s benefits can be fully realized. SIFMA’s work developing master  clearing agreements is an important step to support the clearing transition,  alongside the work under way at many other organizations. With the first  clearing deadline at the end of 2025, it is crucial for all market participants  to prepare.\nThank you. I would be happy to answer your questions.\nNote\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLorie K. Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Opening Remarks for 'Energy and the Economy: The New Energy Landscape' Conference\nThank you for that  introduction, Daron.\nIt’s a pleasure to  open today’s event. This is the Dallas and Kansas City Feds’ seventh joint conference  on energy, and the topic is more vital than ever. As a newcomer to this region,  where energy is so central to the economy, I’m eager to learn and delighted to  participate in this conference for the first time.\nI’d like to thank  everyone who has worked so hard to bring this event together, and particularly  thank Esther George, president of the Kansas City Fed, for her partnership on  this effort over the years. President George has been an extraordinarily  impactful leader across all aspects of the Federal Reserve’s mission during 40  years of service. She is a wise voice in our monetary policy discussions; she  has brought about a leap forward in our nation’s payments system as executive  sponsor of the forthcoming FedNow service; and she has been a strong advocate  for effective and efficient regulation of banks, especially community banks,  throughout her career. President George is retiring this January—but before  that, she is going to do us the honor of giving today’s keynote address.  Esther, I’m so grateful for everything I’ve learned from you, and I know I’m  not alone when I say we will miss you deeply.\nToday’s conference  theme is “Energy and the Economy: The New Energy Landscape.” I’d like to share  a few thoughts on energy and on the economy to begin our discussions. As  always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nEnergy prices have  been extremely volatile this year. The front-month futures  price of West Texas Intermediate oil was up more than 52 percent at points  during the year, though it has since retraced, while natural gas is up 20  percent since a year ago at the Henry Hub and 61 percent in continental Europe. Significant pressures and volatility in energy prices have  stemmed from Russia’s war against Ukraine and Russia’s weaponization of energy  exports. Although European nations have worked hard to build natural gas  inventories and make plans to conserve energy, Europe still faces a difficult  winter under even the best scenarios. This context provides daily reminders  that energy plays a critical role in economic life and national security.\nEnergy is  especially important here in the Tenth and Eleventh Federal Reserve Districts,  which together produce almost half of the nation’s energy. Texas leads the  nation in the production of oil, natural gas and wind power, and is second in  utility-scale solar installations. Our region also leads the nation in refinery  capacity and petrochemical production. In Texas, oil and gas production is a  significant employer and makes up 11 percent of state GDP and almost half of  exports. Adding in chemical products, the energy share of state exports rises  to more than 60 percent.\nThe  Dallas Fed is deeply committed to advancing the understanding of energy’s  influence on the regional, national and global economies. We do so through  our public outreach and research, including our quarterly energy survey of 200  oil and gas firms in Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Louisiana. We are  grateful to those of you who participate in the survey.\nWe  also bring people together, at events like today’s conference, our Energy  Advisory Council meetings and other important gatherings, to work through the  issues and identify constructive paths forward.\nAs Daron said, my  years of experience in finance have given me a deep understanding of the  criticality of energy markets and how events in these markets can reverberate  through the broader financial system. But I am relatively new to the real side  of the energy economy—namely, how energy is produced, distributed and consumed.  So, although I’m fortunate to have an expert energy team at the Dallas Fed and  have learned a great deal from visiting with some key energy leaders around the  Eleventh District, I look forward to listening and learning more. I am  particularly looking forward to today’s discussions and to connecting with all  of you.\nA deep  understanding of the energy ecosystem is critical so the Federal Reserve can  best accomplish core elements of our mission: setting monetary policy to  promote maximum employment and stable prices, promoting the stability and  efficiency of the financial system, and supporting community development.  Energy sector developments affect economic output, employment, inflation,  investment and credit markets. In turn, the Federal Reserve’s policies  significantly affect the energy sector, through both changes in macroeconomic  conditions and changes in financial conditions that influence investment.\nToday’s economic  conditions are complex, but they can be summarized in five words: Inflation is  much too high.\nNot only is  inflation far above the FOMC’s 2 percent target, but with aggregate demand  continuing to outstrip supply, inflation has repeatedly come in higher than  forecasters expected. This morning’s CPI [Consumer Price Index] data were a  welcome relief, but there is still a long way to go.\nPrice stability is  foundational for a healthy labor market and economy over time.\nIn short, high  inflation is a drag on our economy. The longer it continues, the worse the drag  gets, the greater the risk that high inflation becomes entrenched and the  greater the cost that must be paid to bring inflation down. The Federal Reserve  has a dual mandate for monetary policy—maximum employment and price  stability—but to achieve the maximum employment part of the mandate in a  sustainable way, I believe monetary policy must focus now on promptly restoring  price stability.\nThe FOMC has  raised its target range for the federal funds rate by 3.75 percentage points  since the start of the year, including with historically large 75-basis-point  hikes at each of the past four meetings. Financial markets are pricing in the  expectation of substantial further increases, and the FOMC is also removing  monetary accommodation by reducing our asset holdings as described in the plans  that the FOMC issued in May. As a result, broad financial conditions have  tightened significantly. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen to more than 4 percent,  compared with 1.51 percent at the start of the year, and option-adjusted yields  have reached nearly 6 percent on investment-grade corporate debt and about 9  percent on high-yield debt. Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates have climbed to  7.32 percent from 3.27 percent. Importantly, real—or  inflation-adjusted—interest rates, as measured by yields on Treasury  Inflation-Protected Securities, are significantly above zero across the yield  curve.\nThese tighter  financial conditions are beginning to bring demand back into balance with  supply, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as housing.\nSufficient  cooling of the economy will eventually bring inflation back to our target. But this process  is just getting started. The labor market remains very tight, and wages  continue to grow considerably faster than the rate that would be consistent with  2 percent inflation.\nYou may have heard  debate about whether tighter policy will imperil the financial system. It’s  important to remember that higher interest rates should cause pressures. As you  are likely well aware, some investments that had a positive net present value  at last year’s interest rates do not make sense at today’s higher rates. Some  projects will have to shut down. Financial markets, businesses and the economy  will have to adjust after so many years of near-zero rates. Such adjustments  are expected and appropriate to moderate demand and reduce inflation.\nSo far, I believe  we are seeing a normal financial market response to tighter monetary policy.  Although the cost of credit continues to rise and issuance continues to slow,  credit markets remain open for most borrowers. And while liquidity conditions  in key financial markets have been strained, those strains appear so far to  result primarily from high economic uncertainty and volatility that raises the  costs of market-making, rather than the other way around.\nAlthough inflation  poses hardships in the near term and damages the economy’s long-run strength,  falling house prices, a cooling labor market and tighter financial conditions  create hardships of their own.\nI believe that the  FOMC must do everything we can to restore the price stability that will support  a healthy economy in the long run, but we should also try, if we can, to avoid  incurring costs that are higher than necessary.\nIn my career in  financial markets, I’ve learned that financial conditions usually evolve  smoothly but sometimes deteriorate abruptly, with severe consequences for the  economic well-being of households and businesses. As financial conditions  become more restrictive, I am attentive to the potential for nonlinear and  unexpected responses to further policy tightening.\nWhile I believe it  may soon be appropriate to slow the pace of rate increases so we can better  assess how financial and economic conditions are evolving, I also believe a  slower pace should not be taken to represent easier policy. I  don’t see the decision about slowing the pace as being particularly closely  related to the incoming data. The restrictiveness of policy comes from the  entire policy strategy—not just how fast rates rise, but the level they reach,  the time spent at that level, and, importantly, the factors that determine  further increases or decreases. The FOMC can and should  adjust other elements of policy to deliver appropriately tight conditions even  as the pace slows. We must remain firmly committed to our 2 percent  inflation goal.\nI  will look to a wide range of information to assess whether policy is sufficiently  restrictive. For example, I’ll be watching the evolution of the labor market  and economy, as well as thinking about real yields and about the accuracy of  inflation forecasts, among other factors. Real interest rates remaining  significantly above zero would contribute to the slowing of demand that I  expect will reduce inflation. By contrast, inflation forecasts that  consistently miss on the low side do not foster confidence that we understand  the inflation process well enough to predict success.\nThat  is a lot of words to explain a five-word economic situation. So let me sum up.  Inflation is much too high. The FOMC must restore price stability—but must also  proceed in a way that allows us to better assess how financial and economic  conditions are evolving. That  is how we can deliver the healthier economy, with stable prices and maximum  employment, which is the Federal Reserve’s responsibility.\nThank you. I look  forward to learning from all of you today, and especially to hearing President  George’s keynote remarks over lunch.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Keynote speaker introduction  for the Chicago Payments Symposium\nOctober 08, 2025\nGood afternoon, my name is Lorie Logan, and I serve as the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nI’m happy to join you all here today at the Chicago Payments Symposium and to congratulate the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago on the 25th annual gathering of this conference. Year after year the Chicago Fed fills this room with industry leaders with a wide range of backgrounds who share a passion for the integrity, resiliency, accessibility and safety of our payments system. The connections and dialogue fostered here have made a lasting impact on the evolution of payments, and I look forward to seeing where the conversations this week lead.\nThe Fed provides payments services that are inclusive, accessible and easy to use. I sit on the Federal Reserve Banks’ Payments Committee, which oversees the reserve banks’ payments business. For many financial institutions, payments is a strategic component of their core business. And for us at the Fed, it’s a critical part of our mission. It’s an exciting time to be in payments, and the Fed is helping to drive some of the progress in this area.\nModernization\nMany of you are familiar with FedWire Funds, the Fed’s electronic funds transfer service that banks, businesses and government agencies rely on for mission-critical, large dollar same-day transactions. The service handles nearly $5 trillion a day in payments. This summer, we successfully implemented the ISO 20022 global message standard in a one-day cutover. This was important because the standard advances the modernization of payment processes by providing a common language that is easily exchanged between business and banking systems. To implement the standard, every single financial institution that sends payments on the Fed network, their technology partners and all of their systems needed to change—on the same day, at the same time, for everyone across the country. It took an entire community of people across the Fed, financial institutions, their vendors, service providers and industry partners to make it happen. Many of you here today were part of this effort, and I would like to thank you for your contributions to this success.\nWhile we’ve made significant strides in digital payment modernization, we must also recognize the importance of physical currency in the payments ecosystem. Demand remains strong for U.S. currency both domestically and globally, with more than $2.4 trillion in circulation. Cash is important for many people who lack access to financial services and continues to be a safe and stable store of value. And to anticipate possible needs, the Fed is taking a critical look at our operations and making data-driven decisions on how we will meet cash demand in the future.\nThe Federal Reserve is also in the process of replacing our high-speed currency authentication systems, which are more than 30 years old. The new machines will feature more advanced capabilities to streamline operations while ensuring the U.S. currency remains secure. In 2023, Dallas was selected as one of the four pilot sites for these new machines, and our team played an integral role in developing the procedures that support these updated systems. It’s been rewarding for us in Dallas to be part of this process and exemplify how we’re modernizing even our most traditional services.\nInnovation\nAs the Fed advances our modernization efforts, we’re simultaneously working on innovative payment solutions that address the growing demand for speed, efficiency and accessibility. Instant payments has been one of the most revolutionary developments in this space. Since the launch of the FedNow service in 2023, nearly 1,500 financial institutions (including banks of all sizes across all 50 states) and 40 service providers have joined the platform, with volumes increasing quarter over quarter.\nThe Bureau of Fiscal Service recently enabled FedNow as an option to process certain types of federal disaster relief payments. For businesses and households impacted by disasters or emergencies, the ability to quickly receive these payments is critically important. We’ve also introduced new functionality, such as the recent account activity threshold controls, that allow financial institutions to strengthen risk mitigation efforts by defining dollar value and transaction velocity thresholds based on customer segments. Next month, we plan to raise the maximum transaction limit from $1 million to $10 million to meet increased demand.\nThe Federal Reserve is also conducting research on emerging technologies. For example, we are examining tokenization, smart contracts and artificial intelligence to better understand how private sector innovators may use these tools to improve payments. In addition, this research will help us identify opportunities to enhance our critical payment infrastructures.\nSafety\nAs payments evolve, so do the associated challenges. Frauds and scams, including check fraud, are growing concerns in the industry. As an operator and catalyst for system improvements, the Federal Reserve focuses on working collaboratively with the industry to enhance payment system safety. The Fed provides risk management tools and services that participating institutions may use as part of their fraud detection, prevention and mitigation programs. In June, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued an interagency request for information to seek public input on potential actions to help consumers, businesses and financial institutions mitigate the risk of fraud. The comment period recently closed, and we are now working together to consider next steps, including what actions we at the Federal Reserve can take as a payments operator.\nWe’re continuously looking for ways to enhance the safety of the services we offer. For example, Automated Clearing House (ACH) is the Fed’s largest payment service and supports the payments business nationwide, enabling the functionality of many of the popular payment avenues we all use. The ACH network processes over 85 million transactions per day, with electronic payment transfers continually increasing in number and value. We recently introduced a feature allowing subscribers to receive notifications when our systems detect suspicious activity.\nAt the Federal Reserve we will continue to balance modernization and innovation with safety and resilience across our payments rails. Ongoing coordination and collaboration with the private sector remain essential to address challenges that emerge and to create opportunities that benefit consumers, businesses and financial institutions.\nKeynote speaker\nTo dive deeper into the emerging technologies and innovation in the digital payments landscape, we will hear from today’s keynote speaker, Jon Steitz. It is my pleasure to introduce Jon, who is the global co-head of payments at McKinsey, where he advises banks and other payment providers on consumer needs and digital innovations. Jon has made several key contributions to McKinsey’s work in this space, including guiding the launch of new digital payments products for global and domestic financial institutions. In his remarks, Jon will cover the changing payments environment with a focus on what AI and agentic commerce could mean for financial institutions and their customers. Jon holds a bachelor’s degree in molecular biophysics and biochemistry as well as a law degree from Yale University.\nPlease join me in welcoming Jon to the stage. Thank you.\nLorie Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Welcoming Remarks at Day 2 of the Technology-Enabled Disruption Conference\nMay 23, 2023\nGood morning. Thank  you for joining us for the second day of our conference on technology-enabled  disruption.\nThis is the fifth conference on this topic in a series organized by the  Atlanta, Dallas and Richmond Federal Reserve Banks. And the conversations among  business leaders, scholars and policymakers remain as dynamic and important as  ever.\nThe disruptive  potential of technology has been unusually noticeable just in the short time since  the previous conference in the series last October. After many years of  relatively under-the-radar research, generative artificial intelligence [AI] exploded  onto the public scene last November with the release of ChatGPT and, soon  afterward, a number of competitors.\nThese remarkable new  tools are already changing how companies provide customer service, how software  developers write code, how college professors grade essays and even how art is  made. However, you will be glad—I think—to know that  the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy statements are still  written entirely by humans.\nOne wonders whether,  years from now, we’ll look back at the time between this conference and the  last one as a critical turning point—a time when we first truly saw a technology  that, with its capacity to perform so many activities once thought of as  uniquely human, may fundamentally reorient the human endeavor. Or will it turn  out, instead, that generative AI is just another tool, an important one to be  sure, but no more profoundly transformative or disruptive than other important  technological tools?\nIn the financial sector, too,  the disruption of technology has been quite volatile. We’ve seen in recent  months how the combination of the rapid spread of information and the speed of  financial transactions in the digital age puts a premium on banks’ effective  management of liquidity risk. To bankers in the audience, I’d highlight a  message from remarks I made at the Texas Bankers Association last week. In this  new environment, I believe every bank should be fully prepared to borrow from  the Federal Reserve’s discount window and to test its use regularly, including  moving collateral between the Fed and the FHLBs [Federal Home Loan Banks]. It’s a sign your bank is strong, manages risk well and is  fully prepared to serve your customers’ needs.\nAs authorities  continue to learn from the recent episode, it will be valuable to examine how  supervision and regulation can best take operational readiness into  consideration. For example, an expectation that banks establish and regularly  test the discount window access could help make individual firms and the  financial system more resilient. Unlike requirements for banks to hold more  liquid assets, an expectation for discount window readiness would allow banks  to engage as much as always in the traditional business of banking—taking  deposits and making loans—that is so critical to our economy. Also, if all banks regularly tested their discount window  access, the traditional stigmas associated with borrowing from the Fed  would be further reduced.\nThere is more here  the Fed can do, too. Looking forward, the Fed should also consider expanding  the hours of operation for critical services like the discount window. Our liquidity  backstop should be available whenever banks might need it. As liquidity  increasingly becomes a 24/7/365 business, that could come to include nights,  weekends and holidays.\nThis morning,  though, I’ll focus on another aspect of innovation in financial services that  hasn’t gotten as many headlines as liquidity stresses but may be more  transformative in the long run. That is how the Federal Reserve is advancing  innovation in payments. I’ll then turn the stage over to our experts on  technological disruption. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily  those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nFedNow\nThe Federal Reserve operates part of the  nation’s payment system—a mission that is sometimes less visible than our work  on monetary policy, financial stability and community economic development but  is just as fundamental to the strength of the nation’s economy.\nThe latest addition to the Fed’s payments  infrastructure is the FedNow service—a new instant payments service that the  Fed is developing and will begin to roll out in July. FedNow will enable  financial institutions of all sizes, in every community, to provide safe and  efficient instant payment services for their depositors. Through institutions  that use FedNow, people and businesses will be able to send and receive  payments in real time. Recipients will have full and immediate access to funds.  And the service will be available around the clock and every day of the year.\nThroughout my career, increased speed has been a key  theme in financial services innovation. Algorithms  that trade in fractions of a second have replaced voice-brokered and  open-outcry markets. The settlement cycle for stock trades shortened to two  business days from three in 2017 and is scheduled next year to shorten again to  one day. The special fleet of airplanes that moved paper checks around the  country for processing has now been almost entirely replaced by much faster  image processing, and the total volume of checks processed by the Federal  Reserve is down more than 80 percent from the peak three decades ago as people  convert to electronic payments.\nBroadly available instant payments are the latest  step in this push for speed, both in the United States and around the world. Of course, wire transfers between financial  institutions are instantaneous and have been possible for decades. But enabling  consumers and businesses to instantaneously make direct payments to one another  is much newer and potentially transformative.\nThe  private sector has created a number of options for instant payments—including  tools built on existing payment rails as well as entirely new rails.\nAgainst  that backdrop, the Federal Reserve has the public responsibility of ensuring  payment services are available and accessible to all depository institutions. That  responsibility has been central to our work on many forms of payments over  time. And as the world moves toward faster payments,  we are taking that commitment to this new type of service. I see our commitment to ensuring broad and fair access  as increasingly important in maintaining a diverse, vibrant banking ecosystem  amid long-term trends toward consolidation.\nFedNow  will be the public option for financial institutions to support instant  payments for their customers. This new payment rail will work  alongside private sector rails, but the key is that this rail will ensure broad  access. All types of depository  institutions will have the option to use it—from the largest money-center banks  to the smallest banks and credit unions in rural communities.\nSome  of the use cases for instant payments are already familiar, like using an app to instantly split a restaurant bill  with a friend or getting paid immediately for your work instead of waiting for  a paycheck.\nBut  those familiar use cases are not why I see FedNow as potentially  transformative. What’s transformative is  that broad access to this new service is likely to foster all kinds of  innovations that we haven’t even thought of yet.\nWhen  email first became available to the general public, it didn’t seem like such a  big deal to many of us. We thought it was  just fine if a letter or bill took a few days to arrive through the mail. But  once email was widely available, we discovered the power of immediate  communication. Similarly, I expect that broad access to instant payments will  enable people to invent all kinds of valuable new use cases that, today, we may  not even imagine. And I think broad access is critical here because those great  ideas could come from anywhere—any bank or any customer.\nSo that FedNow can achieve  that transformative potential, I’m focused on making sure it is indeed  accessible to the financial institutions that want to use it. Many smaller  banks use third-party service providers known as core processors to connect to  payments services. The Federal Reserve is working with core processors and  other third-party technology providers to ensure banks will have the support  they need to use FedNow.\nIt will take time to get all  of the nation’s depository institutions set up for a change of this magnitude. We  are rolling out FedNow in July with some early adopters. And then we will  continue working with institutions on a rolling basis. Broad access must remain  the goal so the country can harness the full benefits of this innovation.\nConcluding remarks\nLet me conclude by briefly previewing this  morning’s sessions.\nAs we can see in the work of  the Federal Reserve and depository institutions to create and connect to  FedNow, technological innovation requires investment. That can be large-scale  financial investment by a business. Or the smaller-scale— but still very meaningful—investment  of a person working late, lonely hours to pursue their idea for making a better  future.\nIn either case, investments in innovation are  forward-looking decisions. They rely on the innovator’s belief that the  investment will ultimately pay a return.\nMacroeconomic and global uncertainty can  challenge that belief. In a world of pandemics, wars and economic volatility,  one could forgive the innovator for being a little less confident in earning a  future return. Yet a world of pandemics, wars and economic volatility is quite  likely a world that needs more innovation—not less.\nThis morning, we will hear how business  leaders and researchers resolve, or at least think about, that dilemma. Our  speakers include executives from real estate, health care and banking, as well  as scholars of firm dynamics, finance, economic growth, and research and  development. It is a testament to the importance of research to the future of  the economy that there are researchers who research research! I know we’ll all  learn a lot from these discussions.\nThanks to all of our speakers for sharing your  expertise with us. And thanks to all of you for joining us here today.\nLorie K. Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Opening remarks for panel titled ‘Post-Pandemic Challenges for Monetary Policy Implementation’\nAugust 25, 2025\nIt is an honor to participate in this conference commemorating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Banco de México. Gov. [Victoria] Rodriguez Ceja, thank you very much for inviting me. Let me note at the outset that the views I share are mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe Banco de México is a leader in the global central banking community. In 1994, the bank gained policy independence, which strengthened its ability to contain inflation. For the people of Mexico, that outcome has supported economic and financial stability. And for the world, it’s provided a strong example of the value of independent, objective monetary policymaking.\nThe bank’s thought leadership receives worldwide recognition. Banxico is a driving force behind both CEMLA, the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies, and the Bank for International Settlements Representative Office for the Americas, both based here in Mexico City.\nI greatly appreciate the warm relationship between Banxico and the Dallas Fed. The economic ties between Mexico and the Eleventh Federal Reserve District are deep and longstanding. Our two banks co-host an annual conference on international economics, along with the University of Houston. And I and our entire research and leadership teams learn a great deal from the ongoing dialogue between our institutions.\nIt is a true pleasure to celebrate your centennial with you here today and to have the opportunity to discuss the challenges of monetary policy implementation after the pandemic. This is an excellent topic for a centennial conference examining the most crucial questions in central banking. Implementing a central bank’s monetary policy efficiently and effectively is vital to the credibility of that policy and to public trust in the central bank. Yet there is no obvious single right way to implement policy. Every central bank’s operating framework reflects its history, its unique institutional context and the market environment it faces. And we learn over time. In light of both the extraordinary policy implementation actions many central banks undertook in response to the pandemic, and the changes in financial markets in recent years, now is a fitting time to take stock.\nBalance sheet normalization\nIn my view, a key current challenge of monetary policy implementation is how to return central bank balance sheets to more normal sizes and compositions following the expansions undertaken in response to the pandemic. I’ll focus my discussion on G7 central banks such as the Fed, European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of England (BoE) and Bank of Canada (BoC), which have similar approaches to monetary policy implementation and operate in broadly similar financial systems. But the challenge of balance sheet normalization applies much more broadly, as central banks across a wide range of economies expanded their balance sheets earlier this decade. I hope our conversation today will tackle approaches to normalization around the world.\nNormalization affects both sides of a central bank’s balance sheet. Let’s start with liabilities.\nMost central banks’ main liabilities are currency and bank reserves. Currency demand moves slowly, so shrinking the balance sheet typically involves reducing the quantity of reserves. The trick is how to do so without creating undue upward movement in overnight interest rates, which are the price of reserves.\nThe Fed, ECB, BoE and BoC all pay interest on reserves, and all intend to operate in the long run in a framework in which money market rates are close to the interest rate on reserves. That arrangement implements what’s known as the Friedman rule, because it minimizes banks’ opportunity cost of holding reserves. As I’ve argued elsewhere , following the Friedman rule enhances the efficiency of the banking and payments systems and supports both financial stability and effective rate control. I will refer to this type of arrangement as a regime of ample reserves. I want to emphasize that I’m intentionally not calling it a floor system, even though market rates will typically be close to the floor established by the interest rate on reserves. The central banks I’ve mentioned all also maintain lending or funding facilities that help put a ceiling on rates, such as, in the United States, the discount window and the Standing Repo Facility (SRF). Ceiling tools can play an important role in policy implementation both during and after balance sheet normalization. What defines these systems is a supply of reserves ample enough to keep market rates near interest on reserves—not that rates are necessarily pushed to the floor.\nTo keep money market rates close to interest on reserves, the central bank must supply at least as many reserves as commercial banks demand with that configuration of rates. Otherwise, money market rates will rise above the central bank’s policy target.\nThat sounds simple, but it raises several questions. How should the central bank supply the reserves? How should the central bank know how many reserves to supply? And what do we even mean by the quantity of reserves that commercial banks demand?\nThe last question holds the key to the other two.\nOn any given day, any given commercial bank has some quantity of reserves it would like to hold as a function of the spread between market interest rates and interest on reserves. When market rates rise, the bank will want to hold fewer reserves and invest more in market instruments. But a bank has limited options for adjusting its reserve holdings on any given day. It must maintain enough reserves to manage whatever liquidity risks are inherent in its current business model. If it has more than enough reserves for its liquidity needs, it could sell or lend funds to another market participant, but some of those reserves might boomerang back in the form of deposits.\nThe bank has more options for reducing its reserve demand in the long run. It can cut the interest rates it pays on deposits, so some depositors may take their funds elsewhere. And it can reconfigure its business to require less liquidity.\nMoreover, there can be distributional frictions in the banking system. When reserves drop sharply on a single day, the banks that initially lose reserves aren’t necessarily those that value reserves the least. Until the reserves redistribute, there’s a temporary increase in aggregate reserve demand.\nBottom line: as aggregate reserve levels come down, commercial banks’ short-run demand for reserves will likely be higher and less responsive to interest rate spreads than the long-run demand. When a central bank seeks to meet commercial banks’ demand for reserves, it must decide whether that means the short-run demand or the likely lower long-run demand.\nIn my view, it is preferable to aim in the long run to meet the long-run demand. Otherwise, there can be a ratchet effect.\nSince the Global Financial Crisis, central banks have repeatedly bought assets to support financial stability or stimulate the economy when overnight rates were at the effective lower bound. Particularly when stimulus is the goal, those newly acquired assets need to stay on the central bank balance sheet for some time to generate the intended benefits. But the additional reserves that fund the assets also stick around for some time. Those additional reserves tend to push market rates meaningfully below the interest rate on reserves, creating an environment where reserves are more than ample—perhaps abundant or super-abundant. And commercial banks can get used to that environment. They find it profitable to expand their deposit bases or develop business models that rely on abundant liquidity. The short-run demand curve for reserves shifts outward. Unless the central bank finds a way to return to the old long-run demand for reserves, the elevated short-run demand will become the new long-run demand. And instead of the balance sheet expansion being a temporary response to economic or financial stress, it will become permanent. Repeat that over multiple stress episodes, and you’d have a recipe for ever-expanding central bank balance sheets and no route back to normal.\nTo get back to the long-run demand curve for reserves, central banks need to bring the average level of market rates up closer to interest on reserves in a sustained way. That will give commercial banks an incentive to make the long-term adjustments that can bring reserve demand down. Importantly, market rates can fluctuate from day to day. U.S. repo rates, for example, have recently varied in a range of 10 or so basis points. So, moving the average level up closer to interest on reserves also requires some tolerance for temporary, modest moves above interest on reserves.\nWith a sustained shift up in market rates as the goal, there are two basic ways a central bank can identify how far to reduce reserves: ceiling tools and glide paths.\nIf the central bank has confidence that market participants are willing and able to access its ceiling tools, it can simply reduce reserves until the point that ceiling tools see routine use. This is basically the approach that I interpret the ECB and BoE to be following. If the economic cost of funding from the ceiling tools modestly exceeds the interest rate on reserves, banks will have an incentive to bring reserve demand back down to the long-run level. The spread between interest on reserves and the cost of funds from ceiling tools can come either from a spread between official interest rates or from other costs such as collateral haircuts.\nLet me emphasize two necessary conditions for this approach to maintain rate control. Market participants must be willing and able to access the ceiling tools when market rates exceed the ceiling tool rates. If ceiling tools are stigmatized or operationally difficult to access, market rates could spike too high. Additionally, the ceiling rates must not exceed interest on reserves by too much. Otherwise, market rates will have too much room to rise before firms will borrow from the ceiling tools.\nA complementary strategy is for the central bank to come in for a gradual landing on reserves: a glide path. By laying out a smooth path to lower reserve levels, the central bank gives market participants time to adjust to an environment of lower reserves. Along that path, ceiling tools can still contribute to rate control. And, to reach the long-run level of reserve demand, the central bank must still have some tolerance for modest, temporary rate pressures that can occur as the average level of rates moves toward interest on reserves and creates an incentive for banks to shed reserves. But the evolution of money market rates will provide important signals about when reserves are approaching the right level. The Fed and Bank of Canada have both employed what I see as variants of this strategy, and it is working well.\nThe glide path does not rely as much as the first strategy on confidence in the efficacy of ceiling tools. At the Fed, while we have made strides in enhancing the effectiveness of the discount window and Standing Repo Facility, it would be worthwhile to consider further steps, such as increasing or removing limits on the SRF’s size or centrally clearing those transactions. So, I believe bringing reserves down gradually, while also making our ceiling tools available and encouraging market participants to use them when they are economically attractive, will be an effective strategy in the United States.\nIn the U.S., repo rates have averaged about 8 basis points below interest on reserves in recent months. That tells me we have more room to reduce reserves. We could see some temporary pressure around the tax date and quarter-end in September. I was encouraged to see market participants using the SRF over the June quarter-end, and I anticipate they will similarly use our ceiling tools if necessary in September. That will allow us to continue gradually bringing reserves to a more efficient level with market rates close to, but perhaps slightly below, interest on reserves on average over time.\nLong-run reserve supply\nOnce the central bank completes the normalization process and reaches the long-run level of reserves, it must decide how to supply reserves in steady state. What fraction of reserves should be backed by outright asset holdings, and what fraction should come from ceiling tools? The Friedman rule doesn’t answer this question, because either approach can, in principle, keep market rates close to interest on reserves. Rather, one might turn to considerations of footprint and rate control.\nIt’s often asserted that a central bank should avoid having too large a footprint in financial markets. At a high level, that makes sense to me. A market economy should rely mainly on private-sector activity. But what does footprint mean? One view is that a central bank’s footprint relates to the volume of its transactions with the private sector or the number of counterparties it transacts with. In that case, the central bank can minimize its footprint by backing reserves with relatively stable outright holdings of government securities, while making relatively few loans to market participants through its ceiling tools and conducting relatively few operations to offset changes in autonomous factors that add or drain reserves. But another view is that a central bank’s footprint relates to the size of its balance sheet. If a central bank wants to minimize transactions and loans through ceiling tools, it will need to supply a buffer of extra reserves to account for uncertainty in estimates of reserve demand and absorb variability in autonomous factors. So, if you think footprint relates to balance sheet size, the central bank should supply more reserves through ceiling tools (potentially to a broader range of direct counterparties) and temporary operations and less from outright holdings.\nHow best to define footprint depends on a country’s economic, financial and institutional context. I don’t think there are universal answers that apply to all central banks. Forums like this one present valuable opportunities to learn from each other.\nRate control is a second consideration. Just as in the balance sheet normalization process, a central bank can support rate control in the long run both by offering ceiling tools and by smoothly providing enough outright reserves to reliably meet banks’ demand. If market participants are willing and able to access ceiling tools, and if the spread between interest on reserves and lending rates is not too wide, the ceiling tools will effectively cap money market rates. If the central bank prefers a wider rate spread, or if there are concerns about the usability of ceiling tools, it becomes more important to smooth reserve supply. That can require forecasting large swings in autonomous factors that add or drain reserves and preplanning purchase operations to offset them, as described in a 2019 staff memo to the FOMC. I don’t view such operations as fine-tuning reserve supply to control money market rates the way the Fed did before the Global Financial Crisis. They simply ensure a smooth and ample supply of reserves that provides a predictable operating environment for banks.\nEven if the aggregate supply of reserves is stable, payment shocks can shift substantial amounts of reserves from one bank to another on any given day. Unless the banking system efficiently redistributes reserves among banks, those shocks can temporarily raise the aggregate demand for reserves, because some reserves will be trapped at banks that don’t particularly value them. A central bank could reduce the long-run demand for reserves and enhance rate control by providing ceiling tools that help redistribute reserves. For example, if the central bank held a daily auction of a fixed quantity of discount window loans, those reserves would naturally flow to the banks that value them most.\nAssets\nLet me conclude by briefly discussing the asset side of the balance sheet. I’ve already mentioned some trade-offs between backing reserves with outright asset holdings versus loans through ceiling tools. For whatever part of its balance sheet consists of outright assets, a central bank faces additional choices about which assets to hold. While the details of these choices will necessarily depend on the specifics of a central bank’s institutional structure and market environment, a couple of principles seem to me to be relevant more universally.\nFirst, I believe a central bank’s outright asset holdings should primarily comprise whatever serves as the reference asset class in its economy. In that way, the central bank’s holdings will primarily influence broad, baseline financial conditions, rather than spreads between different markets. Treasury securities are the reference asset class in the United States. The Treasury yield curve is an economy-wide benchmark, and the market for Treasuries is as deep and liquid as they come. So it makes sense for the FOMC to hold primarily Treasuries in the long run, as we’ve repeatedly said we intend to do. (Currently, on a par basis, the Fed’s securities holdings consist of about 63 percent long-term Treasury securities, 3 percent Treasury bills and 34 percent agency mortgage-backed securities that are effectively guaranteed by the U.S. government.) In economies where the supply of government debt is smaller, or for a multinational central bank like the ECB, the reference asset could be different.\nA second principle is that, in selecting its core asset holdings, a central bank should respect the boundary between fiscal policy and monetary policy. The nature of that boundary varies across institutions, and the relevant considerations will also depend on what type of assets the central bank primarily holds. For the Fed, the question here is which Treasury securities to hold—in particular, which durations.\nThe Fed remits its net income to the Treasury. From an income perspective, while our choice about which Treasury securities to hold as assets can change our remittances, it’s a wash for taxpayers because the interest income we receive on Treasury holdings represents an interest expense for the Treasury Department.\nHowever, to the extent that Treasury doesn’t adjust its issuance to offset the Fed’s holdings, changes in the maturity composition of the Fed’s assets can change the maturity structure of the consolidated public debt . In turn, that maturity structure influences the amount of duration risk that taxpayers bear from potential interest rate fluctuations on government debt. In my view, and as I’ve said before , the maturity structure of the consolidated government debt in the U.S. is a choice for the Treasury Department, not the Fed. There are many conceivable ways to maintain that division of responsibilities. But a simple and easily communicated one would be for the Fed, in the long run, to simply make its asset purchases proportional to Treasury issuance. In the medium term, overweighting Treasury bills in our purchases could more expeditiously move our current mix of holdings closer to matching the market. The FOMC has made no decisions on the long-run composition of its Treasury holdings, and I look forward to continuing to discuss this topic with my colleagues.\nThank you.\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Opening remarks for moderated conversation at the World Affairs Council of San Antonio\nJuly 15, 2025\nThank you, Armen  [Babajanian]. Thank you all for having me.\nI’d like to begin by offering my deepest condolences to all  those who lost loved ones in the catastrophic flooding in the Texas Hill  Country earlier this month. The loss of life is heartbreaking—especially, for  me as a parent, the deaths of so many children. I take inspiration, though,  from the heroism of first responders and residents who stepped up to help and  from how communities across the area have rallied to support our neighbors.  These actions show the true character of Texas.\nIt’s a pleasure to visit the World Affairs Council of San  Antonio this evening. In cities across the United States, World Affairs  Councils promote engagement with global issues and deep community connections.  This work is so important. The Dallas Fed frequently collaborates on events  with World Affairs Councils in our region. Just last week, we partnered with  the council in Dallas–Fort Worth to host a conversation with Federal Reserve  Board Governor Chris Waller. I’m so glad to be with you here tonight, and I  hope I’ll have many opportunities to return.\nI’m grateful to have many special guests in our audience,  including current and former board members of the Dallas Fed. It means so much  to have strong community partners like our board members who represent South  Texas and who work with our branch here in San Antonio.\nI’m honored to share the stage this evening with our  distinguished moderator, Speaker [Joe] Straus. Before we sit down to talk, I would like to share some initial remarks. As  always, these are my views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal  Reserve System.\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 reserve banks that, along  with the Board of Governors in Washington, make up the Federal Reserve System.  Relative to other public institutions, the Fed has two distinctive  characteristics that are crucial to how we serve you. The Fed is not one  centralized organization but rather a federated system with deep local roots.  And in our monetary policy responsibilities, the Fed operates independently  while remaining accountable to the public.\nOur network of operations across the country provides  insights into communities’ unique economic circumstances. In the United States’  wonderfully varied economy, those perspectives help us make the best decisions  to serve the country as a whole.\nBut the Fed’s federated structure doesn’t just help us  gather information. Each reserve bank is a separate corporation with its own  board of directors. Our directors represent the public in the district. And  besides sharing perspectives on economic conditions, they hold us accountable  for serving the district well.\nTo be clear, in most of our work, the Federal Reserve  ultimately must act in unison to best serve the country as a whole. In monetary  policy, we have to set the same interest rate target for Texas as for  Tennessee. And in bank supervision, we can’t be any more or less stringent when  we examine banks in San Antonio than we are in Seattle. But our local roots  keep us accountable for including your voices in those national decisions.\nMy colleagues and I at the Dallas Fed talk frequently with  business and community leaders—as well as workers and families—to learn how  people are experiencing the economy. Those insights especially inform our  monetary policy choices, which brings me to the Fed’s second unique  characteristic, monetary policy independence.\nCongress tasked the Fed with setting monetary policy to  achieve two goals: maximum employment and stable prices. In the short run, a  central bank could always temporarily boost employment by cutting interest  rates. But over time, excessive rate cuts would trigger a spiral of inflation,  wiping out the benefits of a hot labor market. So to have a sustainably strong  economy, a central bank has to make decisions for the long run.\nCongress designed the Federal Reserve System to promote that  long-term focus. Members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the  president and confirmed by the Senate to serve 14-year terms. Reserve bank  presidents, like me, are appointed to five-year terms by our local boards of  directors, with approval by the Board of Governors. The long terms for these  roles let us choose policies that will best serve the country over time.\nWhile the Fed’s leaders aren’t up for election, we remain  accountable to the public for achieving our monetary policy goals. That  accountability comes through regular testimony to Congress, extensive public  dialogue and ultimately the regular turnover of governors and reserve bank  presidents as terms expire.\nResearch shows that central banks  perform better on inflation when they are independent from short-term political  considerations. The pattern is clear when looking around the world (perhaps a  familiar vantage point for many of you as watchers of global affairs) and over  history. And in my experience, the Fed’s combination of independence and  accountability enables us to make thoughtful, objective, technical decisions  while keeping the public interest at the center of all we do.\nThe Fed’s long-term focus shapes my thinking about monetary  policy at the current juncture.\nThe U.S. economy has been quite stable over the past year  despite substantial shifts in domestic policies and geopolitics.\nStarting with inflation, the price index for personal  consumption expenditures, or PCE, rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ended in  May, which is the most recent figure available. That’s down substantially from  the postpandemic peak of 7.2 percent. It’s still a bit above the 2 percent  target of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), though. And it’s only  slightly lower than late last spring. While the last several monthly inflation  prints have been encouraging, short streaks of good news have raised hopes  before, only to disappoint people when inflation rebounded. So I'd like to see  low inflation continue longer to be convinced.\nThis morning, we received the June data for the Consumer  Price Index, which measures a slightly different mix of prices. The details of  the CPI report suggest annual PCE inflation through June will probably move up  a bit.\nMeanwhile, the labor market remains solid. The unemployment  rate stands at 4.1 percent. Like inflation, that’s just about the same as late  last spring. Job openings, quits and businesses’ hiring and firing rates have  also been moving sideways.\nAfter cutting interest rates 100 basis points in the second  half of 2024, the FOMC has held the fed funds target range steady at 4.25 to 4.5  percent so far this year. Where policy goes from here depends not only on the  current state of the economy but also on the outlook for the future. Changes in  monetary policy take time to work their way through the financial system and  economy. So we have to set a stance of policy that makes sense for where the  economy is going, not where it’s been.\nI see two main scenarios for how the economic environment  could shape the path of policy over coming quarters. My base case is that we’ll  need to keep interest rates modestly restrictive for some time to complete the  work of returning inflation sustainably to the 2 percent target. But it’s also  possible that some combination of softer inflation and a weakening labor market  will call for lower rates fairly soon.\nLet’s walk through the case for each of those scenarios.\nWhile tariff increases have left only a modest imprint on  inflation so far, they appear likely to create additional pressure for some  time. Inventories and fixed-price contracts have helped some companies  temporarily hold the line, but higher tariffs will need to be priced in when  contracts renew and inventories run out. Tariffs on intermediate goods, such as  parts used to assemble new cars, take time to show up in the prices of finished  products. And some retailers are waiting to raise prices until they see  where tariff rates settle.\nTo forecast inflation overall, it’s helpful to set aside  categories of goods and services that have experienced unusually large price  increases or decreases. Those big swings often reverse themselves. The Dallas  Fed’s trimmed mean PCE inflation rate, which removes outliers, has historically  provided a good read on the outlook for overall inflation. Through May, the  trimmed mean stood at 2.5 percent over the past year and 2.7 percent over the  past six months. That tells me we have more ground to cover to achieve our  long-run inflation goal.\nMeanwhile, the environment appears favorable for demand to  remain resilient. Broad financial conditions are supportive of growth. The  stock market is near all-time highs. Credit spreads are near all-time lows. And  in the Dallas Fed’s most recent Banking Conditions Survey, banking executives  in the region told us loan volume and demand have picked up. Fiscal policy  appears set to be a tailwind to aggregate growth, although the effects will  vary across income levels and economic sectors. While consumer spending has  stepped down from last year’s very strong pace, the solid labor market means  household incomes are holding up.\nAll this adds up, for me, to a base case in which monetary  policy needs to hold tight for a while longer to bring inflation sustainably  back to target—and in this base case, we can sustain maximum employment even  with modestly restrictive policy.\nBut even though that’s my base case, other possibilities are  quite plausible. Inflation could turn out to be less persistent and less  responsive to tariffs. There have been slight signs of cooling in the  most recent labor data. Continuing unemployment claims have risen. And private  sector job growth stepped down in June. While firing rates are low, so are  hiring rates, which means it’s harder for people to find work when they lose  their jobs or enter the labor force. House prices dipped in recent  months, which could indicate cooling demand. Indicators of business and  consumer sentiment, including the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Survey,  have been relatively pessimistic. If households and businesses start to act on  those worries, the hard measures of economic activity could worsen. And, as  this audience knows well, against a backdrop of heightened geopolitical risks,  any number of unanticipated shocks could throw the economy off course. Outcomes  along any of these lines could shift the inflation and employment outlook and  call for reducing interest rates sooner than in my base case.\nIn setting monetary policy, we have to balance a wide range  of risks, including the risk that we misjudge which scenario the economy is in.  If we cut rates too soon, inflation could get stuck above our target, and  households and businesses might come to expect further price increases. History  teaches that when higher inflation expectations become entrenched, the road  back to price stability is longer, the labor market is weaker, and the economic  scars are deeper. Yet if we don’t cut rates soon enough, the labor market could  weaken more. Those job losses, too, would be painful. But we’d have the option  of cutting rates further to get employment back on track. For now, I believe  monetary policy is well positioned to achieve the FOMC’s goals of maximum  employment and price stability and to respond appropriately as the outlook  changes.\nThank you again for the opportunity to join you this  evening. I’d be happy to take your questions.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Opening remarks for conversation at Greater Waco Chamber\nMay 29, 2025\nThank you, Matthew [Meadors]. I’m excited to be here with you all, and I look forward to seeing the area’s continued success.\nI have the privilege of leading the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. The Dallas Fed serves all of you, and people throughout Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico, by promoting a strong economy and financial system for everyone. Before we dive into today’s conversation, I’d like to start with some background on the work we do at the Fed, why that work matters for you, and how I’m thinking about the economy right now. I’ll note that, as always, these are my views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 reserve banks that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, make up the Federal Reserve System. We are the nation’s central bank, and we perform five functions to support a strong economy for everyone in the United States:\nRelative to other public institutions, the Federal Reserve has two aspects of its structure that are unique and crucial to how we serve you. The Fed is not one centralized organization but rather a federated system with deep local roots. And in our monetary policy responsibilities, the Fed operates independently while remaining accountable to the public through elected leaders.\nLet me say more about each of those unique characteristics.\nAs I mentioned, the Federal Reserve System has 12 regional reserve banks, the one I lead in Dallas and 11 others, that serve districts around the United States. Our network of operations gives us insight into communities’ unique economic circumstances. And in our country’s wonderfully varied economy, those local insights help us make the best decisions to serve the country as a whole.\nBut it’s more than that. The 12 reserve banks are not just branch offices of a centralized agency. Each reserve bank is a separate corporation with its own board of directors. Our directors represent the public in the district, including the interests of agriculture, business, workers, consumers and banks. Directors share their perspectives with us on conditions in the district, but just as important, they hold us accountable for serving the district well. This governance gives the public of our region a say—a strong say—in how we do our work, in addition to the oversight provided by the Board of Governors in Washington.\nTo be clear, in most of our work, the Federal Reserve ultimately must act in a unified way to best serve the country as a whole. For example, in monetary policy, we have to set the same interest rate target for Texas as for Tennessee. And in bank supervision, we can’t be any more or less stringent when we examine banks in Dallas than we are in Denver.\nBut our local roots and structure keep us accountable for ensuring your voices and concerns are heard in reaching those national decisions and for delivering services effectively and efficiently to the people, banks and businesses of this region.\nI’m very proud of the work the people of the Dallas Fed do to hear your voices and gather your insights. Our network of branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso gives us a foundation to reach communities throughout the region. Each branch has a board of directors that, like the board of the head office in Dallas, keeps us accountable to the local community and updated on how the economy is evolving.\nIn 2024, our team also hosted dozens of business and community roundtables, conducted more than 800 formal outreach calls with leaders in the district, and spoke at more than 200 regional events. This two-way dialogue with people throughout the region keeps the information flowing as we work to serve you.\nAnd, we gather information systematically through our Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey, Texas Service Sector Outlook Survey, Texas Retail Outlook Survey, Energy Survey, Agricultural Survey and Banking Conditions Survey. More than a thousand business and banking executives in the region respond to these monthly and quarterly surveys, giving us a picture of economic trends that enriches the official national statistics. We share all the survey findings on our website so businesses and local leaders can use the results to inform their own decisions. In fact, the data are so useful they regularly get coverage from the national media, and the surveys even got a mention on Saturday Night Live.\nI hope those of you who lead businesses and banks are already responding to our surveys. If not, we’d welcome you to sign up by visiting dallasfed.org.\nSo what do we do with all that information? It informs how we carry out all our work, but it’s especially important for monetary policy, which brings me to the Fed’s second unique characteristic, monetary policy independence.\nMonetary policy means adjusting interest rates to influence the macroeconomy. As assigned by Congress, the Fed works to achieve both maximum employment and stable prices, meaning a 2 percent inflation rate. When we raise interest rates, that tends to slow the economy, typically reducing both inflation and employment. And when we lower interest rates, that tends to stimulate the economy, typically increasing both inflation and employment.\nDeciding what to do is easier at some times than others. When inflation is too high and the labor market is overheated, as was the case a few years ago, or when inflation is too low and the labor market is weak, as happened after the Global Financial Crisis, it’s clear which way we need to move rates to achieve our goals. At other times, inflation and employment can miss our goals in opposite directions, and then we take a balanced approach to setting policy. Regardless, the effects of rate changes take time to play out. So to get the balance right, we always have to think about where the economy is headed, not just where it is now. Regional and local insights are very helpful in that process because they’re timely and help us understand the nuances and reasons behind what we can see in national data.\nWe make monetary policy to do the best job for the country over time, in the long term, not just for the moment. This is incredibly important. In the short run, a central bank could always juice employment by cutting interest rates. People might enjoy that for a little while. But over time, excessive rate cuts would trigger a spiral of inflation. And those rising prices would wipe out whatever temporary benefits people experienced from a hot labor market. To have a sustainably strong economy, a central bank has to make decisions with the long run in mind.\nCongress designed the Federal Reserve System to promote that long-term focus while maintaining ultimate accountability to the public. Members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to serve 14-year terms. Reserve bank presidents, like me, are appointed to five-year terms by our local boards of directors, with approval by the Board of Governors. All of us serve together on the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, which meets every six to seven weeks to set monetary policy. The long terms for these roles allow us to think about which policies will best serve the country over time.\nBut while the Fed’s leaders aren’t up for election, we remain accountable to the public for achieving our assigned monetary policy goals. That accountability comes through the Fed chair’s regular, semiannual testimony to Congress; our extensive public dialogue and communications, which provide transparency into how we serve the public; and ultimately through the regular turnover of governors and reserve bank presidents as terms are completed and new leaders are appointed.\nResearch shows that central banks perform better on inflation when they are independent from short-term political considerations. The pattern is clear around the world and over history. And in my experience, the Fed’s combination of independence and accountability enables us to make thoughtful, objective, technical decisions while keeping the public interest at the center of all we do.\nNow that I’ve described how the Fed’s local roots and accountable independence help us make monetary policy to serve the nation most effectively for the long run, let me share my thinking on monetary policy in the current moment.\nAs I mentioned earlier, Congress has assigned the FOMC to pursue two goals in monetary policy: maximum employment and stable prices. At present, the labor market is strong, with unemployment hovering just above 4 percent for most of the past year. Inflation has fallen significantly from the postpandemic peak but remains somewhat above our 2 percent goal.\nBecause monetary policy takes time to influence the economy, though, the question isn’t just where the economy is today but also where it’s headed. Such forecasts are never certain. And the wide array of ongoing changes in federal policies makes the current outlook even more difficult to pinpoint.\nBut just as all of you must make decisions every day to lead your organizations without knowing the future for certain, my job as a policymaker is to make the best monetary policy decisions I can in light of the current data and the uncertainty we face. When I look ahead, I see a balance of risks. Tariffs could push up inflation, at least temporarily. And if expectations of higher inflation became entrenched, inflationary pressures could persist and become very costly to reverse. Stimulative federal fiscal policy or changes in regulations could also boost investment and consumer demand. On the other hand, economic uncertainty and financial market volatility could prompt consumers and businesses to pull back, slowing the economy. And tariffs could weigh on employment in sectors that rely heavily on imported materials.\nFor now, with the labor market holding strong, inflation trending gradually back to target, and risks to the FOMC’s objectives roughly balanced, I believe monetary policy is in a good place. It could take quite some time to know whether the balance of risks is shifting in one direction or another. But if the balance shifts, we’ll be well prepared to respond.\nThat’s an overview of how I’m thinking about the national economy, but many factors go into my outlook, so I’d be happy to take your questions.\nLorie K. Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Restoring price stability\nFebruary 14, 2023\nThank you for that kind introduction, Dean Quddus. It’s a  pleasure to be with you all this morning, and it’s so good to be here at  Prairie View A&M. I appreciate the many ways the Dallas Fed has been able  to partner with Prairie View, including the Summer Banking Academy Program, the  many students who have interned at our bank, and the graduates who are now part  of our staff. Thank you so much for this invitation to join you all at The  Hill.\nWhile today’s event was marketed as “A Conversation with Lorie  Logan,” I have to say I am extremely honored to be the one having a  conversation with Dr. Ruth Simmons. Dr. Simmons’ influence and achievements are  almost impossible to overstate. As a scholar, teacher and administrator at  universities across the country—from USC to Brown to Prairie View—she has  changed the lives of countless students. You already know the many ways she has  broken barriers. To put it simply, when the New York Times quotes Toni Morrison  describing you as “a bit of a miracle” and “an unusual combination of real  politics and integrity,” you are providing a powerful example of leadership and  service.\nDr. Simmons’ passion for education and her extraordinary career  are deeply inspiring to me and, I’m sure, to all of you.\nSo, Dr. Simmons, thanks for having me today. Thank you for your  service as a member and, now, chair of the Houston Board of Directors at the  Dallas Fed. And thanks most of all for the incredible work you have done  throughout your career to create opportunities for everyone to grow, prosper  and thrive.\nThe Federal Reserve\nWhen I think about what we do at the Federal Reserve, it’s all  about advancing an economy where everyone has opportunities to thrive.\nAt the Dallas Fed, we describe our work as “Building a Strong  Economy Together.” The Dallas Fed is one of the 12 Reserve Banks that, along  with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., make up the Federal Reserve  System. We are the nation’s central bank, and we perform five functions to  support a strong economy for everyone in the United States:\nA theme of my remarks will be that in carrying out the Federal  Reserve’s mission, we make decisions for the long term. We try to do what is  best and most sustainable for the economy over time, even when those choices  are not the easiest to make in the moment.\nThat longer-term focus will be familiar to you as college  students who have made real sacrifices to invest in your education and your  future. And that focus is particularly important to me today because of the  economic situation we are in.\nThere are many good things about the current economy.  Unemployment, for example, is at the lowest level in more than half a century.\nBut today’s economy also has flaws. Not everyone shares fully in  the benefits of economic growth. And the high rate of inflation is undermining  living standards.\nIn my view, the imbalances in the economy are not likely to be  sustainable for the long term. So I would like to share with you some thoughts  on what it will take to get to a more sustainable economy, and the Fed’s role  in that effort. As always, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my  colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nInflation\nInflation over the past two years has been much too high. The  FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for  personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, but prices have risen since January  2021 at an average annual rate of 5.5 percent.\nThis high rate of inflation challenges families and businesses  in the short run, and it weakens our economy in the long run.\nPeople’s incomes fall short of the rising cost of rent and  groceries, and increases in the cost of living have been particularly  stressful for lower-income households. Businesses can’t plan well when  they don’t know what they’ll pay for materials or be able to charge their  customers.\nAnd the longer high inflation continues, the greater the risk  that prices and wages rise just because people think inflation will remain  high. Such a spiral makes the business cycle more volatile, undermining the  long and stable expansions that particularly benefit the most vulnerable in  society.\nIn sum, price stability is foundational for a healthy economy  and labor market over time.\nNow, there has been some progress on inflation in recent months.  But the question for monetary policy is not whether there has been some  progress, but rather whether the progress will continue. Will inflation return  all the way to our 2 percent target, and will it sustainably remain there over  time?\nTo answer those questions, I find it helpful to break down some  of the components of inflation.\nAs it happens, for the last three months of 2022, headline PCE  inflation slowed to an annualized rate of 2.1 percent. However, a good bit of  that drop in inflation was due to falling prices of oil and other commodities.  Energy prices, as measured by the PCE price index for energy goods and  services, fell at a 16 percent annual rate over the last three months of 2022.  But while it’s a relief to see lower prices at the gas pump, energy prices  can’t keep falling at this rate forever.\nCore inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices,  has historically been a better guide to where overall inflation will go in the  future. And core PCE inflation was nearly 3 percent annualized for the last  three months of 2022, which is significantly higher than the inflation rate the  public is counting on us to deliver.\nTo better understand the challenge in returning inflation  sustainably to 2 percent, we can break down core inflation into a few more  pieces: core goods, which includes items like cars and clothing; housing  services, such as rent; and core services excluding housing. This last category  makes up about half of personal consumption and includes everything from health  care to transportation to entertainment.\nCore goods prices fell at a 3 percent annual rate in the last  three months of 2022, partially offsetting rapid increases in services prices.  Goods prices dropped in part because supply chains were recovering from the  disruptions of the pandemic. Supply chains can’t recover twice, so I don’t see  3 percent deflation in core goods as sustainable. It seems more likely that  core goods inflation will move up to the prepandemic trend of zero or a bit  below, which means we’ll need lower services inflation to sustain 2 percent  inflation overall.\nTurning to housing inflation, during the pandemic, the demand  for housing rose, pushing up rents and house prices. More recently, the housing  market has cooled as interest rates have risen. Because rents adjust  infrequently as leases turn over, it takes time for a cooler housing market to  translate into lower measures of housing inflation. Housing inflation was still  around 9 percent annualized for the last three months of 2022. But our research  at the Dallas Fed suggests that housing inflation should peak later this year.\nThe larger concern is with services other than housing. Core  services inflation excluding housing has been running in a range of 4 to 5  percent for close to two years, with little sign of improvement. You could say  this is the core of the inflation problem.\nIf core services inflation excluding housing remained in its  current range, while other categories returned to their prepandemic pace, total  inflation going forward would settle much closer to 3 percent than to our 2  percent goal. And depending on how the U.S. and world economies evolve,  inflation could be even higher. For example, the Dallas Fed’s business contacts  tell us that China’s rapid transition out of zero-COVID policies could drive up  commodity prices this year by more than what most people currently expect.\nBroad-based and persistent services inflation is not the result  of special circumstances like supply-chain disruptions that will eventually go  away. Rather, I see it as a symptom of an overheated economy, particularly a  tight labor market, which will have to be brought into better balance for the  overall inflation rate to return sustainably to 2 percent.\nEmployment\nThe labor market is important in its own right for monetary  policy, given the FOMC’s mandate to achieve both price stability and maximum  employment. But in addition, because services prices depend substantially on  labor costs, the outlook for sustainably returning inflation to 2 percent  hinges in large part on what happens in the labor market.\nThe job market today is incredibly strong. Last month, the U.S.  economy added 517,000 jobs. By most estimates, that’s more than five times  what’s needed to keep pace with the growth of the labor force. We shouldn’t put  too much weight on a single report, which can be driven by one-off factors. But  on average over the past half-year, the economy has added 350,000 jobs a month,  which is still very high.\nAnother sign of strength in the labor market is that as of  December, there were 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person in the United  States. That is down only slightly from the all-time high of two openings per  unemployed person last March. And it is well above the ratio of 1.2 openings  per unemployed person in 2019—which was thought at the time to be a very strong  labor market.\nThe strong labor market has been driving up wages, which have  been growing at an annual rate of about 4.5 to 5 percent by a variety of  measures.\nNow, your first thought may be that rising wages are a good  thing. If workers are earning 5 percent more, aren’t they better off? But  rising wages make workers better off only if workers can buy more goods and  services with those wages. Most workers’ wages have not risen as fast as  prices. So even though workers are taking home more dollars, their budgets are  stretched thinner and thinner.\nOver time, to be able to buy more goods and services with their  wages, workers taken together must produce more goods and services. In other  words, labor productivity must rise.\nThere is a formula for this. In the long run, if companies’  profit margins—or, more precisely, capital’s share of income—are stable, the  growth rate of prices will equal the growth rate of wages minus the growth rate  of labor productivity.\nFalling profit margins could also conceivably contribute to  lower inflation in the short run.\nBut for 5 percent wage growth to be consistent with 2 percent  inflation on a sustained basis, productivity would have to rise at a 3 percent  annual rate. Yet output per hour worked grew at an annual rate of only 1 and a  quarter percent from 2012 through 2019, and there is little indication it has  accelerated meaningfully since then.\nAbsent a dramatic rise in productivity, it seems likely that  sustainably returning inflation to 2 percent will require substantially lower  wage growth. That may take time. Respondents to the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business  Outlook Surveys expect more than 5 percent wage growth in 2023, which is down  significantly from what they saw in 2022 but still quite elevated. Wage  pressures have moderated somewhat in the latest national reports on average  hourly earnings and employment costs. I’d need to see a lot more data, though,  to be convinced the labor market is no longer overheated.\nTo achieve better balance, labor supply will have to increase,  or labor demand will have to decrease.\nLabor supply has been weak coming out of the pandemic. Early  retirements, deaths and lingering illness from the pandemic have reduced the  supply of workers. So have structural challenges like the lack of child care  for working parents. And immigration fell to nearly zero during the pandemic,  though it has since bounced back sharply. Beyond that, employers tell me that  when workers are available, they often lack the necessary training or skills.\nAddressing the structural challenges is critical for the Texas and  U.S. economies in the long run. Developing a larger, higher-skilled workforce  will help support productivity growth and ensure we have a strong economy for  everyone.\nAt the Dallas Fed, we’re committed to partnering with  communities in our region and conducting research that can inform solutions.  For example, our digital inclusion initiative is helping community leaders in  South Dallas, Ector County, El Paso County and southern New Mexico find ways to  expand affordable broadband internet access and digital skills training to  bridge the digital divide. That will allow more students to complete online  school assignments, more parents to access online job postings and more people  to participate fully in the economy. Through our Advance Together initiative, we  are also supporting public, nonprofit and business leaders who are transforming  their local education and workforce systems.\nBut efforts like these take time. So when it comes to the  current elevated inflation, the FOMC has to respond by tightening monetary  policy to reduce demand.\nInterest rates\nWhat do I mean by tightening monetary policy? The FOMC’s primary  tool is the target range for the federal funds rate, an overnight interest  rate. Since the start of 2022, we have raised this target by 4.5 percentage  points, the largest one-year increase in four decades. In addition, since last  June, we have been reducing our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed  securities.\nBoth of these tools push up interest rates for consumers and  companies throughout the economy. Financial conditions have, therefore,  tightened significantly. The 10-year nominal Treasury yield has risen about 2  percentage points, and mortgage rates have risen nearly 3 percentage points,  since the start of 2022. Importantly, in recent months, real medium-term  interest rates as measured by the yields on Treasury Inflation Protected  Securities have averaged above 1.5 percent. That is a significantly restrictive  level given that most estimates suggest the neutral real interest rate is below  1 percent.\nIn moving forward with monetary policy, we need to manage two  risks.\nThe most important risk I see is that if we tighten too little,  the economy will remain overheated and we will fail to keep inflation in check.  That could trigger a self-fulfilling spiral of unanchored inflation  expectations that would be very costly to stop.\nJust last week, the Dallas Fed’s Research Department hosted some  of the world’s leading scholars on the history of inflation. These experts had  studied experiences with high inflation in the United States, Europe and Latin  America from the 1920s through the present. They offered a wide range of views  on macroeconomics and monetary policy, and it was a stimulating debate. A key  lesson I took away was that when central banks aren’t sufficiently proactive in  addressing high inflation, the road back to price stability is longer, the  labor market is weaker, and the scars on the economy can last long after  inflation is finally reduced. We must stay focused on bringing inflation back  to target in a sustainable and timely way.\nAt the same time, if we tighten too much or too fast, we risk  seeing the labor market weaken much more than is necessary to control  inflation. Those job losses would be very costly, too, particularly for  lower-income households.\nMy own view is that, given the risks, we shouldn’t lock in on a  peak interest rate or a precise path of rates. After raising rates at a  historically rapid pace during 2022, the FOMC decided at our most recent  meeting to increase rates by a more historically typical increment of a quarter  percentage point. I anticipate we will need to continue gradually raising the  fed funds rate until we see convincing evidence that inflation is on track to  return to our 2 percent target in a sustainable and timely way.\nThe evidence I’m looking for to gain confidence in the inflation  outlook includes some further and sustained improvement in the inflation  statistics, as well as a clear change in the underlying factors—like the imbalance of aggregate supply and demand and resulting  very tight labor market—that have been producing high inflation. And I think we  need to see the economy evolving more or less as forecasts predict. When  inflation repeatedly comes in higher than the forecasts, as it did last year,  or when the jobs report comes in with hundreds of thousands more jobs than  anyone expected, as happened a couple weeks ago, it is hard to have confidence  in any outlook.\nI will also remain attentive to financial conditions.  Ultimately, conditions need to be sufficiently restrictive to restore price  stability. We must remain prepared to continue rate increases for a longer  period than previously anticipated, if such a path is necessary to respond to  changes in the economic outlook or to offset any undesired easing in  conditions. And even after we have enough evidence that we don’t need to raise  rates at some future meeting, we’ll need to remain flexible and tighten further  if changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions call for it.\nConclusion\nThe FOMC is committed to delivering a healthier economy, with  maximum employment and stable prices. And our policy strategy must be one that  will sustain those outcomes over the long run. That requires paying attention  not only to the latest wiggles in inflation and employment, but also to whether  the economy is rebalancing in a way that can last.\nThank you.\nNote\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for  assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLorie K.

    "text": "Opening remarks for the Eleventh District Banking Conference\nSeptember 17, 2024\nThank you all for joining us today for the Eleventh District Banking Conference. I'm disappointed I can't be there in person with you, as I'm in Washington for a Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Nevertheless, I appreciate the opportunity to welcome you all to the Dallas Fed and to open today's conference. As always, the views I share are my own and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nOur banking supervision team collaborated with our partners at the Texas Department of Banking to develop this summit with three goals in mind.\nAs you all know well, effectively managing risk is critical to success in banking, and it's particularly important because of the crucial position of banks in our economy.\nThe Eleventh District includes southern New Mexico, northern Louisiana and all of Texas. Our regional economy is one of the fastest growing in the nation. And integral to that growth is a large cohort of community and regional banks that help provide the resources businesses and families need to succeed, from lending to small businesses as they launch, to being among the first to support local communities after disasters such as this year's hurricane and wildfires. So it's essential for banks to effectively manage risk so they can continue providing these important services to their communities and the economy.\nI meet regularly with bankers one-on-one and in roundtables to hear what they're experiencing and how the Federal Reserve can continue to foster a strong banking system. The Dallas Fed also conducts the Banking Conditions Survey every six to seven weeks, in which we ask over 100 executives from banks and credit unions headquartered in our district to share their insights on credit and banking developments and the economy more broadly. I also meet regularly with bankers through our Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council. The council's 11 members represent institutions with less than $10 billion in assets from all parts of our district. The members share feedback on areas of focus, including regulations and exam activities. I bring these insights to my colleagues for our conversations about the Fed's approach to supervision and regulation.\nRisk management has been top-of-mind in those conversations with colleagues and bankers over the last couple of years, and I'm particularly focused on operational readiness to respond to any shocks that may occur. To maintain a dynamic banking system, we need all banks of all sizes to be resilient. In particular, well-managed banks have access to a diverse set of funding sources. And in my view, every bank in America should be fully set up at the discount window. This means completing legal documents, pledging collateral and practicing the steps needed to borrow well in advance, so the banks are prepared to use the window if needed. Banks need to be proactive about these preparations. An institution facing a rapid run won't have the luxury of waiting for setup or learning the procedures.\nWorking together with bankers, the Fed has made substantial progress toward enhanced operational readiness at the window. More than 5,000 depository institutions nationally have signed the necessary legal documents, pledging $3 trillion in collateral. This is up $1 trillion in collateral from a year earlier. And earlier this year, we launched Discount Window Direct, which is an online portal for depository institutions to use to request loans.\nIf you'd like to enhance your bank's preparations to borrow from the window, or just share feedback on how the window works, we'll have booths just outside the conference room where you can talk with our staff.\nThe Federal Reserve Board recently issued a request for information on the operational practices of the discount window. You can submit comments directly through the Federal Reserve's website. We're accepting input through the beginning of December. If you have any questions on how to submit feedback, please reach out to someone from our team for more information.\nI'm optimistic that with further modernization of our technology and policies, as well as ongoing partnerships with banks, we can ensure the discount window remains a powerful tool for providing the banking system ample access to liquidity.\nIn closing, I hope today's conference provides an opportunity for open and candid conversations about how we can work together to mitigate risks and maintain a safe and sound financial system.\nThank you to the Dallas Fed's banking supervision team for your work planning for today's conference, in addition to our partners at the Texas Department of Banking. A special thank-you to Commissioner Charles Cooper for joining.\nAnd thank you all again for taking the time to be with us today to discuss these important issues.\nLorie K. Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Sustainably restoring price stability: progress so far and risks ahead\nApril 05, 2024\nThank you for that kind introduction,  Ellen [Meade]. It’s  great to be here at Duke and to have a chance to talk about monetary policy  with one of my favorite former Federal Reserve colleagues.\nToday, I’d like to discuss the progress we’ve made toward the  Fed’s macroeconomic goals, as well as the risks ahead. The views I share are  mine and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC).\nAs you know, inflation surged in 2021 and 2022 on the heels  of the economic disruptions from the pandemic. The annual change in the price  index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) peaked at more than 7  percent, far above our 2 percent target. The FOMC responded by rapidly raising  the target range for the federal funds rate—a total of 5.25 percentage  points over a year and a half. These actions aimed to bring the  economy into better balance so we can sustainably achieve both of our Congressionally mandated goals: stable prices and maximum employment.\nWe have made substantial progress toward that objective. For  the second half of 2023, PCE inflation was just 2.1 percent, annualized.  Moreover, while the labor market cooled from its overheated pace in early 2023,  it remained strong, with the unemployment rate holding below 4 percent. The  combination of cooler inflation and still-strong economic activity in the  second half of 2023 inspired optimism that the economy was on a benign track  toward restoring price stability without too much cost to workers, businesses,  families and communities.\nIn the first two months of 2024, however, inflation data  surprised to the upside. In the rest of my remarks, I’ll assess the economic  outlook and risks in light of these recent developments. My bottom line is that  while the benign path back to price stability remains possible, I see  meaningful risks to continued progress.\nSome good news\nIt’s remarkable how resilient the economy has been to the  increases in interest rates over the past two years. While the FOMC’s rate  increases were necessary to restore price stability, the rapid pace carried a  risk of a nonlinear reaction in financial markets or the economy. This was one  reason I supported slowing the pace in late 2022 even as I remained committed  to raising rates as high as necessary to accomplish the FOMC’s dual-mandate  goals.\nAt times last year, we saw data that some interpreted as  cracks in the economy and labor market, and we heard concerns from financial  market and business contacts that a recession could be imminent. But today,  contacts consistently tell me they see a soft landing as the most likely  scenario. In the Dallas Fed’s most recent Texas Business Outlook Surveys, half  of respondents said they expect demand to pick up over the next six months. The  risk of an abrupt deterioration in economic activity appears to be fading.\nMoreover, immigration and innovation have continued to  support the supply side of the economy.\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently reported a  major upward revision in estimates of net immigration. Relative to estimates made  last year, the CBO now calculates that an additional 4 million people  immigrated to the United States from 2021 through 2023. And the CBO now  projects 4.4 million more immigrants from 2024 through 2026, again relative to  estimates made in 2023. Dallas Fed economists judge that the CBO estimates are  more of an upper bound than a mid-range estimate. The calculations assume  relatively high numbers of undetected border crossings and relatively low rates  of unmeasured return migration. Nevertheless, the inflows are clearly very  large. We’ve seen them firsthand in the Dallas Fed’s district.\nBecause many immigrants come to the United States seeking to  participate in our vibrant economy, they add significantly to the labor force.  This helps explain the combination of robust payroll growth with stable  unemployment and a less-tight labor market over the past year. The implications  for the economic outlook, of course, depend on how long this wave of  immigration continues and on whether immigration affects aggregate demand as  much as aggregate supply.\nTurning to innovation, we could also be at the beginning of  an era of stronger productivity growth.\nGiven the  uncertainties, I’m not ready to put higher trend productivity in my baseline  outlook. However, the risks to productivity appear clearly skewed to the  upside. Stronger productivity growth would open space for economic activity and  wages to rise without generating above-target inflation.\nInflation concerns\nOn the other hand, I’m increasingly concerned about upside  risk to the inflation outlook. To be clear, the key risk is not that inflation  might rise—though monetary policymakers must always remain on guard against  that outcome—but rather that inflation will stall out and fail to follow the  forecast path all the way back to 2 percent in a timely way.\nAssessing the inflation outlook can be challenging because  large swings in the prices of a few narrow categories of goods or services can  temporarily throw off the headline readings. For this reason, to judge where  overall inflation is headed, I find it helpful to look at measures that remove  outliers, like the Dallas  Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate .\nGiven the strength in the trimmed mean late last year, I had  expected inflation to firm over the first half of 2024. Even so, January’s  inflation print was disappointing. January wasn’t a story of outliers. The  entire distribution of price changes shifted to the right. Residual seasonality  could help explain the firm January data, but if so, the improvement in  inflation in the second half of 2023 was overstated.\nAnd the data for February, though better than January’s,  weren’t great. The six-month and 12-month core and trimmed mean PCE inflation  rates all landed around 3 percent, and the three-month rates were somewhat  higher.\nAgainst this backdrop  of disappointingly firm inflation data, I wasn’t surprised when a business  executive in my district shared that the company’s unions are demanding  contracts that incorporate compensation for future inflation. Reports like this  reinforce the importance of bringing inflation sustainably back to the FOMC’s 2  percent target. We need to fulfill our commitment to the public. And we need to  keep inflation expectations anchored.\nThe neutral interest rate\nBeyond the inflation data, I’m concerned that the stance of  monetary policy may not be as restrictive as most forecasts assume. I’ve  previously talked about how I assess whether broad financial conditions are  sufficiently restrictive. Today, I want to share an additional dimension of my  thinking. Economists often assess whether monetary policy is boosting or  slowing growth and inflation by comparing the policy rate to a theoretical  level, called the neutral rate, that would represent neither a headwind nor a  tailwind. Failing to recognize a sustained move up in the neutral rate could  lead to overaccommodative monetary policy.\nNow, the neutral rate—r-star for short—is notoriously  uncertain and difficult to measure. But you can get a sense of where FOMC  participants think it is by looking at the long-run projections for the fed  funds rate in our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). From mid-2019 through  the end of last year, the median of those long-run projections was almost  always 2.5 percent—implying a neutral real rate of 0.5 percent after accounting  for the 2 percent inflation target. At our most recent meeting, that median  ticked up to a 0.6 percent real rate.\nThe right tail of the distribution has spread out  considerably, though. Seven FOMC participants now project a long-run fed funds  rate of at least 3 percent—corresponding to a neutral real rate of at least 1  percent—compared with just three participants making such projections a year  ago.\nAnd, economic and financial evidence is accumulating that the  long-run neutral rate has likely moved up. I divide the evidence into three  buckets: fundamentals, model estimates and financial market prices.\nEconomic theory suggests that fundamental drivers of  investment and growth influence the neutral interest rate over time. Growing  federal deficits have greatly expanded the supply of safe assets. Meanwhile,  between the energy transition, nearshoring and the growth of AI, there are many  sources of increasingly strong investment demand. And, as I mentioned earlier,  we could be seeing the beginnings of higher productivity growth. All of these  factors should raise the neutral rate, all else equal.\nEconomists have also developed many models to estimate the  neutral real interest rate. My team and I reviewed a suite of these models. None of them gives a point estimate as low as the 0.6 percent median in the latest  SEP. Some models estimate a neutral real rate above  2 percent , corresponding to a neutral federal  funds rate above 4 percent given the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation target. All of  the model estimates are imprecise and have wide confidence intervals, however.  And some of the models technically measure a short-run concept of the neutral  rate, though in these cases the measures are highly persistent and are also  informative about the long run.\nFinally, financial market prices reveal market participants’  views on the neutral rate. The 5-year, 5-year-forward real rate on Treasury  Inflation-Protected Securities is around 2 percent.  That interest rate  incorporates a term premium that isn’t included in the neutral level of  short-term rates. But the gap to the SEP median is larger than most model-based  estimates of far-forward term premiums.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Primary  Dealers also suggests market participants expect higher real overnight rates in  the long run. The difference between respondents’ median estimates for the  long-run fed funds rate and the long-run inflation rate has risen from 0.5  percent to around 0.9 percent over the past year.\nMarkets aggregate the information of investors across the  economy. While we may not be sure exactly how much each of the fundamental  factors has moved, how those moves translate into r-star, or which model is  right, we can learn from what markets are saying about the combined effect. And,  as I formulate my views on appropriate policy, I’m taking evidence of sustained  shifts in the neutral rate into account, alongside all the other evidence on  the economic and financial outlook. Although the neutral rate is uncertain,  using the information we do have on it can help ensure monetary policy is set  so that broad financial conditions will be sufficiently restrictive to achieve  our dual-mandate goals.\nConclusion\nTo return to the big picture, the inflation concerns I just  described are upside risks, not my baseline outlook.\nNevertheless, in light of these risks, I believe it’s much  too soon to think about cutting interest rates. I will need to see more of the  uncertainty resolved about which economic path we’re on. And, as always, the  FOMC should remain prepared to respond appropriately if inflation stops  falling. A flexible approach to monetary policy will provide time to continue  assessing the data and outlook and make the best choices to sustainably achieve  both stable prices and maximum employment.\nFinally, a few words about the Fed’s asset holdings. After  acquiring close to $5 trillion in assets in 2020 through 2022 to support the  economy and the smooth functioning of financial markets amid the pandemic, the  FOMC has been allowing some assets to mature to normalize our balance sheet. We  have reduced our balance sheet by about $1.5 trillion so far.\nReducing our asset holdings also removes liquidity from the  financial system. So far, more than the entire reduction  in our balance sheet  has come out of the overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) agreement facility,  where counterparties such as money market funds can place excess cash at the  Fed. As a result, bank reserves have actually increased since 2022. But ON RRP  balances are now down to somewhat above $400 billion. Once those balances are  depleted, asset runoff will reduce bank reserves one for one, all else equal.  Moreover, the current pace of asset runoff is about twice what it was in early  2019, the last time we normalized our balance sheet. Overly rapid reductions in  bank reserves could outpace money markets’ ability to redistribute reserves to  the banks that need them most. That would risk pressures that could force us to  stop balance sheet normalization prematurely.\nWe typically announce changes in our asset redemptions in  advance to avoid disrupting the market. Yet it’s difficult to predict exactly  when ON RRP balances will be depleted, because the rate of decrease has been  volatile. It depends on many factors besides the Fed’s asset holdings—in  particular, tax payments and Treasury bill issuance, which are both in flux at  this time of year.\nSo, I believe it will soon be appropriate for the FOMC to  decide when to slow—not stop—the runoff of our asset holdings. A slower but  still meaningful pace will provide more time for banks and money market  participants to redistribute liquidity and for the FOMC to assess liquidity  conditions. It will also reduce the risk of going too far. I see this as a  technical decision to ensure effective policy implementation and support a  smooth path to an efficient balance sheet size. It should not have much effect  on broader financial conditions. And it is unrelated to considerations of the  appropriate degree of policy restriction to achieve our dual-mandate goals.\nThank you. I look forward to our conversation.\nLorie K.

    "text": "The U.S. economic outlook and monetary policy\nJanuary 18, 2023\nThank you, Dean [Lillian] Mills, for the kind introduction and the warm welcome to the University of Texas.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been tightening monetary policy for the past year to bring inflation back to our 2 percent target. One of the questions I’m asked most often is: How much more will we do? More specifically, how high will we raise interest rates? Or, as my family used to ask on our road trips back home to Kentucky: Are we there yet?\nThose of you who have taken family road trips know that, sometimes, the best way to handle this question is not to answer it.\nThe same is true today in monetary policy. Just as I was committed to completing those long drives, the FOMC is committed to reaching our goal of restoring price stability. But considering the uncertainties we face, I don’t find it particularly helpful at this time to lock in on a peak rate or the precise path rates will follow. Rather, we need to keep our eyes on the economic and financial outlook and lay out a strategy that is both flexible and robust so we are best positioned to achieve our goals however the outlook evolves.\nInflation\nInflation over the past two years has been much too high. The FOMC aims for 2 percent annual inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, but inflation has averaged 5.8 percent at an annual rate since January 2021.\nThis high rate of inflation weakens our economy. People’s incomes fall short of the cost of rent and groceries, and new research at the Dallas Fed finds that the rising cost of living is particularly stressful for lower-income households. Businesses can’t plan well when they don’t know what they’ll pay for materials or be able to charge their customers. And the longer high inflation continues, the greater the risk that prices and wages rise just because people think inflation will remain high—a spiral that would significantly increase the cost of bringing inflation down. In sum, price stability is foundational for a healthy economy and labor market over time.\nIn my view, the run-up in inflation has had two sources. Special circumstances, now mostly in the rearview mirror, pushed up prices in particular sectors, like energy, manufactured goods and housing. But inflation then spread to a broad set of services, and this broader inflation is what shapes the outlook today.\nThe pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have made energy prices remarkably volatile. In March and April 2020, as global economic activity slowed, the price of oil fell from $60 per barrel to around $20. Then, as the economy recovered while fossil fuel production remained low, the price steadily climbed through mid-2022. Last year, Russia’s war caused additional volatility around this trend. Natural gas prices have fluctuated even more, and in Texas, we’ve also seen enormous spikes in the wholesale price of electricity during some winter storms.\nEnergy prices are quite noticeable in our daily lives and quite important to the economy here in Texas, where oil and gas production makes up more than 11 percent of state GDP and half of state exports. But because energy inflation tends not to persist, the recent drop in energy prices doesn’t greatly change the inflation outlook.\nTurning to goods, responses to the pandemic disrupted global supply chains just as consumers shifted to consuming more goods and fewer services. The natural result was that prices of goods rose.\nStatistical measures suggest that supply-chain pressures peaked in December 2021 and have now recovered substantially, though not fully. Correspondingly, goods prices have started to fall. Continued recovery in supply chains should help hold down goods inflation going forward, although there are risks from China’s transition out of zero-COVID policies and the disruptions resulting from Europe’s energy crisis.\nIn the housing market, people fortunate enough to be able to work remotely during the pandemic often wanted bigger homes. They also considered locations far from their offices—in some cases, across the country. And mortgage rates fell to historically low levels in 2020 and 2021. All of this drove up demand for housing.\nBut homes can be built only so fast, so in the short run, prices soared. Austin was perhaps the national epicenter of this effect, fueled by domestic migration and the boom in technology jobs. House prices rose 58 percent here, outstripping all other major Texas metros and straining affordability for working-class and middle-class families.\nHousing prices nationally and in Austin are now cooling as mortgage rates have risen. However, our research at the Dallas Fed finds that changes in house prices take around 18 months to feed into measures of housing inflation, which are based on average rents. The main reason for the lag is that rents adjust infrequently as leases turn over. Our research suggests it could be mid-2023 or later before year-over-year housing inflation begins to fall. Still, I’m confident relief will come.\nWhat’s more concerning is the way inflation has spread to the broader economy. About half of personal consumption consists of what are called core services excluding housing. This category includes everything from health care to transportation to entertainment to dining out. Early in the pandemic, prices of nonhousing services were soft as many consumers stayed home. But as the economy reopened, inflation began to broaden. Core services inflation excluding housing has now been running in a range of 4–5 percent for close to two years, and while headline inflation has softened notably in the last few months, this category has stayed high.\nBroad-based and persistent services inflation surprised many forecasters who thought inflation would come down when shocks like supply-chain disruptions had dissipated. Moreover, it’s hard to point to special circumstances that suggest services inflation will go away on its own. Rather, I see elevated services inflation as a symptom of an overheated economy, particularly a tight labor market, which will have to be brought into better balance for the overall inflation rate to return sustainably to 2 percent.\nEmployment\nThe labor market is important in its own right for monetary policy, given the FOMC’s mandate to achieve both price stability and maximum employment. But in addition, because the tight labor market appears to be driving the broad-based services inflation we are seeing today, the outlook for inflation hinges in large part on how much and how rapidly the labor market eases.\nServices prices depend substantially on labor costs, and wages have been growing at about a 5 percent annual rate by a variety of measures. For that kind of wage growth to be consistent with 2 percent inflation over the long run, productivity would have to rise at a 3 percent annual rate. Yet output per hour worked grew at an annual rate of only 1 and a quarter percent from 2012 through 2019, and there is little indication it has accelerated since then. So, absent a dramatic rise in productivity, it seems likely that returning inflation to 2 percent will require wage growth to slow substantially. That may take time. Respondents to the Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys expect more than 5 percent wage growth in 2023, which is down significantly from what they saw in 2022, but still quite elevated.\nOther statistics also point to an unsustainably tight labor market. As of November, there were 1.7 job openings for every unemployed person in the United States. This is down from a peak of two openings per unemployed person last March but still well above the ratio of 1.2 openings per unemployed person in 2019—which was thought at the time to be a very strong labor market. Payrolls have been growing by more than 200,000 workers per month. And even without looking at the statistics, you can see how tight the labor market is when your favorite restaurant or store cuts its hours because it doesn’t have enough workers.\nBut some other information is starting to point to a slower labor market. While job growth has remained robust in the payroll survey of employers, numbers based on a household survey are significantly lower since last spring. And a much-larger dataset called the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) shows a sharp slowing in employment growth in the second quarter of last year. In fact, when benchmarking Texas jobs data to the QCEW, which the Dallas Fed does regularly, the revisions reduced Texas job growth from 4.7 percent to 3.4 percent, annualized, for the first 10 months of 2022. Some business contacts also tell me their hiring plans are slowing. In addition, wage pressures moderated in the latest national report on average hourly earnings. I’d need to see a lot more data, though, to be convinced the labor market is no longer overheated.\nTo achieve better balance, labor supply will have to increase, or labor demand will have to decrease.\nLabor supply has been weak coming out of the pandemic. The labor force is several million people below what we would have expected by now based on prepandemic trends. You might be surprised that rapidly rising wages haven’t encouraged more people to look for work, but because wages haven’t risen as fast as inflation for most workers, the incentive to work isn’t necessarily that strong. Labor supply is also held back by a substantial number of early retirements, as well as deaths and lingering illness from the pandemic and structural challenges like the lack of child care for working parents and a decrease in immigration. Beyond that, employers tell me that when workers are available, they often lack the necessary training or skills.\nWhile all these constraints are at play in Texas, the state has been a bit of an outlier. The labor force here is 5 percent above its prepandemic level, thanks to accelerating migration from other states.\nAddressing the structural challenges is critical for the Texas and U.S. economies in the long run. Developing a larger, higher-skilled workforce will help ensure we have a strong economy for everyone. At the Dallas Fed, we’re committed to partnering with communities in our region and using our research to help advance solutions. But that work takes time. So when it comes to the current elevated inflation, the FOMC has to respond by tightening monetary policy to reduce demand.\nInterest rates\nWhat do I mean by tightening monetary policy? The FOMC’s primary tool is the target range for the federal funds rate, an overnight interest rate. Since the start of 2022, we have raised this target by 4.25 percentage points, the largest one-year increase in four decades. In addition, since June 2022, we have been reducing our holdings of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities.\nBoth of these tools push up interest rates for consumers and companies throughout the economy. Financial conditions have, therefore, tightened significantly. The 10-year nominal Treasury yield is up nearly 2 percentage points, and mortgage rates are up nearly 3 percentage points, since the start of 2022. Importantly, since the September FOMC meeting, real medium-term interest rates as measured by the yields on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities have averaged above 1.5 percent. That is a significantly restrictive level given that most estimates suggest the neutral real interest rate is below 1 percent.\nIn moving forward, we need to manage two risks. And in both cases, the risk is not just that of getting a slightly different outcome than we’d prefer, because the financial system and economy sometimes shift in abrupt and nonlinear ways. The most important risk I see is that if we tighten too little, the economy will remain overheated, and we will fail to keep inflation in check. That could trigger a self-fulfilling spiral of unanchored inflation expectations that would be very costly to stop. We must stay focused on bringing inflation back to target in a timely way. At the same time, if we tighten too much or too fast, the labor market could weaken much more than is necessary to control inflation. Those job losses would be very costly, too, particularly for the most vulnerable in society.\nThere is much we don’t know about how 2023 will unfold. There is uncertainty, first of all, about how much and how rapidly the economy will respond to tighter monetary policy—the famous “long and variable lags.” We also could get good news, like an unexpected increase in labor supply or gains in productivity that would allow inflation to fall without as much slowing of economic activity. Wage pressures could ease more rapidly than expected if the labor market proves not to be as overheated as many statistics suggest. Or, less happily, challenges like new geopolitical headwinds or rising inflation expectations could emerge. Financial conditions could ease or tighten for reasons unrelated to U.S. economic developments and monetary policy, and to maintain appropriate conditions to achieve our policy goals, it might be necessary to respond with a different policy path.\nIn this environment, I believe we need a strategy that is both flexible and robust.\nTo put ourselves in the best position to manage the risks, I believe we shouldn’t lock in on a peak interest rate. Rather, we need to continually and carefully assess what the incoming data imply about the economic outlook and adjust course accordingly.\nThat assessment will not be simple. I mentioned some of the mixed messages in the labor market data, and I expect that the data and qualitative reports will become even more mixed as the economy slows.\nNow, if you’re on a road trip and you encounter foggy weather or a dangerous highway, it’s a good idea to slow down. Likewise if you’re a policymaker in today’s complex economic and financial environment. That’s why I supported the FOMC’s decision last month to reduce the pace of rate increases. And the same considerations suggest slowing the pace further at the upcoming meeting.\nTo be clear, I don’t see the argument for a slower pace as depending very much on the latest data. Nor should a slower pace signal any less commitment to achieving our inflation goal, any more than slowing the car would suggest you don’t want to get back home to Kentucky.\nA slower pace is just a way to ensure we make the best possible decisions.\nWe can and, if necessary, should adjust our overall policy strategy to keep financial conditions restrictive even as the pace slows. For example, a slower pace could reduce near-term interest rate uncertainty, which would mechanically ease financial conditions. But if that happens, we can offset the effect by gradually raising rates to a higher level than previously expected.\nMy own view is that we will likely need to continue gradually raising the fed funds rate until we see convincing evidence that inflation is on track to return to our 2 percent target in a sustainable and timely way.\nThe evidence I’m looking for to gain confidence in the inflation outlook includes some further and sustained improvement in the inflation statistics, as well as a clear change in the underlying factors—like the imbalance of aggregate supply and demand and resulting very tight labor market—that have been producing high inflation. And I think we need to see the economy evolving more or less as forecasts predict. When inflation repeatedly comes in higher than the forecasts, as it did last year, it is hard to have confidence in any outlook.\nI will also be attentive to how financial conditions respond to the economic data and monetary policy. Ultimately, financial conditions need to be sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability. Even after we have enough evidence to pause rate increases, we’ll need to remain flexible and raise rates further if changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions call for it.\nThe Fed’s balance sheet\nWhile the fed funds rate target is our primary tool, the runoff of asset holdings is another important component of tighter policy. We expanded our balance sheet during the pandemic to support economic growth and the flow of credit to households and businesses. Now that the economy has recovered, it is important to allow these assets to mature to help restore price stability.\nUnlike with the fed funds rate, we are not adjusting asset runoff in response to the economic outlook. Rather, because our assets back our liabilities, like currency and bank reserves, the path of our assets will depend on the need for those liabilities. As our assets run off, our liabilities also fall. We can continue that process as long as we are providing enough currency and reserves for the payments, banking and financial systems to function smoothly.\nJust like with interest rates, you could ask how long that is. Here, too, I think the right answer is more about strategy than numbers. Bank reserves are currently far more than ample. And more than $2 trillion of excess liquidity is parked in our overnight reverse repo facility. If we saw some modest money market rate pressures in this environment, I would not interpret it as a sign that liquidity is scarce. It would simply be an incentive for banks to redistribute liquidity where it’s needed.\nThe process of redistribution from the overnight reverse repo facility to banks won’t necessarily be perfectly smooth. Banks can’t perfectly predict deposit outflows. But over time, if a bank sees reserves fall lower than it would prefer, it can attract more funding by increasing the rates it pays on deposits or wholesale borrowing. I think it is important to allow markets to work to redistribute liquidity in this way, so that the FOMC can reduce the balance sheet to an efficient size. In addition, the Fed’s Standing Repo Facility (SRF) provides a backstop against excessive interest rate pressures or shortfalls in reserves. I would be comfortable seeing some temporary usage of the SRF while balances in the overnight reverse repo facility remain high, as part of the process of redistributing liquidity.\nWith the SRF as a backstop and the power of market incentives to redistribute liquidity, I am confident that we have room to continue running off our assets for quite some time. Exactly how long that is will depend on a careful assessment of the financial environment. The financial system is constantly evolving. We can’t pinpoint the amount of liquidity that will be needed over time. We’ll need to watch the outlook and adjust our balance sheet strategy appropriately so that liquidity levels don’t fall too low.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the FOMC is committed to delivering a healthier economy, with maximum employment and stable prices. To achieve this, I expect we will need to continue increasing the fed funds rate. In my view, we shouldn’t lock in on a peak interest rate or precise path. Instead, I believe it’s appropriate to gradually raise rates, carefully assess financial conditions and the outlook, and remain flexible to adjust as needed, so we can robustly manage the risks we face.\nThank you. I’d be happy to answer some questions.\nNote\nI am grateful to Sam Schulhofer-Wohl for  assistance in preparing these remarks.\nLorie K. Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "The case for modernizing the FOMC’s operating target rate\nSeptember 25, 2025\nThank you for inviting me to participate in this important workshop. These in-depth discussions about how the Fed implements monetary policy are incredibly valuable. I’m going to get back to the very basics: the target interest rate that policy implementation aims to control.\nAs everyone here surely knows, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) primarily adjusts the stance of monetary policy by changing the target range for the federal funds rate. For almost as long as the FOMC has issued post-meeting FOMC statements, they have reported what the committee decided about the fed funds target. And the FOMC has repeatedly affirmed the centrality of the fed funds target in establishing its policy stance.\nMy aim today is to argue that the time has come for the FOMC to prepare to target a different short-term interest rate. I will make four points.\nModernizing the target rate would not interfere with continuing to carry out the FOMC’s principles and plans for normalizing the Fed’s balance sheet. As I’ve said before, the Fed is supplying too many reserves and must bring them down to an efficient level. If anything, a more robust target rate would allow that process to proceed more smoothly.\nLet me also emphasize that modernizing the target rate would not change the FOMC’s monetary policy strategy. The operating target specifies how the FOMC measures and influences monetary conditions. It’s entirely separate from the question of how restrictive or accommodative those conditions should be to achieve the FOMC’s macroeconomic goals.\nMy remarks will cover the highlights of a longer essay that my colleague Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and I published today. Needless to say, these views are mine and not necessarily those of my FOMC colleagues.\nA very brief history of the Fed’s operating targets\nWhen the FOMC decides whether monetary conditions should tighten, ease or stay the same, it’s not enough to talk about monetary conditions in general. You need a specific, quantitative target. That target guides the concrete actions the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk will take to achieve the desired conditions. Since the mid-1990s, the target has also had a second, even more important role: to transparently communicate the stance to the public and allow the public to hold the Fed accountable for its choices.\nOver the years, the Fed has changed its operating targets to adapt to shifts in the economic and financial environment.\nIn the 1950s, when reserve requirements strongly influenced bank lending, the Fed focused on controlling the banking system’s free reserves. In the 1960s, the fed funds market was growing, and studies suggested that variables other than free reserves might have more predictable economic effects. By 1967, daily open market operations sought to control borrowed reserves and the fed funds rate.\nBy the late 1970s, policymakers thought the Fed needed to tightly control monetary aggregates to bring down inflation. The Fed moved to target reserve growth and allowed the fed funds rate to swing by as much as several hundred basis points in a day.\nThen, in the early 1980s, changes in the regulation of interest rates on bank accounts disrupted the relationship between economic activity and monetary aggregates. The FOMC reverted to targeting borrowed reserves. The Desk monitored the fed funds rate to assess whether it should add or drain reserves to hit the target.\nThroughout this history, the targets were internal, not communications vehicles. Market participants had to infer the target from the Desk’s actions.\nThat changed in the 1990s when the FOMC began issuing post-meeting statements. While the world has become accustomed to the statements giving a target for the fed funds rate, they didn’t start out that way. The first post-FOMC press release , on Feb. 4, 1994, said simply: “Chairman Alan Greenspan announced today that the Federal Open Market Committee decided to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions. The action is expected to be associated with a small increase in short-term money market interest rates.” Since January 1996 , the FOMC has announced the fed funds target rather than intended pressures on reserve supply.\nChanges in money markets since the mid-1990s\nThat was three decades ago. A lot has changed since then, and the fed funds target is showing its age.\nThe fed funds market involves unsecured loans between banks or other institutions that are eligible to hold deposits at the Fed. The fed funds rate is the average overnight rate on these loans. Besides commercial banks, the participants can include government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), particularly Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs).\nIn the mid-1990s, the fed funds rate was well suited as a guide to money market conditions. Bank reserves at the time didn’t pay interest. With market rates typically hundreds of basis points above zero, any bank that had excess reserves was highly motivated to lend them out to peers that were short of required reserves. These incentives created a vibrant unsecured interbank market where the interest rate closely reflected banks’ marginal cost of funds.\nThat is not the world we live in anymore.\nThe Global Financial Crisis (GFC) revealed many dangers. One of them is that unsecured, short-term loans between banks can amplify a crisis. Lenders can suddenly lose money because they don’t have collateral to fall back on. And borrowers can be caught short of cash if their lenders suddenly notice the risk and pull back.\nPost-GFC regulations aimed to make the financial system safer by mitigating these risks. The regulations make unsecured short-term interbank lending less attractive for banks on both sides of the loan. That’s a good thing. It keeps depositors’ money safe, and it ensures banks can keep lending to America’s families and businesses through thick and thin. But it means fed funds is no longer where banks normally look to lend or borrow short-term cash.\nAnother important change is in the way the Fed implements monetary policy. In the 1990s, the Fed kept reserve supply below the quantity banks would have wanted to hold if reserves had paid a market interest rate. That system let the New York Fed’s trading desk control money market rates by making slight adjustments in reserve supply. But the artificial scarcity had a serious cost. Scarce reserves meant banks were effectively taxed on their use of liquidity. They couldn’t serve their customers and the economy efficiently.\nIn 2008, the Fed fixed that problem. With Congress’s authorization, reserves now pay interest. And the Fed now supplies as many reserves as banks demand with market rates close to the interest rate on reserves. We call this a system of ample reserves.\nIt’s a more modern and efficient way to implement monetary policy. U.S. dollar reserves are the safest and most liquid asset in the world, an asset that greases the wheels of the banking, financial and payments systems. With ample reserves, banks don’t need to artificially economize on safety and liquidity. The financial system is more stable and resilient. Payments flow more smoothly. And by the criterion of Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, it’s efficient for society.\nBut by law, only depository institutions are legally eligible for interest on reserves. Government-sponsored enterprises aren’t. So the ample reserves regime, beneficial as it is, changed the fed funds market from one that redistributed scarce reserves and set banks’ marginal cost of funds to one where GSEs and banks primarily arbitrage access to interest on reserves. The funds rate now also reflects banks’ balance sheet costs for that arbitrage and bargaining power between banks and GSEs, not just the cost of funds. Put that together with the post-GFC banking rules, as well as reforms that made money market funds safer, and unsecured markets like fed funds just aren’t very relevant anymore.\nThe center of gravity in U.S. money markets now lies in repo markets, where loans are secured by Treasury securities or other collateral. Overnight and open-dated repo volume averages more than $4.5 trillion per day . By contrast, fed funds volume runs only a bit over $100 billion . Repo rates represent a marginal cost of funds for a wide swathe of borrowers and lenders. And a repo rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), has replaced the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) as the dominant reference rate in U.S. financial contracts.\nThe fragility of connections between fed funds and other markets\nThat said, for the moment, fed funds remains a viable target. Rates continue to transmit well between fed funds and other markets. So fed funds still gives us a good gauge of broader monetary conditions, and controlling fed funds still influences broader monetary conditions.\nBut the connection is fragile.\nFed funds already moves noticeably less than Treasury repo rates. Money market developments earlier this month provide an instructive example. In the first week of September, repo rates rose 3 to 8 basis points relative to the end of August as markets digested a settlement of Treasury securities. Repo rates partly retraced in the second week of September. Then, on September 15, a tax payment date coincided with another Treasury settlement. Tri-party repo rates rose 10 basis points to 4.50 percent, or 17 basis points above the level at the end of August. They’ve since come back down. And yet, through this entire period, until  the FOMC cut rates last Wednesday, the fed funds rate remained precisely 4.33 percent, exactly where it had been every trading day since December of last year.\nThe stability of the fed funds rate isn’t due to virtuosic open market operations by the Desk or, more generally, to the FOMC targeting fed funds. The target range is 25 basis points wide. The stability comes from concentration in the fed funds market. With only the 11 FHLBs as major lenders, and relatively few bank borrowers, fed funds relationships are long-lasting. A participant who tried to chase a few basis points from day to day would have to weigh those small profits against the risk to the relationship.\nSuch a concentrated market could abruptly grow more idiosyncratic. The Federal Home Loan Banks have been exploring options for increasing their investments in bank deposits. New early morning maturity tri-party repo products may also attract FHLBs. With only 11 FHLBs, any change could quickly reach the entire market.\nThe market is also vulnerable to any stress that leads the FHLBs to pull back on fed funds lending. We saw this in March 2023. Banking stresses led commercial banks to seek more term advances from FHLBs. The FHLBs appeared to meet those demands in part by reducing fed funds investments, and fed funds volume fell 64 percent in two business days.\nAlternative rate options\nOne might say that since all is fine for now, there’s no need to act. But if transmission between fed funds and other money markets ever broke down, we’d need to quickly find a replacement target. And I don’t think making important decisions under time pressure is the best way to promote a strong economy and financial system.\nTo fix this, the FOMC should plan ahead and prepare to transition proactively to a different rate.\nGood alternative targets are available.\nOptions fall in three broad categories. The first includes administered rates, such as interest on reserves or the rate on the Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement Facility or the Standing Repo Facility. The second category involves measures of the constellation of money market rates. And the third category entails switching to a different single market rate.\nI’m not a fan of targeting an administered rate. The FOMC should say what market conditions it’s aiming for. And the public should be able to verify the FOMC is delivering those conditions. Targeting an administered rate short-circuits that accountability: Administered rates will always be exactly what the Fed wants them to be, regardless of market conditions.\nTargeting the constellation of market rates is also unattractive. Which rates should you include? Should you weight all rates equally or count some more than others? If the FOMC refers only to a qualitative level, how can the public hold the committee accountable? To put it in technical terms, it’s a mess. Monetary policy needs to influence money market rates broadly, but the way to do that is to target a single rate that transmits well to others.\nSo which single rate is best? Overnight repo markets are the center of gravity. Within those markets, repos against Treasury collateral make the most appropriate target, because when risk-managed appropriately, they are essentially riskless.\nParticipants in dollar funding markets have widely adopted SOFR as a reference rate. It covers north of $2.5 trillion a day in overnight Treasury repos.\nBut SOFR isn’t currently a clean gauge of funding costs. SOFR combines two main market segments: tri-party repos that take place primarily between cash investors and large dealers, and centrally cleared repos that take place primarily between large dealers and smaller ones or leveraged investors. Large dealers have some market power in intermediating between the segments, so rates in the centrally cleared segment can partly reflect market power  rather than the cost of funds.\nThe tri-party general collateral rate (TGCR) is cleaner, and I think it would currently offer the best target. It incorporates more than $1 trillion a day in risk-free transactions that represent a marginal cost of funds and marginal return on investment for a large number of participants. It is calculated with a robust methodology. It transmits well across money markets.\nAnd the Fed’s existing tools already provide effective control of TGCR. Let me be clear that by control, I don’t mean pinpoint control to the basis point. In an ample reserves regime, money market rates should average close to interest on reserves, but there can be some fluctuations around that average. It would be perfectly fine, in my view, for TGCR to move up and down from day to day, much as it has for many years. After all, the target range is 25 basis points wide. A tolerance for modest volatility would allow us to maintain rate control with our current simple and efficient tools, without large, frequent or complex operations.\nThe shift in private activity toward secured markets makes it very likely, in my view, that the target rate will eventually need to change. If the target rate must change, the best time for a change would be when markets are functioning smoothly and market participants can have plenty of advance notice. Proactively adopting TGCR as the target would allow for an orderly transition. The alternative, waiting for evidence that a change is urgent, could force a rapid switch in a more challenging environment.\nAn intermediate option would be to announce a contingency plan but not implement it for the time being. That could allow more time to assess how the Securities and Exchange Commission’s mandate for broader central clearing affects the pros and cons of targeting TGCR versus SOFR. But it’s not my preferred approach, because while a contingency plan is better than no plan, it might still have to be implemented quickly in case of sudden stress.\nIn conclusion, there are many aspects of selecting an operating target that I didn’t have time to get into. So I hope you’ll read our full essay. And to reiterate, these are only my views. But I believe the FOMC should modernize the target rate.\nThank you.\nLorie Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Opening remarks for Advance Together: Celebrating the achievements of Texas community partnerships\nJuly 24, 2024\nGood afternoon, everyone. My name is Lorie Logan,  and I serve as the president and CEO of the Dallas Fed.\nI’d like to thank Governor [Michelle] Bowman for  kicking off our celebration and sharing her insights on the Federal Reserve’s  role in community development. And thank you to everyone here, including  external partners and Dallas Fed staff, for joining us today. In particular, I’d like to recognize our guests  of honor, leaders from our four Advance Together communities:\nCommunity development is one of the key  functions of the Federal Reserve. And here at the Dallas Fed, we are working to  build a strong economy where everyone has the opportunity to participate and  thrive.\nThe Dallas  Fed saw an opportunity to address institutional challenges at the heart of K-12  education and workforce development ecosystems here in the state by convening  dedicated professionals from an array of backgrounds including:\nThe diverse perspectives offered by our partners  are integral to the initiative’s work. Thank you all for your hard work over  the last four years, and congratulations on the substantial progress you’ve achieved.  Your commitment to building a brighter future for everyone in Texas is inspiring,  and it has been an honor for us to be a part of these efforts.\nThe development of Advance Together\nI’d like to share some background on why the Advance Together initiative was developed and how it came to life.\nAlthough Texas continues to stand out as one of  the fastest-growing economies in the country, it also has the 10th-highest  poverty rate in the nation. Across the state, many lower-income and  historically underserved communities face barriers that hinder economic  mobility and resilience. We see substantial disparities on indicators such as  kindergarten readiness rates, grade-based reading levels, high school  graduation rates and post-secondary-degree completion. At the Dallas Fed, we  focus a large portfolio of our community development work on educational  attainment and workforce development in hopes of closing gaps in these areas. In  developing the Advance Together initiative, we decided to keep these areas at  the forefront of our focus.\nOur  place-based community development efforts, like Advance Together, are built from  research and conversations with practitioners that show cross-sector  collaboration is key to the economic growth of communities. These  efforts support local cross-sectoral partnerships working to improve  educational and employment opportunities and outcomes for lower-income  communities, thus boosting long-term economic resilience and mobility for  individuals and families. This work reinforces our mission to build a strong  economy for all.\nEffective solutions to complex local problems in  areas like education or workforce development often rely on champions from  across the public, nonprofit and business sectors working together toward  shared goals over a sustained period of time. Advance Together is a catalyst  for this collaborative effort, coordinated by the Dallas Fed in the communities  we partner with. We provide customized guidance, technical assistance, and  trainings to our partners through our staff and external consultants. I would  like to note that the Dallas Fed does not raise funds, provide funding for  grants or participate in the selection of grantees. Rather, fundraising and  grant funding is coordinated by our external philanthropic partners to provide  grants to participating communities.\nThe Advance Together steering committee selects  grantees and manages program funding. Members of this committee include state-  and national-level workforce and education experts from the business,  nonprofit, philanthropic and public sectors.\nBefore we launched Advance Together’s pilot  round, the Dallas Fed and the steering committee explored existing cross-sector  partnerships in the state that were addressing acute education and workforce  development challenges. We identified nearly 90 coalitions during this search. While  many of these coalitions articulated ambitious goals and aligned strategies,  they [the coalitions] shared with us that their biggest challenges include a lack  of infrastructure and dedicated capacity to manage and coordinate this work. This  is where a targeted initiative like Advance Together can make a difference.\nAdvance Together strengthens local and regional  partnerships, builds collective capacity for this work, and capitalizes on the  expertise and experiences of local leaders to drive change. Through our support  and in our role as impartial, neutral conveners and researchers, we have helped  close institutional silos and elevate the work of these community partnerships  beyond individual-level impact. Our application of technical assistance at the  local level provides opportunities for communities to rally around improving  long-term economic objectives that are inclusive of lower-income people.\nCommunity impact\nWe’ve  seen meaningful impact from our pilot-round sites and substantial progress  toward their shared goals.\nA few  highlights include:\nI look forward to the Advance Together team  leaders sharing more about the site-level progress during their panel discussion  later this afternoon.\nConclusion/acknowledgements\nThe Dallas Fed’s district covers Texas, southern  New Mexico and northern Louisiana. Texas was selected as the focus for this  pilot round due to its role as the primary driver of our district’s economy and  our goal to generate state-level impact with this initiative.\nWe aspire to have Advance Together’s approach  serve as a model for communities across our district and nationwide.\nYou will hear this afternoon from an array of  leaders, including representatives from the four communities in Advance  Together’s pilot round, as well as partners who contributed to the design and  development of this initiative. I would like to thank these leaders for their  service to the community and their dedication to the next generation. I hope  their words will encourage many of you to apply for the next round of this  initiative.\nI’d also like to thank our pilot-round partners  including:\nI would also like to recognize Dallas Fed staff  members who have contributed to the development and execution of Advance  Together:\nThis initiative would not have been possible  without strategic support and guidance from our communications, legal and  procurement departments.\nFinally, I want to thank our Dallas Fed board of  directors for their support of this impactful work. In closing, I’d like to thank you all for being  here today in celebration of this tremendous effort and the accomplishments of  this team and our community partners. I’m happy to turn the mic over to Kseniya  Benderskaya now, who will share more about our Advance Together pilot-round  teams.\nLorie K. Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

Which rates should you include? Should you weight all rates equally or count some more than others? If the FOMC refers only to a qualitative level, how can the public hold the committee accountable? To put it in technical terms, it’s a mess. Monetary policy needs to influence money market rates broadly, but the way to do that is to target a single rate that transmits well to others.\nSo which single rate is best? Overnight repo markets are the center of gravity. Within those markets, repos against Treasury collateral make the most appropriate target, because when risk-managed appropriately, they are essentially riskless.\nParticipants in dollar funding markets have widely adopted SOFR as a reference rate. It covers north of $2.5 trillion a day in overnight Treasury repos.\nBut SOFR isn’t currently a clean gauge of funding costs. SOFR combines two main market segments: tri-party repos that take place primarily between cash investors and large dealers, and centrally cleared repos that take place primarily between large dealers and smaller ones or leveraged investors. Large dealers have some market power in intermediating between the segments, so rates in the centrally cleared segment can partly reflect market power  rather than the cost of funds.\nThe tri-party general collateral rate (TGCR) is cleaner, and I think it would currently offer the best target. It incorporates more than $1 trillion a day in risk-free transactions that represent a marginal cost of funds and marginal return on investment for a large number of participants. It is calculated with a robust methodology. It transmits well across money markets.\nAnd the Fed’s existing tools already provide effective control of TGCR. Let me be clear that by control, I don’t mean pinpoint control to the basis point. In an ample reserves regime, money market rates should average close to interest on reserves, but there can be some fluctuations around that average. It would be perfectly fine, in my view, for TGCR to move up and down from day to day, much as it has for many years. After all, the target range is 25 basis points wide. A tolerance for modest volatility would allow us to maintain rate control with our current simple and efficient tools, without large, frequent or complex operations.\nThe shift in private activity toward secured markets makes it very likely, in my view, that the target rate will eventually need to change. If the target rate must change, the best time for a change would be when markets are functioning smoothly and market participants can have plenty of advance notice. Proactively adopting TGCR as the target would allow for an orderly transition. The alternative, waiting for evidence that a change is urgent, could force a rapid switch in a more challenging environment.\nAn intermediate option would be to announce a contingency plan but not implement it for the time being. That could allow more time to assess how the Securities and Exchange Commission’s mandate for broader central clearing affects the pros and cons of targeting TGCR versus SOFR. But it’s not my preferred approach, because while a contingency plan is better than no plan, it might still have to be implemented quickly in case of sudden stress.\nIn conclusion, there are many aspects of selecting an operating target that I didn’t have time to get into. So I hope you’ll read our full essay. And to reiterate, these are only my views. But I believe the FOMC should modernize the target rate.\nThank you.\nLorie Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Welcoming remarks at Fed Listens: Transitioning to the postpandemic economy in the Permian Basin\nApril 20, 2023\nThank you  to Odessa College and President Gregory Williams for hosting this gathering.  And welcome, everyone. Let me note that the views I share are mine and not  necessarily those of others at the Federal Reserve.\nWe Federal  Reserve officials are famous, or perhaps infamous, for giving a lot of  disclaimers, and a lot of speeches—but today we are here to do something much  more important: to listen.\nI’m very  grateful to our panelists for taking the time to join us, and I’m really  looking forward to the insights they’ll share.\nListening  to people in communities throughout the country is so important because the  Federal Reserve’s work is all about advancing an economy where everyone has  opportunities to thrive. To do that, we need a nuanced and granular understanding  of economic issues, and we need to understand how everyone is experiencing the  economy.\nMy  colleagues and I at the Dallas Fed travel frequently throughout the Eleventh  District to engage directly with a wide variety of business and community  leaders. These conversations add color and insight to the economic statistics.\nBy combining perspectives from our contacts with rigorous  quantitative analysis, we can develop a deeper and more-inclusive understanding  of the economy and make the best decisions to serve the public. That was  true when I led the Fed’s trading desk on Wall Street, and it’s even more true  in my role here leading the Fed’s activities in Texas, northern Louisiana and  southern New Mexico.\nThe Dallas  Fed has done extensive research, for example, on the nearly 5 million young  people in the United States who are disconnected from both work and school, the  loss of potential this represents for our economy and the policies that can  help opportunity youths reengage.\nBut I  gained an even deeper appreciation of those issues after I met with city and  business leaders in San Antonio who are working to solve them and with a young  woman who had dropped out of high school but got support from a city center for  opportunity youths and is now on track to graduate from college.\nHere in  the Permian Basin, I’ve been meeting for the past couple of days with energy,  business and community leaders. This morning, I visited an elementary school  where a community partnership called the ConnEctor Task Force is working to  provide better internet access. The statistics on the 39 percent of Ector  County households that lack broadband access are clear enough. But the  importance of closing the digital divide is even more clear to me after hearing  from students how hot spots from the task force made such a difference in their  ability to prepare for class. The Dallas Fed is providing capacity-building  support and technical assistance to the task force through our digital  inclusion initiative. While the scale of this challenge is large, I am inspired  by community leaders’ collaboration to address it.\nIndeed,  promoting the economic resilience and mobility of low- and moderate-income  communities is a top priority for the Fed. So, in our conversations this  afternoon, I’m looking forward to learning more about efforts to advance  economic opportunity in the Permian through education and career readiness  programs.\nI’ll also  be listening closely to your perspectives on the economy. As you surely know,  inflation has been much too high. The Fed has raised interest rates by 4.5  percentage points over the past year to bring the economy into better balance.\nTo assess  whether we have made enough progress, I’ve been watching three markers:\nOver the  past six weeks, I’ve also been closely watching the effects of stresses in the  banking system—both on the macroeconomy and on local communities, especially  here in Texas where small and midsize banks are so important. Smaller banks are  particularly significant in small business, rural, middle-market, and  commercial real estate lending. And to have a strong economy, we need a  diverse, vibrant banking ecosystem.\nYour views  on these economic and financial considerations will be a great help in  interpreting the quantitative data we receive.\nThank  you again for joining us for this important conversation.\nLorie K. Logan is president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

Introduction\nThe Federal Reserve’s responses to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the recession, and their\naftermath included important changes in the conduct of monetary policy. The Federal Reserve\nrapidly reduced its target for the federal funds rate (FFR) to its effective lower bound, introduced\nfacilities to provide ample liquidity and to maintain the flow of credit in the economy, and\npurchased large amounts of longer-term securities. One consequence of these changes is that the\nFederal Reserve will likely need to employ new tools when it begins to raise the FFR and other\nshort-term interest rates to more normal levels.\nOne new monetary policy tool, the payment of interest on banks’ reserves held at the Federal\nReserve, has been in place since 2008. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC or\n“Committee”) has indicated that interest on reserves will play a key role during the process of\nnormalizing monetary policy (FOMC 2014c). Nonetheless, evidence in recent years indicates\nthat the payment of interest on reserves may not provide the degree of control over the FFR and\nother short-term interest rates that the Committee desires, and supplementary tools might be\nneeded to provide that level of control.\nThis need has motivated the FOMC to pursue the development of other monetary policy tools\nthat might be helpful during the policy normalization process. In July 2013, Federal Reserve\nstaff presented a proposal to the FOMC for offering reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) to a\nbroad set of counterparties, including nonbank institutions that are significant lenders in money\nmarkets (FOMC 2013a).1 In concept, this innovative approach of offering RRPs at a fixed\ninterest rate, particularly in “full allotment”—that is, satisfying any level of market demand at\nthat rate—would help to establish a firm floor on interest rates. The FOMC directed the Desk to\ntest variations of overnight (ON) RRP operations to learn how they could work in practice.\nResults of a testing exercise in place since September 2013 indicate that a facility that offers ON\nRRPs, even without providing full allotment, can help control short-term interest rates. Hence, a\nfacility that offers ON RRPs with capped allotment could play an important role during policy\nnormalization, and the FOMC has indicated that it intends to use an ON RRP facility as a\n“supplementary tool” as needed to help control the FFR (FOMC 2014c).\nIn addition to improving the FOMC’s control over short-term interest rates, an RRP facility may\nhave important secondary effects, with both positive and negative implications. In particular, an\nON RRP facility could have repercussions for financial stability. These might include beneficial\neffects arising from the increased availability of safe, short-term assets to investors with cash\nmanagement needs. However, there may be adverse effects stemming from the possibility that\nsuch a facility—particularly if it offers full allotment—could allow a very large, unexpected\nincrease in ON RRP take-up that might enable disruptive flight-to-quality flows during periods\nof financial stress. In addition, very large usage of an ON RRP facility, particularly if it were\npermanently in place, would expand the Federal Reserve’s footprint in short-term funding\nmarkets and could alter the structure and functioning of those markets in ways that may be\ndifficult to anticipate. Indeed, FOMC policymakers have expressed concerns about a sustained\n1 RRPs have long been used in monetary policy implementation. Since 2009, the FOMC has undertaken\npreparations for the possibility of using RRPs on a larger scale.\nPage 1\n\nexpansion of the Federal Reserve’s role in financial intermediation and the risk that ON RRPs\nmight magnify strains in short-term funding markets during periods of financial stress (FOMC\n2014a,b).\nA broad understanding of an ON RRP facility’s promise as a monetary policy tool, as well as its\npossible secondary effects—including both salutary and undesirable consequences—is therefore\nimportant as the FOMC develops plans for the normalization process and determines both the\nrole and the specific features of an ON RRP facility. Those provisions might include features\nthat would mitigate undesirable effects. For example, the FOMC has already indicated in its\nPolicy Normalization Principles and Plans that the facility will be phased out when it is no longer\nneeded to help control the FFR, and its temporary nature should mitigate some concerns about\nimpacts on short-term funding markets (FOMC 2014c). In addition, caps on ON RRP usage\ncould be imposed to limit the Federal Reserve’s footprint in short-term funding markets or to\ncontain potentially destabilizing inflows into the facility during periods of financial stress.\nAt the same time, there may be tradeoffs associated with ON RRP facility design features. For\nexample, caps on ON RRP take-up that are too tight would reduce the degree of control a facility\nprovides over short-term interest rates. Hence, the design of the facility will require a balancing\nof the tradeoffs involved in achieving the necessary degree of interest-rate control while\naddressing concerns about secondary effects. Notably, FOMC policymakers have generally\nagreed that it will be very important for the commencement of policy normalization to proceed\nsuccessfully, and they have indicated that they will be prepared to take the steps necessary to\nensure that the federal funds rate will trade within the target range established by the Committee\n(FOMC 2015).\nThis paper explains the potential usefulness of an ON RRP facility for implementing monetary\npolicy during the normalization process, describes some possible secondary effects associated\nwith ON RRPs, outlines some potential design features that could address effects that may be\nundesirable, and discusses tradeoffs involved in addressing those effects. The paper is organized\nas follows. Section 2 reviews recent changes in monetary policy that have led to the\ndevelopment and testing of an ON RRP facility as a monetary policy tool. We also describe the\nFOMC’s announced intentions for such a facility and summarize the results of an ON RRP\ntesting exercise that has been in place since September 2013. Section 3 examines some\npotentially important secondary effects of an ON RRP facility, including both positive and\nnegative impacts on financial stability. In section 4, we analyze ways in which an ON RRP\nfacility might be designed to mitigate secondary effects that could be undesirable. Section 5\ndiscusses tradeoffs that policymakers may face in designing an ON RRP facility, as they seek to\nbalance the objectives of setting an effective floor on money market rates and limiting any\nadverse effects. Section 6 offers some conclusions.\n2. The ON RRP facility and its potential usefulness as a monetary policy tool\nThis section briefly describes the policy context for the development and testing of an ON RRP\nfacility as a monetary policy tool and explains the rationale behind that facility. We also\nsummarize the FOMC’s announced intentions regarding the use of an ON RRP facility and\nreview some results of an ON RRP testing exercise that has been in place since September 2013.\nPage 2\n\nThese tests indicate that ON RRPs may be helpful in controlling short-term interest rates when\nthe FOMC decides to begin raising the target range for the FFR.\n2.1. The operating framework for monetary policy before the financial crisis\nBefore the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the FOMC conducted monetary policy by setting a target\nfor the overnight FFR—the interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserves for one\nday to other depository institutions—in order to influence the pricing of credit.2 Movements in\nthe FFR influenced other short-term interest rates, which, in turn, affected borrowing costs for\nhouseholds and businesses and financial conditions more broadly.\nDuring this time, the Open Market Trading Desk (“the Desk”) at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York implemented the FOMC’s interest rate policy primarily by controlling the supply of\nreserves in the banking system. The Federal Reserve established a baseline demand for reserves\nby setting reserve requirements, which are minimum amounts of reserves that depository\ninstitutions must hold against their deposit liabilities.3 In addition, banks often held excess\nreserves—that is, reserves in excess of requirements—as deposit balances at the Federal Reserve.\nTo carry out the FOMC’s policies, the Desk conducted open market operations (OMOs) with\ndesignated primary dealers to adjust the supply of reserves so that, for a given level of demand,\nthe market-clearing FFR would be consistent with the FOMC’s target.4,5 The Desk made\noutright purchases of Treasury securities in the secondary market and conducted temporary,\n“fine-tuning” operations, in the form of repurchase agreements (“repos”) and RRPs in markets\nfor U.S. government securities.6 Desk purchases of securities from a primary dealer, whether on\nan outright basis or in the form of repos in a temporary operation, increased reserves because the\nDesk paid for the securities by crediting reserves to the primary dealer’s account at the bank that\n2 Reserves are deposits held by banks and other depository institutions in their accounts at the Federal Reserve, as\nwell as currency held by those institutions.\n3 All depository institutions—commercial banks, savings banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions—are required\nto maintain reserves against transaction deposits, which include demand deposits, negotiable order of withdrawal\naccounts, and other highly liquid funds. Currently, reserve requirements range from 0 to 10 percent of transaction\naccount balances, with the 10 percent requirement applying to all balances in excess of $103.6 million.\n4 The Federal Reserve had adopted a so-called “corridor” operating framework, in which relatively small changes in\nthe supply of reserves can have significant effects on equilibrium short-term interest rates. See, for example, Ennis\nand Keister (2008); Keister, Martin, and McAndrews (2008); and Kahn (2010).\n5 Primary dealers are the Desk’s trading counterparties in its implementation of monetary policy. For a current list\nof primary dealers, see: www.newyorkfed.org/markets/pridealers_current.html.\n6 That is, the operations are carried out in markets for securities that are eligible for OMOs. These include Treasury\nsecurities, the debt of federal agencies and government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), and mortgage-backed\nsecurities backed by federal agencies and the GSEs.\nPage 3\n\ncleared the transaction.7,8 In the five years prior to the crisis, aggregate reserve supply averaged\nabout $11 billion, of which only about $1.7 billion was excess reserves.\n2.2. Federal Reserve responses to the financial crisis and recession substantially increased the\nsupply of reserves\nThe Federal Reserve’s responses to the financial crisis included important changes in the conduct\nof monetary policy as well as lender-of-last-resort actions. First, the FOMC rapidly eased the\nstance of monetary policy by aggressively cutting the FFR target from 5¼ percent in mid-2007 to\na target range of zero to ¼ percent by December 2008. Second, the Federal Reserve introduced\na number of facilities to provide liquidity to banks and nonbanks to maintain the flow of credit to\nborrowers in key markets, and to foster improved conditions in broader financial markets.\nFinally, with the FFR’s proximity to its effective lower bound leaving little scope for further\nreductions, the Federal Reserve purchased longer-term securities for its securities portfolio to put\ndownward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support the functioning of mortgage markets,\nand make financial conditions more accommodative.\nOne consequence of the Federal Reserve’s actions since the financial crisis has been a sharp\nincrease in aggregate reserve balances. In 2014, total reserves averaged $2.6 trillion, virtually all\nof which were excess reserves. Given the FOMC’s indication that asset sales will not play a key\nrole during the policy normalization process, reserve balances are likely to remain very large for\nan extended period of time.9 With the supply of reserves far outstripping depository institutions’\nrequired reserves as well as any demand for excess reserves, modest adjustments in the supply of\nreserves are no longer effective in controlling the FFR. Indeed, the Desk has not conducted\nOMOs to manage the supply of reserves since December 2008. Thus, new tools are required to\nprovide effective control of the FFR.\n7 In practice, the Desk limited the total amount of outright security holdings to maintain a “structural deficiency” in\nreserves; that is, permanent additions to reserves left supply short of the total that banks needed. The Desk’s fine-\ntuning operations thus were primarily repos that temporarily boosted reserves.\n8 In a repo transaction, the Desk purchases a security from a designated primary dealer with an agreement to sell the\nsecurity back to the dealer for a specified price at an agreed-upon date in the future. The term of the repo is the time\nbetween the Desk’s purchase and the dealer’s subsequent repurchase, which can be one day (overnight) or longer.\nThe difference between the purchase price and the (usually higher) repurchase price, adjusted for the term of the\nrepo, implies an interest rate for the repo. Because the Desk provides cash to the dealer in return for collateral, a\nrepo is economically similar to a collateralized loan from the Desk to the dealer for the term of the repo. An RRP is\nthe reverse of a repo transaction, with the Desk temporarily selling securities and the primary dealer or another\ncounterparty providing cash. Thus, a repo serves to increase reserves, since the Desk temporarily purchases\nsecurities, while an RRP reduces reserves, because the counterparty’s cash payment to the Federal Reserve is made\nby debiting the reserve account of the bank that clears the counterparty’s trade.\n9 In particular, the FOMC’s “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans” state that “[T]he Committee intends to\nreduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest\nrepayments of principal on securities held…” (FOMC 2014c). See further discussion of the FOMC’s normalization\nprinciples in section 2.5.\nPage 4\n\n2.3. Introduction of interest on excess reserves (IOER) in 2008\nPrior to the financial crisis, reserve balances at the Federal Reserve did not earn interest.\nHowever, legislation passed in 2006 and 2008 authorized the Federal Reserve to pay interest on\nreserves held by depository institutions, starting in October 2008.10 In the current environment\nin which the supply of reserves far exceeds the amount needed for reserve requirements, IOER—\nwhich is currently set at ¼ percent, or 25 basis points—has become the primary tool for keeping\nthe overnight FFR within its target range of zero to ¼ percent.11\nExcess reserves are effectively free of default and liquidity risk, so the IOER rate should be a\nlower bound for a bank’s opportunity cost of alternative investments, such as loans or purchases\nof securities. Accordingly, if banks were the only investors (lenders) in money markets, IOER\nwould set a floor for money market rates, as no bank would want to lend at a lower short-term\ninterest rate.\nTo be sure, IOER is not available to many large and active money market investors, such as\nmoney market funds (MMFs), other cash-management vehicles, nonfinancial corporations, and\ngovernment-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). But even though these investors cannot directly earn\nIOER, competition might be expected to lift money market rates up to (or close to) the level of\nthe IOER rate, since banks—in the absence of frictions—should be able to earn an arbitrage\nprofit on any funds that they borrow at a lower rate and then deposit at the Federal Reserve.\nThus, in theory and without frictions, the IOER rate might still form a floor for short-term\ninterest rates, allowing the Federal Reserve to achieve its target for the FFR even with a very\nhigh level of reserve balances.\nIn practice, however, the arbitrage across money market rates that could make the IOER rate\neffective as a floor on short-term rates is not costless. To undertake these actions, banks must\nexpand their balance sheets to finance increased reserves, and banks face costs in doing so. For\nexample, domestic banks are assessed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) fees based\non their total assets less tangible equity, and larger balance sheets also increase banks’ capital\nand liquidity requirements and associated costs. Moreover, these costs are likely to rise with the\nimplementation of new requirements for capital, particularly the Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision’s Basel III leverage ratio and the Federal Reserve’s rules mandating that foreign\nbanking organizations with large U.S. operations establish Intermediate Holding Companies\n(IHCs). These costs drive a wedge between the IOER rate earned by banks and the money\n10 The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 authorized interest payments on reserves beginning in 2011,\nand the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 advanced the effective date of this authority to October\n2008. The Federal Reserve pays interest on both required and excess reserves. These rates are currently the same,\nalthough they could be set at different levels. We focus on IOER because most reserves are excess reserves, so\ninterest on excess reserves is more economically significant than that paid on required reserves.\n11 That is, under the current configuration of supply and demand for reserves—with supply far exceeding demand\nfor required reserves—the operating framework to implement policy resembles a “floor system,” rather than a\ncorridor system (see note 4). In a floor system, a policy rate set by the central bank is intended to set a floor on other\nshort-term rates. In practice, however, as discussed below, the IOER rate alone currently does not set a firm floor on\nshort-term rates.\nPage 5\n\nmarket rates that banks are willing to pay to finance reserves. As a result, the IOER rate does not\nset a firm floor under money market rates. Chart 1 shows the IOER rate and three money market\nrates: the FFR, the overnight GCF Treasury repo rate, and the overnight rate on AA-rated\nnonfinancial commercial paper (CP).12 The three money market rates generally fall below\nIOER.\nThe gap between IOER and other rates probably reflects other factors, as well. For example,\nbecause IOER is available only to depository institutions, many active investors in money\nmarkets, such as MMFs and GSEs, may have limited bargaining power when providing the\nshort-term funding that allows banks to arbitrage the IOER rate. Because MMFs generally only\nlend to institutions with top short-term credit ratings, the limited number of banks with such\nratings may further increase their market power and widen the spread between IOER and other\nmarket rates. At the same time, the proximity of short-term interest rates to the zero lower\nbound, and structural features of the money markets that impede nominal interest rates from\nfalling below zero, may be helping to keep the spread between IOER and money market rates\nrelatively narrow.13\n2.4. ON RRPs could complement IOER by helping to set a floor on short-term rates\nOne means of strengthening a floor for short-term interest rates would be to offer an overnight,\nrisk-free instrument directly to a wider range of market participants. In July 2013, the Desk\nreported to the FOMC on the potential for such offerings in the form of fixed-rate, full-allotment\nON RRPs, which could complement IOER in controlling short-term interest rates (FOMC\n2013a). An RRP transaction is economically similar to the Federal Reserve borrowing from a\ncounterparty, with the loan secured by collateral from the Federal Reserve’s securities\nportfolio.14 Thus, reserves and ON RRPs are both very short-term loans to the Federal Reserve,\nalthough reserves are unsecured and ON RRPs are secured. Like the IOER rate, the ON RRP\nrate (the rate of interest implied on an ON RRP transaction) is a risk-free rate of interest set by\nthe Federal Reserve. However, while IOER is available only to depository institutions, ON\nRRPs can be made available to nonbank investors that are active in money markets.\nHistorically, the Federal Reserve conducted RRP (and repo) operations with primary dealer\ncounterparties. However, in 2009, in anticipation of the potential need for large-scale RRPs, the\n12 The GCF (general collateral finance) Treasury repo rate is an index of rates on repos collateralized with Treasury\nsecurities. The index is published by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).\n13 Once the lower end of the FOMC’s target range for the FFR is raised above zero, any role for the zero lower\nbound in narrowing spreads between the IOER rate and money market rates is likely to diminish. As such, the need\nfor tools to establish a floor on short-term interest rates may become more apparent during policy normalization.\nThis point is discussed in section 5.\n14 ON RRP transactions are structured as tri-party repos. To date, ON RRP transactions have been collateralized\nexclusively with Treasury securities.\nPage 6\n\nDesk began to expand its set of counterparties for RRP operations. The Federal Reserve\ncurrently has 164 RRP counterparties, including primary dealers, banks, MMFs, and GSEs.15\nIn theory, as with the IOER rate, the ON RRP rate set by the FOMC would be expected to\nestablish a floor on short-term interest rates, particularly if ON RRPs are available in sufficient\nquantity to satisfy demand at the ON RRP rate. Thus, the Desk’s July 2013 presentation on the\nuse of ON RRPs focused on a “fixed-rate, full-allotment” facility—that is, one that would offer\nON RRPs without limit at the fixed rate set by the FOMC.16 With such a facility in place, ON\nRRPs would always be available to counterparties as an alternative to other investments, so\ncounterparties that can invest in ON RRPs generally should be unwilling to lend elsewhere at\nlower rates.\nSince RRPs are accessible to a broad set of counterparties, including nonbank institutions that\nare significant money market lenders, access to ON RRPs should increase competitiveness in\nmoney markets and strengthen the effectiveness of the floor on rates. Whereas the effectiveness\nof a floor set by the IOER rate alone would depend on banks borrowing from money market\ninvestors at rates that are likely to be below the IOER rate, money market investors with access\nto ON RRP can lend directly to the Federal Reserve and earn the ON RRP rate. The option to\ninvest in ON RRPs also would provide bargaining power to investors in their negotiations with\nborrowers in money markets, so even if actual ON RRP take-up is not very large, such a facility\nwould help provide a floor on short-term interest rates and thus could be an important\nsupplement to IOER in controlling the FFR.17\n2.5. Tests of limited ON RRP offerings\nIn September 2013, the FOMC authorized the Desk to begin testing the use of ON RRPs as part\nof “an ongoing effort to improve the technical execution of policy” (FOMC 2013b).18 The initial\nauthorization set a range for the ON RRP rate of zero to 5 basis points and included a $1 billion\ncap on each individual counterparty’s investments in ON RRP on each day. As shown in the\ntable below, the actual individual-counterparty cap was initially set at $500 million, raised to $1\nbillion within a few days, and gradually increased to $10 billion over the next seven months.\nDuring this testing period, a fixed interest rate for ON RRPs was set on any given day, but that\nrate was moved over time in a range between 1 and 5 basis points for testing purposes.\n15 This total includes 25 new RRP counterparties that were added effective January 16, 2015 (see\nwww.newyorkfed.org/markets/ec-150116.html). For a current list of RRP counterparties, see:\nwww.ny.frb.org/markets/expanded_counterparties.html.\n16 In practice, the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities that can be used for ON RRP collateral place one\nconstraint on aggregate take-up.\n17 As noted above, RRP transactions historically were used to drain reserves. Thus, RRP operations also could be\nused to help reduce excess reserves and make pre-crisis tools effective again for controlling the FFR. However,\nwith the supply of reserves expected to remain very large for an extended period, the primary function of RRPs in\nthe near term would be to assist IOER in setting a floor on short-term interest rates.\n18 The Desk’s announcement of this testing exercise noted that the work was “a matter of prudent advance planning\nby the Federal Reserve” and that the “operations do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy”\n(Federal Reserve Bank of New York 2013).\nPage 7\n\nIn September 2014, the FOMC directed to Desk to raise the individual-counterparty cap for the\ntesting exercise to $30 billion and simultaneously introduced a $300 billion overall limit on the\namount of ON RRPs that the Desk could offer each day (FOMC 2014d).19 The FOMC also\ndirected the Desk to use an auction process to set the interest rate on ON RRPs and allocate them\namong counterparties in the event that the overall limit is binding. Hence, under this phase of\nthe exercise, the ON RRP rate is not always the “offering rate” set by the FOMC; when the\noverall limit is binding, the ON RRP rate set by the auction may be lower than the offering rate.\n(These testing features of the ON RRP exercise are described in further detail in section 4\nbelow.)\nTable. Timeline of the ON RRP exercise\nSeptember 2013 FOMC authorizes an ON RRP exercise through January 29, 2014, sets a\nrange for the ON RRP offering rate of zero to 5 basis points, and puts a $1\nbillion cap on each individual counterparty’s investments. Testing begins on\nSeptember 23 with the per-counterparty cap set at $500 million, and it is\nraised a few days later to $1 billion.\nDecember 2013 Cap on individual counterparties’ investments raised to $3 billion.\nJanuary 2014 Authorization for ON RRP exercise is extended through January 2015, and\ncap on individual counterparties’ investments is raised to $5 billion.20\nMarch 2014 Cap on individual counterparties’ investments raised to $7 billion.\nApril 2014 Cap on individual counterparties’ investments raised to $10 billion.\nSeptember 2014 FOMC sets a $300 billion overall limit on the amount of ON RRP that can be\noffered each day, raises the cap on individual counterparties’ investments to\n$30 billion, and introduces an auction process to allocate ON RRPs (and set\nan interest rate) in the event that the overall limit is binding.\nOctober 2014 FOMC authorizes testing of modest, temporary adjustments of the ON RRP\noffering rate to as high as 10 basis points.\nDecember 2014 Authorization for ON RRP exercise is extended through January 2016, and\n$300 billion in term RRPs spanning year-end are offered in a series of four\nauctions.\nJanuary 2015 FOMC authorizes up to $50 billion in term RRP operations in February and\nearly March, and $200 billion of term RRP operations that span the March\n2015 quarter-end.\nAlso in September 2014, the FOMC published a statement on its Policy Normalization Principles\nand Plans, which indicated that the FFR will continue to play a central role in monetary policy\n19 As noted in the September 2014 FOMC Minutes, “Testing these design features was generally seen as furthering\nthe Committee’s understanding of how an ON RRP facility might be structured to best balance its objectives of\nsupporting monetary control and of limiting the Federal Reserve’s role in financial intermediation as well as\nreducing potential financial stability risks the facility might pose during periods of stress” (FOMC 2014d).\n20 The authorization approved by the Committee at its January 2014 meeting did not specify a particular level for the\nper-counterparty cap, but stipulated that any change to this cap would require approval by the Chairman.\nPage 8\n\nimplementation during normalization (FOMC 2014c). The statement noted that “[w]hen\neconomic conditions and the economic outlook warrant a less accommodative monetary policy,\nthe Committee will raise its target range for the federal funds rate,” and “the Federal Reserve\nintends to move the federal funds rate into the target range set by the FOMC primarily by\nadjusting the interest rate it pays on excess reserve balances.” The FOMC also stated:\nDuring normalization, the Federal Reserve intends to use an overnight reverse\nrepurchase agreement facility and other supplementary tools as needed to help\ncontrol the federal funds rate. The Committee will use an overnight reverse\nrepurchase agreement facility only to the extent necessary and will phase it out\nwhen it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate (FOMC 2014c).\nON RRP testing has also included temporary changes in the ON RRP offering rate. As noted\nabove, that rate varied between 1 and 5 basis points for the first several months of the exercise.\nIn October 2014, the FOMC authorized testing of ON RRP rates between 0 and 10 basis points.\nThe offering rate was lowered to 3 basis points in early November, then raised to 7 basis points\nin mid-November and to 10 basis points in early December, and finally returned to 5 basis points\nin mid-December.\nAnother potential supplementary tool that is closely related to ON RRPs is term RRPs, that is,\nreverse repos for which the sale of securities and their repurchase occur more than one business\nday apart.21 In October 2014, the FOMC instructed the Desk to offer up to $300 billion in term\nRRP operations with the same set of counterparties used for ON RRP operations. The operations\nwere intended to test term RRPs “as a supplementary tool to help control the federal funds rate,\nparticularly when there are significant and transitory shifts in money market activity.” In\nparticular, the FOMC instructed the Desk to conduct term RRP operations that would cross year-\nend 2014—that is, to sell securities before year-end and repurchase them in the first few days of\nJanuary 2015 (Federal Reserve Bank of New York 2014b). As described below, money-market\nrates historically have exhibited significant variation at quarter- and year-ends, so the year-end\nwas a useful period in which to assess the ability of RRPs—both term and overnight—to help\ncontrol short-term rates. Over the last four weeks of December 2014, the Desk conducted four\nterm RRP operations that offered a total of $300 billion in term RRPs, all of which matured on\nJanuary 5, 2015.22\nThe Federal Reserve continues to enhance operational readiness and increase its understanding\nof the impact of RRPs through technical exercises. For example, in January 2015, the FOMC\nauthorized up to $50 billion in term RRP operations for February and early March, and $200\nbillion of term RRP operations that would span the March 2015 quarter-end (Federal Reserve\nBank of New York 2015).\n21 In contrast, as noted above, for overnight RRP, the sale and repurchase occur on successive business days. The\nDesk had previously conducted small-scale tests of term RRPs, largely to ensure that this tool would be ready if the\nFOMC decided to use it to drain reserves.\n22 As noted in section 2.6, total take-up from these four term RRP auctions was $226 billion.\nPage 9\n\n2.6. Results of ON RRP testing to date\nTesting to date suggests that the ON RRP exercise, even in limited size, has helped control short-\nterm interest rates. Chart 2 adds the ON RRP offering rate to chart 1 to show that this rate\ngenerally has served as an effective floor on short-term interest rates since the beginning of the\nON RRP exercise. On most days, for example, the Treasury GCF rate has remained above the\nON RRP rate.\nChart 3 illustrates counterparties’ take-up of ON RRPs. In first three months of the ON RRP\nexercise, from September to December 2013, when the cap on each counterparty’s usage was at\nmost $1 billion, aggregate take-up averaged only $8 billion. ON RRP usage subsequently rose,\nin part reflecting increases in the counterparty cap. From April 7 to September 19, 2014, when\nthe individual counterparty cap was $10 billion, aggregate take-up averaged $140 billion. Since\nSeptember 22, 2014, the individual cap has been $30 billion, and usage has averaged $131\nbillion.23\nThe chart also shows the composition of counterparties’ participation in the ON RRP exercise.\nMMFs generally account for most of the take-up; since April 7, 2014, MMF usage has averaged\n$116 billion, or 85 percent of average aggregate take-up.\nAs shown in chart 4, ON RRP take-up generally increases when the spread between market\nrates—in this case, the overnight GCF Treasury repo rate—and the ON RRP rate narrows. That\nis, ON RRP demand rises when the ON RRP rate is higher relative to market interest rates on\nother short-term investments.\nAs chart 3 illustrates, ON RRP take-up has spiked at recent quarter-ends, largely because\nborrower demand for short-term funding drops sharply on those dates. Much of this drop-off in\ndemand reflects so-called “window dressing” by financial institutions. For example, foreign\nbanking organizations trim borrowing at quarter-ends to reduce the size of their balance sheets,\nsince bank capital regulations in some countries are based on assets measured at the end of each\nquarter. Hence, MMFs and other cash investors, facing reduced opportunities to invest at\nquarter-ends, have shifted money into ON RRP. Take-up has jumped at the end of each quarter\nsince the testing exercise began, and usage reached a record $339 billion at the end of June 2014.\nDemand was even higher, at $407 billion, on September 30, 2014, but with the $300 billion\noverall limit in place, only that lower amount of ON RRP was awarded to counterparties, and the\nauction process was used to allocate ON RRP among them. This auction procedure (described in\nmore detail in section 4) caused the rate paid on ON RRPs (the “stop-out rate”) to fall to 0 basis\npoints that day.\nThe limited availability of ON RRPs on the quarter-end date of September 30, 2014, apparently\ncontributed to a drop in the Treasury GCF rate below the ON RRP offering rate on two days in\nlate September as well as on the quarter-end day itself. As shown in chart 2, on September 30,\n23 Offerings of term RRPs in December 2014 likely contributed to a decline in average ON RRP use in that month.\nTotal RRP usage, including both ON and term RRPs, has averaged $156 billion since September 22, 2014.\nPage 10\n\nthe Treasury GCF rate fell to 1.8 basis points, its lowest level of the year. The decline in rates on\ndays prior to September 30 reportedly reflected money market investors’ expectations that the\noverall limit would be binding on that day and their efforts to invest in substitute assets\nbeforehand.24\nChart 2 also shows that, in contrast to the drop in money-market rates that occurred at the end of\nSeptember 2014, short-term interest rates generally stayed above the ON RRP offering rate at the\nend of December. That result likely reflected, at least in part, the offerings of term RRPs that\nspanned year-end 2014, which augmented the available supply of RRPs with the Federal\nReserve. That is, at year-end, total Federal Reserve offerings of RRPs reached $600 billion:\n$300 billion in ON RRPs and $300 billion in term RRPs. Total RRP take-up on December 31\nwas $397 billion—$171 billion in ON RRPs and $226 billion in term RRPs—just short of the\n$407 billion in bids submitted on September 30 for ON RRPs.\n3. Some potential secondary effects of an ON RRP facility\nAn ON RRP facility is a monetary policy tool that could play an important role in controlling\ninterest rates during the normalization process, and a full-allotment facility that places no limits\non ON RRP offerings might be especially effective in this regard. At the same time, a facility\nthat offers ON RRP in very large amounts, even if it were not full-allotment, could have some\nsignificant secondary effects, including impacts on short-term funding market structure and\nfinancial stability. Policymakers, academics, and market observers have identified several\npotential consequences with both positive and negative implications, and this section describes\nthose possibilities in detail. We follow up this section with analysis, in section 4, of some\npotential features in the design of an ON RRP facility that might mitigate or prevent secondary\neffects that could be undesirable.\nOne implication of a very large ON RRP facility would be the expansion of the Federal\nReserve’s intermediation in short-term funding markets, which—particularly if such a facility\nwere permanently in place—could alter financial markets in unpredictable ways. Concerns\nabout a larger Federal Reserve footprint in short-term funding markets were raised at the June\n2014 FOMC meeting, at which “a number of participants noted that a relatively large ON RRP\nfacility had the potential to expand the Federal Reserve’s role in financial intermediation and\nreshape the financial industry in ways that were difficult to anticipate” (FOMC 2014a).\nThe presence of an ON RRP facility also could have implications for financial stability. A\npotentially beneficial effect arises from the provision of a very safe, short-term asset. A recent\nacademic literature suggests that official-sector issuance of debt instruments with money-like\ncharacteristics can displace private short-term assets that are prone to runs.25 Thus, by supplying\n24 The Federal Reserve’s September 17, 2014 announcement of changes to the ON RRP exercise, including the\nintroduction of the $300 billion overall limit, came shortly before the end of the quarter (Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York 2014a). A subsequent scramble among investors for money market assets late in the quarter may have\ncontributed to the decline in rates.\n25 As described below, this literature includes Stein (2012); Greenwood, Hanson, and Stein (2013); Krishnamurthy\nand Vissing-Jorgensen (2013); and Carlson et al. (2014).\nPage 11\n\nON RRPs with money-like features, the facility might mitigate some risks to financial stability,\nalthough this effect would be incidental to the facility’s primary purpose.\nHowever, a facility that could allow a very rapid and unexpected expansion of ON RRP might\nexacerbate disruptive flight-to-quality flows during a period of financial stress and thus could\nundermine financial stability. Market observers and policymakers both have described such\nrisks. For example, the Minutes of the June 2014 FOMC meeting state that “[m]ost participants\nexpressed concerns that in times of financial stress, the facility’s counterparties could shift\ninvestments toward the facility and away from financial and nonfinancial corporations, possibly\ncausing disruptions in funding that could magnify the stress” (FOMC 2014a).\nThe extent of the potential secondary effects of an ON RRP facility likely would depend on both\nthe size of the facility and its potential rate of expansion. The possibility of unpredictable effects\narising from a larger Federal Reserve footprint in short-term funding markets, as well as the\npotential benefits of supplying safe money-like assets, would be associated with the level of\nfacility usage. In contrast, as described below, the risk of exacerbating a disruptive flight to\nquality would be more closely linked to the potential for facility usage to significantly increase\nsuddenly and unexpectedly. Below, we examine these possible secondary effects in greater\ndetail.\n3.1. Potential effects of a very large ON RRP facility on financial intermediation\nBy offering a new form of overnight risk-free investment, an ON RRP facility could attract cash\nfrom investors who otherwise might provide funding for private institutions and firms. That is,\nthe facility could expand the Federal Reserve’s role in financial markets by offering investors a\nnew tool to manage liquidity and thus could crowd out some private financing. Such crowding\nout may have both desirable and undesirable consequences: This section describes some\npotential adverse implications, while section 3.2 describes some possible benefits.\nSome crowding out of short-term funding is likely during any monetary-tightening phase, as\nshort-term interest rates rise and some borrowers that have obtained funding at low rates are\nunwilling to pay higher rates. Since the purpose of an ON RRP facility is to help set a floor for\nshort-term interest rates by offering investors an alternative risk-free asset, an ON RRP facility\nshould be expected to supplant some private financing activity, particularly when the FOMC\ndecides to raise the target range for the FFR.\nImportantly, increased ON RRP take-up does not expand the size of the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet or the volume of private short-term funding required to finance that balance sheet.\nInstead, such an increase shifts the composition of the Federal Reserve’s liabilities from reserves\nheld by banks to RRPs that can be held by a wider range of institutions. Hence, the crowding out\nof private financing that results from greater use of ON RRP would largely represent a reduction\nin private lending by money-market investors to banks that are financing reserves, offset by an\nincrease in private lending by those investors directly to the Federal Reserve. Given the IOER\nand ON RRP rates that are set by the Federal Reserve, the allocation of Federal Reserve\nliabilities between reserves and RRPs is ultimately determined in markets.\nPage 12\n\nNonetheless, the resulting crowding out of private short-term financing may have some adverse\nimplications. Most importantly, a permanently expanded role for the Federal Reserve in short-\nterm funding markets could reshape the financial industry in ways that may be difficult to\nanticipate and that may prove to be undesirable. For example, a permanent or long-lasting\nfacility that causes very significant crowding out of short-term financing could lead to\natrophying of the private infrastructure that supports these markets. Partially in response to some\nof these concerns, the FOMC has made clear that an ON RRP facility is not intended to be\npermanent (FOMC 2014c).\nThe amount of short-term financing that could be crowded out would depend largely on the\nelasticity of demand for private financing—that is, the extent to which private firms are willing\nto raise rates that they pay for short-term funding to remain competitive with a new risk-free\nasset. The limited testing of ON RRPs to date suggests that the amounts in question could be\nsubstantial relative to the size of the market for Treasury tri-party repo but still only a small\nfraction of overall volumes in money markets. As noted in section 2, since September 22, 2014,\nwhen the individual-counterparty cap was raised to $30 billion, ON RRP take-up has averaged\n$131 billion. During the same period, total tri-party repo against Treasury securities collateral\naveraged $667 billion, and repo against all U.S. government securities collateral averaged $1.26\ntrillion, although tri-party repo represents only a fraction of outstanding money market\ninstruments in which ON RRP counterparties invest cash.26 We are not aware of any evidence\nthat the testing of the facility to date has affected the structure of the money market.\nChart 5 suggests that ON RRPs have served as a substitute for some private financing, although\nrecent declines in private short-term funding probably have reflected factors other than the\navailability of ON RRPs. The chart shows volumes of repo backed by U.S. government\nsecurities (“government repo”) held by MMFs. As the chart indicates, MMFs’ private financing\nthrough government repo was declining before ON RRP became available, at least in part\nbecause of pressures on financial institutions to trim their balance sheets in light of new\nregulatory requirements for capital.27 The chart shows that increasing ON RRP take-up since\ntesting operations began in September 2013 has offset a fairly steep decline in government repo\nfinancing for private entities. So, in this case, increased ON RRP take-up may reflect in part the\ndeleveraging of financial institutions, rather than the crowding out of private short-term\nfinancing.\n3.2. Potential effects of an ON RRP facility on financial stability\nIn principle, there are two distinct channels through which the establishment of an ON RRP\nfacility could affect financial stability. First, the availability of an elastically supplied risk-free\nasset could influence the likelihood that money market investors would shift rapidly from\nproviding private short-term funding to holding only very safe assets. That is, the facility could\n26 These figures include ON RRP transactions.\n27 The requirements include the Basel III leverage ratio introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\nin 2010, which was implemented in the U.S. through the supplementary leverage ratio in 2013, as well as Federal\nReserve rules adopted in 2014 that require foreign banking organizations with large U.S. operations to establish U.S.\nintermediate holding companies (IHCs) that generally will be subject to the same capital standards applicable to\nU.S. bank holding companies.\nPage 13\n\naffect the chance of a widespread run. Second, an ON RRP facility could affect the dynamics\nand severity of such a shift, once it is under way.\nThe academic literature does not provide strong guidance regarding the effects of a new risk-free\nasset on the likelihood of sudden shifts toward safe assets. On the one hand, a recent literature\nhas emphasized the benefits of the public provision of safe short-term assets, such as ON RRPs,\nin enhancing financial stability by displacing private money-like assets that are prone to runs.\nOn the other hand, some models suggest that the availability of an attractive safe investment\ncould increase the likelihood of runs.\nHowever, once a run is underway, the availability of ON RRPs could allow greater flight-to-\nquality flows during a run and thus could exacerbate the run and its effects. These effects might\nbe particularly significant with a full-allotment ON RRP facility, but they also could occur with\nfacility that does not offer full allotment if its structure leaves the potential for a sudden and\nunexpected large increase in take-up.\n3.2.1. Effect on the likelihood of runs\nThe academic literature has not directly considered the broad effects of introducing an elastically\nsupplied risk-free asset, and the insights that can be gained from existing models are somewhat\nlimited, in part because these models do not deliver robust predictions. Hence, the literature\noverall does not provide clear-cut predictions about how an ON RRP facility would affect the\nlikelihood of a run.\nA recent literature has suggested that the provision of short-term safe assets by the official sector\ncould enhance financial stability by displacing private money-like liquid assets and reducing the\nrisk of runs (Stein 2012; Greenwood, Hanson, and Stein 2013; Krishnamurthy and Vissing-\nJorgensen 2013; Carlson et al. 2014). Gorton and Metrick (2012) have argued that private\nissuance of money-like assets, particularly before the financial crisis, was a response to a\nshortage of safe short-term instruments, and that these private instruments can leave issuers\nvulnerable to runs. Stein (2012) and Greenwood, Hanson, and Stein (2013) state that increasing\nthe supply of safe short-term assets may be more effective than regulatory responses to the\nexternalities associated with private money-like assets, especially those created by the shadow-\nbanking sector.\nIn principle, the benefits of displacing private money-like instruments could be realized either\nwith an increase in government liabilities, such as Treasury bills, which can be held by a wide\nrange of investors, or an increase in central bank liabilities, such as ON RRPs, that are available\nto large and active money market investors. Government creation of short-term safe assets via\nincreased issuance of short-term instruments has some drawbacks, however, such as greater\nrollover risk to the government (see, for example, Greenwood, Hanson, and Stein 2013). This\nconcern is less relevant for ON RRPs, since a reduction in investor demand for ON RRPs would\nsimply result in an offsetting rise in reserves.\nModels in the tradition of Diamond and Dybvig (1983) consider the fragility of a financial\ninstitution that must choose between a short-term safe asset (like an investment in an ON RRP\nPage 14\n\nfacility), and a long-term technology. In these models, an exogenous increase in the return on\nthe safe asset, analogous to an increase in the ON RRP rate, has both a substitution and an\nincome effect. The substitution effect reflects the tendency to increase investment in the safe\nasset as its higher return makes it more desirable. The income effect reflects the opposite\ntendency—to reduce investment in the asset because one can earn the same income with a lower\nquantity of the asset. In principle, either effect could dominate.28 Increasing the return on the\nsafe asset could reduce the range of parameter values for which the financial institution is\nvulnerable to runs, but there are no general results establishing the conditions under which such\nan effect could occur.29\nAnother relevant theoretical result is that, by giving investors an attractive outside option (a safe\nasset supplied elastically at a fixed rate), an ON RRP facility could increase the likelihood of a\nrun. This result occurs, for example, in some game theoretic models (see, for example, Morris\nand Shin 2010). However, these models do not consider possible endogenous reactions that\ncould offset the increased risk. For example, borrowers who rely on funding from lenders that\nare more likely to run because of access to an ON RRP facility could reduce this risk by\nincreasing the term of their funding.\n3.2.2. Effect on the dynamics and severity of a run (once it is underway)\nAbsent an ON RRP facility, in the event of a widespread run from private short-term funding\nmarkets, the supply of safe assets, such as Treasury securities, would not expand automatically to\naccommodate increased demand.30 Hence, without ON RRPs, opportunities to run may be\nconstrained by a limited supply of risk-free assets, and greater demand for those assets is likely\nto push up their prices and make running more costly.\nBy contrast, an ON RRP facility that elastically supplies a very safe asset and which has the\npotential to increase in size by very large amounts would provide no immediate mechanism to\nslow a run. Hence, some market observers have suggested that such a facility could exacerbate\nflight-to-quality flows and their repercussions (Wrightson ICAP 2014). In section 4, we describe\nsome possible ON RRP facility design features, such as caps on usage, that could address these\nconcerns. Here, however, we focus on the possible effects of a facility without such features.\nTo be sure, an ON RRP facility may have some benefits during a run. By displacing private\nmoney-like assets prior to the run, ON RRPs might dampen the run and ameliorate some of the\ndamage it causes. Moreover, the availability of ON RRPs could diminish the incentive to run to\nsafe assets, such as Treasury securities or MMFs that hold only U.S. government securities.\n28 For example, if a depositor’s utility function displays constant relative risk aversion, then whether the substitution\nor the income effect dominates depends on the degree of risk aversion.\n29 For example, Ennis and Keister (2006) provide a sufficient condition for a bank to be run-proof that depends on\nthe return of the safe asset.\n30 Safe-haven flows may be limited by other constraints, as well. For example, MMFs that invest exclusively in\nTreasury and other U.S. government securities have at times stopped accepting new investments, especially when\nheightened demand for those securities pushed their interest rates down to very low levels.\nPage 15\n\nBecause the prices of safe assets tend to rise in such scenarios, and government-only MMFs can\nclose their doors to new investors, there may be an incentive to front-run other investors. An ON\nRRP facility that elastically supplies a safe asset at a fixed rate could diminish this incentive.31\nIn the next two sections, we consider some recent flights to quality and discuss how an ON RRP\nfacility might affect financial stability during such an event.\n3.2.3. The dynamics of some recent widespread flights to quality\nShort-term funding markets historically have been buffeted by sudden flights to safety, when\ninvestors have abruptly sought to limit risk exposure by switching quickly from risky assets to\nsafer ones. Prior to the introduction of deposit insurance, these episodes typically involved\nwidespread bank runs. The emergence of a large wholesale funding market in the United States\nin recent decades has set the stage for large-scale runs on the liabilities and shares of nonbank\nissuers, such as the runs on MMFs, repo, and CP that occurred in 2007-2008.\nTo illustrate the types and magnitudes of the rapid shifts that have occurred in short-term funding\nmarkets during flights to quality, we examine a recent episode of financial strain: September\n2008, when the most precipitous runs of the 2007-2009 crisis occurred. (An appendix examines\ntwo additional episodes of more modest flight-to-quality flows that occurred during the debt-\nceiling standoffs of 2011 and 2013.) We focus primarily on flows that occurred during a one-\nweek window, to highlight the types of flows that may present the greatest threats to financial\nstability.\nOf course, flight-to-quality dynamics during future crises are likely to be quite different from\nthose in past episodes. For example, the 2008 crisis was an unusually large shock—not a typical\nflight-to-quality episode—although the flows that occurred during that crisis probably would\nhave been significantly larger without government interventions, including the Federal Reserve’s\nliquidity programs and actions by the Treasury and FDIC. In addition, legal, regulatory, and\nother changes since 2008 will probably affect the nature and scale of future flight-to-quality\nepisodes. For example, new regulations that require banks to hold larger liquid-asset buffers\nthan in 2008, as well as the large amount of reserves currently in the banking system, may\nameliorate some of the effects of large-scale runs on short-term funding instruments. Still, recent\nflights to quality can provide a sense of the magnitudes of flow that could create financial\nstability concerns.\nHow large were flows to safe havens in September 2008?\nThe most severe flight-to-quality flows in 2008 occurred in the week of September 15-19, when\nthe Lehman bankruptcy caused losses at prime MMFs and the Reserve Primary Fund “broke the\nbuck.” A variety of safe havens attracted inflows, including government MMFs and bank liquid\ndeposits.32 As shown in chart 6, government MMF assets increased $190 billion between\n31 This type of effect is studied, in a different context, in Cipriani, Martin, McCabe, and Parigi (2014).\n32 For many safe assets, such as Treasury bills, supply did not increase over the week (Treasury bill supply actually\ndeclined during the week of September 15-19, so net flows were negative), and the marked increase in demand\nPage 16\n\nSeptember 12 and 19, and bank liquid deposits increased $100 billion.33 The largest daily flight-\nto-quality flow that week—adding up inflows to government MMFs and liquid deposits—was\n$140 billion, on September 18.34\nWhere did investors run from in September 2008?\nDuring the 2007-2008 crisis, investors ran from virtually every short-term vehicle that embedded\nliquidity and credit risk, although the timing and severity of runs on individual instruments\nvaried considerably.35 Chart 6 shows that in the week of September 15-19, 2008, investors\nredeemed $310 billion, on net, from prime MMFs. Investors also ran from other short-term\nfunding instruments; for example, CP outstanding dropped $110 billion that week.\nAs MMFs came under redemption pressure, they contributed to the pullback from risky assets.\nPrime MMFs’ holdings of CP and repo dropped $150 billion and $70 billion, respectively,\nbetween September 9 and 23, while holdings of Treasury securities declined just $7 billion and\ntime deposits held about steady.36 Notably, much of the redemption pressure on prime MMFs\nwas alleviated when the Treasury announced its temporary guarantee program for MMFs on\nSeptember 19, as the run on MMFs subsequently slowed significantly. In addition, the Federal\nReserve’s Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility\n(AMLF), which ultimately facilitated MMFs’ sales (at no loss to them) of $150 billion in asset-\nbacked CP to banking organizations, and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), also\nprobably dampened flight-to-quality flows.37\nAn important lesson from recent crises is that sudden changes in the perception of the relative\nrisk of various investments may lead to sharp differences in flow patterns. For example, in late\n2007 and early 2008, prime MMFs were apparently viewed as safer than some near substitutes,\nsuch as enhanced-cash funds and other private liquidity funds, and prime MMF assets increased\n$350 billion from August 2007 to August 2008. Of course, the direction of flows changed\ndramatically amid the run in September 2008. The appendix, which examines other episodes of\nresulted in higher prices and lower yields. Yields on 4-week and 3-month Treasury bills dropped from about 150\nbasis points on September 11 to under 10 basis points on September 17.\n33 Liquid deposits include transaction accounts and savings deposits at weekly FR 2900 reporters, which comprise\nabout 2500 institutions, including the largest domestic banks in terms of reservable liabilities and M2 deposits\n(liquid deposits plus small time deposits), as well as all foreign banking organizations.\n34 Some of these flows may have been impeded by quantity restrictions, such as MMF closures to new investments,\nalthough available data do not provide information on their use in September 2008.\n35 For example, between August 2007 and October 2008, investors sharply curtailed funding for asset-backed\ncommercial paper, auction-rate securities, tender-option bonds, securities-lending cash collateral investment pools,\nenhanced-cash and other private liquidity funds, repo, deposits at certain banks, prime MMFs, offshore MMFs, and\nbank short-term investment trusts. Runs on different instruments did not necessarily occur simultaneously; for\nexample, in late 2007 and early 2008, when some private liquidity funds were experiencing runs, prime MMFs were\nattracting large inflows.\n36 Based on data from iMoneyNet and authors’ calculations. Note that the portfolio holdings of the Reserve Primary\nFund are excluded from these figures, since that fund’s assets were not reflected accurately in iMoneyNet data.\n37 For a description of the Federal Reserve’s Credit and Liquidity Programs deployed during the crisis, see\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_crisisresponse.htm.\nPage 17\n\nstress, provides additional examples of how the direction of flight-to-quality flows may differ\nfrom one episode to the next.\n3.2.4. How might a potentially large ON RRP facility alter flight-to-quality dynamics?\nAs noted above, an ON RRP facility could have some beneficial effects during a run. It could\ndiminish incentives to move cash to safe assets ahead of other investors if there is certainty about\naccess during periods of stress. Furthermore, if the facility is large enough to have displaced a\nsignificant fraction of private money-like assets before a run begins, the facility could dampen\nthe scale of a run and mitigate the damage it causes.\nHowever, an elastically supplied risk-free asset also could amplify run dynamics, such as those\nthat have occurred in past flight-to-quality episodes, and alter the destinations of safe-haven\nflows. Cash that, in the absence of ON RRPs, might have moved quickly to liquid deposits at\nbanks could go instead into a risk-free ON RRP facility through, for example, government\nMMFs that invest in ON RRPs. The sources of flight-to-quality flows, such as prime MMFs,\ncould experience larger outflows than in past episodes, and the availability of short-term funding\nfor broker-dealer and nonfinancial firms through vehicles like repo and CP could decline more\nquickly.\nThe safe-haven flows in previous stress episodes can provide a benchmark for the potential scale\nof flows that, at a time of heightened risk aversion, might be redirected to an ON RRP facility\nfrom financial institutions or funds that served as safe havens in past flights to quality. However,\nsuch flows tell us little about the potential additional flight-to-quality flows that might occur\nbecause an ON RRP facility has created a new, elastically supplied risk-free asset. Some\npotential mechanisms for incremental flows include greater within-portfolio shifts to safe assets\nby MMFs that are ON RRP counterparties, larger redemptions from prime MMFs and inflows to\ngovernment MMFs that hold ON RRPs, and larger inflows to these government MMFs (or\ndirectly to an ON RRP facility) from other sources.\nOutstanding amounts of short-dated money market instruments can illustrate the potential for\nlarge net flows to safe-haven destinations, such as an ON RRP facility, that can accommodate\nincoming cash. For example, the aggregate assets of institutional prime MMFs, which would be\nat risk of sudden, heavy redemptions in a crisis, suggest that such flows could be several hundred\nbillion dollars.38 To be clear, some such flows are likely in an episode of financial stress,\nregardless of the existence of an ON RRP facility, so the overall size of potential flight-to-quality\nflows cannot inform us about the marginal impact of an ON RRP facility on these flows. Still,\nthe magnitudes in question indicate that flight-to-quality inflows to a facility could be very large.\n38 Institutional prime MMFs have proven to be particularly vulnerable to runs in past episodes of stress (see, for\nexample, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 2013, pages 72-76).\nPage 18\n\nWhat are the financial stability implications of the potential changes in flight-to-quality flows\nduring crises?\nThe effects of changes in flight-to-safety flows on financial stability and economic activity\nwould depend in large part on the nature of the institutions and firms that might lose short-term\nfunding if investors shift to ON RRPs. Data on the short-term assets held by MMFs, which are\nvery large investors in these markets, suggest that the institutions and firms in question would\nmostly be large banks—particularly foreign banks—and their subsidiaries, including broker-\ndealers (these data are discussed in the appendix). The ultimate recipients of this financing are\nless certain, but they could have included clients, such as hedge funds and nonfinancial firms,\nthat normally obtain funding from the banks and broker-dealers. However, a substantial amount\nof the short-term borrowing, particularly by foreign banks, was likely used to finance IOER\narbitrage, and the withdrawal of that portion of the short-term funding likely would not have any\nadverse effects on financial stability.\nThe redirection of cash that might have gone to liquid deposits in the past may also have stability\nimplications. Banks that received such cash would have had a broader range of options for\nreinvesting it than the government MMFs that are likely to attract inflows because of their access\nto ON RRPs. In addition, Gatev, Schuermann, and Strahan (2009) argue that deposit inflows\nmay have bolstered bank liquidity during past episodes of stress. However, regulatory changes\ndiscussed in section 2 are probably making large flight-to-quality deposit inflows, particularly\nthose from institutional investors, less attractive for many banks.\nTo be sure, most surges in ON RRP take-up probably would have no bearing on financial\nstability. For example, seasonal reductions in the supply of Treasury bills may cause jumps in\nON RRP usage that are unrelated to financial stability. Also, when private borrowers’ demand\nfor short-term funding drops—for example, as foreign banking organizations and some domestic\nbanks trim borrowing at quarter-ends—investors may shift money into ON RRPs. The resulting\nincreases in take-up are unlikely to be disruptive.\nIn fact, as noted in section 2, large one-day increases in ON RRP usage have already occurred on\ndates when borrower demand for short-term funding has dropped, particularly on quarter-end\ndates. Take-up jumped $199 billion and $131 billion on the last days of June and December\n2014, respectively. Moreover, demand rose by $213 billion on the last day of September 2014,\nalthough the aggregate cap limited the increase in awards that day to $105 billion. Rather than\nbeing disruptive, these increases in ON RRP take-up so far appear to have smoothed the supply\nof money market assets, particularly at quarter-ends when borrowers’ demand for short-term\nfunding typically falls.\nIn contrast, the surges in usage that would be cause for concern would be those triggered by\nstress-related flights to quality, which presumably would be due to reductions in investors’ (that\nis, lenders’) willingness to supply short-term funding to private firms and institutions. The scale\nof one-day increases in ON RRP take-up indicates that money market participants, such as\nMMFs, have the potential to direct large flows quickly to ON RRPs.\nPage 19\n\nWhy does a large and unexpected increase in ON RRP take-up have financial stability\nimplications during a flight to quality? Isn’t provision of safe assets during crises one of the\nroles of the Federal Reserve?\nProvision of safe assets to the financial system is a core central-bank function. Indeed, the\nofficial title of the Federal Reserve Act is “An Act to provide for the establishment of Federal\nreserve banks, to furnish an elastic currency…” Increasing the supply of ON RRP could in\nprinciple be seen as similar to classic means of furnishing an elastic currency, such as open\nmarket purchases or lender-of-last-resort functions like discount-window lending.\nHowever, an increase in ON RRP, which absorbs cash from the private sector, has very different\nimplications for the availability of liquidity and credit in the economy than the classic central-\nbank tools that augment liquidity in periods of stress. Those classic tools, such as lender-of-last-\nresort extensions of credit to banks through Discount Window loans, involve the Federal\nReserve’s provision of cash against less-liquid private assets that serve as collateral, and hence\ndo not cause any reduction in available credit to private borrowers. For example, a private debt\ninstrument that is pledged at the Discount Window in exchange for Federal Reserve liabilities\n(cash or reserves) remains intact. In contrast, all else equal, increased ON RRP usage implies\nreduced short-term financing for other borrowers. If, for example, MMFs quickly shift from\ninvesting in commercial paper or repo to holding ON RRPs, they would reduce the availability of\nshort-term credit for private firms and institutions. More generally, in contrast to classic central-\nbank liquidity provision, which creates reserves, increased ON RRP take-up diminishes reserves.\nThe Federal Reserve could take actions to offset the reduction in available liquidity that might be\ncaused by a flight-to-quality event, including a surge of inflows to an ON RRP facility. In\nparticular, the Federal Reserve could use its traditional tools for injecting liquidity back into the\nfinancial system, such as providing funding through the Discount Window to commercial banks\nwith liquidity shortfalls and providing liquidity broadly through repos backed by OMO-eligible\nsecurities with primary dealers. The Federal Reserve also could employ unconventional tools,\nsuch as large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) of U.S. government securities and—subject to the\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act—establishing broad-based facilities under section 13(3) of the\nFederal Reserve Act to provide credit to a broad set of nonbank financial institutions and\nnonfinancial firms. Still, some limitations in these tools and in the Federal Reserve’s ability to\nemploy some of them expeditiously suggest some caution regarding the efficacy of a potential\nresponse to disruptive flight-to-quality flows.39 For these and other reasons, it may be prudent to\ndesign an ON RRP facility with features that would mitigate the risk of sharp, potentially\ndisruptive surges of ON RRP take-up, while preserving the facility’s usefulness in helping to\ncontrol short-term interest rates.\n39 For example, stigma associated with Discount Window borrowing may limit its effectiveness in providing\nliquidity, repos with dealer firms can be executed only against certain forms of high-quality collateral, and extending\ncredit quickly to nonbank financial institutions and nonfinancial firms would be challenging.\nPage 20\n\n4. Some options for ON RRP facility design features aimed at addressing potentially\nundesirable secondary effects\nIn this section, we discuss some possible design features and safeguards for an ON RRP facility\nthat could address the potentially undesirable secondary effects that were discussed in section 3,\nwhile also providing the FOMC with the desired degree of control over the FFR. In particular,\nwe discuss measures that could limit the role of the Federal Reserve in financial intermediation\nand constrain sudden, sharp increases in take-up that might threaten financial stability. These\nmeasures include making the ON RRP facility temporary, changes in the ON RRP rate, quantity\ncontrols, and combinations of rate changes and quantity controls. It is worth noting that a\nnumber of regulatory changes over recent years have been aimed at boosting the liquidity\npositions of financial institutions and reducing run risks in short-term funding\nmarkets. Consistent with the spirit of those regulations, the design features discussed in this\nsection are aimed at minimizing any potential for ON RRP operations to exacerbate liquidity\nrisks in short-term funding markets.\n4.1. Making the ON RRP facility temporary\nMaking an ON RRP facility temporary would help to address concerns that such a facility could\nexpand the Federal Reserve’s role in financial intermediation and reshape the financial industry\nin ways that are difficult to anticipate and that may prove to be undesirable. A temporary facility\nis less likely than a permanent one to cause lenders to curtail relationships with money-market\nborrowers, to abandon money-market infrastructure, and to rely exclusively on ON RRPs as a\nplace to invest cash. Indeed, market participants appear to be maintaining counterparty\nrelationships, perhaps in part because they anticipate that the facility will be discontinued when it\nis no longer needed to support money market rates.\nThe FOMC has indicated that, although an ON RRP facility will be useful in controlling short-\nterm rates during normalization, the Committee does not anticipate that such a facility will be a\npermanent part of the Committee’s longer-run operating framework. As noted in the Policy\nNormalization Principles and Plans released in September 2014, the Committee will use an ON\nRRP facility only to the extent necessary and will phase it out when it is no longer needed to help\ncontrol the FFR (FOMC 2014c).\nConsistent with the expectation that an ON RRP facility would be temporary in nature, the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York announced in November 2014 that it is unlikely to further\nmodify the eligibility criteria for RRP counterparties. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nalso noted that it did not anticipate increasing the total number of RRP counterparties after\nadding those from a wave of applications in late 2014 (Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n2014c).\nIn addition, as indicated in the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, the Committee intends\nto reduce its securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to\nreinvest repayments of principal. This process will result in a reduction in excess reserves, and\nthus gradually improve the extent to which IOER exerts upward pressure on money market rates.\nFor example, a lower amount of reserves in the banking system should reduce banks’ balance\nPage 21\n\nsheet costs and the costs associated with arbitrage activities, and hence foster a tighter link\nbetween the IOER and other market rates. In addition, reducing reserves should make them\nscarcer (at least for some banks), increase banks’ competition for reserves, and facilitate tighter\ncontrol of the FFR. Against this backdrop, when the FOMC is confident that the IOER rate—\nperhaps supported by supplementary tools other than an ON RRP facility—is exerting a\nsufficiently strong pull on money market rates, the ON RRP facility will no longer be needed.\nThe FOMC has other supplementary tools that could be used to hasten the phase-out of an ON\nRRP facility, if the Committee determines that doing so would be appropriate. For example,\nduring the normalization process, the Committee could complement ON RRPs with term RRPs.\nThe Federal Reserve could also use a Term Deposit Facility (TDF), which would allow banks to\nmaintain term deposits with the Federal Reserve at a higher rate than the IOER rate. These tools\ncould provide additional arbitrage opportunities for banks and nonbanks and help to exert\nupward pressures on money market rates. Furthermore, use of these tools would diminish the\nsupply of reserves. Finally, the Committee could also choose to sell assets, which all else equal,\nwould reduce the amount of reserves in the banking system and diminish the aggregate size of\nthe banking system’s balance sheet. As noted above, both of these effects would help to put\nupward pressure on short-term interest rates.\n4.2. Setting the spread between the IOER rate and the ON RRP rate\nReducing the ON RRP offering rate to make investments in ON RRPs less attractive would be\none way to address concerns that a relatively large ON RRP facility could expand the Federal\nReserve’s role in financial intermediation. In particular, the spread between the IOER rate and\nthe ON RRP rate could be set wide enough to discourage very large average ON RRP take-up\nand reduce the facility’s usage in normal times. If the ON RRP rate is significantly below the\nIOER rate, money market investors are more likely to invest (directly or indirectly) in reserves\nand less likely to invest in ON RRP—that is, changes in the spread should cause substitution\nbetween these two forms of Federal Reserve liabilities. However, setting the ON RRP offering\nrate too low could also limit the usefulness of an ON RRP facility in helping to control short-\nterm interest rates during normalization.\nThe spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates also could be adjusted as needed to address the\nrisk that, in times of financial stress, the facility could attract sudden, large inflows that\ncontribute to a reduction in the availability of short-term funding. For example, during such\nepisodes, the ON RRP rate could be lowered to reduce the attractiveness of ON RRPs and\ndiminish their potential for displacing private short-term financing activity.\nHowever, as a tool for limiting potentially disruptive surges in ON RRP usage during periods of\nfinancial stress, lowering the ON RRP rate (and thus widening the spread relative to the IOER\nrate) has several limitations. Importantly, if investors become rate-insensitive during such\nepisodes—demanding safe assets at essentially any rate—reducing the rate may be ineffective in\ndiscouraging usage. Moreover, demand for safe assets can increase abruptly in a crisis, so a\nsurge in ON RRP take-up could occur before policymakers can react. Such a surge could have\nlasting effects, since a loss of funding could quickly put some firms in difficulty, even if ON\nRRP rates are subsequently adjusted. Of course, rates could be lowered in advance of a potential\nPage 22\n\nsurge in take-up if stress is seen developing in markets, but a risk in lowering the RRP rate\npreemptively is that doing so could intensify financial stress if investors interpret a rate reduction\nas a signal that policymakers expect conditions to worsen.\n4.3. Setting a cap on the ON RRP facility’s size\nAn alternative means of addressing concerns about ON RRPs would be to use caps to limit take-\nup directly. Caps could be set high enough to bind only rarely in normal times, so that the\nfacility can be as effective as possible for setting a floor on short-term interest rates. At the same\ntime, caps could be tight enough to limit the Federal Reserve’s role in financial intermediation or\nreduce the likelihood that a run to an ON RRP facility might contribute to financial instability.\nIndividual caps vs. an aggregate cap\nCaps on daily usage could be set individually for each ON RRP investor or imposed only at the\naggregate level of ON RRP take-up. As described in section 2, the FOMC is experimenting with\nboth types of caps during the current ON RRP exercise.\nA key advantage of having only individual caps is that they allow each counterparty to know in\nadvance the maximum amount that it can invest at the facility, since the amount would not\ndepend on the behavior of other ON RRP counterparties (as it would with an aggregate cap if it\nwas binding). Unless an additional aggregate cap is also in place, total potential ON RRP usage\non any day under a system of individual caps would be the sum of those caps. Individual caps\ncould be set at the same level for each investor or at different levels for different investors or\ninvestor types.\nAn aggregate cap would only limit total ON RRP take-up on a given day. As long as the cap is\nnot binding, individual counterparties could invest as much as they desire in ON RRP, unless\ntake-up is also subject to an individual limit. When an aggregate cap binds, however, individual\ncounterparties would not be guaranteed any particular amount of ON RRP; availability would\ndepend on other counterparties’ investment choices.\nAn aggregate cap on its own could provide a more flexible allocation of usage among\ncounterparties than a system of individual caps. Hence, an aggregate cap may be better suited to\nallocating ON RRPs to the counterparties that value them most. Similarly, if there is not perfect\ncorrelation in individual counterparties’ demand, an aggregate cap could allow for a more\nfavorable tradeoff between the objectives of limiting the size of the facility (and the magnitude\nof potential surges in take-up) and avoiding instances in which caps bind frequently under\nnormal market conditions. For example, an aggregate cap that is expected to bind on a given\nfraction of days can be set lower than the sum of individual caps that likely would bind for at\nleast one counterparty on the same number of days.40\n40 For example, consider two counterparties, each of which has ON RRP demand that varies randomly and\nuniformly from 0 to $10 billion, and assume that their demand is uncorrelated. An aggregate cap for these\ncounterparties set at $10 billion would bind half of the time. If individual caps are each set at $5 billion to maintain\nthe same effective aggregate cap of $10 billion, at least one of the individual caps would bind three-quarters of the\nPage 23\n\nFor an aggregate cap, a rule is needed to allocate usage among investors if the cap is reached. In\nsection 4.4, we describe the auction mechanism currently being tested, which operates in the\nevent that the cap is binding. Another possibility would be to ration awards on a pro rata basis\nbased on investors’ stated demand, although that approach could lead to overbidding when the\ncap is expected to bind.\nUnder an auction-based allocation system, when an aggregate cap is binding, the amount of ON\nRRPs available to an individual investor is determined by that investor’s and others’ bids and\nhence is not completely predictable. As noted above, an advantage of individual caps is that\neach counterparty would know its potential take-up in advance. In addition to reducing\nuncertainty during periods of stress, such predictability may help make an ON RRP facility more\neffective in establishing a floor on short-term interest rates by giving counterparties confidence\nthat a known amount ON RRP is available as a substitute for other investment options.\nStatic cap vs. dynamic cap\nCaps—whether they are set at the individual or aggregate level—could be static or dynamic.\nStatic caps are set in advance and do not vary unless policymakers choose to adjust them. In\ncontrast, dynamic caps would be adjusted at regular intervals (such as daily or weekly), perhaps\nusing a pre-specified rule, which might be based on recent or projected usage. For example, an\naggregate dynamic cap could be reset every week at an amount equal to average take-up during\nthe previous week plus a specified amount. Such a cap could be used as a “circuit breaker” that\nis calibrated to contain potentially disruptive surges in take-up (Dudley 2014).\nThe dotted blue line in chart 7 illustrates the $300 billion overall limit on take-up that has been in\nplace in the exercise since September 22, 2014 and shows how that limit compares to actual ON\nRRP take-up in recent months. The solid red line illustrates an example of a dynamic, circuit-\nbreaker cap, which might be employed in addition to (or instead of) a static limit like the $300\nbillion overall limit in the current exercise. The dynamic cap shown here is equal to average ON\nRRP usage over the previous five days plus $100 billion, although a variety of formulations\nwould be possible.\nMore generically, static and dynamic caps have different advantages. A potential advantage of a\ndynamic cap is that it could be used to control potential one-day surges in ON RRP take-up with\nmore precision than a static limit. (As illustrated in chart 7, potential one-day surges in ON RRP\nusage would be the gaps between a particular cap on a given day and actual, or “normal,” usage\non the previous day.) That is, the dynamic, circuit-breaker cap would adjust automatically to\naccommodate changing demand and market conditions, and it would tend to keep the size of\npotential jumps in usage within a narrower range. With a static cap, when usage is relatively\nlow, the size of potential surges in take-up could be large. However, if usage is trending high\nand close to the static cap, the cap may be so tight that it eliminates potential surges but at the\nexpense of the effectiveness of the facility in setting a floor on short-term rates.\ntime. Experience to date with actual take-up patterns corroborates the point that an aggregate cap set at a given level\ncan accommodate ON RRP demand more effectively than a system of individual caps that sum to the same amount.\nPage 24\n\nA static cap offers greater simplicity than a dynamic cap; a static cap at a given level is\nstraightforward and easily described. In addition, a static cap might be better suited than a\ndynamic cap to limit the Federal Reserve’s footprint in short-term funding markets, as the\ndynamic cap presumably would increase with ON RRP demand. In fact, the circuit-breaker cap\nillustrated in chart 7 could expand fairly rapidly; for example, if usage were to reach the cap on\nsuccessive days, the cap could increase by about $70 billion in three days.\nFinally, a combination of a static overall limit on usage and a dynamic, circuit-breaker cap might\noffer the advantages of each form of cap. That is, the static overall limit could address concerns\nabout the Federal Reserve’s footprint in short-term funding markets, while the circuit-breaker\ncap could mitigate financial-stability risks that might be associated with sudden surges in take-\nup.\n4.4. An auction mechanism to allocate usage\nOn the occasions when an aggregate cap is binding on ON RRP demand, an auction can provide\na market-based pricing mechanism to allocate usage to investors that place the highest value on\nON RRPs. An auction also might mimic the price dynamics of safe assets during flight-to-\nquality episodes.\nFor example, a single-price auction, with a maximum bid rate equal to the ON RRP offering rate,\ncan be used on days when demand exceeds the cap.41 Indeed, such an auction mechanism has\nbeen part of the ON RRP testing exercise since September 22, 2014. Counterparties that wish to\ninvest in ON RRPs must submit both a dollar amount (a bid quantity) and an interest rate. If the\nsum of dollar bids is less than the aggregate cap, then all counterparties receive the amounts that\nthey have requested at the ON RRP offering rate. If total bids exceed the cap (say, at quarter-end\nor during a period of stress), bids are ordered from the lowest interest rate bid to the highest, and\nON RRPs are allocated to bidders starting with those that bid the lowest rate until the aggregate\ncap is reached. The auction rate produced by this procedure (that is, the stop-out rate) is the\nhighest rate bid by any counterparty that is awarded a positive amount of ON RRPs.\nThe “single-price” nature of the auction means that all counterparties that are awarded any ON\nRRPs receive the same interest rate. Those counterparties that bid a rate below the auction rate\nreceive the dollar amounts that they have requested, and any remaining capacity is divided (on a\npro rata basis) among those whose bid rates are equal to the stop-out rate. Ordinarily, the rate\nproduced by this procedure is expected to be the ON RRP offering rate set by the FOMC, but\nwhen the cap binds, the auction-determined rate can be lower.\nAs noted in section 2, the auction mechanism that is part of the current ON RRP testing exercise\nhas been used once to date, on September 30, 2014. Bids totaled $407 billion on that day, so the\n$300 billon aggregate cap was binding. Although the ON RRP offering rate was 5 basis points\nthat day, the auction resulted in an ON RRP rate of 0 basis points.\n41 Uniform-price auctions are currently used for U.S. Treasuries and are also commonly used to conduct initial\npublic offerings.\nPage 25\n\nChart 8 illustrates more generally how ON RRP rates might vary with demand under a system\nthat includes an aggregate cap and an auction. For quantities of ON RRPs below the cap, the\nsupply curve is the thin blue dashed line in the chart. The thin, solid blue curve, D ,\nNormal\nrepresents aggregate demand during normal periods (it is upward-sloping because investors\ndemand more ON RRPs when the rate is higher). In normal times, equilibrium take-up is well\nbelow the cap and the ON RRP rate is the ON RRP offering rate, that is, the maximum bid rate,\nR .\nMax\nIn a crisis, demand might shift out to the thick, solid red curve, D . Demand at the ON RRP\nSurge\noffering rate exceeds the cap, which becomes binding. For demand in excess of the cap, the\nsupply curve is the vertical line at the cap. Total awards when the crisis occurs are limited to the\ncap, and investors receive the rate set by the auction, R , which can fall below the ON RRP\nAuction\noffering rate.\n5. Tradeoffs in the design of an ON RRP facility\nPolicymakers may face tradeoffs in designing an ON RRP facility as they seek to balance\npotentially competing objectives, such as setting an effective floor on money market rates,\nminimizing the unintended effects of a larger Federal Reserve role in short-term funding\nmarkets, and limiting risks to financial stability.\nFor example, setting the ON RRP rate well below the IOER rate would be one means of limiting\nthe footprint of the ON RRP facility in financial markets, but a wide spread between these two\nrates may have some drawbacks. For instance, rates on bank loans, such as the “prime rate,”\nmay remain tied to the top of the FFR target range and hence linked to the IOER rate, which is\nan opportunity cost of bank lending, but funding costs in money markets could remain close to\nthe ON RRP rate. A wide spread could contribute to incentives for lending activity to move\naway from the banking sector. In addition, if the frictions that prevent the IOER rate from\nexerting a strong upward pull on money market rates vary over time, a wide spread could lead to\ngreater volatility in—and uncertainty about—short-term rates.\nAnother tradeoff pertains to setting caps on ON RRP usage. Very low limits that often bind\ncould contain the Federal Reserve’s footprint in short-term funding markets and virtually\neliminate potentially disruptive surges into an ON RRP facility, but such caps also would\ndiminish the effectiveness of ON RRPs in achieving their primary purpose, that is, in helping to\nestablish a floor on short-term interest rates. If the availability of ON RRPs is severely\nconstrained, money market investors will have to look elsewhere for lending opportunities and\npotentially would be willing to invest at rates that fall well short of the ON RRP rate. By\ncontrast, very high caps set at levels that are never close to binding could allow an ON RRP\nfacility to set a firmer floor on interest rates. But such high caps may not do enough to address\nconcerns that a large ON RRP facility could expand the Federal Reserve’s role in short-term\nintermediation and potentially pose a threat to financial stability.\nThese tradeoffs are also likely to evolve. For example, the full implementation of new capital\nand liquidity rules in coming years may drive up financial institutions’ costs of short-term\nfunding and diminish their demand for receiving this type of financing. This could reduce the\nPage 26\n\navailability of money market instruments and boost demand for ON RRPs. If so, all else equal, a\nlarger ON RRP facility may be needed to prevent a widening of spreads between the IOER rate\nand other short-term interest rates. Moreover, in such a scenario, the falloff in private borrowers’\ndemand for short-term funding may diminish concerns about crowding out such funding.\nIn addition, policy normalization itself may affect the tradeoffs. With the FOMC’s target range\nfor the FFR currently set at zero to ¼ percent, structural features of the money markets that\nimpede nominal interest rates from falling below zero are probably helping to keep short-term\ninterest rates in the target range. Once the bottom end of the target range is raised above zero,\nmonetary policy tools that are intended to set a floor for short-term interest rates, such as an ON\nRRP facility, may need to be relied upon more heavily.\nSome of the tradeoffs in policy goals might be addressed by adopting design features that\nbalance objectives effectively. For instance, as noted in section 4, an aggregate cap of the type\ncurrently being tested may be more effective than individual counterparty caps in addressing\nsome of the concerns about an ON RRP facility that are described in this paper. That is, an\naggregate cap can be set at a level that is rarely binding but which allows a smaller footprint and\nsmaller potential surges than a system of individual caps that binds with the same frequency.42\nMoreover, an appropriate balancing of objectives could be fostered by the timing of\nimplementation of some of the features of the facility. For example, the Committee may wish to\ntemporarily employ a sizeable ON RRP cap at the commencement of policy normalization to\nensure a successful process, while announcing a strategy to lower the cap over time and\neventually phase out the facility. Indeed, when the Committee would want to start\nnormalization, economic and financial conditions will be unlikely to be associated with\nheightened risk of a disruptive flight-to-quality event.\nTests of ON RRPs conducted to date have been designed, in part, to provide a better\nunderstanding of the trade-offs involved in pursuing various policy goals. Information garnered\nfrom these tests will be helpful in the design of an ON RRP facility that can achieve the FOMC’s\ndesired level of interest rate control during the normalization process while addressing the\nconcerns related to financial stability and the Federal Reserve’s footprint in short-term funding\nmarkets.\n6. Conclusions\nAn ON RRP facility offers a promising technical advance in the implementation of monetary\npolicy. By making ON RRPs available to a broad set of investors, including nonbank institutions\nthat are significant lenders in money markets, such a facility can complement the use of IOER\nand help control short-term interest rates. Indeed, the FOMC has stated that it intends to use an\nON RRP facility for this purpose during the policy normalization process.\nAt the same time, an ON RRP facility may have important secondary effects with both positive\nand negative implications. The FOMC has considered a range of issues associated with an ON\n42 Even so, limits on individual counterparty usage may be useful for other reasons, such as for preserving access to\nON RRPs for a relatively broad range of counterparties.\nPage 27\n\nRRP facility and has directed the Desk to test several design features of ON RRP operations,\nincluding some which might be used to address undesirable secondary effects. Results of the\ntesting exercise in place since September 2013 have been quite encouraging and indicate that\neven capped offerings of ON RRPs can be effective in setting a floor for short-term interest rates.\nFOMC policymakers have generally agreed upon the importance of a successful commencement\nof the policy normalization process, and they have indicated that they will be prepared take the\nsteps necessary to keep the federal funds rate within the target range established by the\nCommittee (FOMC 2015).\nPage 28\n\nAppendix\nThis appendix supplements sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.4 of the paper. Section A.1 adds to the\nanalysis of section 3.2.3, which examines flight-to-quality dynamics in September 2008, by\nreviewing evidence from two more recent and more modest flight-to-quality episodes. Section\nA.2 furthers the discussion in section 3.2.4 by reviewing MMF portfolio data to provide\nadditional detail on the nature of the institutions and firms that might lose short-term funding\nquickly amidst a large-scale flight-to-quality event.\nA.1. The dynamics of additional flight-to-quality events\nThe two additional flight-to-quality episodes are the debt-ceiling standoffs of July-August 2011\nand October 2013. As was the case for the September 2008 example, we focus here on flows\nthat occurred during a one-week window during each episode.\nDuring the debt-ceiling episodes of 2011 and 2013, large safe-haven flows went primarily to\nbanks, as investors shunned some government securities. As illustrated in charts A1 and A2,\nliquid deposits surged $270 billion in the week ending August 1, 2011, and they increased $120\nbillion in the week ending October 16, 2013.43\nRun dynamics occurred on a more modest scale during the 2011 and 2013 episodes than in 2008,\nand the direction of some flows differed, too. The risk of delays in Treasury payments led to\nflight-to-quality flows from government MMFs. In the week ending on August 1, 2011, both\nprime and government MMFs experienced outflows—each about $60 billion—and CP\noutstanding dropped $50 billion. In the five business days ending on October 16, 2013, net\nredemptions from prime and government MMFs totaled $15 billion and $40 billion, respectively,\nand CP outstanding declined $20 billion.\nAs noted in the text, changes in the perception of the relative risk of various investments may\nlead to sharp differences in flow patterns during flights to quality. The debt-ceiling episodes\nillustrate this point. Government MMFs, which attracted very large inflows in 2008, saw\noutflows in 2011 and 2013, when government securities were themselves a source of concern.\nA.2. Using MMF portfolio holdings data to identify the institutions and firms that might lose\nshort-term funding quickly amidst a large-scale flight-to-quality event\nAs noted in section 3.2.4, the effects of changes in flight-to-quality flows on financial stability\nand economic activity would depend in large part on the nature of the institutions and firms that\nmight lose short-term funding as investors shift to ON RRPs. The short-term assets held by\nMMFs provide one perspective on the composition of borrowers that might be at risk. On\naverage in 2014, 90 percent of the $540 billion in financing that matured within a week from ON\n43 For the 2011 episode, we focus on the period in late July and early August, when concerns about the debt-ceiling\nstandoff appear to have motivated widespread flight-to-quality flows. Earlier that summer, prime MMFs had\nexperienced heavy outflows amid concerns about their large European exposures.\nPage 29\n\nRRP-counterparty MMFs went to 43 recipients.44 Forty-one of these recipients were banks and\ntheir subsidiaries, including broker-dealers, and 34 were foreign banks. The ultimate recipients\nof this financing are less certain, but they would have included clients, such as hedge funds and\nnonfinancial firms, that normally obtain funding from the banks and broker-dealers. For\nexample, $270 billion of the one-week funding was repo, which might have been used to finance\ncollateral for a variety of borrowers.\n44 These figures are based on average funding for each recipient reported at month-ends from January to December\n2014. The financing considered here excludes Federal Reserve RRPs and Treasury securities.\nPage 30\n\nReferences\nCarlson, Mark, Burcu Duygan-Bump, Fabio Natalucci, William R.
