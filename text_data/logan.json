    "text": "The below transcript has been republished from Macro Musings , a podcast hosted by David Beckworth of the Mercatus Center. Listen to the podcast episode .\n\nDavid Beckworth: Lorie, welcome to the show.\n\nLorie Logan: David, thanks for having me. It's a pleasure to be here.\n\nBeckworth: Well, it's a real treat for me, and I know my listeners will also really enjoy having you on the program today. We are recording this January 5th, and as it turns out, Lorie, the minutes from the December FOMC meeting just came out, and I was reading them before I got on the show here with you.  And I read a paragraph that was all about you. I'm reading a paragraph that says, \"In discussing recently established backstop facilities, the manager noted continued progress.\" And it goes on to talk about the standard repo facility and the FEMA repo facility. I'm like, \"Hey, that's Lorie. I'm going to be speaking to Lorie today.\"\n\nBeckworth: So, it's a real honor for me, and I know many of my listeners as well, to get you on this show. Because we talk about this stuff a lot, but to get someone who's actually on the front lines, who's actually doing it. Wow. What a real treat for us. So, thank you for coming on the show. Okay. Lorie, maybe you can tell us a little bit about yourself. How did you get to where you are? What is your career journey like? Any lessons learned along the way?\n\nLogan: Well, thanks. And again, David, it's great to be here. I've had a strong interest in public service and public policy from a young age, which I think was inspired by my family's involvement in local politics, growing up in a small town in Kentucky. And then later fostered by experiences studying political science at Davidson College and later at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs.  And it was at Columbia that I was first introduced to global economic policy issues and opportunities at the Fed. And since then, I spent over 20 years, nearly my entire career, in the Markets Group at the New York Fed, deepening my own understanding of the financial system and working to make monetary policy implementation more effective.\n\nLogan: I started off in 2000 as a trader analyst, reporting on financial market developments and executing domestic operations on the government securities desk. And it was this real-time interaction of analysis and trading that provided an incredible opportunity to learn and to work at the intersection of public policy and financial markets. And I still love those aspects of what I do today. My time in the Markets Group has been marked with periods of accelerated learning. I was on the desk and involved with the historic lending in the securities lending program on September 11th. I crafted plans for liquidity facilities and the large scale asset purchases during the global financial crisis, and led development of the overnight RRP facility to support interest rate control after the GFC. And these experiences deepened my perspective, and over time I grew into increasing leadership positions.\n\nLogan: Two years ago, I was appointed to the SOMA manager role, where I'm now responsible for implementing the FOMCs policy directives and managing the system's $8 trillion securities portfolio. And this involves overseeing open market operations and reporting on financial markets at each of the FOMC meeting minutes. And you heard about that in the minutes that were released today. And working at the Fed has just been an incredible experience. I've had the privilege of serving in a mission-driven organization, one that's focused on making the economy stronger and the financial system more stable for all. And to me, that's especially grounding each day. And I get to do it with an amazing group of people.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. I want to talk about that group of people in a minute, but just going back to your experience, you were there from 2000 to the present. So, you've seen a lot, as you mentioned. You have a lot of institutional knowledge inside of yourself, a lot of human capital for the New York Fed, and you were there for 9/11. And I'm just wondering, what was it like to go through that? Did you have to shut down the office? Were you there working through it? What was it like at that time? Because you're pretty close to the location of the Twin Towers.\n\nLogan: That was just an incredibly difficult experience, and very early on in my tenure at the New York Fed. We were very close to the towers and it was both a difficult time personally and professionally for me and for all those that I was working with. I was there that day, and it was a difficult day to participate in the operations that we did to support market function, and was difficult in the days after. But at that time, I really learned what it means to be a part of the central bank and the role and responsibility of the central bank to be open and available to provide liquidity when the financial market needs it most.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. Very harrowing experience for sure. Well, let's talk about your group at the New York Fed. You oversee a lot, and I'm just looking off your bio here. I see four different roles and this may understate what you actually do, but let me list them off and you can correct me if I'm wrong or add to the list.  But one of your roles is, and you mentioned this already, but the execution of monetary policy for the FOMC. Number two, provision of fiscal agent services to the US Treasury Department and support of its debt issuance and foreign exchange operations. Three, analysis of global financial market developments. And four, production of the New York Fed's reference rates, including the SOFR. So, you do a lot. And in each of those, I guess bullet points, you have a lot of things you could unpack underneath that. Is that list a comprehensive list or is there more you would add to that?\n\nDay-to-Day Operations at the New York Fed\n\nLogan: Well, those are all the things that we do on the trading desk, which is a part of the Markets Group at the New York Fed. In addition to those activities, the Markets Group also, like each of the reserve banks, executes the discount window and also provides financial services for other or central banks. But as the SOMA manager, I'm responsible for overseeing policy implementation analysis. And to do that, I lead a large team of traders and analysts and policy advisors with a real range of backgrounds in finance, economics and policy. So, maybe I'd to share a little bit about my day-to-day and how that looks, most days, and also how that changes over time.\n\nLogan: In terms of my day-to-day, I think my kids, who've had just a really unique and front row seat as we've been working remotely during the pandemic, describe it best. They say my day starts very early and is jam-packed with meetings. And I think that's pretty accurate. My day does begin early. Often starting on an international call before 7:00 AM, but some staff come in even earlier around 4:00 to begin monitoring overseas markets. And then we all come together each morning at 9:05 to discuss our operations and how we're interpreting markets.\n\nLogan: It's an important meeting for me, and it's a meeting that's been held at that time for decades. At that meeting, I typically have my eye on how effectively our operations are working. And I'm also thinking broadly about markets, trying to put what the team is seeing in the context of the FOMCs goals. And then the rest of my day is typically spent in meetings geared toward helping the group achieve on its mission. We run a big operation to manage the portfolio. There's a lot of deliberation and planning to ensure the operations run smoothly and that we communicate about them clearly. And I also spend a significant amount of time with our board colleagues in DC, and then with policymakers, about bigger picture implementation strategy decisions.\n\nLogan: We also to maintain a broad range of external relationships. And a lot of my time is focused on those relationships, and with other central bank colleagues, to share implementation experiences and to really learn from each other.  The most important part of my time though is spent on our people and what they need to be successful. I manage a large team, as I said, and work to ensure that we understand our evolving priorities and that the team's working well. We certainly faced some tough challenges recently, as we've shifted to a remote virtual environment, and that's going to be a continued focus as we develop new ways of doing our work after the pandemic.\n\nBeckworth: Well, let's say there's a crisis emerging, let's say for example, repo panic 2019. You see things unfolding, do you have the power to go ahead and do something, or do you have to call the FOMC first and get authority from them? Are you empowered at some level to respond to market developments?\n\nLogan: As you noted, there are definitely periods when we have to organize our time to be more responsive to these evolving developments. And in those times, the structure of the day is quite similar, but we're in this crisis management mode, and the pace accelerates. The decisions that we're making are more complex and made with less information, but we do make them with an eye to flexibility so we can learn and adapt quickly. And really depends on the environment that we're in at the time, which decisions we make directly on the desk and which we are making at the direction of the FOMC. In each FOMC meeting, the committee issues a directive to the desk, which gives us instructions on how to implement monetary policy, so some of those decisions are ones that we make be at the direction from that particular directive for the intermediate period. And then there's others that might be unusual that we may want to recommend. And those may require a change in the directive or an actual committee vote in between meetings. So it really depends on the environment we're in.\n\nBeckworth: Okay. I want to move on to actual developments and what you have done over the past few years, particularly what happened in March, 2020. Before we do that, go one last question about the New York Fed. And this is a less serious question. But I'm sure you've seen Die Hard with a Vengeance , the movie where the Die Hard character ends up at the New York Fed. And these people try to steal gold from the New York Fed. Is the gold still there? Have you visited the gold down in the basement of the New York Fed?\n\nLogan: Well, I'm certain the gold's still there. I haven't actually been in the building in a bit of time, David.\n\nBeckworth: Okay.\n\nLogan: Given the pandemic, but I know it's still there and it is a really interesting tour to do. My middle son actually is the one who's been able to do that tour with me. And it's been a real highlight for him. And hopefully we'll be back in the building and my other kids will get the chance to do the tour, too.\n\nBeckworth: Very nice. All right. So you've given a lot of talks on what happened in March 2020. The “Dash For Cash” as it's called. A number of talks. You were a part of the Fed's response to it. And I was hoping you could summarize for us your view of what happened during that period.\n\nThe \"Dash for Cash\" and Subsequent Policy Response\n\nLogan: So perhaps I'll take a step back and first talk about what we observed at the time. And then turn to how we responded. So in first, in terms of what we observed, we first saw changes in financial markets early in 2020. Equity markets globally were volatile, responding to the virus that was spreading quickly. By late February, as more cases were confirmed in the US, conditions began to decline quite rapidly. I think it's really important to first emphasize the magnitude of the shock that financial markets were absorbing in early 2020. At the time, the economy had been experiencing relatively steady economic growth. And over the course of just a few weeks, market participants became concerned that large parts of the economy could completely shut down, potentially creating a historic recession. And additionally, market participants were also highly concerned that the financial system itself might not function properly in a remote environment.\n\nLogan: The infrastructure of the global financial system is complex. It's interconnected. There are dependencies all over along the chain of the transactions. So while the financial system itself ultimately made that transition relatively smoothly, that was not an outcome, I think, many thought possible at the time. So the result was just extreme volatility as financial assets repriced to reflect these developments. And there was also a broad base dash for cash as investors sought the safety of cash. Even Treasury securities, which are usually seen as the most liquid of financial assets, were being sold broadly to raise dollars. And so this shift was really unprecedented. Unprecedented in its scale and in its scope, and resulted in severe disruptions across financial markets and had the potential to make economic conditions even worse by cutting off the flow of credit to households and businesses that were most vulnerable.\n\nLogan: So how did we respond? Well, over the first few weeks in March, our operations transitioned from business as usual to managing an unprecedented pandemic. By early March, we had already put the staff in a heightened monitoring stance, and had taken steps to increase the size and lengthen the tenor of repo operations. And you'd asked earlier, are there decisions that you can make directly on the desk? And those are two examples of ones that we can make directly. However, the conditions continue to worsen and to broaden. And so, to me, the turning point was March 12th. And it was on that day where we took more aggressive action. First, we offered almost unlimited amounts of funding through the repos. And then later that day, to help alleviate the strains in Treasury cash markets, we announced a shift in our purchases of Treasury bills to purchase across the Treasury coupon curve.\n\nLogan: And that's an example where we actually needed approval from the chair to make that type of decision. So right there, just that one day, you can see the different types of decisions that we make and the authorities that we have. My own sense was that these moves would help stem the dysfunction. But by the end of the day, we were already seeing significant one way flows and conditions continue to worsen. And we could see that in just a broad set of metrics that we were monitoring. So very late that night, we conferenced again with the team to assess whether more aggressive actions were needed, what options we could put on the table, and then whether we could make those options operationally feasible within such a short window of time because we needed to implement whatever recommendation we'd be putting forward that next morning.\n\nLogan: So after a very lengthy call, we decided to recommend that we pull forward an entire month's worth of Treasury purchases into a single day. Such an aggressive option we hoped would signal that we were prepared to take the actions needed to maintain functioning. And so that discussion was really when I realized we were in an unprecedented environment. Just the extraordinary demand for cash was creating conditions that required us to respond with unmatched size and speed. And ultimately, the FOMC announced an unbounded commitment to support market function. And we met daily from that point on about how many and which Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities to buy. And of course, the Fed also took a broad range of other actions to stem dysfunction across markets, including the FX swap lines with foreign central banks, and also a broad range of liquidity and credit facilities. And it was the combination of these actions, I think, that were successful at supporting the flow of credit in such an uncertain time. And I just want to emphasize that all of this was done by staff working from home.\n\nLogan: Many of them amazing working at home for the first time. And the conditions were quite challenging. And we're always investing in operational readiness, and we'd had virtual capabilities. But we had never operated from home to this extent. So this was a new experience for us and for all of our counterparties. And I'm still in awe of what the team was really able to achieve in those early days.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. A very amazing story there. And I think it's important for us to do the counterfactual. What if the New York Fed hadn't stepped in? I mean the global dollar funding markets are so large, they're global, as you mentioned. And if you hadn't stepped in, it could have been a really horrible outcome, another financial crisis like we saw in 2008, or worse. And so the demands on your staff, I imagine, just are going to grow over time as global dollar funding markets grow as well. I also want to come back to this, maybe an idea of what was this crisis? And from my perspective, and correct me if I'm wrong, the dash for cash was more of a plumbing issue than a fundamental fiscal solvency issue of the US government. It was just people trying to liquidate positions or get into some of their asset and they couldn't. The plumbing was constrained, maybe even cracked or broken. Is that a fair way to analogize what happened?\n\nLogan: I think the experience really underscored the fact that, while the Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid in the world, there are some underlying fragilities. So I think that's what you're referring to. Of course, the pandemic represented as shock of such magnitude that I think even the most resilient market likely would've experienced disruptions. But we've also seen disruptions to Treasury market functioning in more benign environments. And here I'm thinking back to October, 2014 or September, 2019. And sometimes, with those, there was a seemingly little trigger. So I do think, given the importance of this [Treasury] market, financing the government and in supporting the implementation of monetary policy, that it's critical that we take steps to enhance the plumbing and resiliency of the market. So I do think that is a big focus of the work that we're doing on the desk and the inner agency working group on Treasury markets is really focused on.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. I read that report preparing for the show. The inner agency working group for market surveillance from, I guess, November last year. And also, there's been the Brookings Task Force on Financial Stability, Group of Thirty. A lot of great pieces coming out explaining what's going on. And a lot of them have common suggestions for improving. And let me just throw them out there and let me know what you think. So one of them is increased central clearing in the Treasury market. Another is a standing repo facility. And we can kind of check that one off, that's already been adopted. And then several others tweak the supplemental leverage ratio and then better data. But let me just start with the first one, then maybe go one by one. Central clearing, do you see an important role for that moving forward?\n\nThe Role of Central Clearing Moving Forward\n\nLogan: I do. And maybe just before jumping into those potential changes to improve their resiliency. Maybe I could highlight just a couple of themes from my own experience. And I think that we've seen across studies that you mentioned, because I think it's those vulnerabilities that these different proposals will need to be addressing. And I think that'll help us evaluate them as we talk about it. I really think there are four themes that have resonated with my own experience from the studies that we've seen come out. One common theme is that the US Treasury market has grown so much and it's really outpaced the growth in dealer intermediation capacity. Another change in the Treasury market is the growth of electronic trading and non-dealer intermediaries.\n\nLogan: Some electronic markets have high frequency trading and very limited customer interaction. And as a result, participants are less likely to continue engaging in this market when volatility increases. And the third is the proliferation of trading venues and settlement mechanisms that have also created some fragmentation in the market structure. And I think, and result in more frictions across markets, particularly in times of stress. And we saw this play out in March and in April of 2020. And then finally, even as the market becomes more complex and interconnected, real-time data on positions and flows in the US treasuries is still pretty limited. And that reduces visibility for both market participants and for the official sector. So I think as we look at these different proposals, it's important to keep in mind these vulnerabilities because I think we want to be addressing these directly.\n\nLogan: And as you noted, several have put forward some recommendations and the IAWG in particular has said that they would focus on five. Those are improving resilience of market intermediation, improving data quality, evaluating expanded central clearing, enhancing trading venue transparency and oversight, and then finally assessing effects of fund leverage and liquidity risk management practices. And I think the key point I'd make in listing these work streams is that it's very unlikely that there's a standalone solution. I think these are all complimentary efforts. And I think the goal is to ensure that the US Treasury market is as resilient as possible using the combination of these changes that have been proposed. So some of the ones you noted central clearing, the SLR, the standing repo facility are all complimentary in that regard. But I do think we need to stay focused on a package of changes and not get too focused on any one proposal in particular.\n\nBeckworth: Well, one of those proposals has come through, come to fruition and that's the standing repo facility. I guess it was last year that the FOMC made that one official as well as making the FIMA repo facility permanent. Tell us a little bit about the standing repo facility. I've been a fan of this idea for some time. I've had some people on the show to talk about it, but what do you see it doing moving forward?\n\nThe Future of the Standing Repo Facility\n\nLogan: Well, I do think the decision on the standing repo facility and also the FIMA repo facility, which the committee voted on at the same time was a very historic decision with respect to the framework, and one that the committee deliberated on for some time. These facilities were implemented to support effective policy implementation by limiting the potential for pressures in repo or in global dollar funding markets to spill back to the Fed funds market. In recent years, we've observed that pressures in money markets can emerge rapidly and with little warning. And we saw that in September 2019, and again in March 2020. And since pressures in these overnight markets can be difficult to predict and are harder to tamp down once they emerge, I too do think that a key benefit is their ability to help mitigate rate pressures before they develop into these larger disruptions.\n\nLogan: And this should enhance market confidence and help to limit those pressures from building, even if the facilities end up being little used. So while not the primary objective of the facilities, I think having these backstops in financing markets can also have important positive effects for the treasury market functioning more generally. Certainly, the SRF reduces the potential for disruptions in Treasury repo markets to then hinder the dealer's ability to make markets in the Treasury cash market. And the FIMA repo facility can help reduce sales of Treasury securities by the FIMA accounts by providing them with this temporary liquidity against their holdings.\n\nLogan: Now, of course, these repo facilities alone won't prevent all types of pressures on the Treasury market to the extent that limits on intermediation capacity or sales of Treasury securities are happening for factors other than the need for temporary liquidity. Repo won't fully substitute for outright sales of securities, but they can meaningfully I think limit the potential for disruptions. It is a very important development, not only for our monetary policy implementation framework, but also for the Treasury market resiliency efforts that we're working on.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah, it was interesting to read today in the FOMC minutes from the December 2021 meeting that several participants said, hey, this standing repo facility will make tapering easier. It may even affect the final destination, the final size of the balance sheet if people can easily substitute between treasuries and reserves. If they know that's there, that confidence will make the transition to whatever your final target may be an easier path. So interesting to see that happen. And again, great timing for the minutes to come out as we are recording this show. And that's a nice segue to the next thing I want to talk about, and that's the Fed's balance sheet. You mentioned already, it's 8 trillion plus, and the FOMC has announced… or it is already tapering. And I know you can't speak to policy, but I'll just say from my side, it appears from the minutes today that there's going to be some QT or actual runoff occurring this year. And I'm just curious from your perspective, how does that work? How would we see your office, the Federal Reserve in general, do balance sheet reduction?\n\nAsset Purchases and the Process of Balance Sheet Reduction\n\nLogan: Well, maybe it's useful just to take a step back and talk about the asset purchases themselves as a standard tool in the Fed’s tool kit and how those work mechanically, and then come back to mechanically how they work as we begin to slow that process and ultimately decrease the size of the balance sheet. As I said, the asset purchases have become a standard tool in the toolkit to provide accommodation when short term interest rates are near zero. And in terms of the mechanics, I think about them working in a couple of ways. First, they work through the portfolio balance channel. When the Fed or the desk purchases securities from our counterparties, it raises the price of these securities and then lowers their yields. And those counterparties who sold securities to us may then rebalance their own portfolios to invest in other assets, lowering yields broadly, and then easing financial conditions.\n\nLogan: So that's the first channel we tend to think about these working. And the second one is a signaling channel. Asset purchases can signal that the Fed's committed to maintaining accommodated conditions and is unlikely to thereby raise the Fed funds rate for some length of time, and this also reduces yields by lowering the expected path of policy rates. And in periods of stress, such as that we saw in the pandemic, asset purchases can also restore market functioning and reduce risk premia that could otherwise increase yields. And this was a key benefit of the purchases early in the pandemic. So the overall goal again is to lower long term interest rates and keep credit flowing to the economy. And since the onset of the pandemic, the desk has been directed by the committee to purchase significant amounts of treasuries and agency MBS.\n\nLogan: And our assessment is that they've been very effective at easing financial conditions and generally supporting the recovery. And as you noted at the December meeting, the committee decided to accelerate the taper of these asset purchases. And this action was prompted by a rapidly strengthening labor market and currently elevated inflationary pressures and Chair Powell noted that a quicker conclusion of asset purchases would better position policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes. So our focus on the desk is on executing this reduction in the pace of asset purchases and to do so smoothly for the FOMC. And so far, I think this has gone well, and we haven't observed any challenges associated with the decline and purchase amounts. But of course, whereas I said always monitoring developments and keeping an eye towards effects there.\n\nLogan: Now, at some point when the current level of accommodation is no longer necessary to achieve the committee's goals, the committee's going to want to reduce the size of the Fed's balance sheet and unwinding these measures demonstrates that this important tool is used when needed. But importantly, it can be withdrawn once the committee's goals are achieved. And we do have some experience with the mechanics of reducing the balance sheet. At the conclusion of the large scale asset purchase programs after the global financial crisis, the committee did undertake balance sheet normalization that lasted about two years. So in terms of the mechanics of that process, balance sheet normalization was conducted in a gradual manner and a predictable manner. I think those are the two key themes there. And there were two implementation elements to that. First, principle payments from our maturing securities were no longer reinvested and that reduces the balance sheet size. And in other words, it was an organic process. We didn't sell assets. And then the second mechanical feature was that caps were set on these monthly redemption amounts to ensure a steady decline.\n\nLogan: And I think overall this process, that process of natural maturities rather than sales and caps to ensure a steady pace seemed to work quite well. And at the December meeting, the committee did review this previous experience that it had with balance sheet normalization. And there were several aspects of that previous approach that the committee felt remained applicable. Maybe I'll just highlight a couple of those themes from the discussion and these were highlighted in the minutes. The first one I think is clear communications, you know, clear communications provided in advance of the policy decisions were viewed as helpful in setting expectations and enhancing understanding of the overall policy approach and the second was consistent with the previous normalization episode. Changes in the target range for the Fed funds rate were still seen to be the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy.\n\nLogan: Then third, using caps on these redemption amounts, the mechanical process I talked about, can ensure balance sheet reduction occurs in a measured and predictable manner. I think that was recognized as being a very useful approach. Then fourth, retaining flexibility to make adjustments to the approach was viewed as helpful in nimbly responding to economic and market conditions. Those were some of the common themes, I think, that were recognized in looking back at the previous experience. But there were also some differences, and the committee noted that the economic outlook is much stronger now than in the previous episode and that the balance sheet is much larger and that these differences would be taken to account when making decisions about the balance sheet. As the minutes and the chair noted, no decisions have been made. The FOMC is going to be discussing these balance sheet issues in coming meetings, and our focus on the desk will be working to support those deliberations.\n\nBeckworth: Yeah. You've had the experience already of doing QT, or quantitative tightening, but still, this is not a trivial task, right? I mean, there's a lot of things you got to consider, as you mentioned. You got to do only so much or you allow the principal to run off. You got to control that. You got to gauge the stance of the economy. That's the conditional forecast. You got to worry about the TGA balance, right? What's the Treasury doing? You have all these moving parts that you have to control for. So you do have your work cut out for you when it comes to actually implementing this. It's not just  press a button on a keyboard, and then it's done. There's a lot of judgment, I guess, involved in this exercise.\n\nLogan: Well, I think there are a whole host of considerations that you outlined that the committee will be thinking about and exploring in the upcoming meetings. At some point, the desk will get a very clear directive from the committee about how to implement this policy normalization and balance sheet normalization process. That directive, I think, will be very transparent and clear in terms of the mechanics of what we'll need to do to deliver on that directive.\n\nBeckworth: Now, don't you have some blog posts coming out at the New York Fed related to this discussion of the Fed's balance sheet?\n\nLogan: We do. Next week, we'll be releasing a series of blog posts about the Federal Reserve's monetary policy implementation framework. The purpose of the series is to help talk about how the Federal Reserve implements policy today. We'll be looking at the implementation framework, the tools, interest on reserve balances in the overnight RRP facility in supporting that framework. We're going to talk a little bit about technical adjustments to interest on reserve balances and overnight RRP and how we've used technical adjustments to support policy implementation. Then a little bit more about this new backstop facility, the standing repo facility that we talked about earlier. So I'm excited about the series and hope the audience takes the opportunity to review them.\n\nBeckworth: We look forward to seeing it. So speaking of the Fed's balance sheet, there's this runoff that's likely to occur. The balance sheet will get smaller. There's some destination. Is it too soon to start thinking about where that destination is? Is that going to be determined by the FOMC? Let me rephrase the question this way. Will the FOMC come up with a dollar size for the Fed's balance sheet, or more general, we'll know we're there when we're there kind of framing for that journey?\n\nIs There an End Goal for the Fed’s Balance Sheet?\n\nLogan: Well, in terms of the future of the balance sheet, the committee has stated that it plans to continue to implement policy in an ample reserves regime or a floor system. So we'll talk more about that in the post that'll be released. This implies that the balance sheet will need to be maintained at a level that supplies ample reserves to the banking system. Reserves right now are very large. They're highly abundant or super abundant, so I expect the balance sheet could decline some way from here and still maintain an ample level of reserves. But I think the key point is that the long run size of the balance sheet is uncertain because banks' demand for reserves varies over time.\n\nLogan: At the December FOMC meeting, participants suggested that it will be important that we monitor money market conditions as reserves fall in order to assess the appropriate level of reserves to maintain ample conditions. Indeed, we do have a lot of money market data, which allows us to observe those conditions in money markets at a granular level. And we do have our experience from the prior normalization to help serve as a guide when assessing those reserve conditions. And we have the new standing repo facility in place as a backstop now, which wasn't the case during the prior normalization period. So I expect that the long run portfolio size will again be driven by demand for Federal Reserve liabilities consistent with maintaining an ample reserves regime. The exact level is something that's unknown and will be something that we'll be monitoring to determine as the balance sheet declines.\n\nBeckworth: Well, I'm looking forward to this journey, and I'm especially looking forward to the role that the standing repo facility will play in this journey. Because as you said, it could affect how many reserves are demanded by the banks. In the few minutes we have left, Lorie, I want to ask about the framework you mentioned, ample reserves framework, or a floor operating system. We haven't touched on this. The overnight reverse repo facility, does that set the floor effectively for the rates and you could think of standing repo and discount rate being the ceiling, and you want the Fed funds rate somewhere between that? What role would the interest on reserves play in that system?\n\nThe Floor System and the Role of Interest on Reserves\n\nLogan: Well, just going back to 2019 when the FOMC adopted this framework for implementing policy, where they supply an ample supply of reserves that ensures the Fed's administered rates influence the Fed funds rate and other overnight rates. In a floor system, our job is to ensure that reserves are supplied to meet banks' needs for liquid balances and that the IORB and the overnight RRP are important features.\n\nLogan: Now in most economies, the interest on reserve balances would be enough to control interest rates. However in the US, banks are a smaller share of the financial system. So when the FOMC pursues policies such as asset purchases or lending like we've been doing since March 2020, expands the Fed's balance sheet, and banks can end up with more reserves than they're comfortable holding. So during these times, they lower the rates at which they take deposits, and the rates trade below IORB. So in order to enhance rate control, the overnight reverse repo facility was established, and this does place a floor under overnight rates by providing a range of money market participants, this other option.\n\nLogan: This really does two things. It improves investors' bargaining power in overnight markets, and it creates an alternative investment that can spread Federal Reserve liabilities beyond reserves that reduces the pressure on banks' balance sheets. The FOMC's been essentially operating with this floor system for many years now and using both IORB and the overnight RRP as key tools. That's turned out to be quite effective at controlling rates through a variety of environments.\n\nLogan: Recently, the overnight RRP has become a more important component of that framework, along with the growth in the Fed's balance sheet. Overnight RRP usage tends to grow when there are downward pressures on rates relative to IORB. This can happen when reserves are elevated and banks try to shed deposits or when the supply of short-term investments such as Treasury bills declines. In the current environment, we're seeing both of those elements. So the overnight RRP facility is particularly important now and a particularly attractive investment for money market participants. So we've seen the facility increase to record high levels. I think my main observation would just be that both IORB and overnight RRP are important components to the floor.\n\nBeckworth: Well with that, our time is up. Our guest today's been Lorie Logan. Lorie, thank you so much for coming on the show.\n\nLogan: David, thanks for having me. It's been a real pleasure and hope to be able to return some time soon.\n\nBeckworth: Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nI  want to thank the Money Marketeers of New York University for inviting me to  speak again today. 1 These events provide a valuable forum for  discussing the intersection of monetary policy implementation and money markets.\n\nWhen  I last spoke to this group in December 2020, there had been an historically rapid  expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet associated with actions taken  in response to the COVID-19 shock.  These  measures were highly effective at restoring market functioning and fostering  accommodative financial conditions, helping the U.S. economy recover from the  pandemic-related downturn.  At the same  time, they generated a significant increase in reserves supplied to the banking  system.  This year, even as the Federal  Reserve’s balance sheet expanded at a more gradual overall pace, growth in  Federal Reserve liabilities held by market participants—both in the form of  bank reserves and in overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility balances—accelerated,  and money market conditions shifted notably.\n\nIn  my last talk, I suggested that one of the key advantages of the Federal Open  Market Committee’s (FOMC’s) ample reserves operational framework is its flexibility,  allowing monetary policy to be implemented efficiently and effectively across a  range of environments.  Today, I would  like to share some observations on how the framework adapted to much higher  levels of liquidity this year and is working as intended to support control  over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates.  I also want to highlight changes the FOMC has  made in recent months to ensure the implementation framework continues to be  effective through different environments, even on occasions when shocks disrupt  markets.\n\nBefore  I continue, let me note that the views I express today are my own, and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nRecent Shifts In  Liquidity Have Been Historically Large, And Money Market Rates Declined…\n\nLet  me start with a brief review of the recent evolution of the Federal Reserve’s  balance sheet, and how this has influenced conditions in money markets.  In response to the COVID-19 shock, the Federal  Reserve, along with many other central banks, expanded its balance sheet to  support the smooth functioning of financial markets, and maintain the vital  flow of credit to households and businesses.   From March to December 2020, the Federal Reserve’s assets increased by roughly  $3 trillion, as shown in Figure 1 .\n\nThis  expansion in assets could have been accompanied by a commensurate increase in Federal  Reserve liabilities in the form of bank reserves. 2 However, concurrent with the growth in the  balance sheet in 2020, the U.S. Treasury’s General Account (TGA)—effectively  Treasury’s cash account at the Federal Reserve—rose dramatically.  Treasury increased the TGA to ensure  sufficient cash was available to support programs aimed at helping American households  and businesses weather the pandemic. 3 Growth in the TGA, as indicated in Figure 2 , limited  reserve growth associated with the balance sheet expansion.\n\nStarting  in mid-2020, the pace of net asset purchases slowed, and in December 2020 the  FOMC adopted guidance that it would continue to increase its holdings of  Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by at least  $120 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward  its economic goals. 4 However, even with this more steady pace of  balance sheet growth, Federal Reserve liabilities held by market  participants—in the form of reserves and ON RRP balances—increased sharply in  2021, as indicated on the right in Figure 2 .  This resulted from the dramatic $1.5 trillion decline  in the TGA since the beginning of the year. 5\n\nUnsurprisingly,  the increase in reserves resulted in downward pressure on overnight interest  rates—including the federal funds rate—relative to the interest on reserve  balances (IORB) rate. 6 As reserve balances rose, some banks  perceived a cost to expanding their balance sheets further and lowered their  deposit rates. 7 In response, depositors and other investors shifted  assets to money market mutual funds (money funds), which raised demand for  money market investments and put downward pressure on money market rates more  broadly.  On the year, government money  fund assets under management (AUM) have increased by over $320 billion, as  shown in Figure 3 .\n\nIt’s  important to note that at the same time demand for money market investments rose,  the net supply of U.S. Treasury bills—an essential investment for money funds  and other investors—fell by an historically large amount:  over $1.2 trillion so far in 2021, as  indicated in Figure 3 .  This combination  of increased liquidity and reduced supply of investment options had the  potential to put substantial further downward pressure on overnight rates,  including the federal funds rate.\n\n…The ON RRP  Facility Worked As Intended To Support Rate Control\n\nThe  ON RRP facility was established as part of the FOMC’s ample reserves framework  in order to support interest rate control in a wide variety of environments.  It offers a broad range of money market  investors the option to invest in an overnight reverse repo with the Federal  Reserve, which improves their bargaining power for private investments.  It also offers an alternative investment when private investments are not available at rates above the ON RRP  rate. 8\n\nIn  the first quarter of this year, ON RRP facility usage became more regular, and it  has increased rapidly since.  Recently, reductions  in the TGA and Treasury bill supply have accelerated, and the ON RRP facility  has exceeded $1.2 trillion consistently since mid-September, as shown in Figure 4 .\n\nThe  ON RRP facility is working as intended, even as usage expands to new highs.  Just as IORB creates a floor for rates on bank lending activity, the ON RRP facility supports control of the federal funds rate by providing a soft floor for the overnight money market activity of a broader set of money market  participants. 9 Usage of the facility also broadens the  holders of Federal Reserve liabilities beyond banks, easing pressure on bank  balance sheets that may result from reserve growth.  As shown in Figure 2 , the supply of reserves has  increased relatively modestly this year, as the ON RRP facility absorbed much  of the increase in liquidity from the decline in the TGA and ongoing asset  purchases.\n\nAn  essential feature of the ON RRP facility is that it has a fixed rate and  therefore its size is determined by the interest rate environment. 10 Just as usage of the facility grew  in response to downward pressure on money market rates, it should decline in  response to increases in them.  For  example, if Treasury were to expand Treasury bill supply and interest rates on  these instruments rose above the ON RRP rate, investors should naturally  reallocate out of the facility and back into these assets.  Similarly, if the supply of reserves declines  and rates rise relative to the IORB rate, ON RRP balances should naturally recede.  This dynamic has been observed in the past.  Following the expansion of the Federal  Reserve’s balance sheet in response to the Global Financial Crisis, the level  of reserves began to decline in 2014, and as money market rates moved away from  the ON RRP rate, usage of the facility gradually fell back to zero.\n\nThe  flexible size of the ON RRP facility helps the FOMC’s ample reserves framework  adapt smoothly to different reserve and money market environments . The FOMC has indicated that, with the federal  funds rate likely to be constrained by its effective lower bound more  frequently than in the past, it is prepared to use its full range of  tools—including large-scale asset purchases—to achieve its maximum employment  and price stability goals. 11 As such, extended periods of elevated ON RRP usage  may be a relatively regular feature of the ample reserves framework.  This isn’t a challenge for monetary policy  implementation; it’s the framework working as designed.\n\nModest  Adjustments Were Made To Terms Of Implementation Tools To Evolve With The New  Environment…\n\nEven  with the ON RRP facility promoting interest rate control this year, the Federal  Reserve has made some modest adjustments to its implementation tools.\n\nAs  I’ve just described, IORB provides a floor for bank lending rates, and the ON  RRP facility supports control of the federal funds rate by creating a floor beneath  the overnight activity of a broader set of money market participants.  Earlier this year, the IORB rate was 10 basis  points and the ON RRP rate was zero.   Unsurprisingly, as reserves increased, the effective federal funds rate  (EFFR) edged further below the IORB rate and closer to the bottom of the FOMC’s  target range.  Against the backdrop of  declining Treasury bill supply and rising government money fund AUM, overnight secured  rates fell to near zero.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve implemented a technical adjustment to administered rates in  June, lifting the IORB and ON RRP rates by five basis points each, shifting up  their position in the target range.  This  was a normal adjustment in response to evolving money market conditions, intended  to help maintain the federal funds rate well within the target range.  Lifting the ON RRP rate above zero also  helped support the smooth functioning of money markets.  With secured rates near zero, money funds  with stable net asset values (NAVs) could have experienced challenges covering operating  costs and limited inflows, increasing the potential for further downward  pressure on rates.\n\nThis  was the sixth such technical adjustment.   Like the five adjustments before, it worked as expected.  Both secured and unsecured overnight rates  shifted modestly higher, in line with the change in the two administered rates.  As shown in Figure 5 , throughout this year  not only has the EFFR printed well within the target range, but the bulk of  trading in the federal funds market—as shown by the 1st and 99th  percentiles of trades underlying the EFFR—has also fallen within the range.\n\nThe adjustments to the Federal  Reserve’s policy implementation tools this year haven’t been limited to administered  rates.  To ensure the ON RRP facility is  effective, it is important to provide access to a sufficiently broad set of  money market participants and to offer counterparties adequate investment  capacity.\n\nIn April, the eligibility  requirements for RRP counterparties were adjusted to make the facility more  accessible, in line with the New York Fed’s efforts to ensure that its  counterparty policies both support effective policy implementation and promote  a fair and competitive marketplace.   Since then, we have onboarded new RRP counterparties, increasing the  diversity of our counterparty base.\n\nThe ON RRP facility’s  per-counterparty limit has also been adjusted this year.  In March, the FOMC lifted the limit to $80  billion to account for changes in the size and concentration of the money fund  industry since 2014, and to ensure sufficient capacity to maintain an effective  floor under the federal funds rate.  Most  recently, as ON RRP usage steadily increased, the FOMC raised the limit again,  this time to $160 billion.  Since the  increase, some counterparties have participated in ON RRP operations for more  than $80 billion, including on the September quarter-end date.\n\n…And Additional Tools  Were Added To Strengthen The Policy Implementation Framework\n\nIn  order for the FOMC’s ample reserves framework to effectively support policy  implementation through different environments, it also needs to be resilient to  occasional shocks that can arise.  In  recent years, we have observed that pressures in money markets can emerge  rapidly, and that these can spill back into the federal funds market.  Based on the effectiveness of repo operations  to support policy implementation, particularly during periods of stress, the  FOMC established two new standing overnight repo facilities at its July  meeting:  a domestic standing repo  facility, the SRF, and a repo facility for foreign and international monetary  authorities, the FIMA Repo Facility. 12\n\nThe  SRF is intended to address pressures in the repo market that can spill into the  federal funds market, and to flexibly add reserves, when needed.  Both primary dealers and banks can access repo funding through the SRF against a limited set of high-quality securities:  U.S. Treasuries, agency debt, and agency  MBS. 13 While primary dealers have long been  counterparties to the Federal Reserve’s open market operations, the FOMC  decided in July to add banks as eligible counterparties to the SRF, which  allows them to access the facility on similar terms as primary dealers.  Additionally, banks are key participants in  the federal funds market and adding them should enhance interest rate control  by offering a backstop source of liquidity.   Earlier this month, the New York Fed began accepting formal expressions  of interest from banks to become SRF counterparties.  Several have started the process, and we expect  the first group of banks will be able to participate in the SRF early next year.   I encourage banks interested in learning  more about the SRF to reach out to the New York Fed. 14\n\nThe  FIMA Repo Facility is available to help address global dollar funding pressures  that can emerge.  Disruptions in global  funding markets have the potential to negatively impact financial conditions  faced by U.S. households and businesses, in particular during significant  stress events in broader financial markets.   The FIMA Repo Facility provides foreign official accounts a source of  temporary liquidity against their holdings of Treasury securities at the New  York Fed to address these pressures.  Foreign  account holders have responded positively to the establishment of the facility,  as it provides an alternative to outright sales and complements the existing  U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines by extending access to dollar funding to a  broader range of foreign official institutions.\n\nImportantly,  in the FOMC’s ample reserves framework, the role of the ON RRP facility and the  new repo facilities are not symmetric.  These  new repo facilities, while offered daily, are not expected to be used  regularly.  The FOMC is committed to  maintaining an ample supply of reserves to ensure that administered rates—the  IORB and ON RRP rates—exercise control over the federal funds rate.  So, whereas the ON RRP facility could see  persistent usage in some environments, these new repo facilities are only  intended to act as occasional backstops.\n\nLooking Ahead, Working To Ensure Implementation Framework Remains Flexible And Adaptable…\n\nI’ve  talked today about how the Federal Reserve’s ample reserves framework has  ensured effective policy implementation recently by adapting to evolving money  market conditions, and about some of the new tools added to the framework.  However, market structure continuously evolves,  which in turn can have important implications for the framework.  Recognizing that, I would like to share a few  thoughts on two important changes on the horizon.\n\nThe first is work to improve the resilience of the U.S. Treasury  market.  In light of the disruptions in March 2020, and also shorter-lived disruptions on other occasions, market participants, academics, and the official sector have been analyzing underlying vulnerabilities in the Treasury market.   While the new standing repo facilities are designed to support effective  policy implementation, I expect they will also contribute to smooth functioning  of the Treasury market by ensuring temporary liquidity is available against  Treasury securities.  More broadly, the  Inter-Agency Working Group for Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), of which  the New York Fed and the Federal Reserve Board are members, has identified several  key areas for further study to improve Treasury market resilience. 15 Some  of this work could result in important changes to market structure that are  relevant for the FOMC’s implementation framework.  For example, on the Open Market Trading Desk  at the New York Fed (the Desk), we have been attentive to developments around expanded  central clearing.  These could ultimately  merit a study of the costs and benefits of central clearing for some of the  Desk’s open market operations to ensure their ongoing effectiveness. 16\n\nLooking  further ahead, a second area that could have material implications for policy  implementation is technological innovation in payments and money.  Around the world, financial market participants  and the public are seeking faster and cheaper payment settlement.  This desire is resulting in the development  of new, private-sector means of transfer, such as stablecoins, and the study of  public-sector solutions, like central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and faster  payments. 17 The Federal Reserve itself is undertaking an initiative  called FedNow that will enable banks to provide safe and efficient instant  payment services.  And, the Federal  Reserve Board will soon be publishing a paper to engage the public on policy  issues associated with a U.S. CBDC.  On  the Desk, we are focused on the broad implications of financial innovation for  monetary policy implementation.  While  it’s not yet clear how the money and payment ecosystem will evolve in the future,  it seems apparent that there will be important implications for markets and  policy implementation.  But I want to  return to the theme I started with:  the implementation  framework is flexible, and it will be adapted as needed to implement monetary  policy efficiently and effectively.\n\nTransitioning Away  From LIBOR, Only 79 Days Left\n\nAs  I wrap up my remarks, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention a fast-approaching,  critical milestone in the transition away from LIBOR.  After a yearslong effort to reduce the  financial stability risk posed by the use of this flawed reference rate, this  year will effectively mark LIBOR’s end. While  U.S. dollar LIBOR will continue for a little while in order to support the transition  of legacy contracts, supervisory guidance has been clear that banks should stop  entering into new U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts no later than the end of  this year. 18 , 19\n\nThe  New York Fed plays an important role in supporting a smooth transition away  from LIBOR.  Jointly with the Federal  Reserve Board, we convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC),  and we produce the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).  We also operate in financial markets, and need  to transition ourselves.  To prepare for  the end-of-year deadline, we reviewed our contracts with our trading  counterparties and are amending these contracts to replace existing U.S. dollar  LIBOR references with ones linked to SOFR.   These documents should be fully executed by the end of October.\n\nWhile  there has been significant progress in the overall transition to date, there is  still more work that must be done.  Not  only is it imperative that firms around the world act without delay, it’s  equally important that they are prudent in their choice of alternative reference  rates.  The official sector has  repeatedly emphasized the importance of using alternatives that can be reasonably  expected to remain robust and resilient.\n\nThe  ARRC selected SOFR as its preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR for  institutions of all sizes because it is based on a market that is vast and  liquid, with nearly $1 trillion of daily transactions by a diverse set of  borrowers and lenders underlying the rate.   SOFR isn’t the only alternative available, but it certainly is the most  robust, most liquid option.  If market  participants opt to use rates other than SOFR, they should make sure they fully  understand how those rates are constructed and any fragilities associated with  them. 20\n\nThank  you for your attention, and I would like to again thank the Money Marketeers  for the opportunity to speak with you today.  I look forward to the discussion with Dov.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nThank  you for the invitation to speak at this SIFMA event. 1 It is a pleasure to be  back with you to discuss financial markets and monetary policy implementation. When I last spoke with this group in July of last year,  I shared my views on the marked deterioration in conditions in the U.S.  Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets at the onset of  the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Federal Reserve's asset purchases undertaken to  support market functioning.\n\nAsset purchases are ongoing and continue to help foster smooth  market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, supporting the flow  of credit to households and businesses. This expansion in the Federal Reserve's  assets also has the effect of increasing Federal Reserve  liabilities—particularly reserve balances—which can have important implications  for money markets. Today, I would like to discuss the recent  rapid expansion in reserves, and its influence  on money market conditions. I plan to share some perspective on how, in this  environment, the Federal Reserve's tools will help maintain the federal funds  rate well within the target range and support effective policy implementation.\n\nBefore  I continue, let me note that the views I express today are my own, and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nReserves Rise to Historically  High Levels\n\nI'd  like to start with some context on the historic nature of the changes in the  Federal Reserve's balance sheet over the past year. Since the beginning of March  2020, the Federal Reserve's assets have grown from $4.2 trillion to $7.7  trillion, as shown in Figure 1 , representing the largest increase over a  similar timeframe in the Federal Reserve's history. This expansion reflects the  FOMC's swift and decisive actions to address deteriorating conditions in  financial markets and the severe economic downturn associated with the  pandemic. As part of those measures, increases in holdings of U.S. Treasury  securities, shown in dark blue, and agency MBS, shown in red, have supported  smooth market functioning and helped to foster accommodative financial  conditions.\n\nAn  increase in Federal Reserve assets is naturally accompanied by an increase in liabilities.  As Figure 2 shows, the expansion in assets over the past year was primarily supported  by increases in two types of liabilities: bank reserves, shown in red, and the  Treasury General Account (TGA), shown in light blue.\n\nThe  TGA is the U.S. Treasury's cash account with the Federal Reserve, and the U.S.  government uses this account to make and receive payments. As the pandemic  unfolded in 2020, the Treasury built up precautionary balances in this account to  prepare for outflows associated with fiscal spending to address the economic  downturn. This increase in the TGA limited growth in reserves that would have  otherwise resulted from the Federal Reserve's balance sheet expansion. However,  more recently, the Treasury began drawing down these precautionary balances and  the TGA declined by over $600 billion in the first quarter. This reduction in  the TGA, combined with ongoing asset purchases, has lifted reserves at an  extraordinary pace in recent months; aggregate reserves reached an all-time high  of $3.9 trillion on April 7, an increase of about $800 billion since the  beginning of the year.\n\nAs of December, reserves held by domestic banks as a share of their total assets were at the highest level that we have observed, as shown by the dark blue line in Figure 3 , and reserves have risen since then. As aggregate reserves grow, banks may perceive increasing costs associated with higher reserve balances and the resulting growth in their balance sheets.  If so, individual banks may take actions to limit or manage these impacts, such as reducing wholesale funding, discouraging deposit inflows, or purchasing securities to reduce reserve holdings. 2\n\nTo date, reserve increases among domestic banks have been broadly distributed across firms of all sizes, as shown on the right-hand side of Figure 4 . Some banks—global systemically important banks (GSIBs) and other large domestic banks, in particular—appear to be reducing reliance on certain types of wholesale funding and purchasing high quality securities to manage their balance sheets. However, much of the recent growth in reserves has been driven by deposit inflows that may be more challenging to moderate.\n\nAlthough  individual banks can take steps to limit growth in their own reserve balances,  reserves in aggregate cannot fall unless they are absorbed by other Federal  Reserve liabilities or Federal Reserve assets decline. The actions banks take  to limit or manage reserve balances instead put downward pressure on money  market rates relative to the interest paid on excess reserves (IOER) until the  banking system is content to hold the aggregate supply of reserves.\n\nOvernight Rates Have Fallen,  but to Different Degrees\n\nEven  as reserves have risen to historic levels, the effective federal funds rate  (EFFR) has remained relatively stable at around seven basis points, three basis  points below IOER, as shown by the dark blue line in Figure 5 . At the same time, overnight secured rates have fallen and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), shown in red, has declined to around one basis point.\n\nWhat might account for this growing  difference between unsecured and secured rates?\n\nThe resilience to date in overnight unsecured borrowing rates reflects, in part, foreign banking organizations' (FBOs) robust borrowing at rates relatively close to IOER. As shown in Figure 6 , FBOs account for almost all activity that makes up the Overnight Bank Funding Rate (OBFR)—a broad measure of wholesale overnight unsecured rates—and their volumes have increased considerably in recent months. Alongside this growth in wholesale liabilities, FBO reserve balances have grown by roughly 45 percent since the beginning of the year, as shown in Figure 7 . Our understanding is that these FBOs value their relationships with wholesale lenders and may face lower balance sheet costs than many domestic banks, and therefore have not demanded a wider spread below IOER to take on this funding.\n\nIn  contrast, reductions in U.S. Treasury bill supply and robust growth among  secured money market investors has resulted in more pronounced downward  pressure in overnight secured rates. In the year to date, the publicly  available supply of Treasury bills has declined by around $300 billion. Meanwhile,  as shown in Figure 8 , government money market fund (MMF) assets under  management (AUM), which are markedly higher since the pandemic began, have grown  significantly since the start of the year. Investors view government MMFs as  safe and highly liquid investments, and they become increasingly attractive as  banks lower deposit rates or limit deposit growth. 3\n\nHistorically,  when significant differences emerge between secured and unsecured rates, we  have seen investors—most notably prime MMFs—reallocate between these markets, moderating  the rate spread. 4 However, prime MMFs have become much less prominent in recent years, as shown  in Figure 9 . It may be that, with investors somewhat more cautious after the  stresses in money markets last spring, the yield earned on unsecured  investments does not currently offer a sufficient premium to attract new  investments into prime MMFs or for prime fund managers to take on additional  liquidity risk with existing AUM. 5 These factors may also be contributing  to a slightly wider spread than we have observed in recent years.\n\nWhere  might rates go from here?\n\nUltimately, the evolution of overnight rates will depend on the adjustment to higher reserve levels, and the supply and demand for overnight investments. As aggregate reserves continue to grow, banks may take additional actions to manage growth in their individual reserve balances. 6 In previous periods of elevated reserves, FBOs absorbed a significant share of reserves through wholesale borrowing and, as I noted, recently we have seen growth in FBO balances. However, it remains to be seen if some FBOs will be comfortable taking additional reserve balances, and if so, whether it will require a wider spread below IOER for them to do so.\n\nIn an environment where banks are seeking to moderate growth in reserve balances, MMFs are also likely to see ongoing inflows, increasing the demand for short-term investments. To the extent that these inflows continue to go to government MMFs, secured rates may experience more downward pressure. The supply of government investments, including Treasury bills, will be an important factor influencing money market rates.\n\nAs  rates adjust to rising reserves and changes in the supply and demand for overnight  investments, we will be monitoring markets closely. We are confident that the  Federal Reserve has the tools to maintain control over the federal funds rate  and support effective policy implementation, a discussion I will turn to now.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Tools  Support Rate Control, with the ON RRP Facility Becoming More Central in the Framework\n\nIn January 2019, the FOMC communicated its intention to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates. 7, 8 The payment of IOER  sets a benchmark against which banks evaluate their lending and borrowing  opportunities. In addition, the Federal Reserve offers a fixed-rate investment  to a broad base of money market investors, known as the overnight reverse repo  (ON RRP) facility, which establishes a floor for overnight rates below IOER. The  availability of this facility as an investment option improves money market lenders'  bargaining power in private markets. When investors use the facility, the  reverse repo transactions and corresponding reduction in reserves broadens the  liability base that supports asset purchases and alleviates the pressures on  bank balance sheets that lower money market rates.\n\nIn  an abundant reserves environment when overnight rates trade sufficiently below  IOER, the ON RRP facility becomes a more central part of the implementation  framework. Since its introduction, the ON RRP facility has been effective at providing  a floor for the federal funds rate and limiting downward pressure on other overnight  rates, as shown in Figure 10 . 9 Meanwhile, concerns about possible  repercussions of the ON RRP facility that were discussed when it was  established—such as the potential for investments to shift towards the facility  in times of stress or for it to reshape the financial industry in unanticipated  ways—have not materialized in the intervening years, even through various  periods of market stress. 10, 11 Overall, the ON RRP  facility has proven to be a highly effective tool for monetary policy  implementation.\n\nThe availability of the  ON RRP facility may be particularly important in the U.S.  context. This is because the U.S. banking system is smaller relative to the overall  size of the economy than in other advanced economies, as shown in Figure 11 ,  and because non-bank entities represent a relatively larger proportion of the  U.S. financial system. As a result, a given amount of asset purchases relative  to gross domestic product may have a more significant impact on the U.S.  banking system than it would on the banking systems in other countries. The ON  RRP facility can continue to provide a floor on rates and broaden the set of  holders of Federal Reserve liabilities beyond reserves held by banks.\n\nUltimately,  it is the price adjustments in money markets that will determine the mix of  liabilities between reserves and the ON RRP facility. 12 These price adjustments could  also affect the mix of other Federal Reserve liabilities, although likely to a  lesser degree. The Federal Reserve offers accounts and investments to certain  official institutions and financial market utilities (FMUs). As money market  rates decline, these entities may also increase their balances. As shown in Figure 12 , some of these other liabilities have grown notably over the past year. For example, although still lower than in earlier years, Foreign Official and International Monetary Authority (FIMA) accounts have recently increased their reverse repo pool investments and unremunerated balances with the New York Fed, shown in dark blue and red, respectively. 13 Other deposits with Reserve Banks,  which primarily comprise accounts for Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs)  and FMUs designated systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight  Council, have also increased materially.\n\nAn Update of ON  RRP Terms Ensures it Supports Effective  Policy Implementation\n\nAs a measure  of prudent planning, the Open Market Trading Desk (\"Desk\") recently conducted a  review of key design features of the ON RRP facility to ensure that the  facility's terms continue to support effective policy implementation. We found  that the existing ON RRP facility counterparty types—MMFs, GSEs and banks, as  well as primary dealers—continue to cover the major investors in the tri-party  repo market in which the Desk operates the ON RRP. However, the MMF industry  has grown in size and has become more concentrated at the largest funds since  the facility's $30 billion per-counterparty limit was set in 2014. In light of this  evolution, the FOMC decided to increase the ON RRP facility per-counterparty  limit to $80 billion in order to restore the capacity of the facility relative  to the aggregate size of money fund counterparties to roughly the level that  prevailed when the $30 billion limit was established. This should help ensure  that the ON RRP facility maintains a floor for the federal funds rate and  supports effective policy implementation. Related to this review, the Desk is  planning in coming months to relax certain eligibility criteria that MMFs and  GSEs, in particular, must meet in order to be eligible as ON RRP facility counterparties. 14 These changes could reduce  barriers to entry in the industry for smaller MMFs and promote a more fair and  inclusive marketplace.\n\nSince the most recent FOMC meeting, the facility has continued to serve as an effective floor even as greater downward pressure on overnight secured rates has emerged. There has been relatively modest take-up on most days as the ON RRP facility has bolstered money market lenders' bargaining power. Take-up at March quarter-end rose to $134 billion, and the ON RRP facility provided an outlet for investors on this date when financial firms managed their balance sheets more tightly.\n\nSince the facility's inception, we have periodically observed some repo trading at rates below the ON RRP offering rate, as shown in Figure 13 by the first percentiles of the Tri-party General Collateral Rate (TGCR) and SOFR. Recently some activity has occurred at rates below zero in interdealer markets, as captured in the SOFR first percentile. This appears to be technical in nature, driven in part by the value that dealers place on the ability to centrally clear these transactions and net their balance sheet exposures. Given these benefits, we understand that dealers who have access to the ON RRP facility are lending at modestly negative rates. Even as modest volumes occur at rates below the ON RRP rate, the facility continues provide an effective floor. However, we will continue to monitor money markets closely and make adjustments to ON RRP operations as needed.\n\nAdministered Rates Support  Effective Policy Implementation\n\nIn addition to ensuring that the ON RRP’s facility's terms continue to support effective policy implementation, it might be appropriate to implement adjustments to administered rates should undue downward pressure on overnight rates emerge, as noted in the minutes of the March FOMC meeting released last week. The Federal Reserve has adjusted administered rates relative to the target range on numerous occasions in recent years as conditions in overnight markets have evolved, as shown in Figure 14 . Such adjustments are purely technical steps to support effective policy implementation and to maintain the federal funds rate well within the target range.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn  conclusion, the adjustment to higher reserve levels has important implications  for money markets. I have been pleased that the FOMC's implementation framework  continues to accommodate the adjustment to higher reserve levels resulting from  the FOMC's actions to foster smooth market functioning and accommodative  financial conditions.\n\nGiven  the significant increase in reserves and reduction in Treasury bill supply  since the start of the year, overnight money market rates have softened. With  reserves expected to grow further, we will be monitoring money markets closely  and will continue to make adjustments as needed.\n\nIn  this environment, I am confident that the Federal Reserve's tools will continue  to support effective policy implementation. IOER sets a benchmark for bank  lending and borrowing activity, and the ON RRP facility establishes a floor for  overnight rates. Ultimately, it is these administered rates and the spread  between them that will control overnight money market rates in the FOMC's ample  reserves regime and will influence the mix of Federal Reserve liabilities.\n\nI  would like to thank SIFMA and the organizers of this event for the opportunity  to speak here today. I look forward to the Q&A session, as well as the  roundtable on Treasury market structure that follows.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to speak with you today at the New York Fed and Columbia SIPA workshop on monetary policy implementation. Many of you have attended these workshops in the past, and it is great to be together again to talk about issues of essential importance to policy implementation. It is also nice to see so many new participants, reflecting the broad interest and engagement in the topic of digital innovation.\n\nOver the past two days, we heard about faster forms of payments and new, digital forms of money—both private and public—and the effects they might have on money markets, policy implementation frameworks, and the international landscape.\n\nDigital innovation in money and payments is occurring for a reason—consumers, businesses, and financial market participants can benefit from around-the-clock, faster, and possibly programmable payments, both to reduce risk and to simplify financial transactions. Increased competition that results from new forms of money and payments could lower costs, increase service availability, and stimulate further innovation.\n\nHarnessing the benefits of innovation to consumers and businesses, while maintaining a safe and effective monetary system, may require new legislation, changes to regulations and to supervisory approaches, and modernization of traditional payment systems. The specifics of the appropriate initiatives will vary by country. These developments could have significant implications, including for financial stability, national security interests, and international cooperation.\n\nIn my role as manager of the Federal Reserve’s System Open Market Account, I am looking at these issues from the vantage point of monetary policy implementation. And in my remarks today, I will discuss some key issues that digital innovation in money and payments raises for policy implementation. In particular, I will examine how digital currencies might impact interest rate control and central bank balance sheets. In the spirit of this workshop, I won’t speak to the U.S. context specifically, but rather intend to discuss conceptual issues for policy implementation across jurisdictions. And, I won’t take a position on regulation, design choices, or a preference for a private or public solution.\n\nAs always, the views I express today are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nPrivate and Public Innovation\n\nI would like to start by describing two types of monetary instruments that could, in the future, be significant for policy implementation. In the private sector, a broad range of digital assets are emerging. A subset of those digital assets, known as stablecoins, could over time be used by consumers and businesses as money, if they serve as a safe means of payment, a store of value, and a unit of account. 2 Some jurisdictions are considering bringing these kinds of instruments into the regulatory framework by requiring their issuers to become banks or other licensed entities. 3 This could enhance the ability to safely integrate them into the payments system. It could also expand access to central bank accounts and services to new entrants, allowing the stablecoins to be backed by the most liquid and stable of assets: central bank reserves.\n\nTraditional commercial banks are also forming consortiums and partnering with digital innovation firms to increase their offerings of liabilities associated with digital activities, which might entail offering deposits to stablecoin issuers or even direct issuance of stablecoins.\n\nMany are also investing in distributed ledger activities that could transform their businesses. Preliminary analysis of the May 2022 Senior Financial Officer Survey suggests that most U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs) expect growth and development in these areas to be a medium or high priority over the next couple of years, and banks continue to explore these areas to see how they fit into their business strategies. 4\n\nCentral banks are also innovating. Many are implementing new forms of payments or experimenting with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to prepare for the future. Currently, over 60 jurisdictions have launched faster payment services. 5 In addition, central banks are building expertise and investing in technology to examine the potential applicability of CBDCs. 6\n\nMonetary Policy Implementation in An Evolving Monetary System\n\nAs we consider the potential impact of this array of innovations, it is useful to start with a view into the current monetary system.\n\nFor decades, central bank reserve balances have been the safest and most liquid asset, at the core of a smoothly operating financial system. Most economies operate with two-tier monetary systems, in which households and businesses hold and make payments with cash and private money such as bank deposits, while only banks can hold and make payments with central bank reserves. Regulation, supervision, and deposit insurance help keep commercial bank money safe. In turn, deposits fund growth in the economy through loans to households and businesses. And central banks provide liquidity backstops to ensure that the banking system can meet its liquidity obligations to the public.\n\nMost policy implementation frameworks around the world are designed based on this two-tiered system. In these frameworks, central banks control the aggregate supply of their liabilities and the rates at which these liabilities are remunerated, which in turn influences the market interest rates that are transmitted to the economy. 7\n\nIn considering the impact on implementation frameworks of an environment including private and public digital currencies, I would like to raise two key questions that central banks might consider. First, what are the implications for the tools of interest rate control? And second, how might the central bank balance sheet adapt?\n\nWhat are the implications for the central bank’s tools of interest rate control? Most central banks adjust and communicate their monetary policy stance through an interest rate target, and successful implementation entails supplying central bank liabilities in a manner that promotes conditions in money markets consistent with this stance. Central banks often rely on three pillars to control interest rates: the rates of remuneration on liabilities; the amount of liquidity supplied; and the provision of liquidity backstops.\n\nCertain design choices for the adoption and integration of digital currencies could alter how central banks use these pillars to control short-term interest rates.\n\nPillar 1: Rates of remuneration Many advanced economy central banks currently operate in some type of a floor system, in which the administered rate or rates paid on certain central bank liabilities are a core component of interest rate control. 8 The development of new digital forms of currency raises questions about how to fit new liabilities into these remuneration frameworks.\n\nIn the case of a CBDC, a central bank can directly determine the instrument’s design and the return that its holder receives. If a CBDC is designed as a substitute for cash, for example, with relatively low maximum holding limits and zero interest, it may have a relatively limited impact on monetary policy implementation.\n\nOn the other hand, a zero-interest CBDC that could be easily employed for large-scale payments may have greater impact. For example, in higher-interest-rate environments, the opportunity cost of holding a CBDC with these design features could be high, resulting in it being used only for modest transactional purposes. Conversely, in lower-interest-rate environments, a zero-interest CBDC without holding limits could compete more strongly with existing money market instruments, and demand for a zero-interest CBDC in lower-interest-rate environments could be hard to predict.\n\nA zero-interest CBDC could also interact with policy rate setting. For central banks that seek to maintain a zero lower bound on interest rates, a zero-interest CBDC could benefit monetary policy implementation, as a widely available zero-interest instrument could help reinforce the lower bound. For other central banks, a zero-interest CBDC could constrain their ability to achieve negative rates.\n\nThe alternative that central banks might consider is an interest-bearing CBDC, for which the natural question is: what rate of interest should be paid? If a central bank decided to remunerate a CBDC, the incentives created within the monetary policy implementation framework would need to be considered. As a broad principle, research suggests that a CBDC should be structured with rates of remuneration at or below rates on central bank reserve balances, as a higher rate could create direct competition for deposits, risking disintermediation of the banking system. 9 How much lower would need to be considered in the context of a specific central bank’s policy implementation framework, its policy rate target, and the incentives that an interest-bearing CBDC could create in money markets. Some have suggested tiered remuneration for different holding amounts in order to influence incentives and ensure appropriate integration into the monetary system. 10\n\nIn the case of stablecoins, central banks don’t directly control interest that might be paid on these instruments. However, incentives created by remuneration policies could have important influences on the structure and relative demand for private and public digital currencies. Depending on how the regulatory and policy environment for financial innovation evolves, stablecoins could be issued by banks or other regulated entities that could have access to interest-bearing accounts at central banks. In this case, the rate of remuneration stablecoin issuers earn on their accounts might influence the rate paid to stablecoin holders, and the role of the instruments in the broader monetary ecosystem. 11\n\nOf course, implementation issues are not the only important consideration for remuneration of digital currencies, but it should be one consideration. Choices about the remuneration of new central bank liabilities, like CBDC, and of the accounts of private stablecoin issuers, could have an important influence on the incentives created by monetary policy implementation frameworks. Given this, central banks should take a holistic approach to considering the impact of their remuneration policies on the ecosystem of both private and public currencies.\n\nPillar 2: Liquidity supply This brings me to the second pillar of interest rate control: liquidity supply. In order for central banks’ remuneration rates to effectively achieve interest rate control, central banks supply reserves in appropriate quantities to achieve the interest rate target. In some environments, this requires central banks to forecast demand for liabilities and execute open market operations to supply needed reserves.\n\nIn recent years, the demand for many central bank liabilities has become higher and less predictable. However, most central banks have been operating with abundant liquidity surpluses, which has limited the impact of this reduced predictability on implementation. 12 As central banks embark on balance sheet reduction, however, understanding demand for liabilities may become more important.\n\nThe demand for digital currencies is not well understood, as these are instruments for which there is no precedent or experience. For a CBDC, central banks would have to understand the behavior of the demand for this new liability. If stablecoins were to be issued by commercial banks, it would also be important to understand drivers of growth in these coins and how that growth might affect banks’ demand for reserves. Trend growth in these central bank liabilities could be quite different than it is for other liabilities, such as cash or reserve holdings of traditional banks. And, the variability in demand could potentially be high, driven by shifts in the market environment or in response to geopolitical developments or other exogenous events. This variability could be amplified if digital currencies were available internationally, potentially leading to larger flows. The variability could create new challenges for supplying the appropriate amount of reserves to the banking system to ensure that administered rates continue to control rates, and could lead to a need for larger liquidity surpluses to ensure interest rate control.\n\nOne way to manage growth or variability in demand, and the associated impact on demand for reserves in the banking system, could be to impose limits on how much of a CBDC individuals or institutions could hold. Some central banks are actively considering such limits. 13 However, these could also diminish the use cases for CBDC and reduce the potential for consumers and businesses to take advantage of the payment benefits.\n\nStablecoins may not have the same types of holding limitations, which could lead to faster growth or more variability in demand. At least one jurisdiction is considering the potential use of holding limits or transaction limits on stablecoins on a temporary basis, to manage the possible shift from commercial bank deposits during a transition to new forms of digital money. 14 Central banks could also contemplate putting some limits on balances at the central bank associated with stablecoin issuance to manage the unpredictability associated with these flows.\n\nI have spent some time discussing the potential need for greater supply of liquidity; however, the direction is not all one-way. As payments become faster, the demand for some central bank liabilities may decline. For example, in some jurisdictions, payment innovations have led to a substantial decline in the amount of currency in circulation. 15 Banks may also find that more efficient payment systems bring about liquidity efficiencies, and could reduce their own demand for reserves in response.\n\nFrom my vantage point, the key takeaway for liquidity provision is to consider how, in the context of the remuneration paid on these instruments and other features, demand for central bank liabilities might evolve and how it could shift in different environments. Again, this requires holistic thinking about the ecosystem in which both private and public digital currencies operate.\n\nPillar 3: Liquidity facilities and backstops The third pillar of interest rate control is liquidity backstops. In most frameworks the supply of central bank liabilities and their rates of remuneration are the primary means of interest rate control. However, occasional shocks occur in money markets, and central banks provide liquidity backstops that promote interest rate control and smooth market functioning.\n\nIn an environment with new public and private digital currencies, liquidity backstops for traditional banks may become even more important. As I noted, digital currencies could create competition for commercial bank deposits. This could enhance market efficiency and improve transmission of monetary policy, but it may also lead to swings in deposit flows that could unexpectedly shift a commercial bank’s liquidity position. This could in turn increase the potential for occasional variability in overnight rates and the need for central bank liquidity facilities.\n\nHowever, liquidity risk will also be an important consideration for new entrants, such as stablecoin issuers. Stablecoins backed entirely by central bank reserves would be less susceptible to liquidity risk than those backed with other assets. But this design may not ultimately be the most efficient use of central bank liabilities for the financial system, because an important role for commercial banks in the two-tier monetary system is their ability to support the provision of credit in the economy. 16\n\nStablecoins backed by other instruments, such as high-quality liquid assets, could moderate growth in the central bank’s balance sheet relative to a stablecoin backed entirely by central bank reserves. However, this structure would also give rise to liquidity risk for stablecoin issuers, which might in turn give rise to a need for a backstop source of funding.\n\nThese considerations raise important questions for how best to integrate digital currencies and ensure smooth market functioning and interest rate control in times of stress.\n\nHow might the central bank’s balance sheet adapt? Possibly the biggest question over time for monetary policy implementation is how much of the central bank balance sheet should be used to support innovation in currencies.\n\nThe current two-tier system of money and payments has central bank balances at its center, but also features an expansive set of private money offered through bank deposit balances. Innovation in payment systems may have clear benefits for consumers and businesses, and private currencies backed by safe central bank balances or other highly liquid safe assets are certainly better than alternatives created by less regulated firms and backed by lower quality or illiquid assets. However, to the extent that stablecoins or CBDCs supplant private bank money or expand overall demand for central bank liabilities, they could also increase the size and potentially change the nature of central bank assets.\n\nA larger balance sheet could cause some central banks to adapt approaches to asset composition to manage the influence of a larger balance sheet on the policy stance. For example, a central bank could buy short-duration assets to support the new demand for central bank liabilities and differentiate these asset purchases from those intended to foster accommodative financial conditions.\n\nThese issues may also require new operational approaches for central banks. In some circumstances, the balance sheet could need to adjust rapidly because of unexpected large shifts in liability demand. This could require new thinking by central banks on the appropriate approaches to implementation with potentially a different mix of assets or tools to add liquidity to the system. Short-duration assets or temporary liquidity providing operations would also allow flexibility if an increase in liability demand is expected to be short term.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe innovation occurring in money and payments has the potential to alter the existing two-tier monetary system upon which current monetary policy implementation frameworks are designed. How things evolve from here is uncertain, and the impact of these innovations could be revolutionary, or more evolutionary. But imagining an environment in which new forms of private and public money and payments could coexist is helpful in adapting implementation frameworks that will enable central banks to continue to achieve their desired policy stance in the future.\n\nExpanding central bank liabilities in an incremental way to support new forms of money could create a safer payment system—one that promotes innovation, mitigates potential risks, and ensures money continues to function well in an increasingly digital economy. Adapting the implementation framework to incorporate new private forms of money and potentially central bank digital currencies is complex and will require substantial further study of key issues, some of which I have raised today.\n\nThis calls for an integrated approach, one that considers each instrument and its role in the monetary ecosystem. Central banks must draw on broad expertise within their institutions so that payments experts, monetary policy practitioners, financial stability and supervision colleagues explore and understand important intersections. We will also need to continue to engage a broad range of market participants, academics, and colleagues across the international central banking community as we adapt to be prepared for the road ahead. Workshops like this one help us learn from one another. Thank you all for your participation in such a rich and important set of discussions.",

    "text": "Thank you  for the kind introduction. While preparing these remarks, I learned that the  Money Marketeers organization was founded by Dr. Marcus Nadler, a gifted  educator who challenged market participants to deepen their understanding of  the forces that move markets, and that it was born out of a popular lecture  series he regularly held at NYU. This spirit of continual learning is a core  value at the Federal Reserve, and that has been particularly important in  recent years as the Fed has been operating in a new monetary policy  implementation regime. 1\n\nI last had  the pleasure of speaking about monetary policy implementation at this forum two  years ago. At that time, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had yet to  make a decision on what the long run operating regime would look like. Substantial  progress has been made since then. My intention tonight is to share some thoughts  on what the FOMC’s recent decisions could mean for the manner in which the New  York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) implements policy. In  particular, I would like to discuss the Federal Reserve’s ongoing process for  learning about the banking system’s demand for reserves and money market  dynamics more broadly. I will also outline how the Desk could supply reserves  through open market operations as the Federal Reserve transitions from implementing  policy in an ample-reserves regime driven by the asset side of the balance  sheet to one driven by demand for liabilities.\n\nI will  bring an operational perspective to these topics, given my position as head of the  Desk and Deputy Manager of the Federal Reserve System Open Market Account. I  should also say now that the views I express tonight are my own and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nAn Operational Framework for an Ample-Reserves  Regime\n\nLet me begin  by reviewing the FOMC’s recent decisions about the operating regime. In January,  the FOMC communicated its intention to continue implementing policy in a regime  in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the federal  funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the  Federal Reserve’s administered rates and in which the active management of the  supply of reserves is not required. 2 This type of regime is often  referred to as a “floor system” because the administered rates—including IOER (the  rate of interest paid on excess reserves) and the ON RRP rate (the offered rate  at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility)—place a floor under the  rates at which banks and other market participants will lend. 3 I’ve illustrated this  framework in the stylized graphs showing the relationship between the interest  rate and banks’ demand for reserves in Figure 1 . Before the crisis, the Desk operated  along the steep part of the demand curve to achieve its directive from the FOMC,  whereas in an ample-reserves regime, like the one we’ve used in recent years, we  operate along the flatter part of the curve. 4\n\nOver the past  decade, the Federal Reserve has learned a great deal about operating in the  current regime, and during recent deliberations about the long-run  implementation framework the FOMC highlighted several key benefits of the  current regime as supporting its decision. 5\n\nFirst, the  ample-reserves regime has been very effective at controlling short-term  interest rates because the Federal Reserve’s administered rates provide strong incentives  in money markets. As shown in Figure 2 , overnight interest rates moved in line  with changes in these administered rates, even as the FOMC lifted rates from  near zero in late 2015 to over 2 percent more recently. During this same period,  there were sweeping changes in banks’ liquidity management practices and in money  market fund regulation that transformed the structure of money markets, and the  floor system proved resilient to those changes. 6 Looking forward, this  regime should provide stable interest rate control if unexpected situations  arise in which large amounts of liquidity need to be added to relieve stress in  the financial system or large-scale asset purchases are needed to provide  macroeconomic stimulus because short-term rates are at their effective lower  bound. 7\n\nSecond, from  an operational perspective, an ample-reserves regime achieves this  effectiveness in a simple and efficient manner. For example, it reduces the  need for active management of reserve supply because shocks to the supply of or  demand for reserves can be absorbed without the need for sizable daily  interventions by the central bank. In the U.S., the ability to accommodate variability  in non-reserve liabilities is particularly important because those liabilities—such  as the Treasury General Account (TGA), Foreign Repo Pool, and balances held by  Designated Financial Market Utilities—provide benefits for the economy and the global  financial system. 8\n\nAlthough reserves  will continue to be ample going forward, the level will be significantly lower  than has prevailed in recent years. In March, the FOMC issued an updated  “Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans” in which it stated that the longer-run  level of reserves will be a level consistent with “efficient and effective”  implementation of monetary policy. 9 To support a smooth  transition to the longer-run level of reserves, the FOMC also stated that the  reduction in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings will slow this spring  and then stop in September. When balance sheet runoff stops in September, the FOMC  expects the level of reserves to be somewhat higher than necessary for  efficient and effective monetary policy implementation. If so, the total  balance sheet will be held constant for a time, and trend increases in non-reserve  liabilities, such as those shown in Figure 3 , will gradually reduce the average  level of reserves until it reaches a level consistent with efficient and  effective implementation of monetary policy.\n\nAs Chair  Powell noted in his January press conference, the level of reserves consistent  with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy will be  principally determined by financial institutions’ demand for reserves, and an  additional buffer so that interest rate control continues to be exercised  through administered rates. 10 The stylized framework I showed  earlier in Figure 1 illustrates that banks demand different levels of reserves depending  on the prevailing levels of interest rates. However, for purposes of the discussion  today, I will define the banking system’s demand for reserves as a level that  is just to the right of the steeper portion of the demand curve, representing  the lowest quantity of reserves that banks demand in aggregate at rates near  IOER. This corresponds to the minimum level of reserves needed to continue  operating in a floor system, and supplying reserves at or above this level  would be consistent with a floor system.\n\nIn  practice, assessing banks’ demand for reserves will be a continual process  because the factors determining that demand are complex and may change over  time. Federal Reserve staff survey banks, analyze vast amounts of data, and  gather intelligence across the market to better understand this demand. Slowing  the runoff in securities holdings this spring and stopping in September will reduce  the pace of reserve decline, allowing this detailed assessment to adapt  appropriately as reserves decline to levels that were last seen almost a decade  ago. The behavior of money markets with this lower—albeit still ample—level of  reserves will feed back into the Desk’s thinking about the design of operations.  And being operationally flexible will allow the Desk to adapt to changing economic  and market conditions, as well as to the FOMC’s assessment of the appropriate level  of reserves consistent with efficient and effective implementation.\n\nThe Banking System’s Demand for Reserves  in an Ample-Reserves Regime\n\nLet me  take a step back and provide some observations on the banking system’s demand  for reserves. Banks engage in a variety of activities that create uncertainty  about their liquidity positions. These uncertainties include a risk that depositors  will want their money back sooner than expected. To manage this liquidity risk,  banks need access to cash, which can  come from several sources, including reserves already held at the Federal  Reserve, money borrowed either in the private market or from the Federal  Reserve’s lending facilities, or proceeds from asset sales or maturities.\n\nReserves are  the most reliable and safest source of liquidity because they are immediately  available for payments and do not have a changing market value. Nevertheless,  before the crisis, banks typically tried to minimize reserve balances because reserves  earned zero interest, whereas other highly liquid assets, such as Treasury  bills, earned a sizable positive yield. Given this high opportunity cost,  demand for reserves was relatively close to reserve balance requirements prior  to the crisis. 11\n\nToday, reserves  are less expensive to hold than they were before the crisis because the Federal  Reserve now pays IOER, which is the principal tool used to control short-term  interest rates. 12 However, demand for reserves has also shifted in other important ways. In  particular, there are new factors driving reserve demand, and that demand is,  and will likely continue to be, much higher than it was before the crisis. To  start, the crisis appropriately changed attitudes toward risk and increased  focus on managing liquidity risk. The subsequent creation of a liquidity regulatory  framework for larger banks reinforced the benefits of holding unencumbered  liquid assets for both domestic and foreign banks. While these liquidity  regulations do not themselves impose any specific requirements to hold central  bank reserves, many banks now use internal models that also estimate the very  short-term liquidity they need to hold in order to be prepared for a stress  scenario. 13 These models make assumptions about a bank’s reduced access to funding and ability  to sell securities during earlier stages of a stressed period. The bank may  therefore decide to hold a portion of its liquidity buffer as reserves on an  ongoing basis as a precautionary measure. Through our outreach to banks, we  also hear that some are more reluctant to borrow from the Federal Reserve than  they were prior to the financial crisis. For some banks, this reluctance increases  the precautionary demand for reserves to meet large intraday payment  obligations and manage unexpected volatility in deposits.\n\nTo get a more  systematic reading of the factors driving reserve demand as well as the size of  this demand, the Federal Reserve conducted a Senior Financial Officer Survey (SFOS)  in September 2018 and again this February. 14 The respondents to the September  2018 survey held two thirds of all reserves and about 60 percent of assets in  the banking system, and they encompassed a diverse set of business models,  including foreign banks and domestic banks of different sizes.\n\nThe survey  results revealed that a number of important sources of reserve demand are  present. As shown in Figure 4 , which presents September 2018 survey responses, the  majority of both domestic and foreign banks cited internal liquidity stress tests and  meeting intraday payment flows as important or very important drivers of  reserve demand. In addition, meeting potential deposit outflows specifically was  important or very important for almost three quarters of domestic banks, compared  to around a third of foreign banks. 15 In addition, it is worth  highlighting the considerable variation in survey responses, which reinforces my  earlier point that the pre-crisis framework in which all banks had similar  reserve management strategies no longer applies. The diversity of drivers also highlights  how demand for reserves could change if banks move from one strategy to another  or refine an existing one over time.\n\nThe survey  can also be used as an input for quantifying the banking system’s demand for  reserves. The surveys asked each bank to report the level of reserves it would  hold (at the prevailing constellation of rates) before taking active steps to  maintain or increase its reserve balances. 16 This lowest comfortable  level of reserves, or “LCLoR,” corresponds, conceptually, to the part of a  bank’s demand curve where the slope could start to steepen. In the September 2018  survey, total LCLoR of all the respondents was $617 billion, and extrapolating  the survey responses to the banking system as a whole resulted in estimates of U.S.  banking system demand for reserves ranging from $800 billion to $900 billion. 17 When we surveyed banks  again in February, those results yielded estimates in the same range. Figure 5 shows total LCLoRs for foreign respondents and domestic respondents, and the  extrapolated demand for the rest of the banking system. As you can see, each  group has considerable demand for reserves, although this demand is still well  below current reserve levels and far below the peak reserve levels reached in  2014.\n\nTo connect this back to the stylized  framework, in a world  with perfect information and no financial market frictions, an estimate of aggregate  reserve demand derived from summing and scaling the reported demand of  individual institutions might correspond to a level just to the right of the steeper portion of the  demand curve. However,  there are reasons why the amount of reserves a central bank needs to supply to  remain in a floor system could deviate from such an estimate. First, an  estimate of demand for reserves is simply an estimate; the true amount could be  higher or lower. Second, an individual bank’s demand curve could change over  time, both for reasons specific to the bank and because of changes in the  economic or market environment. Third, the banking system’s demand for reserves  could be higher than the sum of each bank’s individual demand if reserves are  not distributed efficiently. This scenario could occur if there are financial  market frictions to redistributing reserves that result in some banks  persistently holding a surplus of reserves above their LCLoR. For example, banks  now suggest that they face higher balance sheet costs to lend in federal funds,  making it possible that this market would not be as efficient at redistributing  reserves late in the day as it was prior to the crisis. 18\n\nIn  practice, assessing the lowest level of reserves necessary to remain on the  flat, or flatter, part of the demand curve will entail not only periodically  conducting the SFOS in collaboration with the Board of Governors, but also broader  monitoring and analytical efforts in order to continuously inform our assessment  of the demand for reserves and reserve conditions. The Desk’s current  assessment is that reserves remain ample overall. Transacted rates in the  federal funds market are relatively stable, and the vast majority of trades are  within the target range. Additional monitoring of bank microdata also suggests  that reserves are well supplied. 19\n\nLet me walk  through some observations based on the Desk’s ongoing monitoring and analysis. Though  rates transacted in the federal funds market are relatively stable, the EFFR has  risen one basis point relative to IOER in recent weeks and is now above IOER.  Since mid-March, overnight repo rates have generally traded above federal funds  rates, providing an attractive investment opportunity for the Federal Home Loan  Banks (FHLBs) that invest a portion of their liquidity portfolios in both  markets. As the dominant lenders in the federal funds market, FHLBs may have  been able to negotiate higher overnight lending rates with banks that regularly  use federal funds to fund non-reserve assets or meet payments, and on occasion with banks  that borrow to improve their Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR) by borrowing from  government sponsored enterprises. 20\n\nIn line  with a slightly higher EFFR, the overall share of above-IOER borrowing in markets  underlying the overnight bank funding rate has been growing somewhat, as shown  in Figure 6 , although a large majority of activity is still transacted within a  couple of basis points of IOER. As long as these rates remain relatively stable  and at modest spreads above IOER, we don't see this as indicating that reserves  are not well supplied.\n\nIndeed, an  examination of daily reserve levels of individual banks shows that currently  most banks remain well above their reported LCLoRs, suggesting that reserves remain  ample. In fact, some banks with surplus reserves have been redistributing these  reserves by shifting the composition of their HQLA (high quality liquid assets)  by lending in repo markets when rates are attractive, suggesting secured  markets are providing a means to redistribute reserves.\n\nIf competition  for reserves were to increase, we might expect to see a more meaningful day-to-day  relationship between changes in the level of reserves and overnight rates. Figure 7 shows a scatterplot of daily changes in reserve balances against daily  changes in the spread between EFFR and the IOER rate. There continues to be no  discernable relationship.\n\nIn sum, a  wide range of information contributes to the Federal Reserve’s assessment of  reserve demand and reserve conditions.  The  Desk’s current view is that reserves remain ample and well above the level the  banking system demands at rates near IOER at this time. Our assessment of  reserve demand is likely to change over time as we continue learning, and could  move higher or lower based on new information from analysis of data, surveys, and  outreach.\n\nSupplying Reserves in  an Ample-Reserves Regime\n\nI will now  look ahead and turn to how the Desk could supply reserves through open market operations to maintain an ample-reserves  regime. After balance sheet runoff ends in September, the average level of reserves  will decline more slowly, although there will be some meaningful transitory  swings in reserve levels because of normal variability in the Federal Reserve’s  other liabilities. As the level of reserves declines, the Desk will monitor  medium-term forecasts of reserves and other indicators of reserve conditions. At  some point, the FOMC will decide that the system has reached a level of  reserves consistent with efficient and effective implementation.\n\nOnce this  determination has been made by the FOMC, the Desk will need to conduct outright  purchases of Treasury securities to supply reserves in order to offset the  general decline in reserves from trend growth in non-reserve liabilities and ensure  that reserves remain ample. 21 In this regard, these purchases  will have the same purpose as they did prior to the financial crisis—expanding  the size of the SOMA portfolio to accommodate growth in currency and other  liabilities. However, the size of these purchases will likely be larger in  nominal terms because the growth of non-reserve liabilities is larger. For  example, in 2018, currency increased by almost $100 billion, as shown back in Figure 3 , compared to average  increases of $40 billion a year in the early 2000s before the crisis.\n\nThese purchases  could also be structured in size and timing to supply a sufficient amount of  reserves so that normal variability in non-reserve liabilities would not  require predictable repo market operations to offset the corresponding reserve  level changes. 22 The size of this “buffer” of reserves would depend on the Desk’s forward-looking  assessment of the expected volatility in non-reserve liabilities. A buffer of  reserves executed through Treasury purchases would diminish the need for the  Desk to conduct frequent, sizable repo operations, which might be difficult to  implement given reduced elasticity of primary dealer balance sheets for tri-party  repo in the post-crisis era. 2 Nonetheless, even with  this type of approach to managing a buffer, there might be some occasions in  which unanticipated changes in reserve conditions would still require the Desk  to conduct repo operations to maintain reserve levels or keep the effective federal  funds rate in the target range consistent with the directive from the FOMC.\n\nLet me make  the discussion of the buffer more concrete by focusing on the TGA. The TGA is  an account the Federal Reserve provides to the U.S. Treasury which, similar to  a checking account, allows Treasury to deposit or withdraw cash every day. When  Treasury takes in cash (for example, tax receipts), money is withdrawn from a private  bank account that in turn comes out of that bank’s reserves holdings. So, when  the TGA increases—and assuming there are no other changes on the Federal  Reserve’s balance sheet—this corresponds to a decrease in the level of  reserves. Figure 8 shows a scatterplot of weekly changes in the TGA against  weekly changes in reserves over the past two years. There have been times when  the TGA has increased by around $100 billion over the course of a week and  there has been a similarly large decline in reserves. 24 Figure 9 shows the  distribution of weekly changes across all non-reserve liabilities. These  changes have grown since the crisis and last year were as large as $100 billion.  Managing a buffer of reserves above the banking system’s demand for reserves would  help absorb these fluctuations in non-reserve liabilities.\n\nAs the  level of reserves falls, the Federal Reserve will continue to learn and enhance its thinking about an  efficient approach to open market operations that could incorporate both the  trend growth and transitory volatility in non-reserve liabilities to maintain  the excellent interest rate control experienced with higher levels of reserves.\n\nWhile my discussion tonight  has focused on the structure of open market operations from the perspective of  supplying sufficient reserves in an ample-reserves regime, the FOMC also  announced in its March Principles and Plans that the Desk will be conducting  Treasury purchases in the secondary market to reinvest mortgage-backed  securities (MBS) principal payments starting in October (subject to a maximum  of $20 billion per month).  The size of  these purchases will vary over time based upon MBS prepayments.  Of course, these purchases will be altering  the composition but not the overall size of the System Open Market Account  portfolio and Federal Reserve balance sheet. At least initially, the FOMC will  direct the Desk to conduct these MBS reinvestment purchases across a range of Treasury  maturities to roughly match the maturity composition of securities  outstanding.  The Desk will provide more  details on these operations in May. 25\n\nClosing Thoughts on Continually Learning  and Remaining Flexible\n\nIn  conclusion, the FOMC made an important decision in January to continue to  implement policy in an ample-reserves regime. Whereas the size of the balance  sheet and the level of reserves have, for many years, been driven by Federal  Reserve asset policies, at some point they will be determined by the demand for  Federal Reserve liabilities, taking into account both the banking system’s  demand for reserves and volatility in non-reserve liabilities.\n\nThrough  outreach, surveys, and regular monitoring we have increased our understanding  of the banking system’s demand for reserves. This learning is ongoing, and we expect  the factors driving reserve demand to evolve over time. The Desk’s current  assessment is that reserves are ample, and we will continue to monitor  conditions closely to further enhance our understanding of reserve conditions  and reserve demand. 26\n\nLooking  ahead, after balance sheet runoff ends in September, average reserve levels  will likely continue to gradually decline. When the FOMC judges that reserves have  reached a level consistent with efficient and effective implementation, the Desk  will begin to execute gradual and mechanical purchases of Treasury securities  in order to ensure that reserves remain ample. The size of these purchases will  need to be larger than similar pre-crisis operations simply because trend  growth in non-reserve liabilities is larger in nominal terms, and because proceeds  from maturing MBS also will be reinvested.\n\nThese are unprecedented  times, so active learning and maintaining operational flexibility will continue  to be core principles that guide the implementation of monetary policy. The ample-reserves  operating framework I have described today has auxiliary mechanisms, such as an  ongoing process for assessing reserve demand, that allow for flexibility and  adaptation for continued successful control of interest rates going forward.\n\nThank you.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "It  is a pleasure to join you virtually today. I’m grateful to SIFMA for the kind  invitation to discuss the Federal Reserve’s ongoing asset purchases and to all  of you here today for your interest in the smooth functioning of financial  markets. 1\n\nIn  response to the severe economic shock associated with the Covid-19 pandemic,  the Federal Reserve is committed to using all of its tools to achieve its goals  of maximum employment and price stability. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  has cut the target range for the federal funds rate close to zero. Additionally,  the Fed has taken a wide range of steps—many in coordination with the U.S. Treasury—to  support the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local  governments. These steps have targeted many different parts of the financial  system and economy. Liquidity tools are supporting funding markets. Credit  facilities are helping to ensure that small businesses, corporations, and state  and local governments have access to credit. And, regulations have been  temporarily adjusted to encourage bank lending. Another important measure, and the  focus of my talk today, is the asset purchases that we have conducted at an  unprecedented scale and speed to support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury  and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS)—both of which play crucial roles in  the American financial system and economy.\n\nIn  early to mid-March, amid extreme volatility across the financial system, the functioning  of Treasury and agency MBS markets became severely impaired. Given the  importance of these markets, continued dysfunction would have led to an even  deeper and broader seizing up of credit markets and ultimately worsened the  financial hardships that many Americans have been experiencing as a result of  the pandemic. 2 The FOMC responded quickly and decisively with substantial purchases of  Treasury securities and agency MBS, and then demonstrated an even more forceful  commitment to market functioning by directing the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) to make purchases “in the amounts needed to support the  smooth functioning of markets” for those securities. 3\n\nAsset  purchases are a standard tool of monetary policy implementation. Traditionally,  the Desk has used Treasury purchases to maintain the supply of reserves in  accordance with the FOMC’s policy implementation regime. Following the Global  Financial Crisis, the FOMC used asset purchases primarily to exert downward  pressure on longer-term interest rates, or in the case of MBS to ease mortgage rates,  when the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound. The purchases during  this most recent episode have been distinct in both their purpose, to address  disruptions in market functioning, and their scale and speed, which have been  unparalleled. As shown in Figure 1 , System  Open Market Account (SOMA) securities holdings grew at an extraordinary pace, with  purchases totaling more than $100 billion on some days. Cumulatively, the purchases since mid-March have totaled $1.7 trillion of Treasuries and more than $800 billion of agency MBS, 4 which represents the vast majority of the overall $2.6 trillion increase in the  Federal Reserve’s balance sheet since then, as shown in Figure 2 .\n\nTo  assess the pace of purchases needed to support market functioning, we used  extensive metrics along with our best judgment. The initial rapid pace of  purchases was motivated by a severe breakdown in the functioning of these  markets. As market functioning improved, we substantially slowed our pace of  purchases. Most recently, at its June meeting, the FOMC decided to increase  holdings of Treasuries and agency MBS “at least at the current pace to sustain  smooth market functioning.”\n\nToday,  I’d like to talk about the disruption we saw and the steps we took in response.  I will focus on three broad questions. First, what is smooth market functioning  and why does it matter? Second, how have our asset purchases supported smooth market  functioning? And third, how will we structure purchases to sustain market  functioning over coming months and remain vigilant against renewed  deterioration? Let me note that the views I express are my own and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the  Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat  Is Smooth Market Functioning, and Why Does it Matter?\n\nBefore  I describe our response to the recent crisis, I want to share how we think  about smooth functioning in Treasury and agency MBS markets, and why it is so  critical to the U.S. economy. I’ll focus on what we perceive as two important  characteristics of smoothly functioning markets: liquidity and efficient  pricing. 5\n\nLiquidity comes in many forms.  One form of liquidity is the availability of financing for existing or new  positions. I think of this as funding  liquidity . Another form of liquidity is the ease with which assets can be  bought and sold, often called market  liquidity . Although these concepts are distinct, they are related and  reinforcing. 6 When funding liquidity is abundant, market participants can finance the  transactions that produce market liquidity. My comments today focus on how we  have used asset purchases to support market liquidity, but I do want to note  that the steps the Federal Reserve took at the same time to support funding  markets almost certainly contributed to market liquidity. In fact, funding  markets are now functioning quite well. As a result, as you can see in Figure 3 , which is a close-up of my  previous chart, our repo book has rolled off over recent months and is now down  to zero, and usage of most other funding programs has also diminished.\n\nLiquid markets allow participants to transact quickly  and at low cost, so they can easily adjust their positions in response to their  own changing circumstances or broader economic developments. In normal conditions,  the markets for Treasury securities and MBS are highly liquid. Confidence in  the liquidity of Treasuries persuades investors to accept lower yields on these  securities, 7 and because Treasury interest rates are a benchmark for many other rates, these  lower yields ultimately reduce borrowing costs for families, businesses, and state  and local governments. Similarly, the liquidity of agency MBS helps investors  to transact quickly and efficiently in residential mortgage loans, which  results in lower mortgage interest rates for households. Supporting the  liquidity of these markets has been an important component of the Federal  Reserve’s actions to bolster the flow of credit and the effective transmission  of monetary policy during the pandemic.\n\nTurning  to efficient pricing, one can always  debate whether any given asset price is right. However, we generally expect  prices of instruments with identical or very similar cash flows to be closely  connected, so opportunities for arbitrage are limited, and relative value  spreads are small. In smoothly functioning markets, if prices of related  instruments diverge, arbitrageurs sell the securities with high prices and buy  those with low prices, profiting from the difference and pushing the prices back  together. When arbitrage breaks down, the resulting mispricings make financial  markets less useful for risk management and investment, which can ultimately  restrict the flow of capital in the economy.\n\nIn  practice, market liquidity is never perfect, and pricing discrepancies are  never entirely eliminated. Liquidity providers—who buy securities from clients  who wish to sell, and then look for other clients who wish to buy—are  compensated for this service in the form of bid-ask spreads or other transaction  costs. Likewise, investors do not exploit all arbitrage opportunities, because  arbitrage typically requires capital and funding and entails transaction costs,  as well as the risk of loss if the price difference widens rather than narrows.  As a result, prices of closely related securities can sometimes diverge. Still,  when the Treasury and agency MBS markets are functioning smoothly, transaction  costs and price divergences should typically be small.\n\nMarkets  are complex. No one indicator can show whether a given market is functioning  smoothly. On the Desk, we use a suite of complementary categories of indicators  to assess the functioning of Treasury and agency MBS markets. Without diving too  deeply into these indicators, I’ve summarized the categories in Figure 4 . The first category includes direct measures of liquidity , such as  bid-ask spreads, price impact coefficients and market depth. 8 The second category  includes direct measures of relative  value , such as the Treasury cash-futures basis, on-the-run spreads, spline  errors, and MBS-Treasury yield spreads . The  remaining categories contain indirect metrics. Instead of showing how well  markets are functioning, these metrics reveal forces that can lead to  breakdowns of liquidity and efficient pricing. In particular, we look at measures of trading pressure, which can  show whether there is an imbalance between the volume of sales and the volume  of purchases, and at the results of our  open market operations, which can provide signals about the intensity of  market participants’ desire to sell securities as well as other market  conditions.\n\nHow Have  the Federal Reserve’s Asset Purchases Supported Smooth Market Functioning?\n\nThe  extreme shock to the economy and financial markets as the pandemic spread in  early March led to a swift and severe deterioration in the functioning of the  Treasury and MBS markets. Pessimism and uncertainty about the economic outlook  as large segments of the economy were shut down, combined with concerns about  markets’ ability to keep functioning in a remote environment, resulted in a  strong desire for cash. In addition, the extreme volatility and its effect on  risk metrics and margins meant that some normally profitable trades were no  longer viable.\n\nInvestors  and asset managers responded by rebalancing their portfolios, deleveraging, and  acquiring the most liquid short-dated assets. In this environment, we saw a  historically large flow of investor sales of Treasuries, as shown in Figure 5 , as well as MBS. There were  also notable sales by foreign reserve managers, whose Treasury securities held  in custody at the Fed, shown in Figure 6 ,  fell sharply during March. The flow strained the capacity of dealers and other  liquidity providers to intermediate on normal terms. The challenges were  particularly notable in off-the-run Treasuries, a sector where some dealers at  times were reportedly reluctant to make markets at all. As a result, market  functioning indicators were quite poor, as illustrated in Figure 7 . Bid-ask spreads for Treasuries, in the left panel , and for agency MBS, in the right panel , both showed extraordinary  increases. Relative value measures also widened notably, with prices appearing  to diverge from fundamentals in some cases, as demonstrated by the Treasury cash-futures  basis in Figure 8 . 9\n\nAt  the FOMC’s direction, the Desk rapidly ramped up asset purchases to address these  conditions. For the first few weeks, we had much to learn about how to maximize  the effectiveness of purchases. We quickly adjusted operations based on our  observations, and although it’s fair to say that at first we were mostly  stabilizing market functioning, the purchases soon began to make meaningful  improvements. As I’ll discuss in a moment, I think our flexibility itself  played an important role in supporting market confidence.\n\nI’ve  been pleased to see that the functioning of Treasury and MBS markets has now rebounded  notably. I was also pleased to see that, in the end, financial markets and  infrastructures were able to continue operating even as the industry shifted,  en masse, to working from home. Measures of market liquidity have uniformly  improved and are now well below their worst points, though some remain more  stressed than at the start of the year. In talking with our contacts, we hear  that the lingering effects of the extraordinary volatility in March and the  uncertain financial environment are limiting improvements in some liquidity metrics  by reducing the appetite to take the risks associated with making markets. Relative  value spreads have also narrowed substantially, though as with liquidity, some  metrics remain higher than before the pandemic.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve’s purchases have supported smooth market functioning through  multiple channels. The purchases absorbed some of the flow of sales and helped  restore two-way trading, which supports liquidity. In addition to absorbing a flow of securities, the purchases changed  the stock of assets held by the  private sector. Because the Desk accepts offers on securities with attractive  prices, our operations can have the effect of buying undervalued securities and  reducing price distortions. 10\n\nBut  these direct effects are not the only channels through which we think our  purchases helped. The design of the purchase program also appeared to reduce market  stress. I’d highlight two key aspects of the program in this regard: commitment and flexibility. The FOMC’s unlimited commitment to purchases “in the amounts needed” to support smooth  market functioning was essential. Our market intelligence indicated that some  investors had been selling not because they needed liquidity immediately, but  because they wanted to take precautions against a further deterioration in  market functioning. By providing confidence that the Treasury and MBS markets  would remain liquid, the FOMC’s commitment to purchases reduced this motive for  sales and helped calm the market.\n\nFlexibility , as I noted  earlier, has been another hallmark of our purchases that has helped to support confidence  in smooth functioning of the Treasury and agency MBS markets. For most of the  spring, we issued calendars for our purchases one week at a time, rather than  our usual monthly calendars, and revised these plans even daily when necessary.  As our indicators showed changes in market functioning, we adapted by adjusting  the size of our purchases, the distribution of purchases across sectors, and  even the settlement timing of our agency MBS operations. 11 This flexibility has  allowed us to maximize support for smooth market functioning. Once we saw  improvements in market functioning, we began reducing the pace of our purchases  starting in late March—but we did so gradually to reduce the chance of renewed  disruptions, and we have remained watchful for conditions that would warrant an  increase in purchases.\n\nHow  Will We Sustain Smooth Market Functioning?\n\nBy  the time of the FOMC’s June meeting, we had reduced the pace of purchases to  the equivalent of around $80 billion per month in Treasuries and about $40  billion per month, net of reinvestments, in MBS. 12 The FOMC directed the  Desk in June to continue increasing SOMA holdings at least at this pace to  sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of  monetary policy to broader financial conditions.\n\nAlthough  market functioning has improved markedly since the period of extreme stress in  mid-March, uncertainty about the course of the pandemic makes it prudent to  protect against further shocks. There also are still sectors of the market  where liquidity and pricing have not fully returned to pre-pandemic conditions.  The continued work-from-home posture at many firms, and ongoing uncertainty in  the outlook, appear to have made liquidity providers somewhat more cautious. Purchases  over coming months will help mitigate risks of renewed stress and sustain continued  smooth market functioning.\n\nWith  the shift to a program focused on sustaining smooth market functioning, we are now announcing a monthly purchase amount and  have lengthened our purchase schedules to semi-monthly periods for both  Treasuries and MBS. These longer calendars provide greater foresight into our  purchase plans, allowing dealers to prepare for this activity in the context of  their customer flows. Importantly, though, we will remain vigilant for signs of  deterioration in market functioning and flexible in adjusting our operations as  needed. This strategy will allow us to safeguard the gains we’ve made and support  the continued flow of credit to American families and businesses.\n\nI’d  emphasize in this regard that our assessment of market functioning is focused  on indicators of market liquidity and efficient prices— not on the level of yields. It is certainly the case that the FOMC’s purchases have been absorbing duration and prepayment risk from the market. The total duration included in our Treasury purchases so far represents the equivalent of about $1 trillion in 10-year securities. Although term premiums do not appear to have come down significantly relative to just before the pandemic, our usual analysis indicates that our purchases have offset some upward pressure that could otherwise have occurred, for example as a result of the recent increases in Treasury debt issuance. I expect that the ongoing purchases  will continue to absorb interest rate risk from the market, and that a wide  range of factors other than our purchases will also continue to influence yields  as our current purchases proceed.\n\nOverall,  I am confident that the full range of Federal Reserve programs, including the Treasury  and MBS purchases, will mitigate the ongoing risks to market functioning and sustain  the progress we have seen. The economic and financial shocks resulting from the  pandemic have been truly extreme. The Federal Reserve’s commitment to smooth market  functioning should provide continued confidence amid the ongoing public health and  economic uncertainties.\n\nStill,  considering the crucial role of the Treasury and MBS markets in the financial  system, and their growing size, it is important to ensure that these markets  remain resilient to future shocks. What factors made these markets vulnerable  to the abrupt deterioration in functioning that we saw in March? Could changes  in regulations, data availability, or market infrastructure make market  functioning more robust to future shocks? What role do funding markets play?  These are challenging questions. They will require careful research and  analysis, and they may not have simple answers. Still, the official and private  sectors should be prepared to work together to assess them, and to do what it  takes to ensure the continued strength and good functioning of these important  markets.\n\nThank  you.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Welcome to the 2021 Annual Primary Dealer Meeting.\n\nPrimary dealers play an important role as counterparties in open market operations, providing a key link in the implementation of monetary policy—a core responsibility of the New York Fed as the Reserve Bank selected to operate in financial markets on behalf of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  In addition, primary dealers serve as important participants in U.S. Treasury auctions. I'm glad that we're back together—even  if only virtually—to participate in this annual forum. These meetings  provide an opportunity to strengthen our relationship and communicate our  expectations.\n\nIt was just over a year ago  that the global economy and financial markets were upended by the COVID-19  pandemic, and the Federal Reserve undertook extraordinary actions to respond to  the crisis. Today, I'd like to reflect on the operational approach of  the New York Fed's Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) during the past year,  and some of the lessons I take away from this experience. Moreover, I'd like to  highlight how our operations have transitioned since the onset of the pandemic,  and some of the ways they will continue to evolve to ensure that we implement the FOMC's directives for open market operations in an  effective and efficient manner.\n\nBefore proceeding, let me note that the views  presented here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the New York  Fed or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe Pandemic Response: Flexible and Adaptive\n\nIn my remarks to this group at the end of 2019, I focused on the FOMC's  approach to implementing an ample reserves regime. 2 We  had set a course to gradually reduce repurchase operations and eventually  maintain an ample level of reserves with regular Treasury purchase operations.\n\nEvents overtook those plans. Our focus shifted abruptly when the onset of the pandemic triggered extraordinary  economic stresses and dislocations in the global financial system. 3 The  Federal Reserve responded with swift and integrated action to support smooth market  functioning and ensure the flow of credit to U.S. households, businesses, and  state and local governments. In addition to conducting large repo  operations and purchasing substantial amounts of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed  securities (MBS), the Federal Reserve expanded FX swap lines and Discount  Window lending, and extended liquidity to critical parts of financial  markets and the economy through special lending and credit facilities. Also,  regulations were temporarily adjusted to encourage bank lending.\n\nOn the Desk, responding to the crisis required an exceptionally  high degree of adaptability and flexibility. For open market operations—both repo  operations and outright purchases—the Desk was broadly directed by the FOMC to  support smooth market functioning. 4 For  Treasuries, agency MBS and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS),  the FOMC directed us to purchase securities in the amounts needed for this  purpose. To comply with these directives, we responded to fast-moving market  developments and adjusted operations as conditions evolved. In reflecting on  the crisis, I believe that both the FOMC's full commitment to market  functioning and the speed, scale and flexibility of our operations were essential  components to a successful response.\n\nOver time, market functioning has improved markedly, and we have  gradually returned to more normal operations: asset purchases now proceed at a  steady pace, regularly-scheduled term repo operations and agency CMBS  operations are no longer being conducted, and the lending authority for all but  one of the 13(3) facilities has expired. Of course, even as some of the  extraordinary measures have been wound down, the FOMC remains committed to using  its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy.\n\nOn the Desk, we continue to adapt our operations to ensure  the effective implementation of the FOMC's directive. Today, I would like to  share some thoughts on how we have returned to more normal operations and how  they will continue to evolve.\n\nAsset Purchases: Ongoing Adjustments to Ensure Efficient and  Effective Implementation\n\nThe FOMC's objective for asset purchases has evolved since  the beginning of the pandemic; whereas purchases were initiated to support  smooth functioning in the markets for Treasuries and agency MBS, over time the  Committee has expanded the objective of purchases to include helping to foster accommodative  financial conditions. Since its meeting in December of last year, the FOMC has directed  the Desk to increase the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities by  at least $80 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $40 billion per  month and has stated that it will continue to increase these holdings until  substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum  employment and price stability goals.\n\nAs the Desk considers how to  approach operations, we first and foremost seek to carry out the FOMC  directive in an efficient and effective manner. In doing so, there are  important operational choices to be made. The Desk's  approach to these choices is guided by key principles, a few of which I would  like to highlight today. First, we aim to be transparent, providing information  to market participants and the public to ensure fairness and promote  understanding of our purchase operations. We also seek to obtain securities at  competitive and appropriate prices for the Federal Reserve, as this will  ultimately benefit the U.S. taxpayer. In addition, unless otherwise appropriate  for efficient and effective implementation under the directive, we endeavor to  operate in a manner that is relatively neutral to the securities available for  purchase and in a way that limits the potential for our operations to affect normal  market functioning. In practice, we follow this principle by purchasing  Treasury securities across sectors in approximate proportion to the universe of  Treasury securities outstanding and by concentrating our purchases of agency  MBS in recently produced securities. I would like to discuss a few changes that  we have made or are planning in the Desk's Treasury, agency MBS, and agency  CMBS operations that help us adhere to these guiding principles.\n\nTreasury Purchase Operations\n\nLast March, when conditions were highly disrupted in the  U.S. Treasury market, we purchased a wide range of securities to address broad  market dysfunction—and, at times, we weighted purchases more heavily toward sectors  in which conditions were especially strained. Adjustments made to the size and  composition of purchases were announced in the Desk's purchase calendars, often  released multiple times a week.\n\nAs market conditions stabilized, we adjusted purchase  allocations to be roughly proportional to the amounts outstanding across the  nominal Treasury coupon and TIPS coupon curves, and we lengthened the purchase  calendars to provide more predictability in our planned operations.\n\nAs our Treasury purchases transitioned to a more  proportional allocation, there were still sectors of the curve that we  refrained from purchasing. For example, the Desk generally has avoided purchasing  bills, both to avoid increasing scarcity value in these securities arising from  strong investor demand and because bill purchases have relatively little impact  on financial conditions. 5\n\nEven in this steadier operating regime, we continue to adjust  our purchase approach consistent with our principles. For example, we conduct  periodic reviews of our allocations across purchase sectors and make modest changes  in response to the evolving market environment. During the past year, issuance of  Treasury securities has increased markedly as the U.S. Treasury has sought to  fund pandemic-related fiscal stimulus expenditures. Even with this new issuance,  the distribution of Treasury coupons outstanding has been fairly stable given  the large outstanding stock of Treasury debt. However, modest shifts have occurred.  In particular, the introduction of the 20-year Treasury bond has increased  amounts outstanding around the 20-year maturity point. In addition, the pace of  increase in TIPS issuance has been slower relative to nominal coupon securities.  With net issuance expected to remain high in the near term, we anticipate that the  composition of outstanding supply will continue to evolve. As a result, we plan  to make minor technical adjustments to our purchase sectors and increase the  frequency at which we update purchase allocations to remain roughly  proportional to the outstanding supply of nominal coupon securities and TIPS. We  expect to announce these as a part of a normal purchase calendar release in coming  months.\n\nAgency MBS\n\nOur agency MBS  operations starting last March were also initially driven by the need to support  smooth market functioning. Purchases focused at first on a broad range of  coupon securities in the outstanding universe of agency MBS that came under intense  selling pressure. Our operations also included purchases for near-term  settlement to help ease pressures on dealer balance sheets, which is different  than the Desk's usual practice of purchasing in the forward-settling market.\n\nAs conditions  normalized, agency MBS purchases returned to a more neutral allocation roughly in line  with recently produced agency MBS coupons in the to-be-announced (TBA)  market. These agency MBS coupons represent the most liquid and readily  available supply and their purchase is least likely to cause settlement frictions  in the agency MBS market. Their yields are also most closely tied to primary  mortgage rates. The recent rise in longer-term Treasury yields and primary  mortgage rates has shifted origination into agency MBS with relatively higher  coupons, and our purchases have followed suit.\n\nThe recent increase  in interest rates will also have implications for the timing of purchases and the  amounts of securities purchased relative to supply. We reinvest our monthly agency  MBS proceeds after paydowns are received, and in the near term these purchases  may continue at a robust pace. In contrast, agency MBS origination volumes are  expected to decline because of the recent increase in mortgage rates. This temporary  difference between the amount of our reinvestments and origination volumes will  diminish as the prepayments in our portfolio also slow down because of higher mortgage  interest rates. However, in the meantime, we will be closely monitoring for possible  signs that market participants are experiencing difficulty delivering enough  agency MBS pools into forward TBA contracts and will adjust the forward settlement  date of our purchases accordingly.\n\nIf needed, the  Desk can also conduct dollar roll transactions to facilitate the orderly  settlement of securities purchases. These operations help limit the potential  for the Desk's purchases to disrupt normal market functioning by rolling forward  the settlement month of securities that may be showing signs of short-term  scarcity. 6 We recently enhanced the transparency  of dollar roll operations by releasing the  results on the  New York Fed's website on the same day that the operations occur, rather than  weekly. This change provides more timely information to all market participants.\n\nFinally, it is fitting to conclude  the discussion of our asset purchases by noting the end of regularly scheduled agency  CMBS operations. During the pandemic, the FOMC directed the Desk to purchase  agency CMBS for the first time to help address the dislocations in that market.  Given the ongoing stabilization in this  market, we recently ceased regularly scheduled operations in agency CMBS.\n\nEven as the  crisis has receded and our operations have normalized, we remain ready to adjust  our operations as needed to sustain smooth market functioning, as directed by  the FOMC. This could include changing the size or composition of our Treasury  and agency MBS purchases or even recommencing purchases of agency CMBS, if  needed. As I noted earlier, fulfilling the directive from the FOMC is our first  priority.\n\nMoney  Markets: The New Normal\n\nI'd like to turn now to money markets. Many of the extraordinary measures taken to address dysfunction in dollar funding markets associated with the pandemic have also gradually wound down. The Desk's remaining term repo operations were phased out in February, the frequency of some central bank swap line operations was reduced last summer, and the lending authority of the 13(3) funding facilities related to money markets has expired.\n\nNonetheless, the  FOMC's ongoing asset purchases continue to lift bank reserves to new  highs, and an environment of elevated reserves is likely to be the new normal  for an extended period. 7 Fortunately, the Federal Reserve's ample reserves framework is well-suited for  managing short-term interest rates in environments associated with a wide range  of reserve levels. In fact, the rapid increase in assets and the resulting  expansion of reserves that have occurred during the pandemic are the types of  actions the FOMC contemplated when choosing an ample reserves regime. While this  shift to operating at much higher reserve levels has been smooth, the Federal  Reserve is always prepared to make adjustments to ensure effective policy  implementation.\n\nMost recently, the growth in reserves has contributed  to a decline in overnight rates relative to interest on excess reserves (IOER).  The effective federal funds rate and other overnight unsecured rates have  softened modestly, while we have observed more pronounced downward pressure on  overnight repo rates. The large size of secured market investors, such as  government money market funds (MMFs) and government sponsored enterprises,  combined with recent reductions in the investments available for these  investors, such as Treasury bills, have put particular downward pressure on  repo and bill rates.\n\nIn this environment, the overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) facility  is likely to become an increasingly important element of our operating  framework. The ON RRP facility helps place a floor on overnight rates by offering a  broad range of money market investors an alternative risk-free investment option.  The availability of this facility is especially important because nonbanks  represent a substantial proportion of the U.S. financial system and money  markets, but do not have access to interest-bearing reserves at the Federal  Reserve. Additionally, the facility can alleviate downward pressure on money  market rates associated with reserve growth by broadening the liabilities that  support balance sheet expansion. The ON RRP has historically been an effective  floor for the federal funds rate and has also supported other short-term  interest rates, and we expect it will continue to do so in the future.\n\nAs a measure of prudent planning, the Desk recently conducted a review of key  design features of the ON RRP to ensure that the facility supports effective policy  implementation. Notably, assets under management at government MMFs—a major  group of money market investors—have increased significantly and become more  concentrated at the largest funds since the facility's $30 billion per-counterparty  limit was set in 2014. In light of these changes, the FOMC recently increased the per-counterparty limit on ON RRP usage to $80 billion which restores the capacity of the facility relative to the assets under management at our MMF counterparties to roughly the level that existed when the $30 billion limit was established.\n\nStaff also  reviewed access to the facility and concluded that the existing counterparty  types are still representative of the universe of repo market investors. However,  the review also presented an opportunity to consider potential adjustments in  line with the New York Fed's broader efforts to ensure that our counterparty policies  promote a fair and competitive marketplace—a topic that we'll be exploring  further in today's panel discussion. Expanding counterparty eligibility can  reduce barriers to entry and foster inclusivity by potentially making our  operations accessible to smaller firms. A more vibrant and diverse marketplace  could, in turn, strengthen the effectiveness of monetary policy implementation  tools. In this regard, we expect in  coming months to reduce the size and activity thresholds for ON RRP counterparty  eligibility, which will help achieve these goals.\n\nThis is part of  the Federal Reserve's ongoing commitment to support diversity, inclusion, and  opportunity, following the expanded counterparty access for certain 13(3)  facilities and agency CMBS operations. Relaxing eligibility criteria helps bring  a diverse set of firms by size, business model, and ownership into our  counterparty base, and we look forward to leveraging these new business  relationships to also broaden our market intelligence efforts.\n\nAs a final note on money markets, in addition to ensuring  that the ON RRP's terms continue to support effective policy implementation,  the Federal Reserve may consider adjusting administered rates if undue downward  pressure on overnight rates emerges, as noted in the minutes of the March FOMC  meeting released yesterday. The Federal Reserve has adjusted administered rates  within the target range on numerous occasions in recent years as conditions in  overnight markets have changed. Such adjustments are purely technical steps to  support effective policy implementation and to maintain the federal  funds rate well within the target range.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, we have gradually returned to more normal operations amid greatly improved financial market conditions. The Desk has continued to adapt its  operations to ensure that it meets the FOMC's directive. In addition, we have sought  to adjust the way open market operations are carried out to be consistent with  our principles of transparency, transacting in a way that will ultimately  benefit the U.S. taxpayer, and limiting the potential to  disrupt normal market functioning as a result of our operations.\n\nAs will be discussed in a panel later today, the New York  Fed also remains engaged with efforts to advance the important goal of enhancing  market resiliency through both our sponsorship of the Treasury Market Practices  Group (TMPG) and our support of the LIBOR transition as co-convener of the  Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) and producer of the Secured  Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). Our partnership with each of your institutions  remains an important part of the effective and efficient implementation of  policy and of ensuring financial market stability and resiliency.",

    "text": "Thank you to the Money  Marketeers of New York University for inviting me to speak today. 1\n\nMoney markets are  vital to the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses, and central to  the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy implementation. For nearly 75 years, the  Money Marketeers has been an essential forum for discussing critical issues  related to money markets. I am pleased that this group is continuing to meet  virtually in these challenging times, allowing this important dialogue to continue.  I look forward to our discussion.\n\nWhen I last spoke with  this group in April 2019, I talked about the recent decision by the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC) to maintain an ample reserves regime as its  long-run framework for implementing monetary policy. 2 An ample reserves regime is  a version of a “floor” system in which reserves are supplied in sufficient  quantity to ensure that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term  interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal  Reserve's administered rates. At the time, I noted two key benefits that the  FOMC highlighted in choosing this framework. First, it provides effective  control over short-term interest rates in a broad range of environments, including  during periods when large amounts of liquidity are needed to relieve stress in  the financial system or large-scale asset purchases are required to support the  U.S. economy. 3 And, second, from an operational perspective, a steady-state ample reserves  regime can be simple and efficient to operate.\n\nHowever, in March, the  global financial system experienced an extraordinary shock, triggered by the  coronavirus pandemic, and our focus shifted rapidly. The Federal Reserve took  swift and decisive action to address the shift in the economic outlook and  deteriorating conditions in financial markets. The FOMC cut the target range  for the federal funds rate close to zero, and directed the Desk to conduct repo  operations and purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities  (MBS) to support market functioning. The Federal Reserve undertook a wide range  of additional steps—many in coordination with the U.S. Treasury—to support the  flow of credit to the U.S. economy, and coordinated with foreign central banks  to stabilize dollar funding conditions. Some regulations were also temporarily  adjusted to encourage bank lending. These measures, alongside swift and  forceful fiscal policy action, succeeded in stabilizing financial markets and  averted an even deeper collapse in economic activity. 4\n\nAlthough the pandemic  shock itself was unprecedented, the responses that it required—a rapid increase  in assets and expansion of liquidity—were the type of actions the FOMC contemplated  when choosing an ample reserves regime. And, as expected, the shift to operating  at much higher reserve levels has been smooth, allowing the FOMC to focus on  supporting the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Today I’d like  to talk about this shift to higher reserve levels and our observations on money  markets so far, and explain why the Federal Reserve’s framework is well suited to  implement policy in this environment.\n\nLet me note that the  views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Impact Has the Federal Reserve’s Pandemic Response Had on the Balance  Sheet and Reserve Balances?\n\nI  would like to start with a review of changes in the Federal Reserve’s balance  sheet since March. It is the size of the balance sheet and composition of  liabilities that determine the level of reserves in the banking system, which,  in turn, has a meaningful influence on money market rates and policy  implementation.\n\nAs  shown in Figure 1 , the Federal Reserve’s balance  sheet grew at a historic pace between  March and June of  this year as a result of the FOMC’s critical actions to support market  functioning and the flow of credit to the U.S. economy. Most of the increase resulted from  purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS, shown in dark and light  blue. Expanded repo operations and  central bank liquidity swaps, as well as credit and liquidity facilities  established with the support of the U.S. Treasury—collectively shown in gray—also contributed to this growth. 5 More recently, the rate of growth  in the balance sheet has slowed. With market functioning significantly improved,  outstanding balances across funding operations and credit and liquidity facilities  have gradually declined, and the pace of net Treasury and agency MBS purchases  has been steady since June.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve expands its assets, reserves in the  banking system increase. This is  mechanical; for example, when the Desk purchases securities from dealers, the  Federal Reserve funds these purchases by crediting the reserve accounts of  dealers’ custodian banks. 6 As shown in dark blue in Figure 2 , reserves in the banking system grew rapidly  during the spring, and have reached a level of over $3 trillion, exceeding the prior  peak in reserves, which occurred in 2014. 7\n\nIn addition to supplying reserves to the banking system, the  Federal Reserve maintains an account for the U.S. government, known as the  Treasury General Account (TGA), as well as accounts for other domestic and  foreign official entities. 8 Increases in the balances held in these accounts alter the composition of  liabilities on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and reduce the level of  reserves in the banking system. For example, when investors purchase Treasury  debt, funds are transferred from their bank accounts to the TGA.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2 , the  TGA has risen dramatically since March, as the Treasury Department built cash  balances to prepare for potentially unprecedented outflows related to the  pandemic response. 9 Treasury’s cash management policy is motivated by precautionary risk management  and calibrated to allow Treasury to cover outflows in case of a temporary  interruption to market access. 10 The  TGA currently stands at roughly $1.5 trillion, nearly four times its largest size  prior to this year. This  balance is generally expected to fall in the coming months and, while the  extent of the decline is uncertain, most expect the balance to remain well  above historical norms.\n\nCurrency in circulation is another liability that affects  the level of reserves. The pandemic increased the public’s demand for currency,  likely for both precautionary and transactional purposes. As a result, currency  has grown at a rapid pace compared to prior years, increasing by approximately  $250 billion since March.\n\nGrowth in the TGA, currency, and other non-reserve  liabilities has muted the growth in reserves since March; reserve balances  would have been about $1.6 trillion higher had these other liabilities remained  unchanged. In effect, this increase in non-reserve liabilities has broadened the  funding of the expansion in Federal Reserve assets beyond reserves held by the banking  system.\n\nBefore I move on, I want to highlight one other Federal  Reserve liability: the overnight reverse repo, or ON RRP, which currently has  no outstanding balance. Unlike other  non-reserve liabilities, the overnight reverse repo is used directly as a tool in  the Federal Reserve’s operating framework to ensure effective interest rate  control. A broad range of money market participants can invest funds in the ON  RRP at a fixed rate, placing a floor under overnight interest rates.\n\nHow Has the Historic Increase in Reserves Affected Money Markets?\n\nTo highlight how reserve supply influences money market rates, Figure 3 shows a stylized depiction of the relationship between the overnight interest  rate and banks’ demand for reserves.\n\nPrior to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the Federal Reserve operated  a regime in which just enough reserves were supplied to meet banks’ reserve  requirements and payment needs. In this environment, depicted to the left, the  marginal bank borrowed at rates above the interest rate earned on reserves—which  at the time was zero—to ensure sufficient balances were maintained to cover  payment needs.\n\nIn an ample reserves framework, reserves are instead supplied in an  amount that leaves most banks with reserve balances above what they need for  payments purposes. As a result, many are comfortable investing excess balances  when the return on other high-quality liquid assets is above the interest paid  on excess reserves (IOER), and also taking deposits at rates near IOER. 11 In  effect, IOER sets a benchmark for short-term lending and borrowing. This  environment is represented by the part of the reserve demand curve that flattens  out with rates near IOER, depicted to the right. 12\n\nHowever, when reserves are supplied well beyond what banks require  for payments purposes, many may perceive increasing balance sheet costs associated  with taking on additional reserves. In this environment, the marginal bank borrows  at overnight rates below IOER, as it requires additional compensation to grow its  balance sheet further. 13 We  might consider reserves at this point to be in abundant supply. Even when  reserves are abundant, IOER retains its strong influence on rates, although federal  funds and many other overnight money market instruments trade at a spread below  IOER.\n\nSo where are we currently on this graphic?\n\nAs I’ve described, the supply of reserves has been shifting significantly  to the right along this curve. Given this, we may have expected money market rates  to be lower than they currently are, reflecting more of an abundance of  reserves. However, as shown in Figure 4 , the effective federal funds rate has  remained relatively close to IOER in recent months—much closer than it was when  reserves were at similar levels in 2014.\n\nI’d highlight two main factors that are contributing to this  difference.\n\nFirst, banks’ reserve management practices appear to have shifted since  March. Figure 5 shows federal funds rates relative to IOER for different levels  of aggregate reserves, over the last 10 years, with observations this year shown  by the light and dark red dots. Since March, rates have been higher relative to  IOER than was the case during the earlier period of abundant reserves, shown by  the light blue dots representing observations in 2014 and 2015.\n\nSome of the light red dots represent observations during the highly  uncertain days of March, when some banks paid elevated rates to maintain precautionary  reserve balances in the face of extraordinary customer demand for liquidity. To  better understand this dynamic, the Federal Reserve Board included new questions  in the most recent Senior Financial Officer Survey (SFOS), which is a survey of  commercial banks that collectively hold around three-fourths of the reserves in  the system. Banks that increased their reserve balances from February to April  confirmed that a strong desire to hold precautionary liquidity against  potential customer credit line draws or deposit outflows drove the increase. 14 The results of this survey were released to the public yesterday and are  available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website.\n\nInterestingly, even as this elevated market uncertainty has receded  and reserve levels have continued to increase, rates have remained near IOER,  as indicated by the dark red dots. It could be that a greater comfort among  domestic banks to hold higher reserve balances, at least for now, is  contributing to rates continuing to trade near IOER. In the SFOS, the banks  with higher reserve holdings since April indicated that their increase was  motivated by a desire to maintain a buffer against deposit outflows, as well as  the absence of attractive risk-adjusted investment alternatives. 15 As  shown in Figure 6 , the growth in reserve balances has been particularly notable  for the U.S. global systemically important banks (GSIBs) and large domestic  banks that typically accumulate deposits. 16 These  banks collectively hold a much higher share of reserves than during the post-GFC  period, when foreign banking organizations (FBOs) absorbed a greater share of  the reserve increase. 17\n\nA second,  and likely important factor, contributing to the higher level of rates relative  to IOER is the significant increase in Treasury’s net bill issuance this year  to fund fiscal stimulus, shown in Figure 7 . Although Treasury bills are  external to our stylized reserve demand curve, they are highly liquid and safe investment  instruments, and an increase in the supply of Treasury bills tends to raise  rates on a range of money market instruments that lenders consider to be  substitute investments.  Indeed, analysis by New York Fed colleagues finds that, controlling for changes in  reserves, an increase of $1 trillion in the supply of short-term Treasury  securities raises the spread of the effective federal funds rate relative to IOER  by about three basis points. 18 This helps explain some of the firmness in money market rates in recent months.\n\nIt is  also possible that the configuration of the Federal Reserve’s administered  rates within the target range has influenced the relative firmness in rates at  times. The current spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates is narrower than  during the earlier period of abundant reserves. Because of this, it would not have  been possible for the effective federal funds rate to trade as far below IOER  as it did during the 2014 to 2016 period, although this does not likely explain  why rates are as close to IOER as they currently are.\n\nWhere Do Money Market Rates Go From Here?\n\nReserves over the near term seem likely to continue to grow,  albeit at a slower pace than during the spring of this year. The degree and rate  of growth will depend, in large part, on the path of asset purchases that the  FOMC chooses. For example, in the Desk’s November Surveys of Primary Dealers  and Market Participants, the median respondent expected net Treasury and agency  MBS purchases to continue at the current pace through the end of next year  before slowing in subsequent years. In addition, as I noted above, most market participants  expect the Treasury Department to draw down the TGA balance over the medium  term. Together, changes in Federal Reserve assets and liabilities such as these  could add significant reserves to the banking system.\n\nEven as aggregate reserve levels are expected to grow, many  banks have suggested they will increasingly take actions to limit the growth in  their own reserves. We have already heard from some banks that compression in net  interest margins and changes in their regulatory ratios associated with higher  reserve levels are making additional reserve growth less attractive for them. 19 Indeed, even as market participants broadly expect reserve levels to increase  in coming months, the majority of SFOS respondents expected their own reserve  levels to be stable or decline, as shown in Figure 8 . Many of these respondents  reported that they intend to let wholesale funding and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB)  advances run off, and to lower the rates they offer on certain deposits. It is  important to note that these types of business changes take time to implement. So,  even if reserves were to stay near current levels, these actions could put  downward pressure on market rates.\n\nOf course, as I described above, reserves  remain in the banking system unless they are absorbed by growth in another  Federal Reserve liability, or Federal Reserve assets decrease. The system is  closed. Actions taken by individual banks to limit reserve growth can redistribute  reserves to banks that have more capacity to absorb them, and money market  rates adjust until banks in aggregate eventually demand the total amount of reserves  being supplied.\n\nDuring the 2010 to 2014 period, as  rates declined, FBOs absorbed a significant amount of reserves, in part by  taking on additional deposits from money market mutual funds. FBOs are natural  borrowers in wholesale deposit markets and faced lower balance sheet costs  associated with reserve growth than domestic depository institutions. 20 It remains to be seen, however, if these banks will be as comfortable taking  additional reserves in the current environment, or if other banks will step in  to absorb reserve growth should rates fall.\n\nGoing forward, it seems likely that some of the factors that  have been supporting rates this year—the increase in the TGA, highly elevated  bill issuance, and domestic banks’ apparent comfort with reserve growth to date—will  moderate or reverse. We will continue to monitor money markets closely to assess  evolving conditions.\n\nHow Will the Fed’s Tools Work to  Maintain Interest Rate Control?\n\nAs I noted above, the Federal Reserve has two important  tools that can help maintain control over the federal funds rate and other short-term  rates in this environment. IOER sets a benchmark against which banks evaluate short-term  borrowing and lending opportunities, and this in turn passes through to other  money market rates. When rates fall below IOER, the ON RRP maintains a floor on  overnight rates by offering a broad range of money market investors an  alternative risk-free investment option. 21\n\nOn occasion, the Federal Reserve has adjusted these  administered rates to influence where the effective federal funds rate falls  within the target range. Since 2018, the Federal Reserve has made five such adjustments  to IOER and, as shown in Figure 9 , each time the effective federal funds rate moved  in line with the adjustment, demonstrating IOER’s strong influence. In instances  where rates have drifted lower relative to IOER, the ON RRP has maintained a  strong floor. 22 Since  2016, the effective federal funds rate has not traded below the target range, even  on balance sheet reporting dates when there can be strong downward pressure on  rates.\n\nAs shown in Figure 9 , IOER is currently set at 10 basis  points, well below the top of the target range. If undue downward pressure on  rates were to emerge, the Federal Reserve could adjust IOER higher to lift  overnight rates. Even if this downward pressure persisted, the ON RRP would  maintain a strong floor by providing an alternative investment for money market  participants and, if needed, by reducing the quantity of reserves held by the  banking system to relieve pressure on bank balance sheets. The Desk has over 120  counterparties to the ON RRP, representing a large majority of investors in the  triparty repo market, giving this tool broad coverage to accomplish these  objectives. 23\n\nOf  course, we will respond to the environment as it evolves. The Federal Reserve  stands ready to adjust the terms of the ON RRP and parameters of other tools as  needed to ensure their efficacy.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nIn conclusion, I have been pleased that the FOMC’s implementation  framework was able to support actions taken to address the pandemic, by  smoothly accommodating a shift to much higher reserve levels. Given this significant  increase in reserves, we might have expected money market rates to trade lower  in the FOMC’s target range relative to IOER than they have, similar to the earlier  experience with abundant reserves.\n\nHowever, the factors that supported rates this year—the  increase in the TGA, highly elevated bill issuance, and domestic banks’  apparent comfort with reserve growth to date—may moderate in 2021. As a result,  rates could fall, reflecting an abundance of reserves. If this softness in  rates emerges, it could help the financial system accommodate the growth in  reserves by encouraging some banks to take on additional balances. Even if more  persistent downward pressure on rates emerges, we are confident that the Federal  Reserve has tools to ensure effective control over the federal  funds rate and other short-term interest rates across the broad range of  potential outcomes.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Good  afternoon. As members of the Foreign Exchange Committee, you are all well aware  of the importance of well-functioning financial markets. I would like to thank  you for the commitment you have shown to supporting the smooth functioning of  the foreign exchange market. Your continued leadership is especially important  in these challenging times. And we are all grateful to those who are putting  themselves in harm’s way on the front lines to take care of others during this  unprecedented public health emergency.\n\nIn  early to mid-March, amid extreme volatility across financial markets triggered  by the coronavirus pandemic, several markets at the center of the U.S.  financial system were severely disrupted. In short-term funding markets, it was  difficult to borrow for longer than overnight. In the usually very liquid  markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS),  trading became impaired. In investment-grade credit markets, even healthy  borrowers found that credit was unavailable or very expensive.\n\nThese  markets matter not only for those who participate in them, but also—because of  their central role in the financial system—for workers and families throughout  the United States. Continued disruptions could quickly make it more difficult  for families to obtain mortgages at reasonable interest rates, for businesses to  fund their operations and pay their workers, and for local, state, and federal governments  to pay for essential services. Such a credit crunch would exacerbate the  hardships many are experiencing in this period of economic constraint necessary  to fight the spread of the coronavirus, and reduce the odds of a strong  recovery afterward.\n\nTherefore,  it was important for the Federal Reserve to act quickly and decisively to support  market functioning and the flow of credit. Over a period of a few weeks, the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the federal funds  rate to near zero. The Federal Reserve also announced a sequence of strong  actions to support the flow of funding in short-term markets, the functioning  of Treasury and MBS markets, and the availability of credit to households,  businesses, and state and local governments.\n\nToday,  I will provide an overview of these actions to date from my perspective as manager  of the System Open Market Account and head of the New York Fed’s Open Market  Trading Desk. The Fed’s recent actions have involved an unprecedented array of  tools—from standard open market operations conducted by the Desk and deployed  on a larger scale than ever before, to new facilities that use the Federal  Reserve’s emergency powers with the consent of the Treasury Secretary and  financial backing from the Treasury and Congress. Some actions targeted problems  in a single market, while others worked to support functioning across many  markets. In addition, because they were deployed in close succession, the  actions reinforced each other, with improvements in each market supporting the  functioning of other markets and the financial system overall. I will speak  about recent actions to support liquidity and the flow of credit in four areas:  domestic short-term funding markets, international dollar funding markets,  markets for Treasuries and MBS, and credit markets.\n\nBefore  I proceed, let me note that the views I express are my own and do not  necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the  Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nDomestic  Short-Term Funding Markets\n\nFunding  markets transfer funds from households and businesses that seek safe, easily  accessible short-term investments to firms that have short-term borrowing  needs. For example, a manufacturing company with a temporary surplus of cash  might invest in a money market mutual fund, planning to take the money back out  in a few weeks to invest in new equipment. In turn, the money market fund might  buy commercial paper issued by another company that needs to cover its payroll,  or it might use a repurchase agreement (or “repo”) to lend to a broker-dealer  that needs to finance an inventory of Treasury securities. The smooth flow of funds  in these markets allows businesses to readily finance their operations and  investors to engage in vibrant trading that keeps a wide range of other markets  working well.\n\nIn  mid-March, short-term funding markets became severely impaired. In repo and  commercial paper markets, there was little term funding available. Even for  overnight borrowing, some market participants paid much higher rates than  usual. Figure 1 shows the Secured  Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which is the median rate on certain overnight  repos against Treasury collateral, as well as the 75th and 95th  percentiles of the distribution of these Treasury repo rates. Ordinarily, this distribution  of rates is very tight. However, in the second and third weeks of March, it  widened notably, with some borrowers paying dozens of basis points above the  median, and well above the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate.\n\nThe  initial pressures in funding markets led to further strains. Investors became  reluctant to buy the commercial paper of healthy issuers, for fear that when  the paper came due, the issuers would have difficulty rolling it over into new  paper. Prime money market funds—which invest in commercial paper—saw outflows  of about $150 billion over the month of March as some investors worried that difficulty  selling holdings would eventually prevent the funds from satisfying  withdrawals.\n\nStarting  March 9, the Federal Reserve launched a series of actions to stabilize funding  markets. The first two actions involved expanding the use of standard tools: repo  operations by the Desk and discount window lending by all 12 Reserve Banks.\n\nShortly  thereafter, several additional actions used emergency tools, based on the  Board’s authority to act in unusual and exigent circumstances with consent of  the Treasury Secretary and, in some cases, funding as well:\n\nInternational  Dollar Funding Markets\n\nAs  the world’s preeminent reserve currency, the dollar plays a leading role in  trade and investment far beyond our country’s borders. Banks around the world  borrow dollars in international markets to finance these activities. In  addition, global banks borrow dollars to finance investments in the United  States—lending, that is, to American families, companies, and the U.S. government.  As members of the FX Committee, you are well versed in the importance of  international dollar funding markets.\n\nThese  markets, too, came under severe strain in March. Shown in Figure 2 , the yen-dollar swap basis spread—a measure of the premium  paid to borrow dollars using yen in the foreign exchange market—soared by roughly  200 basis points. Other foreign exchange swap basis spreads also rose sharply,  and foreign exchange swap trading volumes declined. These pressures had the  potential to spill over to domestic funding markets, as international banks can  compete to borrow  dollars in the U.S., as well as the potential to disrupt the flow of credit  from international financial institutions to domestic borrowers.\n\nTo  ease strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets, the Federal Reserve and  other central banks took coordinated actions in March to enhance the provision  of U.S. dollar liquidity through central bank swap lines around the world. These  swap lines are designed to improve liquidity conditions in the United States  and abroad by providing foreign central banks with the capacity to deliver  dollar funding to institutions in their jurisdictions during times of global  funding market stress. This supports activities that rely on access to U.S.  dollar funding, including supplying credit to U.S. borrowers. The Federal  Reserve and the central banks of Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, Switzerland,  and the euro area agreed to lower the pricing on the standing swap lines, to supply  dollars at longer tenors in addition to regular one-week operations, and to increase  the frequency of one-week operations. The Federal Reserve also established  temporary swap lines, limited in size, with nine other central banks around the  world.\n\nIn  addition to the swap lines, the Federal Reserve established a temporary repo  facility to allow foreign and international monetary authorities to temporarily  exchange U.S. Treasury securities held in their accounts with the New York Fed for  U.S. dollars. This facility provides those central banks with an alternative  source of dollar funding that they can then lend to institutions in their  jurisdictions. The facility also helps to support the smooth functioning of the  market for U.S. Treasury securities by reducing foreign central banks’ need to  sell these securities outright when private cash and repo markets become  stressed.\n\nMarkets  for Treasury and Mortgage-Backed Securities\n\nThe market for U.S. Treasury  securities is commonly described as the deepest and most liquid in the world. Ordinarily,  it is easy for investors to sell Treasuries quickly and at low cost. This  liquidity adds significantly to the value of Treasury securities, helping the  U.S. government to borrow at low interest rates. As many other interest rates  are priced relative to the safe interest rate on Treasuries, the liquidity of  the Treasury market ultimately reduces financing costs for families and firms  throughout the economy.\n\nAlthough  not as liquid as the Treasury market, the market for agency MBS—pools of  residential mortgages backed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac—is also  ordinarily very liquid. This liquidity makes MBS a more attractive investment,  supporting low mortgage rates and the flow of mortgage financing to American  households.\n\nHowever, in mid-March, liquidity in  Treasuries and MBS dried up. The Desk’s market monitoring and data analysis  suggest that two key factors were at work. First, amid large moves in asset  prices and uncertainty about access to liquidity, many investors sought to sell  bond holdings. Some of these investors, such as asset managers that might need  to meet redemptions, were seeking to raise cash. Others were rebalancing their  portfolios after the sharp fall in equity prices, or exiting positions that  were no longer viable in the highly volatile market conditions. These large  sales of bonds drove up dealers’ inventories of Treasuries and MBS; facing  balance sheet constraints and internal risk limits amid the elevated volatility,  dealers had to cut back on intermediation. Second, volatile market conditions  led some trading firms to step back from the market, further reducing  liquidity. Figure 3 shows the  consequences: The average bid-ask spread for Treasury securities, a measure of  transactions costs, rose by a factor of about 13 over the first few weeks of  March. Many other measures of functioning in the Treasury and MBS markets also  deteriorated.\n\nIn response, the Desk, at the  direction of the FOMC, is undertaking extensive purchases of Treasuries and MBS  to support the functioning of these critical markets. Although asset purchases  are a standard Desk tool, the scale of these purchases has been unparalleled,  totaling about $1.6 trillion in the past four weeks. Also, we are now buying  agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), which are pools of  mortgages on apartment buildings and other commercial properties that are backed  by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. As important as the volume of  purchases is the FOMC’s commitment, announced March 23, to purchase whatever  amounts are needed to support smooth market functioning and effective  transmission of monetary policy. 8 Extending a strong commitment  to support market functioning has calmed trading conditions and allayed  the potentially self-fulfilling fear that conditions might deteriorate further.\n\nI should note that supporting smooth  market functioning does not mean restoring every aspect of market functioning  to its level before the coronavirus crisis. Some aspects of liquidity—especially  aspects related to transactions costs and market depth—are importantly affected  by fundamental factors such as how the current extraordinary uncertainty about  the economic outlook influences trading behavior. These aspects of market  functioning may not return all the way to pre-crisis levels for some time, even  as our purchases slow.\n\nNor does supporting smooth market  functioning mean eliminating all volatility. In well-functioning markets,  prices will respond rapidly and efficiently to new information. During the  unprecedented disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, a great deal of  new information arrives every day about the outlook for specific markets, such as  housing, and for the economy as a whole. These changes in the outlook should move  the Treasury and agency MBS markets irrespective of the Federal Reserve’s  purchases.\n\nCredit  Markets\n\nIn normal times, credit markets allow  households and businesses to finance a vast array of activities: buying a car  or a house, attending college, covering a short-term gap between revenue and  expenses, or making a long-term investment in new products or factories. In  this time of economic stress, credit markets are all the more critical, helping  families to borrow rather than forgo necessities, and helping businesses to  keep going, cover their payrolls, and, eventually, make the investments needed  for a strong recovery.\n\nYet  credit markets have come under substantial pressure in recent weeks. For  example, the spread of interest rates on investment-grade corporate bonds  relative to Treasury securities widened by about 250 basis points from late  February to mid-March, as illustrated in Figure 4 .\n\nMuch of that pressure results from significant  changes in the economic outlook: With many businesses temporarily closed and  millions of people losing their jobs, lenders see a greater likelihood that some  borrowers will be unable to repay. But impaired market functioning has also  contributed to the pressures. For example, borrowers often repay their debts by  borrowing anew, but rolling over debt is difficult in a stressed market, so  lenders may conclude that market dysfunction will lead to defaults even by financially  sound borrowers and respond by reducing lending or seeking higher interest  rates. We saw several signs that poor market conditions were contributing to  credit stress in March, including a drop-off in corporate and municipal bond  issuance and large outflows from bond mutual funds.\n\nMany of the Federal Reserve actions  in funding and asset markets that I described earlier are also helping to support  credit markets. For example, the PDCF, CPFF, and MMLF can all provide funding  for loans to creditworthy borrowers such as households, businesses, or local governments,  while MBS purchases support a key market for credit to households.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve Board,  with the consent of the Treasury Secretary and backing provided by the Treasury  and Congress under the CARES Act, has used its emergency authority to announce numerous  steps targeted at other major credit markets. The Primary Market Corporate  Credit Facility (PMCCF) will buy newly issued corporate bonds and syndicated  loans, while the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) will give  investors an outlet to sell corporate bonds—in both cases supporting a key  market for credit to large employers. 9 The Board has also  announced a Main Street Lending Program that will purchase up to $600 billion  in loans to small and midsize businesses, as well as a facility that will  support the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)  by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that make PPP loans to small  businesses. 10 In addition, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) will support  the issuance of securities backed by student loans, auto loans, credit card  loans, small business loans, and other debt, while the Municipal Liquidity  Facility (MLF) will lend up to $500 billion to state and local governments. 11 All of these steps will  help keep credit markets working and credit flowing to qualified borrowers in  response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nConclusion\n\nModern  financial markets are closely connected to one another. Stresses in one market can  easily lead to stresses in others, raising the risk that the financial system  as a whole becomes significantly impaired. For example, if short-term funding  markets are disrupted, otherwise creditworthy borrowers may have difficulty  rolling over their debts—which can make the borrowers more risky and create  pressures in credit markets. The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-’08 showed how  rapidly problems can spread across financial markets and ultimately damage the  economy.\n\nToday’s  crisis is different, having originated outside the financial system, in an  enormous challenge to public health. Yet the lesson of the previous crisis  still applies, and the Federal Reserve has taken it to heart in responding to  the recent stresses in funding markets, Treasury and MBS markets, and credit  markets. By acting quickly and forcefully to support all of these markets at  once, we have been able to stabilize market conditions. Many challenges surely  lie ahead for the economy and financial markets. But the past month demonstrates  that the Federal Reserve will use its tools aggressively to keep markets working  so that credit can flow to households, businesses, and state and local  governments throughout our economy.\n\nThank  you.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me to join this  panel.\n\nThe panel’s topic—what we are normalizing to—is a key issue  facing central banks as they normalize monetary policy after the crisis, and I  hope to bring to this discussion an operational perspective from my position on  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Open Market Trading Desk.  I will highlight three points:  First, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet,  once normalized, is likely to be smaller than it is today but considerably larger  than it was before the crisis, regardless of the type of operating regime the Federal  Open Market Committee (FOMC or Committee) adopts in the long run.  Second, while the FOMC could maintain  interest rate control through a corridor system for its longer run monetary  policy implementation framework, it would require a lot of learning by doing  and would be unlikely to look like our pre-crisis corridor system.  And third, based on what we’ve learned from  operating a floor system thus far, it appears that this type of system can provide  effective control of rates with operational simplicity.  Before I continue, I should note that the  views presented here are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nLast October, the Federal Reserve began the process of  reducing the size of its balance sheet—a significant milestone in the ongoing  monetary policy normalization process.  Using  a program of progressively increasing caps, we are gradually reducing the Fed’s  securities holdings, which will reduce the supply of reserve balances in the  banking system. 2 This process will continue until reserves  fall to a level that reflects the banking system’s demand for reserve balances  and the FOMC’s decisions about how to implement monetary policy “most efficiently  and effectively,” as noted in the FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and  Plans.\n\nHowever, there remains much uncertainty over what the  “normal” size of the Fed’s longer-run balance sheet will be and how long it  will take to get there.  This uncertainty  arises from numerous sources:  We don’t  know how fast our MBS holdings will pay down, how quickly currency outstanding  will grow, how many bank reserves will be required for the efficient and  effective execution of monetary policy, or how other liability items on the  Fed’s balance sheet will evolve.  The  economic outlook also poses an ever-present source of uncertainty.\n\nAlthough the Committee has not yet specified what a  normalized balance sheet will look like, market participants’ expectations may  provide some helpful context.  The New  York Fed’s most recent annual report on open market operations (released just a  few weeks ago) presents a set of projections for possible paths of the Fed’s  securities portfolio. 3 As seen in Figure 1 , the report shows three scenarios constructed from distributions  of market participants’ surveyed expectations for the future size of the  balance sheet. 4 Survey-based expectations for the path of  interest rates and some staff modeling fill in additional details.  While these scenarios by no means embody the  full range of possible outcomes, they suggest the domestic securities portfolio’s  size could normalize at $2.5 trillion to $3.3 trillion, with the larger end of  that range projected to be reached within two years.  After its normalized size is reached, the  portfolio is assumed to incrementally grow again as Treasury securities are  purchased to keep pace with trend growth in liabilities, mainly currency. 5\n\nThe projection exercise illustrates a key point:  The Fed’s future balance sheet will likely be  considerably larger than its pre-crisis level.   This outcome is likely regardless of the design of the operating regime  that the Committee ultimately uses to manage short-term interest rates.  The normalized size will be determined by the  liability side of the Fed’s balance sheet, which will reflect two driving factors:  Growth in non-reserve liabilities, and a potential  shift in the structural demand for reserves.\n\nFirst, there has been substantial growth in the Federal  Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities in recent years, and some factors are  expected to grow further, as seen in Figure 2 .  U.S. dollar currency in circulation tends to grow  over time and has more than doubled since the start of the global financial crisis,  to a current level of $1.6 trillion. 6 The median survey response implies an  expectation for currency to grow to around $1.8 trillion at the time the size  of the portfolio normalizes—in other words, the portfolio will need to be $1  trillion larger than before the crisis just to back currency in  circulation.  Meanwhile, various account  holders—including the Treasury Department, foreign and international official  institutions, government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), and designated financial  market utilities (DFMUs)—have increased their balances held in Federal Reserve  accounts or investment services, which currently represent over $700 billion in  additional liabilities.\n\nSecond, it is likely there has been a shift in the structural  demand for reserves, driven largely by banks’ response to changes in  regulations and risk appetite that favor safe assets, particularly  reserves.  If the demand curve for  reserves has indeed shifted out, the amount of reserves the Federal Reserve  will need to supply to achieve a given interest rate target will be comparably  larger than it once was.\n\nThe FOMC acknowledged in last June’s addendum to its Policy  Normalization Principles and Plans that it anticipates a future level of  reserve balances that is “appreciably below that seen in recent years but  larger than before the financial crisis.” 7 In the three projection scenarios I’ve shown,  reserve balances (as derived from market participants’ expectations) are  assumed to be around $400 billion, $600 billion, and $750 billion once a  normalized balance sheet size is reached, well below the current level of $2 trillion  and consistent with the Committee’s statement.   However, we have insufficient information to identify what factors  inform these views.\n\nTaking reserves and non-reserve liabilities together, I see virtually  no chance of going back to the pre-crisis balance sheet size of $800 billion.  Thus, discussion of whether to have a large  or small balance sheet in the long run partly misses the point.  The conversation is really about the relative  amount of reserves, which will be governed both by the banking system’s demand  for reserve balances—something we will learn more about during the process of  balance sheet normalization—and by the Committee’s future decisions around how  to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively.\n\nDebates about monetary policy implementation regimes generally  center on two frameworks, illustrated in stylized form in Figure 3 .  The traditional framework—a  version of which the Fed used before the crisis—is a corridor system, which is  generally associated with a scarce supply of reserves.  Policy is implemented through frequent  adjustments to the supply of reserves, such that the supply intersects the  steep portion of the reserve demand curve at the desired overnight interest  rate.  Fluctuations in reserves stemming  from autonomous factors are borne by the private sector through the central  bank’s open market operations.  In  contrast, the framework used to implement policy today is a floor system, which  is associated with an abundant supply of reserves and policy implementation  that is achieved through periodic changes to administered rates.  A floor system is generally associated with a  relatively larger balance sheet than a corridor system because the central bank  needs to supply enough reserves to satisfy demand on the flat part of the  reserve demand curve, perhaps with an additional buffer to accommodate reserve  supply shocks.  Such shocks typically  stem from fluctuations in other liabilities. 8 However, we do not really know how large or  small a difference in the amount of reserves would be needed to run an  effective and efficient floor versus a corridor in the longer run.  The answer will depend critically on the shape  of the demand curve, which we will learn more about over time, as well as the specific  design parameters of either framework.\n\nI would  emphasize that central banks have successfully implemented both types of  frameworks, or variations of them, and that the Fed can achieve interest rate  control with either one.  Leaving aside some  of the broader policy considerations, I’d like to make a few points about the technical  operation of each framework in the longer-run.\n\nFirst, some observers see a return to the Fed’s pre-crisis,  reserve-scarce corridor system as the natural conclusion to the normalization  process, highlighting that system’s familiarity.  But it is important to note that fundamental  changes in the money market landscape over the past decade would likely make monetary  policy implementation in a future corridor system look substantially different  than before the crisis.\n\nIn the Fed’s pre-crisis regime, hitting the target federal  funds rate each day was a technically challenging exercise.  Demand for reserves was driven largely by  reserve requirements, in addition to intraday payment clearing needs.  We started with a banking system that on most  days was short of reserves.  Then, using staff  forecasts of various factors affecting the supply of and demand for reserves  over multiple days ahead, we calibrated open market operations with the dealers  in the repo market to bring the aggregate supply of reserves into balance at  the target rate.  With this aggregate  balance achieved, individual banks distributed them. Banks facing a  deficiency of reserves needed to find and trade with banks holding reserve  surpluses, each balancing the costs associated with holding too many or too few  reserves. 9 , 10 We were reliably proficient in hitting the  FOMC’s target rate in normal times, but interest rate control was more  challenging at times when factors affecting reserves were harder to predict.  This was particularly true in the early  stages of the crisis, when large changes in reserve demand caused significant  intraday and interday swings in federal funds rates (Figure 4) . 11 , 12\n\nToday, with greater uncertainty and variability in factors  affecting the day-to-day demand for and supply of reserves, it would be more  difficult to anticipate fluctuations and achieve the necessary balance in  reserve conditions even in normal times.   In aggregate, reserve demand is likely to be guided by a more complex  set of drivers, including post-crisis liquidity regulation, supervision,  resolution planning, and intraday payments risk management.  These needs have the potential to contribute  to higher and more variable demand for reserves than banks had before the  crisis. 13 Estimating reserve demand would need to take  into account these factors, as well as banks’ propensities to substitute between  reserves and other relevant assets—something that may vary according to an  individual institution’s business strategy.   Knowledge about the shape, position, and stability of banks’ reserve  demand curve will likely emerge only with experience.\n\nAdditionally, we would need to consider shocks that affect the  supply of reserves, such as those stemming from changes in the Fed’s non-reserve  liabilities. As seen in Figure 5 , net changes in non-reserve liabilities have become more variable  in recent years. 14\n\nEven if fluctuations could be accurately forecast, in a  corridor system, they would need to be offset through open market operations to  maintain interest rate control.  Larger  fluctuations would likely require larger operations. 15 In the years before the crisis, the average  size of daily overnight repo operations was around $5 billion—a relatively  small amount given the size of the repo market and dealers’ net securities  financing needs.  Roughly 95 percent of  these operations were for less than $10 billion, and the maximum operation size  in normal times was $20 billion.  Looking  just at recent variability in non-reserve liabilities and assuming overnight  operations were used to offset their fluctuations, daily temporary operations  in a corridor system might routinely need to be around $25 billion, but could  go as high as $100 billion. 16 We would need to consider whether the Fed’s repo  and reverse repo operations could be dependably scaled to that degree, and  whether their effects would be transmitted to other rates.\n\nOne consideration in this regard is that there appear to be  greater frictions across funding markets today.   Dealer balance sheets have shrunk and become less elastic in the face of  changes in regulation and risk management. 17 While dealer caution contributes to the overall  safety and soundness of the banking sector, it could mean we would need more or  different types of counterparties for traditional repo operations, or perhaps different  types of operations altogether—particularly if federal funds trading became  idiosyncratic or disconnected from other rates.   In sum, a reinstated corridor might look less familiar than some expect.\n\nFor comparison, let me make a few observations about our  experience with the floor system that the Fed is currently using.  The FOMC has successfully raised its target  range for the overnight federal funds rate six times since December 2015, and,  as seen in Figure 6 , the effective  federal funds rate has reliably printed in the prevailing target range over  that time.  The policy stance has  transmitted to a broad constellation of money market rates.  The system is simple and efficient to operate.  The interest rate the Fed pays on excess  reserves serves as the primary policy implementation tool, with support from a  standing facility that offers overnight reverse repos (ON RRPs) at an  administered rate. 18 There is no need to forecast specific factors  affecting reserves or to conduct discretionary open market operations each day;  overnight reverse repos are offered every day based on price, not quantity.  Day-to-day fluctuations in factors affecting reserves  are accommodated by the elastic reserve demand given that reserve needs are  widely met.  Market forces keep the federal  funds rate in the FOMC’s target range by allowing a wide range of  counterparties to price trades against the alternative option of investing with  the Federal Reserve.  And in the  aggregate, use of the Fed’s balance sheet is efficient by allowing private and  official sector market participants to determine their preferred distribution across  the range of Fed liabilities. 19\n\nThis system could continue to work well with considerably  lower levels of reserves, so long as the supply continued to intersect the flat  part of the demand curve.  If reserves  fell too low, we could see high volumes of fed funds borrowing at interest  rates well above the interest rate on excess reserves, which would indicate  that we were no longer operating at the flat part of the demand curve. 20 As I noted earlier, maintaining a buffer of excess  reserves to absorb reserve-draining shocks could prevent this outcome.  An important trade-off arises between the  size of that additional buffer and the frequency and size of open market operations. 21\n\nTo sum up, the FOMC could choose to retain the floor system  to implement policy in the longer-run or it could choose to shift back to a  corridor system.  However, a reinstated  corridor system may be less familiar than some expect.  Such a framework would involve uncertainties  about reserve demand and greater variability in factors affecting reserve  supply, and would likely require operations that are larger, more variable, or even  very different from those used before the crisis.  Meanwhile, those who favor a floor system may  be encouraged by the performance of our current framework to date.  We’ve learned that the floor system has  proven to be highly effective at controlling the effective federal funds rate  and other money market rates, is resilient to significant shifts in market  structure, and is efficient to operate.  Under  either framework, the balance sheet will likely normalize at a level  substantially larger than it was before the crisis to accommodate higher demand  for reserves and non-reserve liabilities in the post-crisis landscape.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Welcome to the 2019 Annual Primary  Dealer Meeting.  Each of your firms plays  an important role as a trading counterparty in the implementation of monetary  policy—a core responsibility of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the  operating arm for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  This is an area that has generated  increased operational activity over the past year.  These annual meetings provide us an  opportunity to strengthen our relationship and communicate the New York Fed’s expectations  of its counterparties.\n\nOver the course of the year, there  have been important developments in the Federal Reserve’s framework for  implementing monetary policy, and the markets in which we operate have continued  to evolve.  I’d like to focus today on  what  the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) is currently  doing to implement the FOMC’s ample reserves regime, particularly over the next  several months.  In mid-October, the FOMC  directed the Desk to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the  level that prevailed in early September, and we recently began Treasury bill  purchases to achieve that objective.   Since it will take some time to accumulate securities holdings, we also continue  to conduct temporary repurchase agreement (repo) operations in order to ensure  that the supply of reserves remains ample and to mitigate the risk of money market  pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation.  Although money market conditions have calmed  since the mid-September volatility, the Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring reserves  conditions and money market developments, and the Desk will continue to use its tools and adjust operational plans  as needed to maintain the federal funds rate in the FOMC’s target range.\n\nIn addition to discussing  open  market operations today, I would also like to focus briefly on another key  development in money markets—the transition away from LIBOR.  I will highlight today’s announcement about  the New York Fed’s proposal to produce averages for the Secured Overnight  Financing Rate (commonly known as the SOFR).\n\nBefore I begin, I will remind you  that the views presented here are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect  those of the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nOpen Market Operations in an  Ample Reserves Regime\n\nI’d like to start with some context  about how the FOMC planned its transition to an ample reserves operating regime  for monetary policy implementation.\n\nIn January, the FOMC announced its  intention to continue  implementing monetary policy using an ample reserves operating regime.  This means that the supply of reserves is sufficient  to ensure that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term  interest rates is exercised primarily through the Federal Reserve’s  administered rates, and active management of the supply of reserves is not  required. 2 This last clause is an important feature of  the framework and means that, over time, the level of reserves will be large  enough to absorb short-term changes in factors affecting the supply of reserves  without the need for frequent, sizeable interventions to offset these changes ( Figure 1 ).\n\nIn March, the FOMC indicated that the longer-run level of reserves will be a  level consistent with “efficient and effective” implementation of monetary  policy. 3 To support a smooth transition to the  longer-run level of reserves, the FOMC also stated its intention to slow the  pace of the decline in reserves—which had  been coming down as a result of normalizing the balance sheet—over subsequent quarters, first by slowing and then  by stopping the reduction in the Federal Reserve’s aggregate securities  holdings.  The end of balance sheet  runoff occurred in August, and the FOMC continued to monitor a  wide range of information to reach a judgement about the level of reserves most  consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation in an ample  reserves regime. 4\n\nIn mid-September, upward pressure emerged in  funding markets as corporate tax payments and the settlement of Treasury  securities increased demand for securities financing and sharply reduced reserves in the system.  Consistent with the directive from the FOMC, the Desk responded with temporary open market operations to foster conditions that would maintain the federal funds rate within the target range.  In mid-October, the FOMC directed the Desk to maintain over time reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September in order to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample. 5 The FOMC judged this level more supportive of smooth market functioning and effective control over the federal funds rate, and we have seen money market pressures stabilize.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the quantity  of reserves needed to maintain an ample reserves framework is  subject to uncertainty and may change over  time.  Banks’ demand for reserves is not  static.  It shifts in response to changing  financial conditions and will evolve through time as banks adjust their  business models and respond to changes in the economic and regulatory  environment.  In addition, the level of  reserves needed to maintain an ample reserves regime is more than the sum of  individual banks’ reserves demand, particularly when there are frictions that  result in inefficient redistribution of reserves.   The measurement of these factors is complex,  and the FOMC will continue to monitor a broad range of information to assess the  level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective implementation of  policy.\n\nI’d like to turn now to how the  Desk will supply reserves to carry out the FOMC’s directive to maintain reserves  over time “ at or above ” the level  that prevailed in early September.  This directive  requires provision  of a supply of reserves that can sufficiently absorb normal fluctuations  in non-reserve liabilities, so shifts in these balances do not bring reserves  below desired levels and potentially compromise effective interest rate control.\n\nThe Desk has been directed to  purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year to  achieve the FOMC’s objective, and we are currently executing those reserve  management purchases at the initial pace of $60 billion per month. 6, 7 I’d like to share some thoughts on the  composition and sizing of those purchases.\n\nFirst, why Treasury bills?\n\nAs I noted earlier, the goal of the  reserve management purchases is to maintain an ample supply of reserves to  support effective and efficient monetary policy implementation.\n\nBecause Treasury bills are  short-dated instruments, purchases of these securities can help  maintain the  supply of reserves while limiting the impact on financial conditions.  Moreover, bills are liquid instruments with  deep markets, and the  Federal Reserve doesn’t currently hold many of them.  The Federal Reserve traditionally held a  relatively large portfolio of Treasury bills (in addition to holdings across  the coupon curve) in its System Open Market Account (SOMA), but sold or redeemed  that bill portfolio during the Global Financial Crisis and in the Maturity  Extension Program.  While the FOMC has  not yet made decisions about the long-run composition of its domestic  securities portfolio, current bill holdings in the SOMA are low by any measure. 8 Treasury  bills represent less than 3 percent of the SOMA’s Treasury  portfolio, compared to  15  percent of the outstanding Treasury universe ( Figure  2 ).  From a portfolio  composition perspective, these purchases will incrementally add bills back to  the portfolio as the FOMC continues to consider its desired long-run  maturity composition.\n\nSecond, how do we approach the  design of our purchases?\n\nAt present, three elements are  driving the overall size of the reserve management purchases:\n\nIn practice, this will mean looking out over several months and sizing reserve management purchases to offset expected reserve declines.  For example, reserve balances tend to decline notably in late April as the TGA grows with the collection of individual taxes, and the  Desk’s planned purchases  over the next several months will help to offset the anticipated decline in reserves associated  with those flows.\n\nBesides estimating the total amount of  purchases, the Desk also needs to determine the pace at which it  will execute those purchases.  The amount and timing of the  operations take into account market functioning considerations and allow for  some adjustments around periods with sharp expected declines in reserves or  liquidity conditions.\n\nSo far,  reserve management  purchase operations have proceeded smoothly.   The Desk has purchased $52.5 billion of the initial $60 billion in monthly  purchases, through seven purchase operations of roughly $7.5 billion each.  To date, those operations have generated  strong offer-to-cover ratios, pricing that has been favorable relative to  market and theoretical prices, and broad participation and awards from your  firms.  Moreover, the Treasury bill  market is accustomed to shifting  amounts of securities available for  purchase due to seasonal dynamics related to TGA inflows and outflows and the  debt ceiling, and we’ve seen market prices adjust as we expected given the flow  of our planned purchases.  With roughly  $2.4 trillion of Treasury bills outstanding and daily turnover of around $95  billion, the bill market has substantial capacity to support our activity, and  we expect to  be able to maintain  the current pace of Treasury bill purchases  for  some time. 10\n\nThat said, the Desk is prepared to  adjust the pace and other parameters of the reserve management purchases as  necessary to maintain an ample supply of reserves and based on money market  conditions.  We’ll be closely monitoring  the attractiveness of propositions and indicators of market functioning to assess  whether operational adjustments are appropriate.\n\nIn the meantime, because it will take some time for  the bill purchases to sustain the supply of reserves at or above levels prevailing  in early September, the FOMC has also instructed the Desk to continue offering  term and overnight repo operations at least through January.  Repo operations foster conditions to  maintain the federal funds rate within the target range through two  channels.  First, they supply reserves in  support of the FOMC’s operating regime, helping to ensure that reserves are maintained  over time in amounts at or above the early September levels, even in the face  of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities. 11 Second, they provide funding  in repo markets to damp repo market pressure that  could otherwise pass-through to the federal funds market and adversely affect  policy implementation.\n\nThe repo operations have successfully  offset supply changes and money market pressures associated with big  anticipated drops in reserves, such as around mid-month and month-end  settlements.  In doing so, they have been  effective at restoring calm in money markets and maintaining control over the  federal funds rate.  Overnight and term  money market rates have moderated, on average, relative to IOER, and the  effective federal funds rate has stayed well within the FOMC’s target  range.  Participation in the repo  operations has been robust and the transmission to broader money markets has  been good.\n\nOn October 23, the Desk announced an increase in the amount offered in overnight repo operations from  at least $75 billion to at least $120 billion.   We also increased the amount offered in the remaining term repo  operations spanning the October month-end from at least $35 billion per  operation to $45 billion, raising the total amount of term repos offered over  this period to up to $180 billion.  This  increased capacity was supportive to  money markets,  and the federal funds rate was   stable over October's month-end.\n\nAs we head into year-end, the Desk will continue to make adjustments as needed to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation.  It is good to  see firms starting to address year-end funding needs, and we understand that,  as firms manage their balance sheets more carefully in December, rates can be  somewhat more variable and dealers may adjust their approach to our  operations.  We will monitor conditions closely  and will be prepared to adapt open  market operations as needed to meet the directives  from the FOMC.\n\nAverages of SOFR Rates and the  Transition from LIBOR\n\nBefore I wrap up, I’d like to say a  few words about reference rates.  As I  noted to this group last year, the New York Fed is committed to producing  robust and resilient reference rates and to supporting the transition away from  LIBOR. 12 New York Fed President John Williams has emphasized this issue, noting that while progress has been made, there  is still much work to do, and with no guarantee of LIBOR’s existence  beyond the end of 2021, the clock is ticking. 13\n\nThe New York Fed helps advance these  objectives  as the administrator and producer of the SOFR,  which was selected by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) as its  preferred alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR, and also, in coordination with the  Federal Reserve Board, through  support of the ARRC.  The SOFR, which launched in April 2018, is a  measure of the general cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by  Treasury securities in the repo market—a rate that broadly reflects how  financial institutions fund themselves.   Importantly, it reflects underlying transaction volumes averaging more  than $1 trillion per day over the past year, and its production is compliant  with IOSCO’s Principles for Financial Benchmarks.  Over the past year-and-a-half, SOFR futures  markets have demonstrated promising growth in notional volumes traded and  liquidity, even if volumes remain low compared to both federal funds and  Eurodollar futures.  Additionally, there  has been meaningful issuance of SOFR-linked cash products like floating rate  notes.\n\nA next step in  supporting broader adoption of the SOFR as a LIBOR alternative will be to meet  the need expressed by market participants—particularly financial and corporate  issuers of securities and loans—for a set of SOFR averages that can be used in  a wide range of financial products. 14 To this end, today, the New York Fed released  a solicitation for public comment on a plan to publish daily, starting in the  first half of 2020, a set of three compounded averages of the SOFR, as well as  a daily SOFR index that would allow users to calculate compounded averages over  custom time periods. 15\n\nAn expansion to the suite of reference rates we  produce is an important next step that further demonstrates the Federal  Reserve’s commitment to support  the usefulness of adopting the SOFR.  I also urge you to commit to this critical  endeavor.  The comment period for the  public solicitation will close on December 4, and I encourage you to review the  proposal and provide feedback, including about the tenors and compounding methodology  for the new products.  While the response  to preliminary socialization of the program parameters has been positive, we  recognize the importance of getting these averages right.  Market participant feedback was critical as the  New York Fed  began producing Treasury repo reference rates to support the transition, and  your continued input will help ensure that the rates we produce best meet the needs  of the financial system.  More generally,  every market participant needs to understand their LIBOR exposures and use all  available tools to transition to robust alternative rates, such as the SOFR, as  they prepare for a world without LIBOR.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, the  Desk continues to operationalize  the FOMC’s ample reserves regime.  We are  doing this by conducting Treasury bill purchases to maintain a supply of reserves  consistent with the FOMC’s directive to maintain reserves at or above  early-September levels.  Also, since it  will take some time to accumulate securities holdings to achieve that  objective, the Desk is continuing to provide reserves temporarily through overnight  and term repo operations.  We are monitoring  market conditions closely, have tools to effectively and efficiently support  monetary policy implementation, and will make adjustments as needed.  Both in the execution of open market  operations and support for the transition from LIBOR, it is a very active time  on the Desk, and our partnership with each of your institutions remains  important to the smooth implementation of this work.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Thanks very much for that kind introduction.  I would like to thank Dick Berner and Venky  Venkateswaran for  organizing this event. 1 As Dick would likely recall, I was supposed  to give a talk about implementing policy here at NYU Stern two years ago,  almost to the day. We had to cancel that speech as it became clear that the  emerging pandemic and the efforts to contain it would disrupt the global  economy and lead to unprecedented strains in financial markets. Today, the world faces an extraordinary new challenge.  I would like to acknowledge the tragic events  in Ukraine and the terrible hardship this places on the Ukrainian people. The economic and financial impact of these events  will take time to become clear.  On the Desk,  we are monitoring global developments carefully.\n\nMy  remarks today will begin by looking back at the pandemic crisis and the historic  policy response.  Starting in March 2020,  the Federal Reserve took a set of extraordinary measures in response to the extreme  economic stresses and dislocations in the global financial system that were triggered  by the pandemic.  These  actions—many taken in close coordination with the U.S. Treasury, and alongside  a forceful fiscal response from the U.S. government—were successful in providing  accommodation to the U.S. economy during a very vulnerable and uncertain period. 2\n\nIn light of recent  strength in the labor market and elevated inflation, the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) has decided to end net purchases of  Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in early March.  The Committee also stated that it expects it  will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,  and released principles for significantly reducing the size of the Federal  Reserve’s balance sheet. 3\n\nWith net asset purchases coming to  an end, it is an opportune time for reflection.   In my remarks today, I’ll first review the asset  purchases the Fed conducted over the past two years, exploring how the  Committee’s evolving objectives for these purchases influenced the Desk’s implementation  approach. I’ll then highlight how these purchases shaped  the SOMA portfolio today and discuss some considerations ahead for policy implementation, in the context of the FOMC’s recently issued Principles  for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet .\n\nAs always, the views I express today  are my own, and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Fed’s Asset Purchases: Objectives  and Implementation\n\nNext week,  the FOMC’s net purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS will come to an  end, marking the conclusion of this historic program, in which net purchases  totaled roughly $4.6 trillion, as shown in Figure 1 . These purchases were  instrumental in supporting the flow of credit to the U.S. economy and fostering  accommodative financial conditions—and, along with other significant policy  measures, prevented a much deeper economic downturn.\n\nThe onset of the pandemic resulted  in an unprecedented “dash for cash” as heightened uncertainty in the outlook  and shifts to a remote trading posture prompted extreme price volatility, sudden  portfolio de-risking, and strains in market functioning.  In this environment, even the most liquid  securities, like Treasuries, were being sold broadly and in large quantities,  overwhelming the market’s intermediation capacity. 4\n\nBy mid-March 2020, Treasury and  agency MBS market functioning had deteriorated to levels not seen since the Global  Financial Crisis.  In this truly exceptional  environment, the Fed stepped in to buy securities at an unprecedented scale and  speed to restore market functioning and maintain the vital flow of credit to  the U.S. economy.  This entailed  purchasing record amounts of securities to address one-way selling flows and meet  the immediate demand for liquidity.\n\nThe flow of these  purchases helped to alleviate private sector balance sheet constraints and meet  this demand for market liquidity.  Over  time, purchases restored two-way trading and more normal market functioning. The FOMC’s full commitment to purchase Treasuries  and agency MBS “in the amounts needed” to support smooth market functioning  also had the effect of stabilizing precautionary sales and forestalling a  spiral in liquidity demand. 5\n\nDuring this period, flexibility was  a hallmark of our implementation approach.   The Desk adjusted purchases in response to shifting market conditions  and sized them to address dysfunction.  We  closely monitored and assessed market functioning metrics and targeted sectors  in which conditions were especially strained.  In the MBS market, operational  adjustments included purchasing a broad range of securities that came  under intense selling pressure and purchasing for  near-term settlement, which helped ease pressures on dealer balance sheets.  This differed from the Desk’s typical practice of purchasing recently produced  coupons in the to-be-announced (TBA) market for forward  settlement.\n\nGiven the depth of the strains, market  functioning improved only gradually at first.  However, with the Committee’s full commitment to supporting  market functioning and the Desk’s continuous operational adjustments, market functioning metrics improved  considerably over the course of several weeks, and the Desk reduced purchase  amounts commensurately. 6 In the Treasury market, bid-ask spreads  narrowed and market depth rebounded, as shown in Figure 2 .  Similarly, agency MBS market liquidity  conditions, as represented by the effective bid-ask spread shown in Figure 3 ,  improved markedly.\n\nAs market functioning improved and  conditions stabilized, the Committee shifted its focus to fostering  accommodative financial conditions to support the economy as it recovered from  the pandemic shock, and to sustaining the gains made in market functioning. While asset purchases conducted to support  market functioning were used during the pandemic to address extraordinary and  acute stresses, asset purchases aimed at fostering accommodative financial  conditions are a standard part of the Committee’s monetary policy toolkit,  employed when the federal funds rate is constrained by its effective lower  bound (ELB).\n\nBy reducing the stock of securities and duration risk held by  private investors, Fed asset purchases lower term premiums and longer-term  interest rates, easing financial conditions broadly.  In  addition, purchases of agency MBS reduce the amount of prepayment risk held by  investors, leading MBS spreads to fall and resulting in lower mortgage interest  rates for homeowners.  Asset purchases can  also convey information about the FOMC’s policy intentions, as market participants  believe the Committee would be unlikely to raise its policy rate while  conducting asset purchases.\n\nAs  the FOMC’s objectives for asset purchases evolved, so too did the operational  approach.  Purchase  amounts were quickly scaled back as conditions improved, dropping from a  daily average of over $100 billion in late March 2020 to around $10 billion by the  summer, as shown in Figure 4 .  Without the need for high-frequency  adjustments to address market strains, the Desk extended  the horizon for purchase calendars to provide more predictability in planned  operations.  Purchase allocations  also became more standard and were distributed relatively neutrally to the universe of securities outstanding.  In this case, Treasury purchases were allocated proportionally to the amounts outstanding across the nominal Treasury coupon and TIPS coupon curves. 7 In the MBS market, the composition of purchases was adjusted to be roughly in line with recently produced coupons in the TBA market.\n\nOverall, the asset purchases, and the  operational approach used to implement them, were effective at achieving the  Committee’s objectives. The flow of  purchases substantially improved market functioning by meeting immediate  demands for market liquidity in strained conditions.  The total stock of Fed asset holdings—resulting  from both purchases initiated to address market functioning and those conducted  with a focus on providing accommodation—worked to put downward pressure on  longer-term yields and ease financial conditions.  And, the Committee’s communications about asset  purchases had important signaling effects about its commitment to supporting the  economy.\n\nWhat I take away from this experience is  that the FOMC’s toolkit for addressing both severe market functioning  disruptions and economic downturns is comprehensive and effective.  Nonetheless, while asset purchases used to  support market functioning and those employed to foster accommodative financial  conditions may be broadly similar in nature, I do not view them as equal parts  of the monetary policy toolkit.  I expect  circumstances warranting sizable intervention to support market functioning to  be extraordinarily rare.  In this respect, the ongoing work to better understand  vulnerabilities in the U.S. Treasury market and to develop potential reforms to  further enhance its resiliency is critical. 8 In  contrast, the Committee has indicated that  asset purchases to provide accommodation are a standard tool when the federal  funds rate is constrained by the ELB. 9\n\nConsiderations  for Policy Implementation Ahead\n\nLooking ahead,  as I noted, with a strong  labor market and elevated inflation, the FOMC has stated that it  expects it will soon be appropriate to raise its target range for the federal  funds rate, and has indicated that it intends to significantly reduce  the size of the balance sheet. 10\n\nFor now, the FOMC has directed the Desk to  continue to reinvest all principal payments from the Fed’s Treasury and agency  MBS holdings following the conclusion of net purchases, which will maintain the size and broad composition of the SOMA portfolio. 11 However, in recent meetings, the FOMC began deliberations on its approach to reducing the balance sheet, and following its January meeting the Committee issued principles to provide information on its planned approach. 12 These principles are high-level tenets, and not specific plans.  They build on the experience gained from reducing monetary policy accommodation over 2014 to 2019, and, importantly, also reflect the Committee’s assessment of the current environment.\n\nThe principles start by  affirming that the FOMC sees changes in the target range for the federal funds  rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy, and that reducing the balance sheet will occur  after the process of raising the target range has begun.  The principles further state  that when the Committee decides to begin reducing its securities holdings, it  intends to do so over time in a predictable manner, primarily through  adjustments to reinvestments, so that securities holdings decline with  principal payments.  In addition, the  principles affirm the FOMC’s choice of an ample reserves operating regime, and  an intention, in the longer run, to hold primarily Treasury securities.\n\nLet  me turn to a couple of considerations ahead for policy implementation, in the  context of these principles and the current contours of the SOMA portfolio.\n\nSOMA  Portfolio Contours\n\nFirst, the SOMA portfolio is  substantially larger than it was at the end of the last round of large-scale  asset purchases (LSAPs), reflecting the extraordinary pandemic shock and the  purchases needed to support market functioning and the economic recovery.  As shown in Figure 5 , at about $8.5 trillion and 35 percent of nominal GDP, the SOMA  portfolio is roughly double the size in dollar terms and about 10 percentage  points higher as a share of GDP than in late 2014.  Given  the large size of the SOMA, the Committee has suggested that a significant  reduction in the balance sheet would likely be appropriate. 13 This assessment reflects the view that, with  the overall elevated size of the balance sheet, SOMA securities holdings have  more room to decline than during the prior period of runoff before reaching levels  consistent with efficient and effective implementation in an ample reserves  regime.\n\nIn  addition to the much larger size of the SOMA, the weighted average maturity (WAM)  of Treasury holdings is about two years shorter than in late 2014.  This is because asset  purchases over the past two years have been conducted across the Treasury  curve, whereas purchases under previous LSAP programs and the maturity  extension program (MEP) targeted longer-dated Treasuries.  It also reflects the effect of sales of shorter-dated  securities conducted during the MEP. 14\n\nAs shown in Figure 6 , the portfolio  will have sizable principal payments from Treasury holdings over the next few years, ranging  from $40 billion to $150 billion per month, and averaging around $80 billion.  These could be rolled over or allowed to  mature, depending on the Committee’s decisions.   During the prior period of balance sheet reduction, shown in Figure  6b, the Committee directed the Desk to phase in a cap for monthly Treasury redemptions  of $30 billion per month, to limit the pace and variability of redemption  amounts, particularly around the middle month of each quarter when maturities are  greater. 15 Often, principal payments were below the caps,  and the average pace of Treasury redemptions was less than $20 billion per  month.\n\nAgency MBS principal  payments, shown in Figure 7a , are also expected to be modestly larger  than those experienced during the prior runoff period and could average nearly $25  billion per month over the next few years. However,  there is considerable uncertainty around mortgage prepayments; a  downward shift in mortgage interest rates could increase prepayments  substantially, as indicated by the gray bars. 16 During the prior reduction period, shown  in Figure 7b , the Committee phased in a monthly redemption cap of $20  billion for MBS.  This made the decrease  in agency MBS holdings more predictable, and also limited the possibility of procyclical  reductions in SOMA holdings during periods when interest rates fell in response  to a worsening economic outlook.  In 2019, as the Committee eased policy, the cap did limit the  pace of agency MBS redemptions.\n\nIn summary, Treasury  principal payments in coming years will be much larger and more variable than  they were following the LSAP programs.   MBS principal payments will likely be modestly larger and are subject to  considerable uncertainty.  The FOMC has not  decided on its plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet.  However, the minutes from the December FOMC meeting  noted that many Committee participants judged that monthly caps on redemption  amounts could help ensure that the pace of reduction in the SOMA portfolio would  be predictable over time. 17\n\nAmple Reserves Regime\n\nA second observation  is that the Committee’s affirmation of its ample reserves operating framework  provides broad insight into the longer-run supply of reserves, a key determinant  of the longer-run size of the balance sheet.\n\nDuring  the prior period of balance sheet reduction after the LSAPs, the Committee had  not yet decided on its operating framework.   Even after the Committee announced the ample reserves regime, heightened uncertainty existed about the underlying demand for reserves given the substantial changes in banks’ liquidity management practices since the Global Financial Crisis.\n\nToday, the operating framework is well  established, and we can draw on the prior experience with balance sheet  reduction in assessing the demand for reserves.  That said, the underlying demand for reserves is still uncertain  and varies over time.  Most large reserve holders assess their need for reserve  balances based on intraday payment flows and projected outflows under stressed  market conditions, and each bank has a different profile based on the composition  of its liabilities and the outflow assumptions it makes. 18 Moreover, the supply of reserves needed to  maintain ample conditions is not just the sum of individual banks’ demand, due  to frictions that limit the rapid redistribution of reserves.\n\nAs the  Committee reduces the balance sheet, staff will carefully monitor developments  in money markets to understand changes in reserve conditions and inform the  Committee's assessment of the appropriate path for the balance sheet in the  longer run.  Importantly, the prior  experience with balance sheet reduction offers a useful guide to money market  conditions that reflect ample reserves.  The  FOMC is committed to maintaining sufficient reserves to ensure that  administered rates—the interest on reserve balances (IORB) and overnight  reverse repo facility (ON RRP) rates—exercise control over the federal funds  rate.  However, should  pressures in overnight markets unexpectedly emerge, the new Standing Repo  Facility (SRF) that the Committee established last year is also  available, providing an important backstop to support effective policy  implementation and smooth market functioning.\n\nFlexibility  in Implementation\n\nAs the Committee turns toward  reducing the high level of accommodation provided during the pandemic, the Desk  will focus on implementing the Committee’s plans as they develop.  Overall, the FOMC’s principles provide helpful  guidance on the approach to reducing the balance sheet; similar principles  communicated in advance of decisions or actions during the prior episode enhanced  understanding of the Committee’s approach, supporting effective policy  implementation. 19 This  time around, FOMC participants generally noted that current  conditions likely warrant a faster pace of balance sheet runoff than during the  previous period. 20\n\nGiven  the experience implementing the last balance sheet reduction, it seems likely  that redemptions could proceed smoothly at a somewhat faster pace than before.  However, a significant reduction in SOMA holdings  will require meaningful adjustments to private-sector balance sheets—as  investors absorb the net increase in Treasury and agency MBS issuance and money  markets transition to lower levels of liquidity — and these  adjustments could take time.  And while the Fed has some experience shrinking its  balance sheet, this process is still relatively novel.  So, the Desk will continue to monitor  markets closely to inform the FOMC’s policy deliberations.  The Committee is prepared to adjust its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet, should economic and financial developments warrant.\n\nPotential  for Liftoff is Near-Term Focus\n\nFinally, as  the principles note, the FOMC will first increase the target range for the  federal funds rate before it begins reducing the size of the balance  sheet.  And, at its January meeting, the Committee  stated that it expects it will soon be appropriate to increase the target range.   So, I am also focused on liftoff and adjustments in money markets that  might occur.  Let me offer some concluding  thoughts on that.\n\nThe Committee last lifted the  target range off of the zero lower bound in 2015.  At that time, the Fed had no experience lifting  short-term interest rates in an environment with abundant reserves, and there  was significant uncertainty about the dynamics we’d see in money markets.  Ultimately, the policy  implementation framework—including the administered rates and associated operations—was very successful in managing  the federal funds rate within the target range and lifting the  constellation of overnight rates.  And as we’ve seen over the past several years, the framework has continued to support effective policy implementation across a range of environments.\n\nEven as the current environment is characterized  by higher levels of liquidity than in 2015, I am confident that administered  rates will again be effective at lifting the federal funds rate when the  Committee increases the target range.   Administered rates create strong incentives in overnight markets, and  the ON RRP provides a broad range of money market investors an alternative  investment to support the federal funds rate and other overnight rates.  My sense is that the current setting of  administered rates relative to the target range has been working well and that  it could continue to support effective policy implementation following any  increase in the target range in coming months, although adjustments could be  warranted over time.\n\nWith the high levels of liquidity in money  markets, take-up at the ON RRP facility could increase as rates rise.  Flows  between bank reserves and ON RRP balances depend, in part, on relative levels  of interest rates on bank deposits versus other money market investments, such  as money market mutual funds (money funds).   Some banks may use rising rates as an opportunity to  reduce reserve holdings by shedding deposits. 21 If, when the FOMC increases the target range,  banks raise deposit rates by less than money funds increase net yields to investors, funds could flow from banks into money funds, which could in turn increase take-up at the ON RRP.\n\nThat said, while  many expected an increase in the ON RRP in 2015, this did not come to pass, and  it could be that ON RRP balances remain relatively steady following liftoff or  even decline.  Regardless of what happens  following liftoff, over time, as the Committee reduces the size of the balance  sheet, I expect usage in the ON RRP to decline.\n\nIn sum,  the administered rates working together should maintain the federal funds  rate within the FOMC’s target range.  I  am confident our tools will promote smooth implementation of the Committee’s  policy stance.  But as always, we will monitor  conditions closely and consider adjustments to our approach as appropriate.\n\nFigures Data for Figures 6 and 7",

    "text": "Thank you to the Yale Program on Financial  Stability and to the Bank for International Settlements for the invitation to speak at today’s forum. 1 Financial crises can have deep and lasting  effects on the economy.  They disrupt the  vital flow of credit, damage business and household balance sheets, and result  in lost jobs and income for the American public.  Given these costs, it is critical that we learn  the lessons of past crises and continue to build knowledge about the tools  and interventions that will help us respond effectively in the future.  Discussions like the one we’ll have today are  valuable opportunities to evolve our thinking on policy implementation and  crisis management.\n\nToday, I’ll share some lessons I’ve  taken from two crises that occurred during my time implementing monetary policy:  the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the coronavirus pandemic shock.  I’ll discuss liquidity shocks and how central  bank actions address them.  In  particular, I’ll focus on a recent decision by the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) to establish two standing repo facilities to support the  effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning: the  Standing Repo Facility and the FIMA Repo Facility.\n\nBefore I begin, let me say that my  comments today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the New York  Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Crises: Divergent Shocks; Similar  Hallmarks\n\nFinancial crises emanate from  shocks, which often are amplified by vulnerabilities or imbalances in the  financial system.  Each crisis unfolds in  its own way, challenging policymakers to respond to evolving conditions.  Still, there are recurring elements to most  crises.  And in these similarities we can  find valuable lessons that help us better prepare for the future.\n\nThe GFC and the pandemic crisis  resulted from very different events.  The  GFC was precipitated by a housing market shock that was amplified by weak  underwriting standards and highly leveraged financial intermediaries—in  particular, in subprime mortgage finance.   The crisis unfolded over an extended timeline, punctuated by events that  revealed significant vulnerabilities among financial institutions, including in  the banking sector.  In contrast, the  pandemic  crisis was caused by an extraordinary exogenous shock to the economic outlook as  measures taken to control the coronavirus pandemic threatened to disrupt  activity worldwide and raised concern about the ability of financial markets to  operate smoothly.  The sudden and  unprecedented uncertainty resulted in a “dash for cash” that began in  the markets for the most liquid and safe investments and unfolded with  astonishing speed. 2 Although banks were a source of strength  during the pandemic, the event still revealed vulnerabilities in market  structure and among some financial firms.\n\nEven with these very divergent  origins, the GFC and pandemic crisis impacted financial markets in some similar  ways.\n\nFirst, both resulted in an extraordinary  increase in the demand for dollar liquidity.   The demand arose out of both immediate funding needs and the desire to  raise precautionary liquidity. 3 The supply of liquidity was also curtailed as firms  that normally lend instead stockpiled liquidity to meet potential future payment  needs.  During both crises, this surge  in demand for U.S. dollars was global in nature and had significant spillovers  to domestic funding conditions.\n\nSecond, each crisis revealed  vulnerabilities in short-term funding markets—notably among prime money market  funds—in which maturity transformation created an unstable source of liquidity during  periods of stress, propagating funding strains. 4\n\nThird, as a result of strained  liquidity conditions, credit markets became severely disrupted, threatening the  flow of credit to the economy.  In both  crises, extreme stress in credit markets resulted in elevated risk premia and  reduced access to credit, with the potential for harmful effects on aggregate  demand and output.\n\nEven with the divergent shocks precipitating  each crisis, these common elements resulted in negative feedback loops that led  to sharply deteriorating conditions.  As  funding conditions worsened and volatility increased, investors divested assets  to increase liquidity, which in turn resulted in declining prices and a further  need to deleverage or raise liquidity.\n\nThe Response: Some Things Old;  Some Things New\n\nAs I’ve discussed in previous  remarks, the  Federal Reserve responded to dislocations from the pandemic crisis with swift  and decisive actions—many in coordination with the U.S. Treasury—to support  smooth market functioning and the flow of credit to the U.S. economy.  Bearing in mind lessons from the GFC, policymakers announced  actions to address conditions quickly in order to restore confidence.  Fortunately, many tools used during the GFC—including  expanded U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines, enhanced terms of Discount Window  lending, and 13(3) facilities—were able to be revived, with good results.  Indeed, the Commercial  Paper Funding Facility ( CPFF), Money  Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF), Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF),  and Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) were all substantively  similar to facilities employed during the GFC. 5 And,  during the pandemic, the CPFF and MMLF in particular were highly effective at  stabilizing money funds and short-term funding markets.\n\nHowever, we also developed new approaches and tools to  address the unique circumstances associated with the pandemic.  The Desk conducted large-scale and  effectively full-allotment repo operations to stabilize short term funding  markets. 6 Purchases of U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed  securities (MBS)  were initiated with unprecedented speed and scale to address severe dysfunction  in the markets for these securities. 7 The Federal Reserve also introduced a temporary  FIMA repo facility to support global dollar funding conditions and to stem  sales of Treasury securities. 8 New lending facilities were established, in  coordination with the U.S. Treasury, to directly support the flow of credit to small-  and medium-sized businesses and nonprofit organizations, corporations, and  state and local governments. 9\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s actions—many  in close coordination with the U.S. Treasury, and alongside a forceful fiscal  response from the U.S. government and the temporary adjustment of regulations  to encourage lending—brought confidence back in  financial markets. 10 I believe it was this broadly  integrated approach, the swift and agile response, and the unwavering  commitment by policymakers to using their full range of tools that ultimately  helped restore market functioning.\n\nLessons  for the Future: Announcement Effects and Liquidity Needs\n\nAs I look  back, one thing I reflect on is the notable differences across the various  tools in terms of the scale needed to achieve success.  In some cases, the announcement of a program  or facility was sufficient to inspire a strong positive response in the target  markets.  Meanwhile, other tools required  large-scale usage to achieve desired results.   In particular, repo operations, swap lines, and asset purchases all expanded  the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet on a large scale.\n\nWhat were  the factors that gave rise to these differences, and how can we apply the lessons  from this experience?\n\nAnnouncement  effects are a critical element of most central bank actions.  Asset prices are forward-looking, and a credible  commitment to lend or to purchase assets alleviates strains in the  present by shifting expectations about future financial conditions.  In financial crises, announcements that central  bank liquidity will be available soon can temper asset sales and other actions  to raise liquidity.  Announcements can  also enhance the supply of funding and market liquidity.  If intermediaries or end investors are  confident that liquidity will be available in the future, either in the form of  funding or asset purchases, they may perceive market-making and investing as  less risky today—restoring the flow of transactions before any central bank operations  are conducted.\n\nAs an example, the announcements of credit facilities  during the pandemic, including the Corporate Credit Facilities (CCFs) and  Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF), were generally effective at reducing risk  premia and restoring the flow of credit in private markets. 11 The success of facilities despite limited  actual take-up demonstrates that when announcement effects are powerful,  take-up is not the best measure of a central bank program’s impact. 12 During the GFC, the announcement of the first  large-scale asset purchase program in November 2008 substantially improved  conditions in MBS markets even before asset purchases began in January 2009. 13\n\nOn  the other hand, in my experience, policy announcements are less effective when market  dysfunction arises from an immediate demand for U.S. dollars.  For example, a firm that needs to meet margin  calls or an investor that faces redemptions today must actually obtain the  cash; the prospect of cash at some future date is not enough. In these  circumstances, the underlying demand for liquidity may not be satisfied by  enhancing confidence and limiting negative feedback loops with expectations for  future central bank interventions.  When  this is the case, it is only actually delivering liquidity—through asset  purchases or lending—that calms conditions.\n\nAt the onset of the pandemic crisis, the immediate and intense demand  for cash required substantial interventions.   We were fortunate to have repo operations in place at the time that  helped limit the intensity of potential pressures.  However, it took successive increases in the  size of those operations to stabilize repo market conditions.  Similarly, initial announcements establishing  large-scale Treasury and agency MBS purchases did little to quell pressures,  and it was not until actual purchases were increased in size that conditions  slowly began to improve. 14 , 15\n\nTo summarize, shocks can create rapid  shifts in the demand for liquidity that lead to severe financial market  dysfunction.  To the extent that  announcements of central bank actions can reduce that liquidity demand and encourage  a return to normal investing and market-making activity, they can significantly  improve conditions even with little or no actual activity.  However, the most immediate liquidity needs are  unlikely to be resolved by announcements alone and thus require active  operations to address them.  In both of  these crises—as well as during other liquidity shocks, such as the one that  occurred in September 2019—we learned that when immediate liquidity needs  arise, the time needed to put in place a response, even one that is fairly  ready for deployment, risks worsening a fragile situation.  Central banks should maintain a comprehensive  set of tools, some of which are available to meet the most immediate needs, to  address these circumstances.\n\nTwo New Standing Facilities\n\nSo, what does this mean for the  future?  Certainly, these events will continue  to be studied by academics and practitioners for years to come, and the lessons  will be many and varied.  Today, however,  I would like to highlight a few recent decisions by the FOMC.\n\nAs many of you may be aware, the  FOMC has discussed standing repo facilities for a number of years in the  context of its monetary implementation framework. 16 Based on recent experience with repo operations  and their ability to support policy implementation, particularly during periods  of stress in overnight markets, the FOMC renewed its deliberations in recent  meetings. 17\n\nAt its July meeting, the FOMC established  two standing repo facilities as tools in the Fed’s policy implementation  framework: a domestic standing repo facility (SRF) and a repo facility for  foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facility). 18 These facilities will serve as backstops in  money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and  smooth market functioning.\n\nThe SRF enhances control over the  federal funds rate by limiting pressures in the repo markets that could spill into  other overnight money markets. 19 The facility is positioned and priced as  a backstop with a minimum bid rate of 25 basis points, corresponding to the top  of the target range for the federal funds rate.   This pricing allows for robust private activity to occur under most  market conditions, but limits the potential for spikes in repo rates to move  the effective federal funds rate outside of the target range.  SRF counterparties include primary dealers  and will be expanded to include depository institutions that will be able to access  liquidity through this facility and at the discount window. 20 Treasuries, agency debt, and agency MBS will  be accepted to ensure the facility can effectively address pressures that arise  in markets for repo backed by high-quality liquid collateral. 21\n\nThe FIMA Repo Facility establishes a standing facility  to address global dollar funding pressures that may affect U.S. financial  conditions.  The facility provides  foreign official accounts with a temporary source of liquidity against their  holdings of U.S. Treasury securities held in custody at the New York Fed,  presenting an alternative to outright sales of those securities.  This facility complements the existing U.S.  dollar liquidity swap lines by extending access to dollar funding to a broader  range of central banks and foreign official institutions.  The rate is the same as on the SRF to create  alignment across facilities to support effective policy implementation.\n\nThe presence of these facilities should  create confidence that liquidity at a backstop rate will be available in  overnight money markets as needed, potentially limiting the demand for  precautionary liquidity and the run-like dynamics that can occur.  Equally important, they will be available on  a standing basis to meet immediate liquidity needs should they arise.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile I hope we can avoid future  shocks to the financial system and the disruptions to the economy that they  cause, history teaches us that unpredictable events will challenge financial  markets from time to time.  Central banks  will need to respond to new environments and new shocks.  Nonetheless, there are some recurring  elements of liquidity shocks from which we can learn.  The SRF and FIMA Repo Facility will provide  backstops in overnight money markets that help address immediate demand for  dollar liquidity, both domestically and internationally, when shocks  occur.\n\nI hope that the continued study of  crisis events will yield further lessons for central bankers looking to shield  economies from the effects of shocks to the financial system.",

    "text": "Thank you for inviting me to speak and  for that kind introduction.  For years I  have had the privilege to be a part of the audience at these events, and it’s  an honor to be asked to address the group.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Implementation Framework Is Working  Well\n\nThe Federal Reserve has  successfully raised the overnight federal funds rate three times since December  2015 in the gradual process of normalizing the stance of monetary policy.  During this time, the effective federal funds  rate has printed within the prevailing target range set by the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC).  These results  have been achieved with an abundant supply of reserve balances created in the  banking system by large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) from 2008 through 2014 and  amid significant changes in U.S. money markets. 2\n\nA central bank’s operational framework  for implementing monetary policy is designed to control policymakers’ selected  target, typically a short-term interest rate.  Since December 2015, the Federal Reserve has  been using a floor-style framework that allows us to change short-term interest  rates while maintaining an abundant supply of reserve balances that has  fluctuated in a wide range, mostly above $2 trillion.  We can illustrate this framework with a stylized  graph showing the relationship between the interest rate and banks’ demand for  reserves (Figure 1) .  When reserves are  scarce, the curve slopes steeply downward, and small variations in the supply  of reserve balances produce sharp moves in interest rates.  But when reserves become plentiful enough, banks’  demand flattens out, and interest rates become effectively insensitive to  shifts in reserve supply.  The interest  rate at which the curve levels out reflects the return that banks receive on  reserves held at the central bank.  Thus,  in a floor system, undesired upward movements in rates are prevented by making  the supply of reserves abundant enough to intersect the flat part of the demand  curve, while undesired downward movements are prevented by establishing the rate  of interest paid on reserves held at the central bank.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s implementation  of a floor regime is unique in featuring two tools that help prevent the  effective federal funds rate from falling appreciably below the FOMC’s target  range.  The primary tool—interest on  reserves (IOR)—applies to the reserve balances held by banks in their accounts  with the Federal Reserve. 3 In principle, the federal funds rate should  not fall below IOR, because depository institutions have no incentive to lend federal  funds at interest rates below what they could earn simply by leaving the funds  in their reserve accounts.  However, a  number of frictions have caused the effective federal funds rate to print  moderately below IOR, leading the Federal Reserve to use a supplementary tool—a  facility that offers overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs) at a  specified offering rate to a wide range of counterparties. 4\n\nThe ON RRP facility helps to  reinforce the floor under market interest rates by providing an outside  investment option to a broad group of nonbank market participants that are not  eligible to earn IOR. 5 We’ve observed that a high volume of actual ON  RRP usage has not been necessary to achieve interest rate control.  In the first half of 2016, for example, average  daily usage of the facility was $63 billion.   In principle, even with zero usage, the ON RRP facility can support market  rates by ensuring that counterparties demand rates on other investments at  least as attractive as the rate offered on the Federal Reserve’s ON RRPs.\n\nThe ON RRP facility also serves as  a flexible shock absorber that helps to maintain interest rate control when transitory  shifts occur in the supply and demand for short-term market instruments.  For example, around key month- and quarter-end  reporting dates, some financial institutions shrink their balance sheets, a  measure that reduces the availability of private money market investments, puts  downward pressure on money market rates, and produces higher ON RRP take-up.  Last fall, the ON RRP facility also helped to  maintain rate control during the implementation of money market fund reform by temporarily  absorbing heightened demand for safe, overnight investments by government money  market funds.\n\nThus, with almost a year and a half  of experience with a federal funds target above the zero lower bound, our current  approach has so far proved to be both effective and resilient to structural  changes in the market.  The new framework  is also quite simple and efficient from an operational perspective.  To fully appreciate this, it’s useful to look  back at the conduct of open market operations before the global financial crisis.\n\nOpen Market Operations in Money Markets Pre-Crisis\n\nPrior to the crisis, the Federal  Reserve’s operational framework was similar to a corridor system based on  reserve scarcity. 6 At that time, the Federal Reserve did not pay  interest on reserves.  Banks’ demand for  reserves balanced the costs of falling short of their reserve requirements  against the opportunity cost of holding too many non-interest-bearing reserves  or of borrowing reserves at a penalty rate.   This trade-off created a steeply downward-sloping demand curve for  reserves (Figure 2) .  Facing that demand  curve, the Desk conducted daily open market operations to bring the system’s aggregate  supply of reserves to a level where it would meet the estimated demand at or  near the FOMC’s target federal funds rate. 7 Active interbank trading distributed these reserves  within the system, between banks with a surplus of reserves and those with a  deficit.\n\nManaging the supply of reserves at  levels that kept the federal funds rate from moving too high or too low was a  technically challenging exercise that required both market knowledge and expert  judgment. 8 Reserve forecasters on the Desk and at the Federal  Reserve Board of Governors projected various elements that could affect the  supply of and demand for reserves over multiple days ahead.  Anticipating changes in the supply of  reserves required a detailed understanding of numerous factors, many of which  were driven by forces outside the control of the Federal Reserve—so-called “autonomous  factors,” such as balances held by the Treasury in its account at the Federal  Reserve or physical U.S. currency held by the public.  To determine the demand for reserves, staff gathered information to estimate banks’ reserve needs  and plans for meeting them over each two-week reserve maintenance period. 9 Using this information, staff planned open  market operations—specifically, overnight and term repurchase agreements, and purchases  of Treasury securities—to affect reserve conditions throughout each maintenance  period.  Uncertainty about various  factors, such as swings in banks’ clearing needs, meant that fluctuations in  banks’ demand for reserves could not be completely forecasted, especially on a  daily basis, but even predictable variations resulted in the need for open market  operations on most days.\n\nIn normal times, we were reliably  proficient in hitting the FOMC’s target rate.   However, interest rate control was more challenging at times when  autonomous factors or the demand for reserves was harder to predict.  These challenges were particularly acute during  the early stages of the financial crisis, when large changes in reserve demand caused  significant intraday swings in federal funds rates. 10 A framework based on actively managing the  supply of reserves was, from an operational perspective, also a discretionary and  interventionist approach, albeit one that required only small adjustments on  most days.  Moreover, the pre-crisis framework created costly  cash management regimes for banks, which had to meet reserve requirements and  avoid overnight overdrafts in an environment with reserve scarcity and the high  opportunity costs entailed by holding reserves.\n\nOpen Market Operations in Money Markets Today The Desk’s role now is quite  different.  With reserve balances far in  excess of banks’ reserve requirements, the Desk cannot meaningfully influence  the federal funds rate by changing the supply of reserves, so the Federal  Reserve achieves control over the federal funds rate by setting rates on  various central bank liabilities.\n\nThe Desk’s operational charge for maintaining  the federal funds rate in the FOMC’s target range is now centered on running the  ON RRP facility.  On a daily basis, the  Desk auctions ON RRPs at an offering rate and aggregate offering limit set by the  FOMC.  The operation is based on price,  not quantity, so there is nothing to forecast ahead of time. 11 Market forces then keep the federal funds  rate within the FOMC’s target range by pricing private trades against the  alternative option of investing with the Federal Reserve, rather than by having  interbank trading redistribute reserves throughout the system, as it did before  the crisis.  However, this approach  relies on the Desk maintaining a larger and more heterogeneous set of counterparty  relationships than before the crisis.\n\nWe support this framework with  substantial market analysis, but the nature of the analysis has changed.  The current framework does not require  high-frequency forecasts of factors affecting the supply of and demand for reserves.   Instead, we analyze trading dynamics and  relationships among a broad set of market participants to build knowledge about  how our tools affect private sector trading incentives and how market developments  might affect policy implementation.  This  knowledge helps us to better understand the first steps in the transmission of the  monetary policy stance, to assess the efficacy of policy implementation, and to  provide advice on how the Federal Reserve could adjust the framework and tools  if needed to ensure they remain effective. 12\n\nWhat Could the Monetary Policy Implementation Framework Look Like in  the Future?\n\nThe current framework was developed  as a means for the Federal Reserve to normalize the stance of monetary policy after  the extraordinary balance sheet expansion that was undertaken in the aftermath  of the crisis, but policymakers have begun to consider what framework to use in  the longer run. 13 In a preliminary discussion about the long-run  monetary policy implementation framework held in November 2016, FOMC  participants commented on the advantages of an approach to policy  implementation similar to the one currently in use, in which active management  of the supply of reserves would not be required.  They noted that such an approach could be compatible  with a balance sheet that was much smaller than the current one, though likely at  least somewhat larger than the pre-crisis balance sheet.  Such an approach was seen as “likely to be relatively  simple and efficient to administer, relatively straightforward to communicate,  and effective in enabling interest rate control across a wide range of  circumstances.” 14 However, policymakers made no decisions on  these issues and acknowledged that they expected to learn from additional  experience before making such judgments.\n\nIn the meantime, I believe it is  important that we continue to consider what a “new normal” might look like in  order to ensure operational and analytical readiness—just as we spent several  years preparing to raise the federal funds rate away from zero by expanding  counterparties, developing and testing ON RRPs and various types of term reserve-draining  operations, and enhancing our collection of data on money market activity.\n\nWhat Might the Balance Sheet and Open Market Operations Look Like in  the Future?\n\nThe FOMC’s statement on Policy  Normalization Principles and Plans notes that in the long-run, the FOMC intends  to “hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy  efficiently and effectively.”  It is challenging  to determine far in advance what balance sheet size would accomplish this  objective.  However, it is probable that the  normalized balance sheet will be considerably larger than its pre-crisis level,  even before considering the volume of reserves that the FOMC would decide to  supply.  The reason is that recent growth  trends in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities will augment the  necessary size of the normalized balance sheet independent of the operational  framework adopted by the FOMC in the long run.   To understand this point, it’s useful to consider the liability side of the  Federal Reserve’s current balance sheet (Figure 3) .\n\nFirst, currency in circulation—a  central bank’s traditional liability—remains a large and growing balance sheet  item.  Federal Reserve notes outstanding  have nearly doubled since the start of the crisis, with a current level of  about $1.5 trillion, implying that currency demand alone requires a much larger  balance sheet than before the crisis.  A  simple assumption is that U.S. currency in circulation will grow in line with  nominal U.S. GDP growth.  However, it is easy  to imagine shocks that could materially affect currency growth, either positively  or negatively.  For example, with heavy  usage of U.S. paper currency overseas, demand for dollars appears sensitive to  changes in global growth and financial and geopolitical stability. 15 In addition, it is hard to know what  longer-term implications financial technology will have for currency demand.\n\nSecond, the U.S. Treasury holds  cash balances at the Federal Reserve in the Treasury General Account (TGA), its  primary “checking account.”  Before the  crisis, Treasury targeted a TGA balance of $5 billion on most days; those balances  increased during the global financial crisis.   In May 2015, the Treasury announced plans to hold a level of cash  generally sufficient to cover one week of outflows to help protect against a  potential interruption in market access. 16 Since that cash management policy went into  effect, TGA balances have averaged around $250 billion, reaching as high as $440  billion.\n\nThird, designated financial market  utilities (DFMUs) can now establish and hold cash deposits in Reserve Bank  accounts. 17 The buildup of DFMU balances has prompted “other  deposits” on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to grow steadily over recent years to a current level of about $85  billion, compared to a pre-crisis average of less than $1 billion.  The other deposits category also includes balances  held by GSEs and international and multilateral organizations. 18\n\nFourth, the Federal Reserve has  long offered an overnight repurchase agreement investment to foreign official  and international account holders—a service known as the foreign repo pool.  The foreign repo pool has grown from an  average level of around $30 billion before the crisis to an average of about $250  billion now.  The rise reflects foreign central  banks’ preferences to maintain robust dollar liquidity buffers, reduced  availability of alternative low-risk investment options with private  counterparties, and the New York Fed’s removal of constraints on account  holders’ ability to vary the size of their investments.\n\nIn projecting the size of the  normalized balance sheet, one can make assumptions about the long-run trends  that will determine future levels for each of these non-reserve liabilities,  subject to various kinds of uncertainty.   Even taken at today’s levels, the TGA, other deposits, and the foreign  repo pool alone account for about $600 billion of the Federal Reserve’s current  balance sheet size.  Adding on currency  outstanding brings this set of non-reserve liabilities to $2.1 trillion today,  and this set is likely to grow as the economy continues to expand.  This sum does not yet consider reserves or ON  RRPs.\n\nThe ON RRP facility, which has averaged  around $165 billion this year, is another non-reserve liability that one might need  to factor into balance sheet projections.   The FOMC has said that it plans to phase out the ON RRP facility when it  is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.  However, as mentioned earlier, the facility  has been a useful shock absorber amid structural changes in money markets, and  it may be that some such facility would be helpful in maintaining effective  interest rate control should the FOMC decide to remain in a floor system in the  longer run.  Of course, a decision to  maintain an ON RRP facility would require longer-term choices about  counterparty relationships and consideration of possible financial stability  risks. 19\n\nFinally, to complete projections  for the normalized size of the balance sheet, we must consider reserve balances,  currently the Federal Reserve’s largest liability.  Two components will help shape the long-run  level of reserve balances:  banks’ demand  for reserves and what, if any, additional supply of reserves might be deemed  appropriate for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.\n\nThe precise shape and position of banks’  demand curve is not currently known, but we generally understand the key forces  that are likely to influence it.  Changes  in bank liquidity regulation and supervision since the crisis will be  particularly important. 20 In this new environment, we will need to  consider the relative attractiveness of rates paid on reserves and close  substitutes, such as Treasury securities, as well as banks’ propensity to  substitute between these assets in meeting their liquidity requirements.  Other characteristics of reserves may boost  their inherent appeal—for example, intraday liquidity that supports clearing  and settlement activities, or perceptions that holding reserves makes an  institution safer.  These factors are likely  to contribute to higher and more variable demand for reserves than banks had  before the crisis.  If the demand curve  for reserve balances has indeed shifted out, then a greater supply of reserves  will be needed to attain a given interest rate target.\n\nMoreover, it is important to take  into account how uncertainty and increased variability in the non-reserve liabilities  I’ve discussed could warrant an additional supply of reserves (Figure 4) .  For example, TGA balances exhibit significant  day-to-day variation stemming from the settlement of securities and the receipt  of tax payments.  All else equal, changes  in non-reserve liabilities have the opposite effect on the supply of  reserves.  What these variations will  mean for the amount of reserves the Federal Reserve decides to supply—and also  for the size of the normalized balance sheet and the types of open market  operations that will be employed—will depend heavily on the operational framework  the FOMC chooses in the longer run.\n\nTo remain in a floor system, the  Federal Reserve would need to supply enough reserves to satisfy bank demand  along the flat portion of the reserves demand curve.  It would also need to ensure that even amid  shocks to non-reserve liabilities, the supply of reserves would stay on the flat  part of the demand curve.  There are  essentially three ways to accomplish that objective.  First, as in the past, the Federal Reserve could  establish limits for the overall size of or daily variations in non-reserve account  balances.  Second, the Desk could carry  out open market operations to offset fluctuations in reserve-absorbing factors,  similar to what we did in our pre-crisis framework but at a lower frequency.  Third, the balance sheet could include an  additional buffer of excess reserves sufficient to ensure that most shocks  would still leave us safely to the right of the steep part of the demand curve.  Providing this additional buffer would  require that the Federal Reserve retain a corresponding amount of assets.\n\nAn important trade-off in a floor  system arises between the size of that additional buffer and the frequency and  size of open market operations.  In the  current floor framework, the buffer is more than large enough to absorb shocks without  the need to conduct offsetting open market operations.  In fact, the level of reserve balances has  fluctuated by as much as $700 billion since the start of 2016 with no material impact  on federal funds market dynamics.  To  project the balance sheet’s long-run size, one could try to estimate the size  of a conservative buffer by examining the distribution of changes in currency, the  TGA, other deposits, and the foreign repo pool.  Data since January 2016 suggest an additional  buffer of reserves of about $145 billion would absorb 99 percent of changes in  the daily average holdings of these liabilities from week to week (Figure 4) .  Accounting for variability in ON RRPs could  add another $215 billion to the buffer. 21\n\nIn a floor system with a buffer  that would sufficiently accommodate swings in non-reserve liabilities, IOR  would continue to be the primary tool to maintain interest rate control,  perhaps supported by ON RRPs if needed.   In addition, the Federal Reserve would still need to conduct some reserve-adding  open market operations, but only periodically, to accommodate trend growth of  balance sheet items like currency; otherwise, the quantity of reserves would  eventually be smaller than that needed for efficient and effective policy  implementation.\n\nHowever, if the FOMC wanted to  maintain a somewhat smaller balance sheet, it might prefer to operate a floor  system with a smaller buffer.  In this  case, the Desk would have to use regular reserve-adding open market operations  to offset transitory shocks to reserve-absorbing factors in addition to secular  trends.  The smaller the buffer, the more  the Desk’s operational schedule and supporting analysis would need to focus on  short-run changes in demand for the Federal Reserve’s liabilities.\n\nReturning to a corridor system, in  which we operate on the steep part of the demand curve, would mean an even  smaller balance sheet.  Daily forecasting  and frequent open market operations would once again be required to manage the supply  of reserves in the face of either reserve-adding or reserve-absorbing shocks in  order to maintain interest rate control.\n\nOne could put together all of these  elements—one’s projected levels for the range of non-reserve liabilities and assumptions  about the supply of reserves—to arrive  at some rough estimates of the range of balance sheet sizes that would be  required under these different operational frameworks. 22 However, the uncertainties surrounding these  factors at this stage are very large.  Furthermore,  the variability of these factors over time suggests that the size of the  balance sheet that best balances the trade-offs will evolve as the structure of  money markets and other factors change.  In  practice, it will likely be necessary for the Federal Reserve to closely monitor  the behavior of money markets as its balance sheet shrinks, and to use that information  to enhance our understanding of the evolution of the demand for reserves and  the other, non-reserve liabilities.\n\nHow Might We Know When We Are Getting Close to a Normalized Balance  Sheet Size?\n\nThe FOMC is currently maintaining  the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by reinvesting payments of  principal on its securities holdings and has said that it anticipates  continuing to do so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate  is well underway.  When the FOMC reduces  its securities holdings, the supply of reserves will also shrink.  As that process occurs, understanding evolving  money market dynamics and the structure of the reserves market will be a  central component of the Desk’s analytical agenda—regardless of whether the  FOMC decides to remain in a floor system or return to a corridor system.  A key focus for interest rate control will be  assessing the shape and position of the reserve demand curve and interpreting financial  market conditions to gauge how far we are from the steep portion of it.  Our thinking on this is still evolving, but  let me offer a few thoughts.\n\nUpward pressure on overnight  interest rates is the most direct indicator that reserves are becoming scarce.  If the FOMC were to return to a corridor  system, this would be the main indicator we would need.  An increase in rates would likely suggest that  reserve supply had moved onto the steep part of the demand curve, exhibiting  the desired reserve scarcity that is associated with this type of operational  framework.  In assessing when to stop  reducing the balance sheet to remain in a floor system, however, upward  pressure on rates might not be as useful an indicator.  Although brief increases in rates might not be  materially adverse, a longer-lasting rise in rates would be a sign that  reserves had already become scarcer  than needed to maintain interest rate control.  Thus, for a floor system, it will be important  to develop and assess more forward-looking indicators to signal impending  reserve scarcity.\n\nData from the Federal Reserve’s Report of Selected Money Market Rates (FR  2420) provide visibility into transactions in a range of unsecured funding  markets and could be leveraged to develop some such indicators.  Changes in the distribution of traded funding  rates or in the nature of trading in the federal funds market might be signs that conditions  in money markets were becoming more directly influenced by the amount of reserves.   For example, most market activity today  is characterized by banks borrowing from nonbanks to earn IOR.  As reserves are reduced, a shift towards banks  borrowing reserves to cover unexpected shortfalls could be a sign of mounting  reserve scarcity.  Banks needing to cover  shortfalls might borrow from nonbanks at rates closer to IOR or from banks,  likely at rates above IOR (since banks are unlikely to lend reserves at a rate  below what they could earn if they left the funds in their reserve account). 23\n\nMonitoring correlations between  trade volumes and rates might also be informative.  Higher volumes accompanied by lower rates—a  negative correlation—could suggest an increase in arbitrage activity as banks  try to earn the spread between market rates and IOR, while a positive  correlation between volumes and rates could indicate that banks need to borrow  reserves at relatively high rates at the end of the day to cover reserve  shortfalls. 24\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up:  The Federal Reserve’s framework for implementing  monetary policy has evolved quite substantially since the financial crisis. The  unique floor system we’ve adopted to influence short-term interest rates, which  uses interest on reserves and overnight reverse repos as support, has given the  FOMC excellent control of the federal funds rate and supported efficient  transmission to other money market rates.\n\nIn the longer run, the Federal  Reserve could choose to retain the floor system to implement monetary policy or  shift back to a corridor system.  Under either  operational framework, the balance sheet would decline significantly from its  current size, but remain substantially larger than it was pre-crisis in order  to accommodate its non-reserve liabilities and to supply an appropriate  quantity of reserves.  Moreover, the balance  sheet’s size will change over time, driven by changes in longer-run demand for various  Federal Reserve liabilities.\n\nIf the Committee remains in a floor  system, the Federal Reserve will need to supply enough reserves to satisfy  demand along the flat portion of the reserve demand curve plus, perhaps, an  additional buffer to absorb variability in demand for non-reserve liabilities.  These considerations would contribute to a  larger balance sheet than in a corridor system.   The size of the buffer would influence the need to conduct open market  operations to offset temporary shocks, so policymakers would need to consider a  trade-off between a larger balance sheet that accommodates this buffer and the  complexity associated with more active forecasting and open market operations.\n\nOnce the Committee begins to reduce  the balance sheet, we will track market dynamics to gauge the impact of  declining reserve balances. Given the uniqueness of the current operational  framework and the substantial ongoing changes in money markets, this task will  present an interesting challenge for the staff, and one that we are preparing  for as we carry out our operational and analytical responsibilities.\n\nThank you.  I would be happy to answer any questions.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Good morning, and thank you to the  Brookings Institution-Chicago Booth Task Force on Financial Stability for  convening this discussion on such a critical topic. This has been a year marked  by tremendous human suffering related to the pandemic and unprecedented  challenges for the global economy and financial markets. The events that  unfolded in March and April underscored the importance of understanding market  functioning and liquidity so that financial markets continue to serve their  important role in supporting the economy. 1\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the  global financial system experienced an extraordinary shock, triggered by the coronavirus  pandemic. Asset prices adjusted sharply, reflecting increasing pessimism and  uncertainty about the economic outlook as large segments of the economy began  to shut down. A spike in financial market volatility, combined with concerns  about markets’ ability to function in a remote work environment, resulted in a surge  in the demand for cash.\n\nThe Federal Reserve took swift and  decisive action in response to both the shift in the economic outlook and  deteriorating conditions in financial markets. 2 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cut the target range for the federal  funds rate close to zero, and directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) to  conduct repo operations and purchases of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed  securities (MBS) to support the smooth functioning of these markets. The  Federal Reserve undertook a wide range of additional steps—many in coordination  with the U.S. Treasury—to support the flow of credit to households, businesses,  and state and local governments. Regulations were also temporarily adjusted to  encourage bank lending. These  comprehensive actions, alongside swift passage of the CARES Act to support the  U.S. economy, were essential for stabilizing U.S. financial markets and  averting an even deeper collapse in economic activity.\n\nThe disruption in the U.S. Treasury  market was especially notable, as measures of market functioning deteriorated  at unparalleled speed to levels not seen since the Global Financial Crisis. The  Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid fixed-income market in the world.  It serves as a critical benchmark for all other dollar fixed-income markets,  both in the U.S. and abroad, including the mortgage, corporate debt, and  municipal bond markets that are essential to the flow of credit. Given the  importance of the Treasury market, continued dysfunction could have led to an  even deeper and broader seizing-up of credit and ultimately worsened the economic  hardships that many Americans have been experiencing.\n\nThe Desk initially responded to the  severe dysfunction by expanding repo operations, and then, at the direction of  the FOMC, by buying a substantial quantity of Treasury securities and agency  MBS. The FOMC then demonstrated a more forceful commitment by directing the  Desk to purchase these securities “in the amounts needed” to support smooth  functioning of these markets. The speed and scale of these actions—and the  flexibility with which they were deployed—stabilized and eventually restored market  functioning, and in June the FOMC transitioned the objective of purchases to sustaining smooth market functioning. During  the period from March to June, the Federal Reserve purchased a total of around $1.6  trillion of Treasuries and $700 billion of agency MBS, as shown in Figure 1 . 3\n\nIn recent months, the public and  private sectors initiated broad-based efforts to better understand the dynamics  that led to the Treasury market dislocation in March and April. Ongoing research  is helping shape our views of what happened, and last month the New York Fed, along  with other Joint Member Agencies, co-hosted the sixth annual U.S. Treasury Market  Conference. 4 Participants  focused on the causes of the Treasury market disruption and potential measures  that could be taken to ensure the market’s resilience going forward.\n\nToday, I want to share some observations  from our experience executing open market operations on the Desk during this  period, and from the developing body of research and discussions. I would note that  the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of  the New York Fed or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Have I Taken Away  from the Data and Research So Far?\n\nData and developing research offer  perspective on important elements of the events of last spring. Though many  aspects of what occurred warrant further study, I would like to focus my  remarks on insights that the data and research provide about the exceptional desire  to sell Treasury securities, and the capacity of the Treasury market  infrastructure to manage these flows.\n\nOn the Desk, we certainly heard  from our contacts and observed in the data available to us at the time that  there was an extraordinary volume of selling by Treasury investors. Since then,  data have confirmed that the size of those sales was unprecedented. As shown in Figure 2 , customer transaction  volumes reported by primary dealers spiked from an average level of around $400  billion per day in February to a peak of around $650 billion per day in mid-March—an  increase of more than 50 percent. The more granular data from the Trade  Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) confirm that the size of the risk being  transferred was exceptional. The top half of Figure 3 shows the volume of daily customer sales of off-the-run Treasury  securities expressed in “10-year equivalents,” a measure of the dollar amount  of securities normalized by their interest rate risk. 5 The bottom half shows customer purchases, net of the Federal Reserve’s  purchases. The difference between these, in red, highlights the extraordinary degree  of market liquidity being demanded by customers.\n\nWe also observed in March and April  that these sales of Treasury securities were coming from a wide range of investors. While some commentary since then has  focused on the role of certain investor types and strategies, recent data and work  by academics help to dimension the broad-based nature of the selling. 6\n\nMutual funds appear to have sold in  exceptionally large volumes, as these funds monetized their most liquid asset holdings  to prepare for potential redemptions and rebalance their portfolios. As shown  in Figure 4 , net sales of Treasuries  by domestic mutual funds totaled almost $200 billion in the first quarter, the  largest quarterly decline on record. 7\n\nForeign official accounts, some of  which were raising funds to meet actual and anticipated local needs for U.S.  dollars, were also large net sellers, as shown by data from official accounts  held at the New York Fed depicted in Figure 5 . According to data from the Federal Reserve’s Financial Accounts of the  United States, shown in Figure 6 , foreign  accounts, both official and private, sold a meaningful amount of Treasuries in  the first quarter, although these data also include funds that operate in the  U.S. but are domiciled offshore.\n\nThere has been significant attention  on hedge fund sales of Treasury securities, and whether these amplified the stresses  in the Treasury market. We heard in March and April that the sharp increase in  volatility and futures margins resulted in relative value funds and other levered  strategies reducing their positions. 8 According to the U.S. Financial Accounts data, net sales of Treasury securities  by households—a category that includes private investors domiciled in the U.S.—were  notable in the first quarter, shown in Figure 7 . 9 We also observed that the reduction in net short positions in Treasury futures held  by levered accounts accelerated sharply in March, as shown in Figure 8 . Some research papers  attribute a significant degree of the stress to hedge funds unwinding cash-futures  basis positions, while others question whether these strategies were a meaningful  contributor to the dynamics. 10 This is difficult to judge, in large part because the available data on hedge  fund holdings and transactions are incomplete. In the context of broad-based  selling pressure, though, I think of these sales as an important contributing  factor, but not the sole source of the challenges.\n\nIn addition to giving greater  insight into the historic size and breadth of sales, data and recent research shed  light on how the Treasury market responded to these extraordinary flows.\n\nBefore diving into this, I’d like  to start with some background on the ecosystem of Treasury market intermediation.  Broadly speaking, trading takes place in two separate but connected market segments:  the dealer-to-client segment, where dealers transact with end-investors, and  the interdealer segment, which is generally comprised of dealers and principal  trading firms, or “PTFs,” trading with one another in the most liquid  securities and largely on electronic limit order books. 11 The interdealer segment is critical to the intermediation process, as it allows  participants to manage risk and adjust positions rapidly and serves as an  important source of price discovery in Treasuries. These features support the intermediation  of customer flows and the smooth functioning of the Treasury market overall. 12\n\nOur observations in March and April  were that these intermediation channels became highly strained. The data show that  dealers entered March with inventories of Treasury securities that were already  high by historical standards, and, as depicted in Figure 9 , those inventories grew as investors sold securities. Our conversations  with dealers suggest that, amid a sharp increase in perceived risk, it became  increasingly challenging to hold these positions and absorb new ones. In March,  volatility in Treasury markets soared to levels not seen since the Global Financial  Crisis, as shown in Figure 10 . 13 Heightened volatility increases the risk that dealers face in intermediating  markets, as prices have greater potential to move during the period between the  purchase and sale of securities. In this environment, dealers noted that risk  measures rose sharply, and many suggested that internal risk management processes  developed to ensure compliance with regulations limited the nimbleness with  which they could respond to rapidly evolving circumstances.\n\nIn an environment of extraordinary  volatility and large Treasury sales, the terms on which dealers were willing to  make markets deteriorated sharply. For example, in less liquid off-the-run Treasury  securities, bid-ask spreads, which are a measure of the price that investors  pay to transact, rose to almost 30 times their normal levels and reached  historic wides, as shown in Figure 11 .\n\nDeteriorating conditions in the  interdealer market likely exacerbated the challenges that dealers faced  providing market liquidity to their customers by limiting their ability to efficiently  manage risk. As highlighted in a recent note by Federal Reserve economists  Dobrislav Dobrev and Andrew Meldrum, market depth in on-the-run Treasury securities  fell dramatically compared to typical levels, and standing orders near the top  of the order book on electronic systems were not replenished rapidly enough to  keep pace with increased trading volumes. Figure 12 , reproduced from their note, illustrates this sharp drop in  market depth, showing the top level and top three levels of the order book on a  normal day, on the left, and on a highly stressed day in mid-March, on the  right. 14 , 15 Liquidity providers in this market—both dealers and PTFs—faced high and  unpredictable volatility and flows that made it riskier to maintain or quickly restore  standing orders. Overall, PTFs, which are more thinly capitalized and do not  typically hold positions overnight, appear to have reduced the competitiveness  of their intermediation to a somewhat greater degree, as their share of transaction  volume fell, depicted in Figure 13 . 16\n\nNonetheless, it seems important to  note that while the terms on which Treasuries were intermediated deteriorated  dramatically, a much higher-than-normal volume of private transactions still  occurred. So, while liquidity was severely strained, the volume that  intermediaries were managing was still quite high, even in the less liquid  market segments such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and  off-the-run Treasury securities.\n\nIn sum, I interpret the work to date  as confirming our observations at the time that unprecedented demand for cash led  to selling that was historic in size and broad-based in nature. Intermediation  activity expanded, but was unable to keep pace, and the market came under severe  strain. As a result, the Fed stepped in to buy securities at unprecedented  scale and speed, ultimately restoring and sustaining effective market  functioning.\n\nWhat Ideas Have Been Raised  That Could Make the Market More Resilient?\n\nAt the U.S. Treasury Market Conference,  there was an insightful and robust discussion among industry professionals,  academics, and policymakers about Treasury market resilience. 17 While participants acknowledged that there is still much more to learn about  the events of March and April, many shared early ideas on how the resiliency of  this critical market might be enhanced over time.\n\nFinancial  markets are always evolving in response to changes in the environment,  including technology, regulation, and business models. Participants at the  conference noted that, in recent years, we have seen substantial growth in the share  of electronic intermediation, significant changes in the regulation of key  intermediaries, and a meaningful shift in both the outstanding size and holders  of Treasury debt.\n\nParticipants highlighted how each  of these has brought substantive benefits, but may also present new considerations.  Increased volume of electronic trading on central limit order books has  contributed to reductions in transaction costs and lowered barriers to entry  for new liquidity providers. However, available liquidity can diminish in  highly volatile markets, as market makers manage risk and may have less  relationship incentive to maintain liquidity provision on anonymous platforms. Regulations  have enhanced financial stability by making banks and their broker-dealers more  resilient, but conference participants suggested that the manner in which firms  implement regulations may reduce their flexibility to respond to rapidly evolving  conditions.\n\nFinally, participants highlighted  that growth in Treasury issuance has been essential for the U.S. government to  support U.S. households and businesses during the pandemic, but, as Darrell  Duffie noted in a recent paper, ongoing increases in the stock of Treasuries  may result in greater peaks in the demand for intermediation. 18 These peaks may be amplified by the reliance of some investors on Treasuries to  provide liquidity in portfolios with natural liquidity mismatches, and by the  use of leverage in some Treasury investment strategies. 19\n\nI was pleased that conference participants  also offered some early ideas for enhancing the resiliency of the Treasury  market in this evolving environment. Of course, given the complexity associated  with changes to Treasury market infrastructure, I would highlight that these  ideas are preliminary and all would require further analysis.\n\nFirst, several conference  participants suggested that, while Treasury market data has improved markedly  in recent years, continuing to enhance transparency could bolster confidence in  the ability to transact fairly, particularly in volatile markets. 20 For repo markets, providing public data on the opaque uncleared bilateral segment  could improve visibility into the size of levered Treasury positions, and data  on term repo might give market participants more confidence in pricing. In the  Treasury cash market, continuing to refine and increase the availability of the  TRACE data would improve our understanding of the market, including the types  and prevalence of trading strategies and the methods of execution. 21\n\nSecond, conference participants  suggested ways to increase the capacity for and flexibility of liquidity  provision, so the market can manage peaks in liquidity demand. Expanding access  to trading venues and central clearing were both highlighted as potential ideas.  Increased central clearing can help market participants manage settlement risk and  facilitate more efficient balance sheet usage, and may also pave the way for  more direct trading among Treasury market participants. 22 , 23 Separately, several conference participants thought it might be helpful to explore  whether adjustments to certain regulations might enhance banks’ flexibility,  while still maintaining their resiliency.\n\nThird, and finally, participants highlighted  steps that could help stem the volume of sales during periods of high  volatility and stress. Several indicated that greater uniformity or enhanced  transparency in margin practices could reduce the need for funds employing certain  levered trading strategies to unwind positions amid higher volatility. In  addition, some thought further study may be warranted on the role of nonbank  financial institutions in this market. With regard to the Federal Reserve,  participants suggested that existing repo backstops could be fortified, as  these facilities provide confidence in the liquidity of Treasuries, thus reducing  the need for outright Treasury sales during stress events. 24\n\nConclusion\n\nIn sum, the pandemic created  exceptional uncertainty about the economic outlook and concern about financial  market functioning, resulting in an intense demand for cash. This desire to  raise cash rapidly, combined with extraordinary financial market volatility,  resulted in an unprecedented volume of Treasury sales and stresses in the  Treasury market. In response, the Federal Reserve stepped in to support the smooth  functioning of this vital market in order to maintain the flow of credit to  U.S. households and businesses.\n\nThis was truly an exceptional  event. However, while it is tempting to dismiss it as a once-in-a-lifetime shock,  it is important to take time to reflect and assess if lessons can be learned  that could make the Treasury market even more resilient to future shocks. The situations  that require policy intervention should be extraordinarily rare.\n\nIn this regard, I have been heartened  by the energy that academics, industry professionals, and public sector  officials have brought to understanding the underlying drivers of the stress in  March and April. The developing research and discussions are already producing  vital insights, and I encourage continued engagement on these issues. I also look  forward to working together with other agencies and industry professionals to explore  ways to enhance the resilience of the U.S. Treasury market, so that it  continues to be the deepest and most liquid fixed-income market in the world.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to the discussion.\n\nFigures",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nWelcome to  this year’s primary dealer meeting.  Primary  dealers play several important roles as trading counterparties in the  implementation of monetary policy, as participants in Treasury auctions, and as  providers of information on financial markets.   These annual meetings provide us an opportunity to strengthen this  relationship and communicate our expectations.  We also have a shared interest in ensuring  that markets function efficiently, effectively, and fairly.  To help achieve these goals, the official  sector employs a variety of channels, including legal, regulatory, and  supervisory.  Additionally, officials  work with market participants to help guide private-sector solutions.  Today, I will speak about our shared efforts  in the reform of reference interest rates, focusing the discussion on the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s (New York Fed) part as an administrator and  producer of reference rates.  The views  presented here are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of the New  York Fed or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nResponding to LIBOR’s Uncertain Future\n\nReference  rates serve a number of purposes in financial markets.  They facilitate trading in standardized  contracts, which can lower transaction costs and improve market liquidity.  They can reduce information asymmetries by  providing a transparent, independent pricing source.  A robust and reliable reference rate can also  reduce moral hazard by limiting incentives to misreport pricing for settling a  contract.  However, a reference rate that  is not well designed may increase moral hazard by creating incentives to  manipulate the rate. 2\n\nNo reference  rate is more ubiquitous than the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  U.S. dollar LIBOR is estimated to be  referenced in $150 to $200 trillion of financial contracts, including loans,  interest rate swaps, and mortgage-backed securities. 3 Many market participants, including the  primary dealer community gathered here today, have exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR.  However, as Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  Chief Executive Andrew Bailey noted in a speech last July, the lack of activity  in the wholesale unsecured funding markets that underlie LIBOR means the  sustainability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed. 4 In fact, existing LIBOR panel banks have only  agreed with the FCA to support LIBOR through the end of 2021. 5 While U.S. dollar LIBOR may exist past 2021,  prudent risk management implies preparing for a world without it.\n\nFor several  years, the Federal Reserve—in conjunction with others in the official sector—has  supported private-sector efforts to identify viable alternatives to U.S. dollar  LIBOR, reduce reliance on LIBOR, and strengthen financial contracts to better  address the risk of a cessation of LIBOR.   Until relatively recently, this work has focused on the interest rate  derivatives market, which represents a very large proportion of total gross  notional exposure to LIBOR.  But, as  Governor Powell noted in a speech in November, the risks to LIBOR highlighted by  Andrew Bailey emphasize the need for all participants in the markets where  LIBOR currently is referenced to seriously consider how best to transition away  from its use. 6\n\nFurther, as  you are aware from previous meetings, in 2016 the Treasury Market Practices  Group (TMPG) incorporated recommendations in its Best Practices that market  participants should understand their vulnerabilities in using financial  benchmarks.  The TMPG recommends that  where current benchmarks are inconsistent with the Principles for Financial Benchmarks ( Principles ) published by the International Organization of  Securities Commissions (IOSCO), market participants should develop plans to use  alternative benchmarks that are consistent with the Principles . 7, 8 It is important that market participants  fully assess their exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR given both its weaknesses as a  benchmark and the risk that it may not always be published, and that they take  steps to mitigate their exposure by adopting more robust contract language and  transitioning to alternative rates.\n\nThis past June,  the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) selected an overnight Treasury  repo reference rate that the New York Fed plans to produce—the secured  overnight financing rate (SOFR)—as “best practice for use in certain new U.S.  dollar derivatives and other financial contracts”. 9, 10 The ARRC’s selection of this rate is part of the  motivation behind my comments on the New York Fed’s role as an administrator  and producer of reference rates.\n\nOver the  last two years, the New York Fed has enhanced the calculation of the effective  federal funds rate (EFFR) and launched an entirely new rate, the overnight bank  funding rate (OBFR).  We also announced  plans to begin producing three Treasury repo reference rates, including the SOFR  that was selected by the ARRC.  At the  core of these developments are investments the Federal Reserve has made in all  aspects of the administration and production of reference rates to ensure that our  rates are reliable measures of market activity.   These rates are anchored in active underlying markets, are based on a  comprehensive set of transactions that incorporate controls to mitigate risk of  errors and manipulation, and are capable of being published every day, even in  adverse circumstances.\n\nThe New York  Fed produces reference rates primarily to inform monetary policy implementation  by developing a better understanding of money market dynamics and to aid market  functioning by providing transparency.  For  example, collecting the transaction-level data necessary for producing robust  reference rates enhances the Federal Reserve’s ability to analyze market  developments.  While we have not historically  produced rates with the explicit goal of having them referenced in financial  contracts, we understand that they often are used that way. 11 And, we are committed to the continued  production of durable rates that market participants can have confidence in  over the long run.\n\nIn the  remainder of my remarks, I will first describe the improvements the New York  Fed has made to our production process and how those improvements ensure that  the rates we produce today are reliable.  I will then discuss how our three new rates  will help deepen our understanding of money market dynamics and provide  transparency for secured money markets.  Finally,  I will address how we plan to maintain the relevance and reliability of our  reference rates as markets evolve.\n\nEvolution of the Effective Federal Funds Rate\n\nAdministering  and producing reference rates is not a new activity for the New York Fed.  Daily calculation of the EFFR dates back at  least to the 1950s.  Today, changing the  target range for the federal funds rate is the Federal Open Market Committee’s  (FOMC) primary means of communicating adjustments in the stance of monetary policy,  and the EFFR serves as a measure to assess whether conditions in money markets  are consistent with the policy stance.   However, when the New York Fed first produced the EFFR, the federal  funds rate was not the FOMC’s policy target. 12 Like the OBFR today and our forthcoming repo  rates, the EFFR served as a useful indicator of conditions in an important  money market.\n\nFrom the  1950s until early 2016, the EFFR was calculated as a volume-weighted mean based  on data collected voluntarily from federal funds brokers.  While we continue to be confident in the  integrity of the EFFR production process employed during those years, the  international focus on best practices in the production of reference rates following  revelations about the manipulation of LIBOR hastened our efforts to review all  aspects of the EFFR production process.  This  review included an assessment of whether the EFFR could be strengthened by  switching to a more robust data source that better reflected activity in the  federal funds market, and whether a volume-weighted mean remained the most  appropriate measure of central tendency.\n\nAs a result,  in March 2016, we began calculating the EFFR using the Report of Selected Money  Market Rates (the FR 2420 report), which collects transaction-level data directly  from a large set of domestic banks and agencies of foreign banks operating in  the United States. 13, 14 The FR 2420 report offers a wider breadth of  market coverage, higher transaction volumes, and more granular information for  better data monitoring than the brokered data used previously.  At the same time, the measure of central  tendency employed was switched to a volume-weighted median, after analysis  indicated a median is less likely to be materially impacted by erroneous data  and outliers than a volume-weighted mean. 15, 16\n\nAdditional changes  were implemented to further strengthen the EFFR.  We invested in a sophisticated production  platform to ensure a well-controlled end-to-end production process, from collection  of the data to rate calculation and publication.  We refined our framework for regular review  by oversight bodies, and enhanced our ethics and conflict-of-interest policies  for staff involved in reference rate production.  We also put in place a resilient backup production  process—including geographic dispersion of staff and platforms involved in data  collection, administration, and publication—and developed a data contingency  plan that features a backup source of transaction data.\n\nReflecting  our commitment to producing rates aligned with international best practices, we  will publish a statement for all reference rates the New York Fed administers  and produces documenting their compliance with IOSCO’s Principles .  We anticipate  publishing such a statement for the EFFR and OBFR in the next few weeks, and we  will release similar documentation of compliance with IOSCO’s Principles for the three planned  Treasury repo rates likely around the time of their initial publication.\n\nDevelopment of a New Overnight Bank Funding  Rate\n\nAs we worked  to enhance production of the EFFR, we also developed the OBFR—the New York  Fed’s first reference rate designed from the outset to be compliant with IOSCO’s Principles .  The OBFR was created to increase the amount  and quality of publicly-available information about overnight unsecured funding  costs of U.S.-based banks.  The OBFR is  calculated using both federal funds and Eurodollar transactions, as reported in  the FR 2420 report. 17, 18 Many U.S.-based banks are active in the federal  funds and Eurodollar markets, so having a measure of borrowing costs across  both markets provides a more complete picture of overnight unsecured borrowing  costs than looking at the federal funds market alone.\n\nWhen we  launched the OBFR in the first quarter of 2016, daily Eurodollar volume was in  excess of $200 billion.  Today, however, volume  is nearly 50 percent lower.  The decline  largely reflects two factors: less investment by prime money market funds, and  a substitution from offshore to onshore wholesale deposits by some banks.  The former is a function of the more than $1  trillion decline in prime money market fund assets under management in 2016 associated  with the implementation of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) money  market fund reforms. 19 The latter reflects some U.S.-based banks  shifting from taking deposits in their Caribbean branches to taking similar  deposits onshore. 20 Eurodollar deposits currently are captured in  the FR 2420 report, and included in the OBFR.   However, onshore wholesale deposits are not captured.  The Federal Reserve is considering enhancing  the FR 2420 report to capture such “onshore Eurodollar” deposits, where the  motivation, counterparty, and pricing are similar to the Eurodollar deposits  included in the FR 2420 report.  If these  transactions are collected in the FR 2420 report, we will consider including  them in the OBFR as well.\n\nConsistent  with our ongoing analysis of the scope of transactions underlying the OBFR, creating  a durable reference rate that is reliable over the long run involves some need  for flexibility.  Financial markets are  not static; they evolve.  And, for a  reference rate to remain relevant over the long run, it must have the  flexibility to evolve with the market that underlies it.  Of course, changing the calculation of a rate  too frequently may create excessive volatility and uncertainty as to exactly  what the rate measures, potentially contributing to a loss of confidence in the  integrity of the rate.  For this reason,  we believe it is important to be clear in describing what each reference rate  we produce is meant to measure.  We do  not wish to make frequent changes to the rates we produce, but we are committed  to making necessary ones.\n\nExpanding Production to Treasury Repo Rates\n\nSecured  markets—the Treasury repo market in particular—also play a critical role in the  efficient functioning of financial markets and the implementation of monetary  policy. 21 However, historically there have been limited  data available to the public on the Treasury repo market. 22 In November 2016, the New York Fed announced  that, in cooperation with the Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Research  (OFR), we were considering publishing three reference rates based on overnight  Treasury repo transactions to improve repo market transparency.  Publication of these rates should improve  market functioning and our insight into monetary policy implementation.  Additionally, the ARRC had expressed interest  in a repo rate produced by the public sector as a possible alternative to U.S.  dollar LIBOR. 23\n\nWhy Produce Three Treasury Repo Rates?\n\nHaving  identified an opportunity to provide greater transparency into conditions in  the Treasury repo market and support reference rate reform, we decided to  produce not just one new repo rate, but three.   Why three?\n\nFirst and  foremost, we wanted to produce a rate reflective of a broad swath of activity  in the Treasury repo market.  At the same  time, we recognized that one broad rate might not consistently reflect differing  conditions in various segments of the market.   Dynamics in the overnight Treasury tri-party repo market—the segment of  the market characterized by cash-rich investors such as money market funds  lending to government securities dealers—may not always be the same as dynamics  in the blind-brokered, largely interdealer GCF Repo service offered by the  Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).  For example, greater opportunity for balance  sheet netting resulting from a single central counterparty in the GCF Repo  market, and the blind-brokered nature of trading in that market are two  differences between the tri-party and GCF Repo markets that impact the set of counterparties  active in each market and incentives for trading.  Both of these factors could manifest in a  divergence in rates. 24\n\nTrades in  the tri-party and GCF Repo markets are made against pools of “general”  collateral.  In a general collateral (GC)  repo trade, the cash provider stipulates a population of acceptable  collateral—for example, all Treasury securities—but does not stipulate the  specific securities that must be pledged to settle the transaction.  However, in the bilateral repo market, where  the services of a tri-party agent are not used, the counterparties themselves  identify specific securities to settle each trade.  As a result, the bilateral repo market can be  used to temporarily acquire specific securities, which can create different trading  incentives than simply investing cash against a pool of securities.  In particular, demand for specific securities—the  supply of which may be relatively scarce—can have a significant impact on rates  in the bilateral repo market.\n\nThe money  market funds eligible to participate in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse  repurchase facility (ON RRP) predominantly lend cash in the tri-party market. 25 As such, a rate focused only on the tri-party  repo market may be useful when evaluating money market fund participation in  the ON RRP.  On the other hand, a broad  measure of the cost of financing Treasury securities in the repo market—one not  just limited to GC trades—may be a better fit for other purposes.  For example, a broad measure may be a better  reflection of the average secured funding cost for a bank holding company that  participates across the tri-party, centrally-cleared interdealer, and bilateral  repo markets. 26\n\nOur choice  to produce three overnight Treasury repo rates recognizes this “fit for  purpose” issue.  Given existing market  segmentation and the potential for activity to shift across segments as the  repo market evolves, one rate likely is not a perfect fit for all needs.  However, producing a vast number of very similar  rates is not practical either.  From the  public feedback received, we believe that producing these three rates will strike  the right balance.\n\nWhat are the Three Rates the New York Fed  Will Produce?\n\nI will  provide an overview of each rate’s “Interest,” the term in IOSCO’s Principles for what a rate conceptually  is intended to measure.  Transactions in  which the Federal Reserve is a counterparty will be excluded from all three  rates, as the rates are meant to reflect private-market transactions, and the  Federal Reserve’s motivation for transacting in the repo market tends to be  different than for other participants. 27\n\nThe first  rate—the tri-party general collateral rate, or TGCR—is intended as a measure of  rates on overnight, tri-party Treasury GC repo transactions where the  counterparties involved know each other’s identity at the time of the trade.  The terms of all tri-party trades are bilaterally  negotiated between the security and cash providers before using the services of  a tri-party agent to clear and settle trades.   Based on recent data, the TGCR would include around $280 billion of  daily tri-party repo transactions.\n\nThe second  rate—the broad general collateral rate, or BGCR—is intended to capture all trades  where the specific securities provided as collateral are not identified until  after other terms of the trade are agreed.   The BGCR will include all trades in the TGCR plus other GC trades, such  as those that are blind brokered.  Given  the addition of approximately $15 billion in overnight Treasury GCF repo  transaction volume, if calculated today the BGCR would capture nearly $300  billion in daily transaction volume.\n\nThe third  rate—SOFR—is the broadest measure of the cost of borrowing overnight in the  repo market using Treasury securities as collateral.  The first two rates—the TGCR and BGCR—both focus  exclusively on the GC repo market, but, as I noted earlier, not all repo trades  are for “general” collateral.  Many  trades in the bilateral repo market are at rates similar to those on GC repo  trades in the tri-party repo market, with the cash providers’ motivation for  lending in the bilateral market very similar to the motivation of a cash  provider in the tri-party repo market.  However,  in some bilateral repo market trades the cash provider is seeking to acquire specific  Treasury securities, and the specific securities to be delivered are determined  at the outset of the trade, before a rate is agreed.  When such trades occur at rates below  prevailing rates on GC trades, the securities collateralizing the repo are said  to be trading “special.” The more demand for a specific security exceeds the  supply available to be lent, the greater the “specialness” premium for that security,  and the lower the rate on repo trades for that security.  A cash provider’s motivation for entering GC  and “specials” repo trades is different—investing cash in the case of a GC  trade and acquiring specific securities in a “specials” trade.  However, irrespective of the motivation of  the cash provider, both types of trades provide the cash borrower a means to  borrow funds with Treasury securities as collateral.\n\nSOFR is  intended to reflect the general cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized  by Treasury securities, regardless of the motivation of the cash providers  participating in the trades.  However, a  limited number of Treasury securities often trade with a significant “specialness”  premium—i.e., at rates considerably lower than those prevailing for GC trades  and most “specials” trades.  A  significant “specialness” premium implies that the supply-demand dynamics for a  particular Treasury security are very different than for the vast majority of  Treasury securities.  To mitigate the  potential influence of Treasury securities trading very “special,” we will  remove a portion of the lowest-rate transactions in the bilateral repo market  from the calculation of the SOFR.\n\nGiven the significant activity in the bilateral repo market cleared by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), transaction volume  underlying the SOFR would be in the neighborhood of $800 billion if calculated  today, more than double the volume underlying the BGCR.\n\nStarting in the  second quarter of this year, the New York Fed expects to begin producing and  publishing the three repo rates on a daily basis, alongside the EFFR and  OBFR.  We have explored how best to  calculate each of the three rates—also incorporating public comment received through  the Federal Register Notice process—and arrived at a calculation methodology  for each rate.  I will not discuss every  aspect of each rate, as that detailed information is already available, but there  are four key points that are important to highlight. 28\n\nFirst, all  three repo rates will be calculated as volume-weighted medians. 29 We selected the volume-weighted median as the  most appropriate measure of central tendency for these rates for the same  reasons we selected it for the EFFR and OBFR.   A median is more robust to submissions of erroneous data and is more  likely to reflect a transacted rate, as compared with a volume-weighted mean. 30\n\nSecond, we  have put in place various measures that should mitigate the risks associated  with data collection for all three rates.   While some have expressed concern that a portion of the data underlying  the rates is collected under a commercial agreement, the production of a  transaction-based rate necessitates the collection of transaction data, and there  are inherent risks in any data collection.   I would also note that in November, OFR announced plans to issue a  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking this year to collect the cleared repo data  underlying the BGCR and SOFR. 31 Simply put, if the markets underlying the  three repo rates are active, I do not anticipate that acquisition of necessary  data will be an impediment to the ongoing production of the rates.\n\nThird, I  want to provide further clarity around our method for identifying the set of  bilateral trades to be excluded or “trimmed” from the SOFR, and discuss why we  settled on this particular approach.\n\nOur use of a  volume-weighted median helps to ensure that “specials” will not have an undue  influence on the rate; however, we have taken additional precautions to ensure  that this is the case.  All transactions  in the FICC-cleared bilateral data set with rates below the 25th  volume-weighted percentile will be removed, and the remaining bilateral  transactions will then be combined with the tri-party and GCF Repo transactions  to calculate the SOFR.  In selecting this  trimming methodology, we sought a method that would remove transactions for  securities trading with an extreme “specialness” premium, consistent with the  concept of the SOFR I outlined earlier, while also being relatively easy to  communicate.  We explored a variety of  potential trimming methods and settled on the one we feel is the simplest that still  gets the job done.\n\nFinally, we  are working to determine what additional historical data we can provide for all  three repo rates, which is reflective of the requests for such data received  through the public comment process.  There  has been particular focus on data for the SOFR, as some have suggested that providing  a time series of the SOFR extending back prior to 2007 and the onset of the  financial crisis would ease adoption of the rate as an alternative to U.S.  dollar LIBOR.  We have previously released  indicative rates for the TGCR, BGCR, and SOFR from August 2014 forward based on  transaction-level data provided by the tri-party clearing banks and DTCC, and we  are looking into producing similar indicative rates for dates earlier than  2014. 32, 33 However, the calculation of these rates  utilizes some information that first became available after the financial  crisis as part of reforms to the tri-party repo market infrastructure.  While we may be able to provide additional  historical data beyond what we have already published, it is unlikely such data  will reach prior to the onset of the financial crisis for any of the three  rates.\n\nHowever, for  nearly two decades, the New York Fed has collected daily summary data from the  primary dealers on their borrowing across all segments of the overnight  Treasury general collateral repo market.   A rate based on these summary data may serve as a useful indicator of  the behavior of rates in the overnight Treasury repo market, and the New York  Fed is considering a one-time release of a time series of this primary dealer  survey rate.  While a rate based on the  primary dealer data would cover similar segments of the repo market as the  SOFR, the rate would not be a perfect substitute for the SOFR.  For example, the primary dealer survey rate  would be a volume-weighted mean, would only cover the GC segment of the repo  market, and would not cover activity by non-primary dealers.  Additionally, the rate could not be produced  in a process aligned with international best practices.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nTo conclude,  I hope that I have provided you with a brief history of the New York Fed’s role  as an administrator and producer of reference rates while highlighting various  aspects of the Treasury repo rates we plan to begin producing later this year,  including the role these rates play in mitigating risks from overreliance on  U.S. dollar LIBOR.  In the end, I hope  you walk away with two key messages.\n\nFirst, the  New York Fed is committed to producing durable reference rates.  That is, we are committed to producing rates  that are robust and resilient, both now and in the future.  These rates are compliant with IOSCO’s Principles , and best practice dictates  that administrators periodically review the rates they produce to assess  whether changes in the underlying markets require changes to those rates.  The New York Fed plans to perform such  reviews periodically for the repo rates, as well as for the EFFR and OBFR.  We do not anticipate frequent changes to how  we calculate the rates we produce, but if we believe changes are necessary, we  are committed to making them, and to doing so in a transparent fashion that  provides an opportunity for public input.   The integrity of the rates we produce is of the utmost importance,  whether they are used for analytical purposes or as reference rates in  financial contracts.\n\nSecond, recognizing  that the long-term availability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed, it is critical  that market participants with exposure to U.S. dollar LIBOR assess their associated  risk and take steps to mitigate their exposure.   While individual firms must decide on the most appropriate way to manage  LIBOR-related risk, we encourage all to take two steps at a minimum: (1) adopt  contract language capable of addressing the cessation of a reference rate, and (2)  reduce reliance on U.S. dollar LIBOR by transitioning to robust alternative  rates, such as the SOFR.  In addition to  being in the best interest of individual financial institutions, greater  reliance on robust alternative reference rates aids the transmission of  monetary policy and reduces financial stability risks.\n\nThank you.",
