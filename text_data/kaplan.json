    "text": "Remarks for Hoover Institution monetary policy conference\nMay 07, 2019\nIn our May 2019 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the federal funds rate unchanged in a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent. In the post-meeting statement, we commented that, on a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined and are running below 2 percent. The statement also noted that we “continue to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.”\nBackground\nHeadline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation,  the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, has been running below our 2  percent target for a substantial portion of the time period since 2012. [1] At the Dallas Fed, we particularly focus on the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure  of core PCE inflation, which filters out extreme upside and downside moves in  inflation components. We believe this measure is a useful indicator of underlying  inflation trends. The trimmed mean is currently running at approximately 2.0  percent on a trailing 12-month basis and has been in a range of 1.4 to 2.0  percent over the past seven years. [2]\nThe unemployment rate is currently 3.6 percent and has been  below the Congressional Budget Office estimate of full employment for two  years. [3] At the Dallas Fed, we particularly focus on the U-6 measure of unemployment,  which measures the level of unemployed, plus “marginally attached workers” who  indicate that they would like a job but have stopped looking for one, plus  people working part time who would prefer to work full time. This measure now stands  at 7.3 percent, and is below its 2006 prerecession low of approximately 7.9  percent. [4]\nDallas Fed economists expect GDP growth of approximately  2.25 percent in 2019. While this is slower growth than in 2018, it should be  sufficient to further tighten the labor market and cause the rate of wage growth  to modestly pick up over the course of 2019. Our economists also expect that,  despite some recent weakness in headline and core inflation readings, the  headline PCE and Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of core PCE inflation are  likely to firm, ending the year in the range of 2 percent.\nSome observers have suggested that, with this tight of a labor  market, there should be greater wage pressure than the 3.2 percent recent  reading of average hourly earnings growth over the past year. [5] They argue that they would have expected wage pressure to have translated into  greater price pressure. As most of you know, the Fed has initiated a review of  its framework and communication strategy to explore whether there are actions  we could take to improve our ability to achieve and maintain our dual-mandate  objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nWith all this as background, and in light of our ongoing  framework review, I thought it would make sense to step back and explore some  of the potential issues raised by recent weakness in headline and core  inflation measures. In particular, I will focus my remarks on labor slack,  inflation expectations, and structural forces with regard to how they may be  impacting the Fed’s ability to meets its 2 percent inflation objective.\nLabor slack\nA number  of economists have argued that there may be more slack in the U.S. labor market  than standard measurements are capturing. They believe that there may be more  scope to attract and retain previously under-represented groups in the  workforce. To support this argument, it is worth noting that, since 2015,  increases in labor force participation have disproportionately come from  under-represented groups. For example, the participation rate of the prime-age female  population with less than a high school education has increased significantly,  as has the participation rate for black males and Hispanic females. [6]\nIt  is also worth noting that the prime-age labor force participation rate in 2018  was 82.0 percent versus 83.1 percent in 2008 and 84.1 percent in 1998. [7] If we compare U.S. prime-age labor force participation to other developed  countries, we find that the U.S. participation rate lags behind many of these countries,  although this gap has begun to close somewhat since early 2015.\nDownloadable chart | Chart data\nIs it possible that the strength of the labor market is  drawing in workers who have been on the sidelines—particularly  under-represented groups—and is also encouraging workers to stay in the labor  force? [8] Is it possible that improvements in skills training, child care availability  and transportation availability have drawn, and could still draw, more  sidelined workers back into the workforce—and keep them in the workforce?\nIt’s important to recognize that gains in labor force  participation act to slow the decline of the unemployment rate. Additionally,  recent research—including work done by Richard Crump, Stefano Eusepi, Marc  Giannoni and Ayşegül Şahin—has argued that changes in demographics, especially  the aging of the workforce, the aging of firms, as well as the increase in the  attachment of women to the labor force, may have contributed to a decline in  the natural rate of unemployment. [9]\nIf this is the case, we may look back five years from now  and conclude that the natural rate of unemployment was simply lower than we had  been historically accustomed, and that one of the reasons for the perceived  surprising lack of inflation pressure was due to an excessively high estimate  of the equilibrium level of unemployment. In  this explanation, the Phillips curve may be alive and well, but the intercept  is simply lower than we have previously understood. If this is true, central  bankers need to be vigilant to the possibility that there is still the  potential for inflation readings to firm substantially, with a time lag, if the  degree of full employment overshoot becomes more sizeable and persists for an  extended period of time.\nInflation expectations\nAnother debate relates to the Fed’s ability to manage longer-run  inflation expectations. As you all know, the Fed has clearly articulated a 2  percent PCE inflation target. Many would argue that the Fed has done a  reasonably good job in helping to anchor inflation expectations. They would cite  the fact that surveys of professional forecasters’ inflation expectations are  close to 2 percent, and they would suggest that this is not a coincidence; it  is a reflection of the Federal Open Market Committee’s policy actions and  communications, which have been aimed at achieving and maintaining full  employment while anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at our 2 percent  objective.\nHowever, other economists contend that, due to an extended  period of inflation running below our 2 percent target, expectations may have  drifted somewhat lower. This downward drift might be reflected in the  University of Michigan survey for inflation expectations over the next five  years, which has gone from an average of 2.9 percent in 2013 to 2.5 percent in the  12 months ending April 2019. [10] These economists argue that the Fed may need to do more to help keep inflation  expectations well-anchored. In particular, has the Fed done enough to convince the  public that it is committed to a symmetrical 2 percent inflation target? Are  there changes to the Fed’s policy framework, communication strategy or other  actions the Fed could take to help better anchor inflation expectations at the  Fed’s 2 percent target?\nStructural forces\nAn additional area of exploration deals with structural changes  in the U.S. and global economies. In particular, are the forces of technology,  technology-enabled disruption and, to some extent, globalization, limiting the  pricing power of businesses and muting inflation?\nDallas Fed economists recognize that we are living through a  period of acceleration in the trend of technology replacing people. We are also  seeing the proliferation of new models for selling goods and services—often  technology-enabled (think Amazon, Airbnb, Uber or Lyft)—that replace  traditional models for delivering these goods and services. These new models  are often enabling consumers to buy products and services at prices that are  dramatically below those of incumbent competitors. To take advantage of this  trend, large-platform companies are increasingly bundling products and services—sometimes  with little or no gross margin—in order to gain market share.\nAll this is being facilitated by the fact that the consumer  now has in the palm of his or her hand more computing power than most companies  did just 15 years ago. Consumers are able to use this new technology to shop  for goods and services at lower prices, often with greater convenience.\nThe impact of these trends means that companies, depending  on the industry, often have much less pricing power than they did historically.  In response, companies are investing even more in technology that replaces  people and, increasingly, taking actions to achieve greater scale in order to  effectively manage the investment and margin implications of these trends. The  net result is that, in a range of industries, if there is wage pressure,  companies are just as likely to see margin erosion versus being able to pass  these costs on to the customer.\nAs a result of these trends, we are seeing a record level of  merger activity by companies in order to get more scale to compete in this  environment. [11] Companies are using  increased debt issuance to fund merger activities to achieve greater scale and  are also using increased debt issuance to fund accretive share repurchases in  order to soften the margin dilution they are experiencing. [12] Activist investors are increasingly pressuring companies to take steps to merge  and fund accretive share repurchases or face replacement of their boards of  directors and/or their executive teams.\nThe workforce is also experiencing the impact of this trend.  Highly educated and skilled workers are often seeing the benefits of technology  and disruption—depending on their company or industry. However, those workers  with a high school education or less—who lack specific skills training—are increasingly  seeing their jobs restructured or eliminated. This is leading to increasing  wealth and income inequality.\nThis discussion would suggest that powerful structural  changes in the economy may be an important aspect of more muted price  pressures. Further, there may be some evidence in recent productivity  statistics that new technology and greater economies of scale could be helping to  dampen growth in unit labor costs.\nImplications\nThe Fed’s 2 percent inflation target is symmetrical—that is,  we don’t want inflation to run persistently below or above our 2 percent target.  Sustained deviations from our inflation target could increase the likelihood that  inflation expectations begin to drift or become unanchored. This could, in  turn, make it more difficult for the Fed to achieve its dual-mandate objectives  of full employment and price stability.\nIn this context, the various issues raised in this essay merit  further discussion and attention. As the Federal Reserve conducts its ongoing  review of our monetary policy framework and communication strategy, the  challenge will be to explore potential options for enhancing our policy  approach so that we can better achieve our dual-mandate objectives.\nRobert S.

    "text": "Key Secular Trends and Implications for Monetary Policy\nAugust 2, 2016 Beijing\nThank you for inviting me to speak with  you. I have been coming to China regularly for the past 25 years. I’ve always  enjoyed working with Chinese companies and getting to know leaders in this  country. So, it’s a real pleasure for me to be here today.\nAs you know, I have been president  and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas since the beginning of September  2015. The Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional banks in the Federal Reserve  System. It has approximately 1,200 employees and oversees the Eleventh Federal  Reserve District, which is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern  New Mexico.\nAs head of the Dallas Fed, I  participate in every meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which  is the key monetary policy making body within the Federal Reserve System.\nToday, I’d like to speak with you  about my assessment of economic conditions as well as my views regarding  monetary policy. I will also discuss some of the key challenges facing policy  makers in the years ahead.\nI’d like to start my remarks with a  brief discussion of some of the larger secular issues that I see forming the  broader context for our work.\nThe  Broader Context\nGlobalization\nThe world has become much more  interconnected over the past several decades. Major companies have increasingly  spread their operations throughout the world in order to serve customers and  improve their competitiveness. As a result of this, S&P 500 companies now  derive as much as 50 percent of their earnings from outside the United States. [1] While corporate revenue and profit growth have been enhanced by globalization,  this trend has clearly created strains on cities and towns that have seen jobs  and significant portions of key industries relocate to other geographic  regions.\nAs global trade between countries  has expanded, economic conditions in one nation now have a greater potential to  impact economic conditions in other nations. These impacts are generally  transmitted through the trade of goods and services as well as through capital  flows and labor market dynamics.\nWhile economies are more globally  connected, financial markets have also become much more interconnected.  Investment portfolios are increasingly global, and asset allocators  increasingly think internationally when making investment decisions. Because  financial markets trade in real time, market strains or other challenges in one  market now have the potential to rapidly affect currency, debt and equity  markets globally.\nWe certainly saw the effects of  this interconnectedness during the 2008–09 financial crisis. More recently, and  on a much smaller scale, we saw how turmoil in currencies and local markets in  certain countries in early 2016 helped lead to global market volatility and a  rapid tightening of overall financial conditions. We are also seeing this trend  in continuing increases in global investment demand for “safe” assets—particularly  U.S. government securities.\nDemographics\nA second major challenge is  demographics. The United States and other major economies, including Europe,  Japan and China, are all facing the issue of aging populations. These  demographic changes will bear directly on the rates of workforce participation  and, in turn, impact rates of potential economic growth across the industrialized  world.\nFor example, in the U.S., as the  baby-boomer generation moves into retirement age, the fraction of the labor  force age 55 or older is projected to increase from approximately 21.7 percent  in 2014 to almost 25 percent in 2024. [2] Looking further ahead, the median age of the labor force is expected to rise  steadily through 2060.\nAs you know, in China, the size of  the working-age population peaked in 2014 as fertility rates have declined  below the population replacement rate. The median age in China has increased  from 22 in 1980 to 37 today and is estimated to be 50 by 2050. The Chinese  working-age population as a share of total population is estimated to have  peaked at 74 percent in 2011 and, based on current trends, is expected to fall  to 59 percent by 2050. [3] This decline will create headwinds for the country’s future economic growth.\nHigh  Levels of Debt to GDP\nWhile these demographic trends  continue to unfold, it is also the case that the ratio of debt to gross  domestic product (GDP) has increased in Japan, China and the U.K. as well as  most major countries in Europe. In the U.S., for example, household balance  sheets have improved since the financial crisis, but business debt to GDP is  somewhat higher and government debt to GDP has also increased.\nWhile U.S. government debt held by  the public is approximately 75 percent of GDP [4] ,  it is estimated that the present value of unfunded “entitlements” is now in  excess of $45 trillion. [5] These unfunded obligations will increasingly work their way into the annual  budget deficit over the next five to 10 years and will tend to increase the  U.S. budget deficit as a percentage of GDP.\nChina has also seen a significant  increase in its debt levels. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Chinese  nonfinancial debt to GDP was estimated at 255 percent (as compared to 148  percent at the end of 2008). This was composed of government debt of 44  percent, household debt of 40 percent and private nonfinancial debt of 171  percent. [6] This  debt growth may prove to be unsustainable.\nIncreasing  Rates of Disruption\nWhile these larger forces are  unfolding, the rate of disruption in industry is increasing. More than ever  before, consumers are able to use technology to rapidly compare prices for  goods and services. New business models are emerging which offer products and  services in a superior manner to older models. Amazon or Alibaba versus a  retail store is a classic example. These trends are encouraging  companies to look for new ways to use technology to lower costs, improve  productivity and enhance customer service. While the impacts can be hard to  measure, I believe these changes are reducing the pricing power of companies  and putting some degree of downward pressure on the prices of many types of  goods and services. This, in turn, is affecting the way companies think about  traditional capital spending and overall resource allocation.\nIt is difficult to fully determine  the ultimate impacts of these secular trends on economic growth, labor market  dynamics and price stability. However, I do believe that these underlying  forces are likely to have a significant impact on economic conditions in the  years ahead. These forces will also have significant implications for monetary  as well as fiscal policy. As the world has become more complex, central bankers  must work to better understand these issues in order to make sound judgments  regarding monetary policy.\nWith this backdrop, let me turn to  a discussion of the economic conditions in the Eleventh Federal Reserve  District, the United States and the world. I will then talk about their  implications for monetary policy.\nEleventh  District Discussion of Energy\nI’ll start with a discussion of  energy because of its impact on the Eleventh District as well as its importance  to the U.S. and the world.\nBased on analysis as well as  discussions with industry contacts, our Dallas Fed economists believe that  global oil production and consumption should move into rough balance by the  first half of 2017. While there are varying estimates of the precise timing of  this balancing process, the key to us is the trend—we are gradually moving  toward balance. Our analysis is based on our expectation that global demand for  oil will grow by approximately 1.3 million barrels per day, on average, in 2016.\nDespite significant cuts in capital  spending and rig counts in the U.S., global supply reductions have been slow to  materialize over the past year. As supply reductions in the U.S. have occurred,  they have been more than offset by production increases in Iran, Russia and  other nations.\nOver the past few months, market prices  have likely been impacted by periodic supply disruptions, such as those which have  occurred in Canada, Nigeria, Iraq and Kuwait. We believe that the bulk of these  supply outages have now been restored.\nWe expect continued price  volatility as we head into year-end. In addition, because many U.S. energy  companies are highly leveraged or operate in areas where the breakeven cost of  production is above current market prices, we expect to see more bankruptcies,  mergers and restructurings in the energy industry during the remainder of 2016.\nEleventh  District Overall Economic Conditions\nThe challenges of the energy  industry continue to create headwinds for our district. The oil and gas industry  now accounts for approximately 2 percent of Texas employment [7] and 6 percent of its GDP [8] (versus 3 percent of employment and 13 percent of GDP in 2014).\nTexas has substantially diversified  its economy over the past three decades and has also become the top exporting  state in the U.S. Texas has benefited from a sustained migration of people and  firms to the state. Since 2000, population growth in Texas has exceeded that of  the nation by almost a full 1 percentage point per year. This growth and  diversification has helped contribute to the resiliency of the state despite  recent headwinds from lower energy prices and the negative impact on exports  from a strong dollar.\nIn 2016, Dallas Fed economists  expect Texas job growth of 0.5 percent, compared with 1.3 percent in 2015 and 3.7  percent in 2014. [9] Manufacturing in Texas  remains weak, and some of this weakness has spread to the state’s service  sector. Jobs declined across most sectors and regions in the first quarter when  oil prices fell sharply and exports were weakened by a stronger dollar.  However, in the second quarter, job growth rebounded and leading indicators  improved in the state.\nAs the headwinds from energy and a  strong dollar continue to dissipate, I am very optimistic about the growth  prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the years ahead. My optimism  is due particularly to the increasingly diversified nature of the Texas economy  as well as the continued migration of people and firms to the state.\nEconomic  Conditions in the U.S.\nGross  Domestic Product and Employment\nEstimates of first and second quarter  2016 GDP growth in the U.S. have been disappointing. Despite this, Dallas Fed  economists continue to expect that GDP will grow approximately 2 percent in  2016, based largely on our expectation of solid consumer demand.\nWhile the most recent revision of  the May jobs report showed a net increase of only 11,000 jobs, the June report  showed an increase of approximately 287,000 jobs. [10] The  three-month average pace of growth was 147,000 jobs. This deceleration from  last year’s 200,000-plus pace should not be unexpected as the economy has moved  closer to full employment.\nThe labor force participation rate,  which measures the population 16 and older that is either employed or actively  looking for work, stands at 62.7 percent. The unemployment rate is now 4.9 percent,  after five years of steady declines. [11]\nThe labor force participation rate  is now 3.3 percentage points below its prerecession level. Dallas Fed  economists believe that most of this decline is due to an aging population. It  is our view that if current trends continue, the participation rate is likely  to decline to below 61 percent by 2024. [12] This expected decline will have negative implications for future potential GDP  growth in the U.S.\nInflation\nHeadline inflation continues to run  below the 2 percent longer-run objective set by the Federal Reserve. The most  recent PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) report indicated headline  inflation of 0.9 on a 12-month basis, up from 0.3 percent one year ago. [13]\nIn addition to headline inflation, our  economists carefully track measures of core inflation. In particular, we look  at the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean inflation rate, which trims out the most extreme  upward and downward monthly price changes. This rate had been running between  1.6 and 1.7 percent on a yearly basis from early 2014 until the end of 2015.  Since the start of 2016, it has edged up to roughly 1.8 percent. The stability  and trend of this measure bolsters our confidence that headline inflation will  reach 2 percent over the medium term as the effects of declining energy prices  and a stronger dollar ultimately subside.\nGlobal  Economic Conditions\nWhile we are the central bank of the  United States, it is critical to assess how global economic conditions impact  domestic economic conditions. Estimates of global growth continue to be revised  downward, and the composition of this growth continues to be uneven.\nBrazil, Russia and Venezuela are  expected to remain in recession in 2016, while advanced economies are expected  to show only modest growth. In addition, as you know, China continues to be  challenged by overcapacity in key industries, high levels of debt to GDP and  aging demographics as well as managing an initiative to transition from an  export- and manufacturing-based economy to one that is more consumer and  service-sector based. As China grapples with these issues, its future rates of  GDP growth are likely to decline. As the world adjusts to these lower levels of  growth, we will continue to carefully monitor the potential spillover effects  on currencies as well as global financial conditions.\nWe will also continue to monitor  and assess the implications of Brexit in the United Kingdom. While this  decision has had some ripple effects on global financial markets (particularly  regarding currencies and interest rates), it will take time for events to  unfold before we know the ultimate impact of this decision on growth in the  U.K., Europe and the rest of the world.\nImplications  for Monetary Policy\nI am closely monitoring how slowing  growth, high levels of overcapacity and high levels of debt to GDP in major economies  outside the U.S. might be impacting economic conditions in the U.S. I am also  closely tracking how these issues might be affecting the slope of the U.S.  Treasury yield curve as well as measures of tightness in financial conditions.\nIn light of these challenges, I  have been suggesting that removal of accommodation should be done in a gradual  and patient manner, based on a realistic assessment of progress toward  achieving the Federal Reserve’s dual-mandate objectives regarding full  employment and price stability. I am also very cognizant that, from a risk-management  point of view, our monetary policies have an asymmetrical impact at or near the  zero lower bound.\nCurrent  Challenges of Monetary Policy\nAs you know, the target range for  the federal funds rate stands at 25 to 50 basis points. The Federal Reserve  raised the range by 25 basis points in December 2015 after seven years at the  zero lower bound. Prolonged low rates, several rounds of quantitative easing  and other extraordinary Fed policy actions came in response to the severe  financial crisis and economic recession of 2008 and 2009.\nIt is worth noting that the last  time short-term interest rates in the United States were this low was during  the middle and late 1930s as the U.S. economy struggled to emerge from the Great  Depression. In addition, government bond yields in Germany and Japan are  actually negative, even at maturities over five years. [14] Real  government bond yields—returns after inflation—are at or below zero across a  wide swath of countries, including the United States. This situation has been  accentuated in the aftermath of Brexit.\nThe  Neutral Rate\nAs central bankers, we aim for  monetary policy to be accommodative when the economy is operating below full  employment and trend inflation is below target. We typically begin to remove  accommodation as we move closer to achieving those dual goals. When our  full-employment and price-stability goals are in conflict, the FOMC makes an  assessment of the “balance of risks” to the two objectives.\nWhile there are disagreements about  how much slack remains in the labor market and about how best to gauge trend  inflation, policy debates focus more fundamentally on how to gauge the appropriate  level of tightness or accommodation in monetary policy. This, in turn, depends  on judgments about the “neutral rate”—the rate that signifies the dividing line  between an accommodative and a restrictive monetary policy. This debate is  complicated by the fact that the neutral rate is “unobserved”—that is, we have  to infer this rate based on observations of financial and economic data.\nEconomists and other forecasters  have lowered their estimates of the longer-run neutral rate over the past  several years. Yields on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) have also  signaled a decline in the longer-run neutral real rate. [15]\nA major driver of the decline in  the neutral rate is a decrease in estimates of future growth. Longer-run  estimates of future GDP growth have been declining across most advanced  economies. This growth slowdown has been mostly due to demographics, but weaker  productivity growth also contributes significantly to this decline.\nAnother likely reason for the  decline in the neutral rate is the emergence of the U.S. as chief supplier of  safe assets to the world. In an increasingly interconnected world, the search  for safety and return occurs globally—meaning that low rates in one country can  quickly impact interest rates in other countries. Robert Hall of Stanford  University and the Hoover Institution argues that the representation of  risk-averse foreign investors in U.S. financial markets has increased and that  this trend has contributed to downward pressure on the neutral real rate. [16]\nMy colleague John Williams, president  of the San Francisco Fed, along with Thomas Laubach, on the staff of the Federal  Reserve Board of Governors, has estimated that, as of the end of the first  quarter of 2016, the longer-run real neutral rate was approximately 0.2 percent.\nEvan Koenig and Alan Armen at the  Dallas Fed estimate of the shorter-run real neutral rate was negative 1 percent  as of the end of the second quarter of 2016. By this measure, the Fed was only  modestly accommodative last quarter.\nWhile there are different  approaches to measuring the neutral rate, it is clear that there has been a  significant decline in estimates of the neutral rate over the past several  years.\nI am strongly persuaded by  arguments that aging demographics in advanced economies, slower productivity  growth and the continued emergence of the U.S. as a source of safe assets have  all contributed to the decline in the neutral rate. I also believe that high  levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies and higher levels of political  polarization have, at a minimum, limited the capacity of these countries to implement  fiscal policy and structural reforms that could have stimulated higher rates of  growth. This situation has, in turn, caused the neutral rate to be lower than  it would be otherwise.\nThe  Role of Monetary Policy\nIn light of the decline in the  neutral rate, using monetary policy to help manage the economy has become more  challenging.\nMonetary policy has a key role to  play in economic policy. However, at or near the zero lower bound, it may be less  effective than other tools of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed,  by itself, to address the key structural issues we face today stemming from  demographic changes, lower rates of productivity growth and high levels of debt  to GDP as well as dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates of  economic disruption.\nFor the past eight years, advanced  economies have relied heavily on monetary policy and much less on fiscal policy  or structural reforms. However, at this stage, if we are going to generate  higher sustainable rates of GDP growth and address key secular issues, there  needs to be policy action beyond monetary policy. This action could take a  variety of forms.\nIn the U.S., given that aging of  the population is expected to continue to create headwinds for future economic  growth, more could be done to examine policies that would ensure an inflow of  workers to strengthen and grow the U.S. workforce. Appropriate immigration policy  is a key element of this effort.\nPublic investments that upgrade  aging infrastructure could help to bolster sluggish demand in the near term  while boosting productivity in the long run. Given the sizable private pools of  capital that exist today, some meaningful portion of this investment could come  from public/private partnerships, with substantial capital coming from the  private sector.\nMore broadly, tax reform and  regulatory policies that create incentives for growth and investment could  ultimately improve growth rates. Improved growth expectations could help  counter the forces holding down the neutral real interest rate, giving monetary  policy makers greater scope for action without resorting to unconventional  tools.\nHistorically during economic  downturns, fiscal policy has often been used to assist monetary policy.  However, due to high levels of debt to GDP as well as political polarization,  governments have had difficulty coming to consensus on such action.\nThese are some examples of policy  actions that could be considered. There are certainly other examples, including  comprehensive regulatory review at the national, state and local levels, as  well efforts to implement more comprehensive trade policy. Policy makers would  need to address which of these might make sense to pursue. Whichever choices these  leaders prefer, my point is that some of these actions will be necessary to  address the challenges we currently face.\nConcluding  Remarks\nI believe advanced economies around  the world are at the stage where structural reforms, fiscal policy and other  government actions need to join the menu of economic policy. That is, to  address several of the key challenges we face, there needs to be economic  policy action beyond monetary policy. While there may be good reasons why  monetary policy has been the primary policy action over the past several years,  we are now at the point where policy makers must enter a new phase in our  thinking and actions.\nWe need to think more expansively  about how to generate higher rates of sustained GDP growth. Now, eight years  after the Great Recession, we need to take a new and broader approach to our  economic policy making.\nThank you. I look forward to taking  your questions.\nNotes\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official   positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nRobert S.

    "text": "The U.S.–Mexico Economic Relationship and a Discussion of U.S. Monetary Policy\nNovember 4, 2016 Mexico City\nThank you for having me here today at the Asociación de Bancos de Mexico.\nMexico is a very important partner to the United States, and there is a long history of close relations between the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Banco de México as well as with the broader leadership of Mexico. In particular, I would like to thank Agustín Carstens for his warm hospitality and outstanding efforts to build a strong relationship with the Dallas Fed over the past several years.\nAs most of you know, the Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. We represent the Eleventh District, which is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. This territory includes 74 percent of the 1,933 miles that comprise the U.S.–Mexico border.\nAs you probably also know, Texas is the largest exporting state in the U.S., and Mexico is our number one trading partner. [1] A majority of Texas immigrants come from Mexico. [2] In addition, cross-border investment is a key element of economic development in our region. So, building our relationship is critically important—which is why I am very glad to be here today and why I look forward to working with you for many years to come.\nToday, I would like to talk briefly about the close ties between Mexico and the United States. I would then like to discuss my assessment of economic conditions as well as the appropriate role of monetary policy in addressing key economic challenges we face. Then, I look forward to taking your questions.\nThe Mexico–U.S. Relationship\nSince the implementation of NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), trade between the U.S. and Mexico has grown from approximately $159 billion in 1994 to over $532 billion in 2015. According to U.S. government estimates, approximately 45 percent of this represents U.S. exports to Mexico, and the remaining 55 percent represents imports from Mexico to the U.S. [3] Approximately 81 percent of Mexico’s exports in 2015 went to the U.S. [4]\nIncreased bilateral trade and production sharing between the U.S. and Mexico has resulted in stronger economic integration, rising foreign direct investment and increasing business-cycle synchronization. For example, estimates indicate that approximately 40 percent of content in U.S. imports from Mexico originates in the U.S. [5]\nAs I mentioned earlier, Mexico is the number one destination for Texas exports. In 2015, Texas exported approximately $92.5 billion of goods to Mexico. [6] Dallas Fed research indicates that trading collaboration with Mexico has materially improved Texas’ global competitiveness. [7]\nToday, many Texas border cities benefit from increased U.S.–Mexico economic integration. Roberto Coronado is head of the El Paso branch of the Dallas Fed and has done extensive work trying to better understand this economic integration. His research suggests that growth in manufacturing activity in northern Mexico has generated substantial job growth in border cities such as El Paso and McAllen. [8] Job gains have been concentrated in services and transportation, resulting in better wages and improved standards of living for Texas border residents. [9]\nThe U.S. is home to more immigrants from Mexico than from any other nation—approximately 12 million. Mexican-born immigrants account for 27 percent of all immigrants living in the U.S. and 55 percent of immigrants living in Texas. [10] Immigration has contributed substantially to labor force growth in the U.S. and Texas. It is estimated that immigrants and their children have comprised more than half of the growth in the labor force in the U.S. over the past two decades. [11] In Texas, foreign workers overall are estimated to have comprised over 40 percent of workforce growth between 1990 and 2010. [12]\nPia Orrenius leads our effort to understand immigration as well as broader economic conditions in the Eleventh District. Dallas Fed research indicates that highly skilled immigrants are substantially beneficial to the U.S. economy. [13] Related research suggests that these workers tend to patent at much higher rates than similarly educated natives, hence contributing disproportionately to innovation and productivity growth. [14] Further, immigrants tend to be more entrepreneurial than natives and have somewhat higher rates of self-employment. [15] Pia’s research suggests that, on average, Mexican immigrant education levels are rising, and increasing numbers are filling high-skilled jobs in the U.S. [16]\nOne further insight from Pia’s work is the fact that Mexico–U.S. migration has slowed since the Great Recession. [17] Net immigration flows between the two countries have been running close to zero over the past several years. This slowdown appears to have been driven primarily by improving economic conditions in Mexico relative to the U.S. In addition, the increase in dual-earner households, smaller average family size, the creation of a more substantial social safety net, as well as stronger domestic labor market prospects in Mexico have all worked to reduce the flow of migration to the U.S.\nI look forward to talking more about these subjects in the Q and A. But now, let me turn to a discussion of economic conditions in the Eleventh District as well as the U.S.\nDiscussion of Economic Conditions\nLet me begin my remarks by talking about energy, given its importance to the Eleventh District and Mexico as well as the United States. As you know, energy prices have substantially declined since June of 2014. This weakness has certainly created economic headwinds for Mexico as well as the Eleventh District economy.\nAt the Dallas Fed, we continue to believe that global oil production and consumption will get into rough balance by sometime in the first half of 2017. This balancing process could be helped if there is a more explicit agreement worked out between OPEC nations to limit production levels.\nWhile there are varying estimates of the timing of reaching balance, we believe that the overall trend is the key—we are moving toward balance. Our analysis is based on our expectation that global supply will grow at a slower rate and that daily demand will continue to grow, on average, at approximately 1.3 million barrels per day for the remainder of 2016 and in 2017.\nThis balancing process has been more painful and slower than some had anticipated. While average daily U.S. oil production has declined by as much as 1 million barrels over the past year, these declines have been more than offset by production increases in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia and other countries. As a result of these developments, global oil supply reductions have been slow to materialize, and excess inventories of oil products now stand at record-high levels.\nAs we look ahead to 2017 and 2018, we expect to see continued price volatility. However, as we move toward balance, we expect to see excess inventories begin to decline and prices continue to firm. Despite this firming, we expect to see more bankruptcies, restructurings and merger activity in the energy sector in the U.S. Based on our energy surveys and discussions with market participants, the rig count is unlikely to increase significantly in the U.S. until prices rise to between $55 and $65 per barrel.\nThe energy sector as well as a stronger dollar have created headwinds for our district. The rate of job growth in Texas for the first half of 2016 was just below 1 percent. We saw continuing job losses in energy as well as weakness in the state’s manufacturing sector and slowing growth in its service sector. However, as the headwinds from energy and the dollar have begun to subside, we are beginning to see faster growth. In this regard, we now expect to see approximately 2 percent job growth in the second half of 2016 as well as in 2017.\nTexas continues to benefit from migration of people and firms to the state. Population in Texas stood at approximately 27.5 million in 2015 versus 22.8 million in 2005. [18] We expect this trend to continue in 2017 and beyond.\nGDP growth in the first half of 2016 was a disappointing 1.1 percent. [19] Underpinning this weak growth was the financial turmoil in the first quarter of this year as well as a sizable inventory deceleration in the second quarter. Initial estimates of third quarter GDP growth show an improvement to 2.9 percent. Based on these estimates and our confidence in the strength of the U.S. consumer, we now expect full-year 2016 GDP growth of approximately 2 percent.\nThe October employment report showed a headline unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. Additionally, the October labor force participation rate stood at 62.8 percent versus 66 percent in 2007. [20] We at the Dallas Fed believe that much of this decline is due to changes in demographics—that is, workers are aging out of the labor force. This trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as almost all advanced economies. For example, within the next 10 years, we expect the participation rate to fall below 61 percent if no mitigating actions are taken. This trend has significant implications for potential GDP growth.\nRegarding inflation, our Dallas Fed economists track headline inflation and other measures of core inflation including the Dallas Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate. This measure trims out outlying price movements. It has been running consistently at 1.7 percent since the start of 2016, up from 1.6 percent in 2015. The stability and trend of this measure gives us confidence that the headline inflation rate should gradually reach our 2 percent target in the medium term. Progress in reaching this objective has been frustratingly slow over the last few years.\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team is closely monitoring economic developments outside the U.S. to assess how these developments might impact economic growth domestically. In this regard, we are closely watching the impact of BREXIT on the U.K and European economies as well as monitoring the risk of contagion. At this stage, I believe that the impact of BREXIT is likely to be very manageable for the U.S.\nOur Dallas Fed research team is also monitoring emerging-market countries, particularly China. China has a high degree of overcapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises), high and growing levels of debt, and is in the midst of a multiyear transition from being a manufacturing- and export-driven economy to one that is based on consumer spending and services. We think this transition is likely to take many years, and the world is going to have to become accustomed to lower levels of Chinese growth. This deceleration coupled with high levels of debt is likely to make financial markets more vulnerable to periodic bouts of financial turmoil, which have the potential to tighten global financial conditions.\nBroader Secular Trends\nIn addition to monitoring key cyclical trends in the economy, I am also closely monitoring more persistent secular drivers, which help explain shorter-term economic results. I am particularly focused on four key drivers:\nThe Role of U.S. Monetary Policy and the Need for Structural Reforms and Broader Economic Policy\nThese secular trends are having an impact on economic conditions. They are, to a great extent, structural—that is, they are not easily addressed through monetary policy. This is one reason why I have suggested that, at this stage of the economic recovery, we need fiscal policy and structural reforms to join the menu of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural issues we face today. While monetary policy certainly has a key role to play, it is not a substitute for actions that address deeper fundamental challenges.\nFor example, given an aging population, we need to explore policies that could grow the workforce in the years ahead. This would likely involve greater emphasis on improving levels of educational attainment so as to raise the productivity of the U.S. workforce.\nOptions for improving educational attainment levels must include beefing up public/private partnerships that focus on vocational training that equips workers for technical and other skills-based opportunities of the 21st century. These programs could help grow the workforce and address the skills gap that has been identified by many companies we speak with in the Eleventh District.\nI also believe it makes sense to consider a range of public investments that upgrade aging infrastructure and could potentially improve productivity and help to bolster sluggish demand. Given the sizable private pools of capital that exist today, some meaningful portion of this investment could come from public/private partnerships, with substantial capital coming from the private sector.\nMore broadly, tax reform and regulatory policies could be considered in order to create greater incentives for capacity expansion and capital investment, which might ultimately improve future rates of GDP growth. Improved growth expectations could help to counter the forces holding down global interest rates, giving monetary policy makers greater scope for action without resorting to unconventional tools.\nSome observers suggest conducting a comprehensive review of regulations at the national, state and local levels. They argue that, in some cases, excessive regulation and fees might be creating undue burdens on capital investment, lending, and the formation and growth of small business. This may help explain why business investment and small-business formation have been disappointing over the past several years.\nEntitlement reforms, which involve strengthening Social Security and Medicare without jeopardizing potential benefits for those already 55 or older, could help improve the sustainability as well as ease the future fiscal burden of these programs. In addition, reforms might reduce current disincentives to remain in the labor force, while helping to soften the impact of aging demographic trends on growth and interest rates. Such reforms, insofar as they ease long-term concerns regarding the sustainability of future government debt burdens (as a percentage of GDP), might also reduce uncertainty about future tax rates and boost growth expectations through that channel.\nThese are some examples of policy actions that could be considered. There are certainly other examples, including efforts to implement more comprehensive trade reforms, which could help create a more level global playing field for the movement of goods and services.\nMonetary policy is a key element of economic policy—but it shouldn’t be the only element of policy. To improve future economic outcomes for our citizens, we need to consider structural and fiscal policies alongside sound monetary policy.\nClosing\nIt has been a pleasure speaking with you today. I look forward to working with you in the years ahead to build the relationship between our two countries.\nNow, I would be happy to take your questions.\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nRobert S.

    "text": "The value of patience\nFebruary 05, 2019\nIn the January 2019 meeting, the  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the federal funds rate unchanged in a  range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent and communicated that it “will be patient” as it  determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds  rate may be appropriate.\nThe FOMC also issued a “ Statement  Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization ,”  which reflects our decision to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime  in which control over the level of the federal funds rate is exercised via a  so-called “floor system” with an ample supply of reserves. [1] The Committee also said that it is prepared to adjust any of the details for  completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial  developments.\nThe FOMC began the process of  gradually reducing the size of its balance sheet in the fall of 2017. Through  January, the Fed has reduced its balance sheet by approximately $400 billion.\nOverview\nThe U.S. economy, as measured by  real gross domestic product (GDP), is estimated to have grown approximately 3  percent in 2018. However, various economic and financial uncertainties have  emerged over the past several months. I believe that these developments merit  close monitoring—and have the potential to impact the economic outlook.\nAfter approximately 115 months of  economic expansion and nine federal funds rate increases over the past three  years, I believe that we are at a critical juncture in terms of monetary policy.  It is my view that the Fed should be exhibiting patience. In particular, I  believe that we should take no further action on the federal funds rate until  there is greater clarity regarding a number of uncertainties relating to the  economic outlook and development of financial conditions.\nIn addition, consistent with our  January “Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet  Normalization,” I believe it is highly appropriate for us to be open to adjusting  the details of our normalization plans based on our ongoing assessments of the  economic outlook and financial conditions. My FOMC colleagues and I will  continue to analyze and discuss the appropriate size and composition of the  balance sheet—and will be working toward making decisions on these issues over  the coming months.\nEconomic conditions\nU.S. economic growth in 2018 was  aided by sizable fiscal stimulus and strong consumer spending. Additionally, for  much of the year, business fixed investment and solid global growth provided  tailwinds to U.S. GDP growth.\nBased on underlying employment  data as well as discussions with business contacts, it is my view that the U.S.  labor market is extremely tight by historical standards. The unemployment rate in  December was 3.9 percent, and the U-6 rate was 7.6 percent. This U-6 reading  was lower than the prerecession low of 7.9 percent in 2006 (U-6 comprises the  unemployed, plus “marginally attached workers” who indicate that they would  like a job but have stopped looking for one, plus people working part time who  would prefer to work full time).\nIn January, the unemployment rate  increased to 4.0 percent, and U-6 jumped to 8.1 percent. The labor force  participation rate increased to 63.2 percent. Dallas Fed economists have  cautioned that the January increase in the unemployment rate and the  substantial rise in U-6 were likely influenced by the partial federal  government shutdown and may well reverse in the coming months. In particular,  we would note the unusual jump in the number of people working part time who  would prefer to work full time; this measure increased by approximately 500,000  and may reflect, at least in part, government workers and contractors seeking  alternative employment during the shutdown.\nI believe that the Federal  Reserve is meeting its inflation mandate. The most recent reading of the Dallas  Fed Trimmed Mean, our preferred measure of core inflation, was approximately 2  percent for the 12 months ending in November. This measure, which exes out  extreme price movements to the upside and downside, provides a reliable gauge of  underlying inflation trends. Given the tightness in the labor market, it is  noteworthy that core inflation has not risen more sharply.\nMy own view is that the  structural forces of automation and technology-enabled disruption as well as globalization  are limiting the pricing power of businesses and having a dampening effect on  inflation. It is also my view that while cyclical inflationary pressures have  been building due to a tightening labor market, the impact of these structural  forces is also intensifying. Based on these cross-currents, I expect  inflationary pressures to remain somewhat muted; I don’t expect inflation to  run away from us.\nCautionary signs and uncertainties\nAs we begin 2019, I see several cautionary  signs that bear close scrutiny. First, global growth is decelerating. For  example, China’s purchasing managers indexes have continued to weaken, and the European  Central Bank has continued to downgrade its projections for economic growth in  the euro zone for 2019. While the world economy (excluding the U.S.) grew 3.4 percent in 2017, growth is estimated to have declined  to 3.0 percent in 2018 and is expected to further decline to 2.7 percent in  2019. [2] Measures of world export growth and industrial production (excluding the U.S.) also decelerated during 2018.\nIt is my view that slowing  economic growth outside the U.S. has the potential to ultimately spill over  into economic growth in the U.S. I am particularly mindful of the fact that approximately  45 percent of S&P 500 company revenues come from outside the United States  and that a variety of U.S. industries rely heavily on exports to China, Europe  and other regions of the world. Slower economic growth outside the U.S. means  that there is less foreign demand for goods and services originating in the  U.S. In addition, a substantial number of U.S. companies are highly reliant on global  logistics and supply-chain arrangements. If those arrangements are more  uncertain due to trade tensions, this can create challenges for domestic firms  in managing profit margins and have a chilling effect on capital spending plans  by these firms.\nIn the U.S., interest-sensitive industries are showing  signs of weakness. As of November, new single-family building permits were down  4.3 percent from their February 2018 expansion peak. Sales of existing  single-family homes, which hit 5.05 million in November 2017, were down 11.9  percent to 4.45 million as of December 2018.\nRecent national and regional  surveys of manufacturing activity also indicate signs of slowing. The Institute  for Supply Management manufacturing index indicated meaningfully slower growth  in December and, to a lesser extent, January. This slowing was also reflected  in Federal Reserve Bank surveys from the Dallas , Kansas City , New York and Richmond regions.\nIn addition, recent surveys of  consumer sentiment have fallen. In January, the Conference Board Consumer  Confidence Index fell to its lowest level since July 2017, and the University  of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index declined to its lowest level since October  2016, attributed in part to concerns about the partial federal government  shutdown.\nIt is the view of our economists  at the Dallas Fed that the negative impact of the recent shutdown on economic  activity and unemployment should substantially reverse in the coming months—this,  of course, assumes the shutdown does not resume in the coming weeks. Our judgment  doesn’t take into account any heightening of business and consumer uncertainty  that might persist as a result of the shutdown.\nSince early October, financial  conditions in the U.S. have tightened. For example, high-yield spreads  increased from approximately 3.15 percent to 5.30 percent between early October  and December 31, and then retraced somewhat to approximately 4.40 percent by  January 31. U.S. high-yield corporate bond issuance declined 39 percent in 2018.  The average level of monthly high-yield issuance was approximately $16.9  billion through October 2018 but declined to $3.6 billion in November and $0.6 billion  in December before rebounding to approximately $19.9 billion in January.\nFor the past year, Dallas Fed  economists have expected that 2019 growth would slow  from 2018 levels . We expected this slowing due to waning fiscal  stimulus heading into 2019 as well as the impact of Federal Reserve rate  increases that tend to impact the economy with a lag. We have also highlighted the  powerful structural headwinds of slowing workforce growth due to aging of the  population as well as sluggish productivity growth due in part to lagging  education and skill levels in the U.S.\nSince early December, Dallas Fed  economists have lowered our base-case forecast for 2019 GDP growth to approximately  2 percent. Of course, we are cognizant of ongoing risks to this outlook that include  trade tensions as well as the other uncertainties discussed earlier.\nImplications for monetary policy\nI believe the Federal Reserve has  made good progress in achieving its dual-mandate objectives of maximum  sustainable employment and price stability. In addition, we have made progress  in normalizing monetary policy and in reducing the size of our balance sheet.\nI am mindful of the fact that GDP  growth is made up of growth in the workforce plus growth in productivity. The  current economic expansion has now lasted for nearly 10 years, and we are  likely somewhat late in the business cycle, with relatively less spare  labor-force capacity to help support continued robust growth.\nI believe that the Treasury yield  curve is sending cautionary signals regarding expectations for medium- and  longer-term GDP growth. These sluggish expectations are reflective of key  structural headwinds discussed in this as well as previous essays ,  which include: 1) aging-population demographics that are likely creating slower  workforce growth, 2) limited improvements in productivity growth due in part to  lagging education and skill levels in the U.S., and 3) high levels of corporate  and federal government debt in the U.S. that are stimulative on the way up but  can create impediments to growth if debt levels need to be moderated. Further,  it is our view at the Dallas Fed that globalization is likely an opportunity to  achieve higher levels of economic growth and that some resolution of current  trade tensions is critical to seizing this opportunity.\nBased on these various factors, and in light of the  uncertainties described in this note, I believe it would be prudent for the Fed  to exercise patience and refrain from taking further action on the federal  funds rate until the economic outlook becomes somewhat clearer. I expect we  will get some further clarity during the first half of 2019.\nIn addition, it is my expectation  that inflation readings will remain somewhat muted in 2019. As I mentioned  earlier, it is my view that the structural forces of automation, technology-enabled  disruption and globalization will continue to offset, at least in part, the  cyclical pressures created by a historically tight labor market. As a result, I  believe the Fed has the luxury of being patient over the next several months. Exercising  patience will be critical if we are to achieve our dual-mandate objectives of  maximum sustainable employment and price stability.\nRobert S.

    "text": "The labor market may be tighter than the level of employment suggests\nMay 27, 2021\nNonfarm payroll employment disappointed in April, increasing just 266,000, well below consensus expectations of nearly 1 million new jobs. With payroll employment remaining well below its prior peak, slow job growth would typically suggest weak demand for labor from firms and limited employment opportunities for job seekers. Current conditions in the labor market, however, may be far from typical.\nThere are several reasons why previously employed  individuals may not currently be actively looking for work or are searching with  low intensity. These reasons might include lingering health concerns; working  mothers staying home to care for children, perhaps reflecting a lack of accessible child care options; generous unemployment insurance benefits; and decisions to retire  or prioritize other activities.\nBased on these issues, it may be wise to consider  a wider range of indicators, in addition to headline employment data releases,  in order to assess the state of the current labor market.\nIndicators of labor market tightness\nMany of the labor market indicators that we track at the  Dallas Fed point to labor market conditions that are tighter than the headline level  of employment would suggest.\nFor example, the red line in Chart 1 plots the  ratio of job openings to the number of  unemployed, excluding temporary layoffs. [1]\nDownloadable chart | Chart data\nYou can see in this chart that, as of March 2021, job  openings were at a historically high level (blue line) and the ratio of job  openings per unemployed is similar to mid-2017. Consistent with this analysis, a  recent National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) survey indicates  the percentage of small businesses that report few or no qualified applicants  for job openings increased to 54 percent in April, above the 2019 average of 52  percent.\nChart 2 plots the Conference  Board labor market differential, which takes the share of consumer survey respondents  saying jobs are plentiful and subtracts the share saying jobs are hard to get.\nDownloadable chart This differential has increased rapidly since March 2021,  reaching 34.6 in May. This exceeds its 2019 average of 33.2, suggesting that  jobs are relatively abundant for those looking for work. In addition, the rate that employed workers quit  their jobs was 2.4 percent in March, equal to its record high in 2019. The quits rate was  historically tightly correlated with the unemployment rate through 2019—a high  quits rate has been consistent with a tight labor market, as workers are  confident enough to leave their current positions in order to pursue better  opportunities. Wage growth has remained resilient The signals coming from wages are consistent with those  coming from our alternative measures of labor market tightness. According to  the employment cost  index , which adjusts for composition effects, wages increased 2.7 percent  over the 12 months ended March 2021. This is only slightly below the pace of  wage growth in 2019 and much stronger than during the slack labor market  conditions that existed during the aftermath of the Great Recession. In the most recent April jobs report, growth in  average hourly earnings accelerated sharply to 0.7 percent month over month, even  though greater employment growth in lower-wage industries should have had the  impact of weighing down this measure. It should be noted that last year, as the  economy shed relatively low-paying jobs, compositional  shifts appear to have artificially boosted average hourly earnings . This recent  data is consistent with reports from employers throughout the Eleventh Federal  Reserve District that the labor market has recently tightened, and that wage  pressures have intensified since the first quarter of 2021. Many former employees are unwilling to return to their previous positions Many  employers throughout our district report that they are struggling to rehire  former employees as the economy reopens, as many of their former employees are  reluctant to return to their old jobs. The Real-Time Population Survey asks individuals who were employed in February 2020, but not currently  employed, whether they would be willing to return to their previous position  for the same pay and hours. The share responding yes has declined to just over  50 percent in April ( Chart 3 ). Downloadable chart | Chart data Role of retirement Since February 2020, the  economy-wide employment-to-population ratio has declined by 3.2 percentage  points, or by about 8.5 million workers. About 1.6 percentage points (4.1  million people) of the decline consists of unemployed workers who will likely  eventually return to employment. The remaining roughly 1.7 percentage  points (4.4 million) represents a higher share of individuals not in the labor  force—meaning that they are not currently actively looking for work. What is  driving the higher share out of the labor force? Out of this 1.7 percentage  points, 1.0 percentage points (2.6 million) report that they are currently retired,  and 0.5 percentage points (1.3 million) report to be caregivers (individuals  whose primary activity is taking care of a household or family). Can we expect the 2.6 million  workers who have self-identified as retired to return to the workforce? Chart 4  shows that the share of the population in retirement increased from 18.5 percent  in February 2020 to 19.5 percent in April 2021. Assuming 2019 retirement rates  for the various age groups, we estimate that 0.4 percentage points of the rise  in retirement (1.2 million) would have retired regardless of the pandemic. The additional  retirements account for approximately 0.6 percentage points (1.5 million). Downloadable chart | Chart data One might expect a number of  individuals who have retired during the pandemic to return to the labor force  as the effects of the pandemic continue to fade. However, in making this  judgment it is worth comparing rates of retirement in the three years leading  up to the pandemic. Chart 4 shows how a hot labor  market in 2018 and 2019 likely prompted many older workers to delay retirement,  causing the share of the population in retirement to increase more slowly than the  rate of aging would have implied. We see that during 2020 and 2021, the rate of  retirement returned to its 2017 trend. How this trend unfolds—along with the  degree to which caregiving, unemployment benefits and other special factors influence  employment—will impact the ultimate size of the available workforce. Teenage employment fully recovered One group that is increasing  its participation is teenagers. According to the latest employment report, the  employment-to-population ratio for individuals age 16–19 increased to 32.8 percent in April , exceeding  its prepandemic level of 32.1 percent in February 2020. This increase in teenage  employment accounted for approximately 78 percent of the increase in employment  in the April 2021 jobs report. While this may signal increased opportunity for  younger workers, it could also have negative implications for educational  attainment and future productivity. In particular, a wide range of  school superintendents in the Eleventh District are expressing concern about  dropout rates for their junior and senior classes and the long-term impact on  the workforce if these young adults don’t return to achieve their high school  certificate. Implications for monetary policy The Federal Reserve is committed to supporting a broad and  inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting recession. However,  as the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2020  statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy states, maximum  employment “changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors.” In this post, we wish to suggest that policymakers should be  cognizant of a range of supply factors that may currently be weighing on employment.  These factors may not be particularly susceptible to monetary policy. We would expect that many of these factors will  fade as the year progresses, increasing the number of job seekers and  potentially reducing labor market tightness. However, it is also possible that  labor supply will increase less than expected. It is our view that this possibility  should be kept in mind as policymakers assess the appropriate stance of monetary  policy.

Labor COVID-19 Monetary policy\nThis differential has increased rapidly since March 2021,  reaching 34.6 in May. This exceeds its 2019 average of 33.2, suggesting that  jobs are relatively abundant for those looking for work.\nIn addition, the rate that employed workers quit  their jobs was 2.4 percent in March, equal to its record high in 2019. The quits rate was  historically tightly correlated with the unemployment rate through 2019—a high  quits rate has been consistent with a tight labor market, as workers are  confident enough to leave their current positions in order to pursue better  opportunities.\nWage growth has remained resilient\nThe signals coming from wages are consistent with those  coming from our alternative measures of labor market tightness. According to  the employment cost  index , which adjusts for composition effects, wages increased 2.7 percent  over the 12 months ended March 2021. This is only slightly below the pace of  wage growth in 2019 and much stronger than during the slack labor market  conditions that existed during the aftermath of the Great Recession.\nIn the most recent April jobs report, growth in  average hourly earnings accelerated sharply to 0.7 percent month over month, even  though greater employment growth in lower-wage industries should have had the  impact of weighing down this measure. It should be noted that last year, as the  economy shed relatively low-paying jobs, compositional  shifts appear to have artificially boosted average hourly earnings . This recent  data is consistent with reports from employers throughout the Eleventh Federal  Reserve District that the labor market has recently tightened, and that wage  pressures have intensified since the first quarter of 2021.\nMany former employees are unwilling to return to their previous positions\nMany  employers throughout our district report that they are struggling to rehire  former employees as the economy reopens, as many of their former employees are  reluctant to return to their old jobs. The Real-Time Population Survey asks individuals who were employed in February 2020, but not currently  employed, whether they would be willing to return to their previous position  for the same pay and hours. The share responding yes has declined to just over  50 percent in April ( Chart 3 ).\nDownloadable chart | Chart data\nRole of retirement\nSince February 2020, the  economy-wide employment-to-population ratio has declined by 3.2 percentage  points, or by about 8.5 million workers. About 1.6 percentage points (4.1  million people) of the decline consists of unemployed workers who will likely  eventually return to employment.\nThe remaining roughly 1.7 percentage  points (4.4 million) represents a higher share of individuals not in the labor  force—meaning that they are not currently actively looking for work. What is  driving the higher share out of the labor force? Out of this 1.7 percentage  points, 1.0 percentage points (2.6 million) report that they are currently retired,  and 0.5 percentage points (1.3 million) report to be caregivers (individuals  whose primary activity is taking care of a household or family).\nCan we expect the 2.6 million  workers who have self-identified as retired to return to the workforce? Chart 4  shows that the share of the population in retirement increased from 18.5 percent  in February 2020 to 19.5 percent in April 2021. Assuming 2019 retirement rates  for the various age groups, we estimate that 0.4 percentage points of the rise  in retirement (1.2 million) would have retired regardless of the pandemic. The additional  retirements account for approximately 0.6 percentage points (1.5 million).\nDownloadable chart | Chart data\nOne might expect a number of  individuals who have retired during the pandemic to return to the labor force  as the effects of the pandemic continue to fade. However, in making this  judgment it is worth comparing rates of retirement in the three years leading  up to the pandemic.\nChart 4 shows how a hot labor  market in 2018 and 2019 likely prompted many older workers to delay retirement,  causing the share of the population in retirement to increase more slowly than the  rate of aging would have implied. We see that during 2020 and 2021, the rate of  retirement returned to its 2017 trend. How this trend unfolds—along with the  degree to which caregiving, unemployment benefits and other special factors influence  employment—will impact the ultimate size of the available workforce.\nTeenage employment fully recovered\nOne group that is increasing  its participation is teenagers. According to the latest employment report, the  employment-to-population ratio for individuals age 16–19 increased to 32.8 percent in April , exceeding  its prepandemic level of 32.1 percent in February 2020.\nThis increase in teenage  employment accounted for approximately 78 percent of the increase in employment  in the April 2021 jobs report. While this may signal increased opportunity for  younger workers, it could also have negative implications for educational  attainment and future productivity.\nIn particular, a wide range of  school superintendents in the Eleventh District are expressing concern about  dropout rates for their junior and senior classes and the long-term impact on  the workforce if these young adults don’t return to achieve their high school  certificate.\nImplications for monetary policy\nThe Federal Reserve is committed to supporting a broad and  inclusive recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting recession. However,  as the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2020  statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy states, maximum  employment “changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors.”\nIn this post, we wish to suggest that policymakers should be  cognizant of a range of supply factors that may currently be weighing on employment.  These factors may not be particularly susceptible to monetary policy.\nWe would expect that many of these factors will  fade as the year progresses, increasing the number of job seekers and  potentially reducing labor market tightness. However, it is also possible that  labor supply will increase less than expected. It is our view that this possibility  should be kept in mind as policymakers assess the appropriate stance of monetary  policy.\nRobert S.

    "text": "Remarks for Hoover Institution monetary policy conference\nMay 07, 2019\nIn our May 2019 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the federal funds rate unchanged in a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent. In the post-meeting statement, we commented that, on a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined and are running below 2 percent. The statement also noted that we “continue to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.”\nBackground\nHeadline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation,  the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, has been running below our 2  percent target for a substantial portion of the time period since 2012. [1] At the Dallas Fed, we particularly focus on the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure  of core PCE inflation, which filters out extreme upside and downside moves in  inflation components. We believe this measure is a useful indicator of underlying  inflation trends. The trimmed mean is currently running at approximately 2.0  percent on a trailing 12-month basis and has been in a range of 1.4 to 2.0  percent over the past seven years. [2]\nThe unemployment rate is currently 3.6 percent and has been  below the Congressional Budget Office estimate of full employment for two  years. [3] At the Dallas Fed, we particularly focus on the U-6 measure of unemployment,  which measures the level of unemployed, plus “marginally attached workers” who  indicate that they would like a job but have stopped looking for one, plus  people working part time who would prefer to work full time. This measure now stands  at 7.3 percent, and is below its 2006 prerecession low of approximately 7.9  percent. [4]\nDallas Fed economists expect GDP growth of approximately  2.25 percent in 2019. While this is slower growth than in 2018, it should be  sufficient to further tighten the labor market and cause the rate of wage growth  to modestly pick up over the course of 2019. Our economists also expect that,  despite some recent weakness in headline and core inflation readings, the  headline PCE and Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of core PCE inflation are  likely to firm, ending the year in the range of 2 percent.\nSome observers have suggested that, with this tight of a labor  market, there should be greater wage pressure than the 3.2 percent recent  reading of average hourly earnings growth over the past year. [5] They argue that they would have expected wage pressure to have translated into  greater price pressure. As most of you know, the Fed has initiated a review of  its framework and communication strategy to explore whether there are actions  we could take to improve our ability to achieve and maintain our dual-mandate  objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\nWith all this as background, and in light of our ongoing  framework review, I thought it would make sense to step back and explore some  of the potential issues raised by recent weakness in headline and core  inflation measures. In particular, I will focus my remarks on labor slack,  inflation expectations, and structural forces with regard to how they may be  impacting the Fed’s ability to meets its 2 percent inflation objective.\nLabor slack\nA number  of economists have argued that there may be more slack in the U.S. labor market  than standard measurements are capturing. They believe that there may be more  scope to attract and retain previously under-represented groups in the  workforce. To support this argument, it is worth noting that, since 2015,  increases in labor force participation have disproportionately come from  under-represented groups. For example, the participation rate of the prime-age female  population with less than a high school education has increased significantly,  as has the participation rate for black males and Hispanic females. [6]\nIt  is also worth noting that the prime-age labor force participation rate in 2018  was 82.0 percent versus 83.1 percent in 2008 and 84.1 percent in 1998. [7] If we compare U.S. prime-age labor force participation to other developed  countries, we find that the U.S. participation rate lags behind many of these countries,  although this gap has begun to close somewhat since early 2015.\nDownloadable chart | Chart data\nIs it possible that the strength of the labor market is  drawing in workers who have been on the sidelines—particularly  under-represented groups—and is also encouraging workers to stay in the labor  force? [8] Is it possible that improvements in skills training, child care availability  and transportation availability have drawn, and could still draw, more  sidelined workers back into the workforce—and keep them in the workforce?\nIt’s important to recognize that gains in labor force  participation act to slow the decline of the unemployment rate. Additionally,  recent research—including work done by Richard Crump, Stefano Eusepi, Marc  Giannoni and Ayşegül Şahin—has argued that changes in demographics, especially  the aging of the workforce, the aging of firms, as well as the increase in the  attachment of women to the labor force, may have contributed to a decline in  the natural rate of unemployment. [9]\nIf this is the case, we may look back five years from now  and conclude that the natural rate of unemployment was simply lower than we had  been historically accustomed, and that one of the reasons for the perceived  surprising lack of inflation pressure was due to an excessively high estimate  of the equilibrium level of unemployment. In  this explanation, the Phillips curve may be alive and well, but the intercept  is simply lower than we have previously understood. If this is true, central  bankers need to be vigilant to the possibility that there is still the  potential for inflation readings to firm substantially, with a time lag, if the  degree of full employment overshoot becomes more sizeable and persists for an  extended period of time.\nInflation expectations\nAnother debate relates to the Fed’s ability to manage longer-run  inflation expectations. As you all know, the Fed has clearly articulated a 2  percent PCE inflation target. Many would argue that the Fed has done a  reasonably good job in helping to anchor inflation expectations. They would cite  the fact that surveys of professional forecasters’ inflation expectations are  close to 2 percent, and they would suggest that this is not a coincidence; it  is a reflection of the Federal Open Market Committee’s policy actions and  communications, which have been aimed at achieving and maintaining full  employment while anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at our 2 percent  objective.\nHowever, other economists contend that, due to an extended  period of inflation running below our 2 percent target, expectations may have  drifted somewhat lower. This downward drift might be reflected in the  University of Michigan survey for inflation expectations over the next five  years, which has gone from an average of 2.9 percent in 2013 to 2.5 percent in the  12 months ending April 2019. [10] These economists argue that the Fed may need to do more to help keep inflation  expectations well-anchored. In particular, has the Fed done enough to convince the  public that it is committed to a symmetrical 2 percent inflation target? Are  there changes to the Fed’s policy framework, communication strategy or other  actions the Fed could take to help better anchor inflation expectations at the  Fed’s 2 percent target?\nStructural forces\nAn additional area of exploration deals with structural changes  in the U.S. and global economies. In particular, are the forces of technology,  technology-enabled disruption and, to some extent, globalization, limiting the  pricing power of businesses and muting inflation?\nDallas Fed economists recognize that we are living through a  period of acceleration in the trend of technology replacing people. We are also  seeing the proliferation of new models for selling goods and services—often  technology-enabled (think Amazon, Airbnb, Uber or Lyft)—that replace  traditional models for delivering these goods and services. These new models  are often enabling consumers to buy products and services at prices that are  dramatically below those of incumbent competitors. To take advantage of this  trend, large-platform companies are increasingly bundling products and services—sometimes  with little or no gross margin—in order to gain market share.\nAll this is being facilitated by the fact that the consumer  now has in the palm of his or her hand more computing power than most companies  did just 15 years ago. Consumers are able to use this new technology to shop  for goods and services at lower prices, often with greater convenience.\nThe impact of these trends means that companies, depending  on the industry, often have much less pricing power than they did historically.  In response, companies are investing even more in technology that replaces  people and, increasingly, taking actions to achieve greater scale in order to  effectively manage the investment and margin implications of these trends. The  net result is that, in a range of industries, if there is wage pressure,  companies are just as likely to see margin erosion versus being able to pass  these costs on to the customer.\nAs a result of these trends, we are seeing a record level of  merger activity by companies in order to get more scale to compete in this  environment. [11] Companies are using  increased debt issuance to fund merger activities to achieve greater scale and  are also using increased debt issuance to fund accretive share repurchases in  order to soften the margin dilution they are experiencing. [12] Activist investors are increasingly pressuring companies to take steps to merge  and fund accretive share repurchases or face replacement of their boards of  directors and/or their executive teams.\nThe workforce is also experiencing the impact of this trend.  Highly educated and skilled workers are often seeing the benefits of technology  and disruption—depending on their company or industry. However, those workers  with a high school education or less—who lack specific skills training—are increasingly  seeing their jobs restructured or eliminated. This is leading to increasing  wealth and income inequality.\nThis discussion would suggest that powerful structural  changes in the economy may be an important aspect of more muted price  pressures. Further, there may be some evidence in recent productivity  statistics that new technology and greater economies of scale could be helping to  dampen growth in unit labor costs.\nImplications\nThe Fed’s 2 percent inflation target is symmetrical—that is,  we don’t want inflation to run persistently below or above our 2 percent target.  Sustained deviations from our inflation target could increase the likelihood that  inflation expectations begin to drift or become unanchored. This could, in  turn, make it more difficult for the Fed to achieve its dual-mandate objectives  of full employment and price stability.\nIn this context, the various issues raised in this essay merit  further discussion and attention. As the Federal Reserve conducts its ongoing  review of our monetary policy framework and communication strategy, the  challenge will be to explore potential options for enhancing our policy  approach so that we can better achieve our dual-mandate objectives.\nRobert S.

    "text": "The value of patience\nFebruary 05, 2019\nIn the January 2019 meeting, the  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the federal funds rate unchanged in a  range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent and communicated that it “will be patient” as it  determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds  rate may be appropriate.\nThe FOMC also issued a “ Statement  Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization ,”  which reflects our decision to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime  in which control over the level of the federal funds rate is exercised via a  so-called “floor system” with an ample supply of reserves. [1] The Committee also said that it is prepared to adjust any of the details for  completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial  developments.\nThe FOMC began the process of  gradually reducing the size of its balance sheet in the fall of 2017. Through  January, the Fed has reduced its balance sheet by approximately $400 billion.\nOverview\nThe U.S. economy, as measured by  real gross domestic product (GDP), is estimated to have grown approximately 3  percent in 2018. However, various economic and financial uncertainties have  emerged over the past several months. I believe that these developments merit  close monitoring—and have the potential to impact the economic outlook.\nAfter approximately 115 months of  economic expansion and nine federal funds rate increases over the past three  years, I believe that we are at a critical juncture in terms of monetary policy.  It is my view that the Fed should be exhibiting patience. In particular, I  believe that we should take no further action on the federal funds rate until  there is greater clarity regarding a number of uncertainties relating to the  economic outlook and development of financial conditions.\nIn addition, consistent with our  January “Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet  Normalization,” I believe it is highly appropriate for us to be open to adjusting  the details of our normalization plans based on our ongoing assessments of the  economic outlook and financial conditions. My FOMC colleagues and I will  continue to analyze and discuss the appropriate size and composition of the  balance sheet—and will be working toward making decisions on these issues over  the coming months.\nEconomic conditions\nU.S. economic growth in 2018 was  aided by sizable fiscal stimulus and strong consumer spending. Additionally, for  much of the year, business fixed investment and solid global growth provided  tailwinds to U.S. GDP growth.\nBased on underlying employment  data as well as discussions with business contacts, it is my view that the U.S.  labor market is extremely tight by historical standards. The unemployment rate in  December was 3.9 percent, and the U-6 rate was 7.6 percent. This U-6 reading  was lower than the prerecession low of 7.9 percent in 2006 (U-6 comprises the  unemployed, plus “marginally attached workers” who indicate that they would  like a job but have stopped looking for one, plus people working part time who  would prefer to work full time).\nIn January, the unemployment rate  increased to 4.0 percent, and U-6 jumped to 8.1 percent. The labor force  participation rate increased to 63.2 percent. Dallas Fed economists have  cautioned that the January increase in the unemployment rate and the  substantial rise in U-6 were likely influenced by the partial federal  government shutdown and may well reverse in the coming months. In particular,  we would note the unusual jump in the number of people working part time who  would prefer to work full time; this measure increased by approximately 500,000  and may reflect, at least in part, government workers and contractors seeking  alternative employment during the shutdown.\nI believe that the Federal  Reserve is meeting its inflation mandate. The most recent reading of the Dallas  Fed Trimmed Mean, our preferred measure of core inflation, was approximately 2  percent for the 12 months ending in November. This measure, which exes out  extreme price movements to the upside and downside, provides a reliable gauge of  underlying inflation trends. Given the tightness in the labor market, it is  noteworthy that core inflation has not risen more sharply.\nMy own view is that the  structural forces of automation and technology-enabled disruption as well as globalization  are limiting the pricing power of businesses and having a dampening effect on  inflation. It is also my view that while cyclical inflationary pressures have  been building due to a tightening labor market, the impact of these structural  forces is also intensifying. Based on these cross-currents, I expect  inflationary pressures to remain somewhat muted; I don’t expect inflation to  run away from us.\nCautionary signs and uncertainties\nAs we begin 2019, I see several cautionary  signs that bear close scrutiny. First, global growth is decelerating. For  example, China’s purchasing managers indexes have continued to weaken, and the European  Central Bank has continued to downgrade its projections for economic growth in  the euro zone for 2019. While the world economy (excluding the U.S.) grew 3.4 percent in 2017, growth is estimated to have declined  to 3.0 percent in 2018 and is expected to further decline to 2.7 percent in  2019. [2] Measures of world export growth and industrial production (excluding the U.S.) also decelerated during 2018.\nIt is my view that slowing  economic growth outside the U.S. has the potential to ultimately spill over  into economic growth in the U.S. I am particularly mindful of the fact that approximately  45 percent of S&P 500 company revenues come from outside the United States  and that a variety of U.S. industries rely heavily on exports to China, Europe  and other regions of the world. Slower economic growth outside the U.S. means  that there is less foreign demand for goods and services originating in the  U.S. In addition, a substantial number of U.S. companies are highly reliant on global  logistics and supply-chain arrangements. If those arrangements are more  uncertain due to trade tensions, this can create challenges for domestic firms  in managing profit margins and have a chilling effect on capital spending plans  by these firms.\nIn the U.S., interest-sensitive industries are showing  signs of weakness. As of November, new single-family building permits were down  4.3 percent from their February 2018 expansion peak. Sales of existing  single-family homes, which hit 5.05 million in November 2017, were down 11.9  percent to 4.45 million as of December 2018.\nRecent national and regional  surveys of manufacturing activity also indicate signs of slowing. The Institute  for Supply Management manufacturing index indicated meaningfully slower growth  in December and, to a lesser extent, January. This slowing was also reflected  in Federal Reserve Bank surveys from the Dallas , Kansas City , New York and Richmond regions.\nIn addition, recent surveys of  consumer sentiment have fallen. In January, the Conference Board Consumer  Confidence Index fell to its lowest level since July 2017, and the University  of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index declined to its lowest level since October  2016, attributed in part to concerns about the partial federal government  shutdown.\nIt is the view of our economists  at the Dallas Fed that the negative impact of the recent shutdown on economic  activity and unemployment should substantially reverse in the coming months—this,  of course, assumes the shutdown does not resume in the coming weeks. Our judgment  doesn’t take into account any heightening of business and consumer uncertainty  that might persist as a result of the shutdown.\nSince early October, financial  conditions in the U.S. have tightened. For example, high-yield spreads  increased from approximately 3.15 percent to 5.30 percent between early October  and December 31, and then retraced somewhat to approximately 4.40 percent by  January 31. U.S. high-yield corporate bond issuance declined 39 percent in 2018.  The average level of monthly high-yield issuance was approximately $16.9  billion through October 2018 but declined to $3.6 billion in November and $0.6 billion  in December before rebounding to approximately $19.9 billion in January.\nFor the past year, Dallas Fed  economists have expected that 2019 growth would slow  from 2018 levels . We expected this slowing due to waning fiscal  stimulus heading into 2019 as well as the impact of Federal Reserve rate  increases that tend to impact the economy with a lag. We have also highlighted the  powerful structural headwinds of slowing workforce growth due to aging of the  population as well as sluggish productivity growth due in part to lagging  education and skill levels in the U.S.\nSince early December, Dallas Fed  economists have lowered our base-case forecast for 2019 GDP growth to approximately  2 percent. Of course, we are cognizant of ongoing risks to this outlook that include  trade tensions as well as the other uncertainties discussed earlier.\nImplications for monetary policy\nI believe the Federal Reserve has  made good progress in achieving its dual-mandate objectives of maximum  sustainable employment and price stability. In addition, we have made progress  in normalizing monetary policy and in reducing the size of our balance sheet.\nI am mindful of the fact that GDP  growth is made up of growth in the workforce plus growth in productivity. The  current economic expansion has now lasted for nearly 10 years, and we are  likely somewhat late in the business cycle, with relatively less spare  labor-force capacity to help support continued robust growth.\nI believe that the Treasury yield  curve is sending cautionary signals regarding expectations for medium- and  longer-term GDP growth. These sluggish expectations are reflective of key  structural headwinds discussed in this as well as previous essays ,  which include: 1) aging-population demographics that are likely creating slower  workforce growth, 2) limited improvements in productivity growth due in part to  lagging education and skill levels in the U.S., and 3) high levels of corporate  and federal government debt in the U.S. that are stimulative on the way up but  can create impediments to growth if debt levels need to be moderated. Further,  it is our view at the Dallas Fed that globalization is likely an opportunity to  achieve higher levels of economic growth and that some resolution of current  trade tensions is critical to seizing this opportunity.\nBased on these various factors, and in light of the  uncertainties described in this note, I believe it would be prudent for the Fed  to exercise patience and refrain from taking further action on the federal  funds rate until the economic outlook becomes somewhat clearer. I expect we  will get some further clarity during the first half of 2019.\nIn addition, it is my expectation  that inflation readings will remain somewhat muted in 2019. As I mentioned  earlier, it is my view that the structural forces of automation, technology-enabled  disruption and globalization will continue to offset, at least in part, the  cyclical pressures created by a historically tight labor market. As a result, I  believe the Fed has the luxury of being patient over the next several months. Exercising  patience will be critical if we are to achieve our dual-mandate objectives of  maximum sustainable employment and price stability.\nRobert S.

    "text": "A Discussion of Economic Conditions, Key Secular Trends and the Limits of Monetary Policy\nNovember 30, 2016 New York City\nThank you for having me here today at the Economic Club of New York.\nI spent 23 years working on Wall Street. Much of my business career and many of my nonprofit activities have been based in this city. Many of my closest friends and mentors live in New York, and some are in attendance this morning. So I am very glad to be visiting with you here today.\nAs most of you know, I have been president and CEO of the Dallas Fed since September 2015. In this role, I have now participated in 10 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings and am firmly ensconced in performing the key duties of a Federal Reserve Bank president. In that regard, I have spent a substantial amount of time getting to know business and community leaders throughout the Eleventh District and have developed good working relationships with the other Federal Reserve Bank presidents and the Board of Governors.\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. We represent the Eleventh District, which is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.\nAs you probably also know, Texas now accounts for 8.7 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). [1] It is the largest exporting state in the U.S. and is home to 52 Fortune 500 companies. The characteristics of our district help give the Dallas Fed excellent insight into energy, trade, immigration and other key aspects of the regional, national and global economies.\nToday, I would like to speak with you about my assessment of economic conditions as well as my views regarding monetary policy. After that, I will look forward to taking your questions.\nDiscussion of Economic Conditions\nLet me begin my remarks by talking about energy, given its importance to the Eleventh District as well as the United States. As you know, energy prices have substantially declined since June of 2014. In early 2014, the mining sector, composed substantially of oil and gas exploration and services, accounted for approximately 2.8 percent of U.S. GDP. By early 2016, the sector had declined to approximately 1.3 percent of GDP. [2]\nAt the Dallas Fed, we believe that global oil production and consumption will get into rough balance by sometime in the first half of 2017. This balancing process could be accelerated if there is a more explicit agreement worked out between OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) nations to limit production levels.\nWhile there are varying estimates of the timing of reaching balance, we believe that the overall trend is the key—we are moving toward balance. Our analysis is based on the expectation that global oil supply will grow at a slower rate and that daily demand will continue to grow, on average, at approximately 1.3 million barrels per day for the remainder of 2016 and at a similar rate in 2017.\nThis balancing process has been more painful and slower than some had anticipated. While average daily U.S. oil production has declined by as much as 1 million barrels over the past year, this decline has been more than offset by production increases in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and other countries. As a result of these developments, global oil supply reductions have been slow to materialize, and excess inventories of oil products now stand at record-high levels.\nAs we look ahead to 2017 and 2018, we expect to see continued price volatility. However, as the market moves toward balance, we expect to see excess inventories stabilize and then begin to decline, and prices continue to firm. Despite this firming, we expect to see more bankruptcies, restructurings and merger activity in the energy sector in the U.S. While rig count has increased over the past few months, based on our energy surveys and discussions with market participants, we believe that rig count is unlikely to increase significantly in the U.S. until prices rise to between $55 and $65 per barrel.\nA weak energy sector and a stronger dollar have created headwinds for our district. The rate of job growth in Texas for the first half of 2016 was just below 1 percent. We saw continuing job losses in energy as well as weakness in the state’s manufacturing sector and slowing growth in its service sector. However, as the headwinds from energy begin to subside, we are starting to experience faster growth. In this regard, we now expect to see approximately 2 percent job growth in the second half of 2016 and a similar rate of growth in 2017.\nTexas continues to benefit from the migration of people and firms to the state. The population in Texas stood at approximately 27.5 million in 2015 versus 22.8 million in 2005. [3] As a result of an increasingly diversified economy as well as continued migration of people and firms to the state, I am very optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the months and years ahead.\nU.S. GDP growth in the first half of 2016 was a disappointing 1.1 percent. [4] Underpinning this weak growth was the financial turmoil in the first quarter of this year as well as a sizable inventory deceleration in the second quarter. Estimates of third-quarter GDP growth now show an improvement to 3.2 percent. Based on these estimates and our confidence in the strength of the U.S. consumer, we now expect full-year 2016 GDP growth of approximately 2 percent.\nThis is sluggish growth by historical standards but should still be sufficient to continue to drive down the unemployment rate and remove slack from the labor market. In assessing labor slack, we look at the headline rate of unemployment of 4.9 percent, but we also track the participation rate, estimates of the number of people working part time for economic reasons and other measures of labor market utilization. The participation rate stands at 62.8 percent versus 66 percent in 2007. [5] Our economists at the Dallas Fed believe that much of this decline is due to changes in demographics—that is, workers are aging out of the labor force. This trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as almost all advanced economies. For example, within the next 10 years, we expect the participation rate to fall below 61 percent if no mitigating actions are taken. [6] Without a material improvement in the rate of U.S. productivity growth, this trend is likely to have significant negative implications for future potential GDP growth.\nRegarding inflation, our Dallas Fed economists track headline inflation and other measures of core inflation, including the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate. This measure trims out the most extreme upward and downward monthly price movements. It has been running consistently at 1.7 percent since the start of 2016, up from 1.6 percent in 2015. The stability and trend of this measure gives us confidence that the headline inflation rate should gradually reach the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target in the medium term. Progress in reaching this objective has been frustratingly slow over the past few years.\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team is closely monitoring economic developments outside the U.S. to assess how these developments might impact economic growth domestically. In this regard, we are closely watching the impact of Brexit on the U.K. and European economies as well as monitoring the risk of contagion. At this stage, I believe that the impact of Brexit is likely to be very manageable for the U.S.\nOur Dallas Fed research team is also monitoring emerging-market countries, particularly China. China has a high degree of overcapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises), high and growing levels of debt, and is in the midst of a multiyear transition from being a manufacturing- and export-driven economy to one that is based on consumer spending and services. We think this transition is likely to take many years, and the world is going to have to become accustomed to lower rates of Chinese growth. This deceleration, coupled with high levels of debt, is likely to create currency volatility and make global markets more vulnerable to periodic bouts of turmoil—which could have the potential to tighten global financial conditions.\nBroader Secular Trends\nIn addition to monitoring key cyclical trends in the economy, I also closely monitor more persistent secular drivers, which help explain shorter-term economic results. I am particularly focused on four key drivers:\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nAs you know, the Fed has a mandate to pursue full employment and price stability. Regarding our full-employment objective, as I just discussed, I believe we are making good progress toward reaching our goal. I do believe that, in a more interconnected world, labor slack should be assessed in a global context. Excess capacity outside the U.S. may be dampening inflation pressures in the U.S. As a result, I think we may still have some capacity for further job growth without overheating the economy or unduly stressing the capacity of the U.S. workforce.\nIn terms of price stability, even though headline inflation continues to run below our 2 percent objective, I believe that, as the impacts of lower energy prices and a stronger dollar begin to dissipate and as the labor market continues to tighten, headline inflation will likely trend toward our 2 percent objective in the medium term.\nIn light of the challenges posed by the broad secular drivers I discussed earlier, I have been suggesting that removal of accommodation should be done gradually and patiently. I am cognizant that, from a risk-management point of view, our monetary policy tools are asymmetrical at or near the zero lower bound—that is, it is easier to tighten policy than to ease policy at this point in the normalization process.\nLastly, I have repeatedly stated that I believe it is important that we strive to take steps to “normalize” monetary policy because there is a cost to excessive accommodation in terms of penalizing savers, as well as creating potential distortions and imbalances in asset allocation, investing, hiring and other business decisions. These imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very painful to address.\nBased on these considerations, as we continue to make progress in achieving our dual mandate, I would advocate that we take action to remove some amounts of accommodation.\nLet me now turn to a discussion of the appropriate role of monetary policy.\nThe Role of Monetary Policy\nAs you know, the target range for the federal funds rate stands at 25 to 50 basis points. It is worth noting that the last time short-term interest rates in the United States were this low was during the middle and late 1930s as the U.S. struggled to emerge from the Great Depression. While policy rates are historically low, real government bond yields—returns after inflation—are also at historically low levels across a wide swath of countries, including the United States.\nA major driver of these historically low rates is the decline in expectations for future economic growth. As I have discussed, key persistent trends—particularly aging-workforce demographics, as well as weak productivity growth—are having a negative impact on growth prospects in the U.S. as well as in most other advanced economies. An additional likely reason for the persistence of low interest rates is the emergence of the U.S. as a chief supplier of safe assets to the world. In an increasingly financially interconnected world, the search for safety and return occurs globally—which means that low rates in one country can quickly impact interest rates in other countries.\nMonetary policy has a key role to play in economic policy. However, at or near the zero lower bound, it may be less effective than other tools of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural issues we face today stemming from demographic changes, lower levels of productivity growth, high levels of debt to GDP, as well as the dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates of technology-enabled economic disruption. While monetary policy certainly has a key role to play, it is not a substitute for actions that could address more fundamental economic challenges.\nFor the past eight years, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, advanced economies have relied heavily on monetary policy and much less on structural reforms and fiscal policy. However, at this stage, if we are going to generate higher sustainable rates of GDP growth and address key secular challenges, there needs to be policy action beyond monetary policy. This action could take a variety of forms.\nPotential Policy Actions Beyond Monetary Policy\nGiven that aging-workforce demographics are expected to create headwinds for future economic growth, more could be done to explore policies that could grow the workforce in the years ahead. Appropriate immigration policy is likely to be a key element of this effort. Historically, immigration has played an important role in economic growth in the U.S. It is estimated that immigrants and their children have comprised more than half of the growth in the labor force in the U.S. over the past two decades. [8]\nPolicies that involve greater emphasis on improving levels of educational attainment are likely to be critical in order to ensure that an increasing percentage of our population can become more productive members of the workforce. Options for improving educational attainment could include beefing up public/private partnerships that focus on vocational training that equips workers for technical and other skill-based opportunities of the 21st century. These programs could help to grow the workforce and address the skills gap that has been identified by numerous companies we speak with in the Eleventh District.\nPublic investments that upgrade aging infrastructure could potentially improve productivity and help bolster sluggish demand. Given the sizable private pools of capital that exist today, some meaningful portion of this investment could come from public/private partnerships, with substantial capital coming from the private sector.\nMore broadly, tax reform and regulatory policies could be considered in order to create increased incentives for growth and investment, which might ultimately improve future rates of GDP growth. Improved growth expectations could help to counter the forces holding down global interest rates, giving monetary policy makers greater scope for action without resorting to unconventional tools.\nSome observers suggest conducting a comprehensive review of regulations at the national, state and local levels. They argue that, in some cases, excessive regulation and fees might be creating undue burdens on capital investment, lending and the formation and growth of small businesses. This may help explain why business investment and small-business formation have been disappointing over the past several years.\nEntitlement reforms, which involve strengthening Social Security and Medicare without jeopardizing potential benefits for those already 55 or older, could help improve the sustainability and ease the future fiscal burden of these programs. In addition, reforms might reduce current disincentives to remain in the labor force while helping to soften the impact of aging-workforce demographic trends on growth and interest rates. Such reforms, insofar as they ease long-term concerns regarding the sustainability of future government debt burdens (as a percentage of GDP), might also reduce uncertainty about future tax rates and boost growth expectations through that channel.\nThese are some examples of policy actions that could be considered. There are certainly other examples, including efforts to implement more comprehensive trade reforms, which could create a more level global playing field for the movement of goods and services. Policymakers would need to address which of these options might make sense to pursue—but my point is that some of these actions will be necessary to address the fundamental challenges we currently face.\nClosing\nMonetary policy is a key element of economic policy—but it shouldn’t be the only element of policy. To improve future economic outcomes for our citizens, we need to consider structural and fiscal policies alongside sound monetary policy. It has been a pleasure speaking with you today. I would now be happy to take your questions.\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nRobert S.

    "text": "Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy in a Changing World\nJanuary 11, 2016 Dallas\nThank  you for that kind introduction. Thank you for having me here this evening. It’s  a great pleasure for me to speak with you.\nFor  those who I haven’t had a chance to meet yet, I was an investment banker and financial  services executive for almost 23 years and then a professor at Harvard Business  School for 10 years. I grew up in Kansas, went to the University of Kansas and  spent a lot of time as a youngster traveling the state of Texas with my father,  who was a jewelry salesman. I have always had a desire to do public service, so  I was very glad to have the opportunity to lead the Dallas Fed.\nI  have been president of the Dallas Fed since the beginning of September. It’s a  great honor to be able to serve the people of the Eleventh Federal Reserve  District (which includes Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico) and  the nation. I have spent the past four months getting to know business and  community leaders, as well as talking with many other people throughout this  district. I have attended three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings  and developed good working relationships with the other Federal Reserve Bank presidents  as well as the Board of Governors.\nI  have been impressed with the people who live and work in this district and with  our dedicated staff at the Dallas Fed, as well as those who work in the Federal  Reserve System across the nation. I say regularly that, as a citizen, if you  could see what I get to see every day, you would be very proud and gratified by  the work of the people of the Federal Reserve.\nWith  that background, I’d like to speak tonight about the regional, national and  global economies and then talk about implications for monetary policy. If  there’s a theme, it’s how the world has changed and keeps changing. Our job at  the Fed is to work to understand these changes, be continually open to learning  and asking questions, and then strive to make good decisions for the citizens  of this country.\nAs  I speak this evening, my remarks represent my own views and do not necessarily  reflect the views of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nThe  Eleventh District: Discussion of Energy\nI’ll  begin my remarks with a discussion of the energy industry, given its vital  importance to this district and the nation. Since the December Organization of  the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meeting,  the overall tone in the oil and gas sector has soured, as expectations have  decidedly shifted to an “even lower for even longer” price outlook.\nOPEC  seems to have abandoned any pretense of production quotas, and Saudi Arabia  seems to be determined to maintain its market share of production. As a  consequence, it appears that any reduction in supply from Saudi Arabia will  have to be accompanied by proportionate declines from other middle-eastern nations and Russia—this, so  far, seems unlikely.\nOrganization  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) inventories continue to  increase and now stand at roughly 300 million barrels above their historical  five-year average. [1] For 2015, the Department of Energy estimates that global supply exceeded global  demand by an average of 1.7 million barrels per day. [2] As  of today, this gap has declined to approximately 1 million barrels per day and  is expected to ultimately drop to 600,000 barrels per day by year-end 2016. [3] Our economists at the Dallas Fed believe that global excess inventories aren’t  likely to begin falling until 2017. If we are wrong, the risks are that this  rebalancing process will take even longer.\nThis  situation is further complicated by the expectation that Iran sanctions will likely  be lifted in early 2016, and Iran will increase its production shortly  thereafter. Furthermore, our industry contacts suggest that Iran has 30 – 40 million barrels of oil in storage  which, over time, could be sold into the world markets. The prospect of all or  a portion of this supply coming into the market sooner than expected has  increased uncertainty and negatively impacted oil prices.\nAnother  complicating factor is that, despite rig count declines and additional cuts in capital  spending, U.S. oil production declines have been slow to materialize. This  reflects increased output from the Gulf of Mexico, the time lag between capital  spending cuts and production declines, as well as the fact that shale-well productivity has improved over  the past several years.\nAll  this suggests that 2016 will be a challenging year for oil producers. On the  positive side, lower oil prices translate into lower gasoline prices for  consumers. These lower prices have helped generate stronger automobile driving  activity as well as record auto sales in the U.S., and underpin our expectation  of a 1.4-million-barrel-per-day increase in global consumption in  2016. [4]\nGiven  these various cross-currents, the ultimate timing of reaching market  production/consumption balance remains uncertain. As a consequence, we expect  to see continued low prices and price volatility, as well as more bankruptcies,  mergers and restructurings in the energy industry.\nBroad Economic  Conditions in the Eleventh District\nCertainly,  the Eleventh District economy has been adversely impacted by low oil prices as  well as strength in the dollar. As a result of these challenges, Texas job  growth slowed to approximately 1.3 percent in 2015, and Dallas Fed economists  expect similar growth in 2016. [5] This  compares with the 3.6 percent job growth the state experienced in 2014. [6]\nWhile  the Texas energy and manufacturing sectors have been losing jobs, the state’s  service sector has shown steady, moderate expansion. We have seen particular  strength in the health care and the leisure and hospitality industries. We  have also seen recent strength in construction employment in the state.\nIt  is worth noting that migration of firms and people has been a key underpinning of  economic growth in this state. Since 2000, the average annual rate of  population growth in Texas has been almost a full percentage point higher than the  rest of the nation. [7] Despite some slowing due  to the downturn in energy, I expect this migration trend to continue albeit at  a slower rate. Due to the diversified nature of the state’s economy and  continued attractiveness of the state as a destination for firms and people, I  am very optimistic about the resiliency and overall economic outlook for this district  in the years ahead.\nEconomic Conditions  in the Nation\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) and  Employment Dallas  Fed economists estimate that the U.S. economy grew approximately 2 percent in 2015.  While this rate of growth is sluggish by historical standards, it was  sufficient to drive down the rate of unemployment from 5.6 percent at the  beginning of the year to 5.0 percent by year-end. [8] Our economists expect 2016  GDP growth of somewhere between 2.0 and 2.5 percent.\nAs  with the Eleventh District, the U.S. service sector has been the primary growth  engine in the United States. A strong dollar combined with relatively weak  growth abroad continues to weigh on U.S. manufacturing and net exports.\nIn  2015, nonfarm payroll job growth averaged 221,000 jobs per month. Dallas Fed  economists estimate that the economy needs to add somewhere between 100,000 and 150,000 jobs per month in order to keep the  unemployment rate roughly constant. We expect sufficient job growth in 2016 to  continue to drive down the rate of unemployment.\nTo  gauge progress toward our full-employment  mandate, we closely monitor various measures of labor market slack beyond the  headline unemployment rate. In particular, we look at the labor force  participation rate, which is the share of the population age 16 and older that  is either employed or actively looking for work. This percentage is currently  at 62.6 percent, which is 3.5 percentage points lower than its prerecession level. [9] At  the Dallas Fed, we assess that while some of this decline is cyclical, more  than half is due to aging workforce demographics. (I’ll talk more about this in  a few moments.)\nWe  also closely monitor the number of “would be” workers who are “discouraged” and  have given up looking for work, as well as the number of part-time workers who would convert to full  time in a stronger job market. Both of these measures have recently shown  improvement, which suggests to us that labor slack is declining and we are  making progress toward our full-employment  objective.\nInflation Headline  inflation readings continue to run below the 2 percent longer-run objective set  by the Federal Reserve. In November, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)  price index was only 0.4 percent higher than a year earlier. [10]\nAt  the Dallas Fed, our preferred measure of inflation is the Trimmed Mean PCE  inflation rate, which “trims out” items with the most extreme upward or  downward monthly changes. We believe this trimming gives us a measure of trend  inflation that is more reliable than so-called  “core” inflation, which excludes food and energy prices. The 12-month change in the trimmed mean has  run between 1.6 and 1.7 percent since early 2014. The stability of this  measure, in combination with anticipated further reductions in labor market  slack, gives us confidence that headline PCE inflation will gradually increase  to 2 percent by year-end 2017.\nWorld  Economic Conditions\nWe  estimate that 2015 global GDP growth, excluding the U.S., was 2.5 percent. [11] This headline growth rate masks a very uneven underlying picture. For example,  emerging economies with high levels of exposure to commodities showed  significant declines in growth rates. Brazil, Russia and Venezuela were in  outright recession during 2015, and we expect negative GDP growth again in  these countries in 2016. On the other hand, India’s GDP growth rate was 7.3  percent in 2015 and is expected to increase further in 2016. [12]\nLooking  ahead to 2016, Dallas Fed economists expect global growth, excluding the U.S.,  to gradually improve to 2.9 percent. While this reflects improvements in both  advanced as well as emerging-market  economies, it is relatively sluggish compared with past rates of growth and  comes with some meaningful level of downside risk. One  potential concern is China. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that  China growth will slow to approximately 6.3 percent in 2016 versus a reported  growth rate of 6.9 percent in 2015. [13] This  slowing has been manifested in dramatic swings in the Chinese stock market (which  have, in turn, spilled over into global financial markets), as well as in Chinese  government actions intended to address some of their key economic challenges.\nOvercapacity  in key industries (particularly in state-owned  enterprises), higher levels of leverage, and aging demographics are key  challenges likely to impede growth. These issues are secular and will take  years to address. In addition, China has embarked on a longer-term initiative to transition its  economy to be more consumer and service-sector  based from one that is heavily manufacturing and export based.\nAs  a result of these factors, it seems probable that the world will have to adjust  to lower levels of Chinese growth in the years ahead. Slower Chinese growth has  the potential to further impact commodity prices and create headwinds for GDP  growth in the U.S. and other economies.\nOpenness to  Learning in a Changing World\nAs  I mentioned earlier, I grew up in Kansas and went to college in Kansas. As I  was starting my professional career, there were a few things that I (and  seemingly) everyone else knew to be true:\nWe  had never heard of the Internet, mobile devices or online news/content  providers, which would allow us to get information immediately and would substantially  disrupt the traditional newspaper industry. Japan suffered through decades of  slow growth and increasingly challenging issues with high levels of government  debt, a shrinking population and aging demographics. And we know what happened  with housing and interest rates.\nThe  point is, what we know “for sure” is not always correct. The world evolves, and  we have to be open-minded and adapt  to the changes. We have to be willing to learn and, when the facts warrant,  modify our views. This way of thinking is particularly important to me as a  participant in the monetary policy deliberations of the FOMC.\nBecause  the world has changed and keeps changing, some of the key tools we use to  assess economic conditions must be assessed and reassessed in this context. For  example, the Phillips curve has been a critical tool in analyzing the  interaction of unemployment rates with inflation. In this current recovery, we  are moving toward increasingly low rates of unemployment, but we have not yet  seen an increase in headline inflation. Of course, this inflation shortfall may  be due to transitory factors, but we are also aware there may be other more  fundamental issues at play here.\nAdditionally,  during this recovery, the labor-force  participation rate has remained low by historical standards. As a result, some  have questioned whether the headline unemployment rate remains the best measure  of labor slack.\nWhy  is this happening?\nI  believe there are several key factors that may be impacting economic conditions  and should influence the way we think about monetary policy.\nDemographic Trends The  United States and other major economies, including Europe, Japan and China, are  all facing the challenge of aging demographics. For example, in the United  States, as the baby-boomer  generation moves into retirement age, the fraction of the labor force age 55 or  older is projected to increase from approximately 21.7 percent in 2014 to  almost 25 percent in 2024. [14] Looking further ahead, the median age of the labor force is expected to rise  steadily through 2060. [15]\nAging  demographics are likely to negatively impact labor force participation rates.  As I mentioned earlier, the labor force participation rate in the U.S. has  fallen about 3.5 percentage points since late 2007. [16] While the 2008–09 recession certainly had a great impact, we believe that more  than half of the decline can be explained by aging. Individuals age 55 and over  tend to have lower participation rates than do younger individuals.\nBased  on current demographic trends, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the  overall labor force participation rate will decline 2 percentage points further  to 60.9 percent by 2024. [17] Since GDP growth is substantially impacted by growth in the labor force plus  improvements in labor productivity, these trends suggest that, assuming no  mitigating actions are taken, potential GDP growth rates may well be negatively  impacted in the future.\nIn  addition, these demographics suggest that the “dependency ratio”—which is  crudely measured as the ratio of population under age 18 or over 64 to the  population 18–64—will rise. The implication is that an increasing share of the  population will “depend” on those of working age to pay for future medical and  retirement benefits. This higher dependency ratio may have implications for the  ability of countries to meet their obligations for retirement and medical  benefits.\nOf  course, these demographic forecasts are just that—forecasts. Policymakers and  other agents have the ability to take actions, and events can occur, which  alter or offset these trends, improve productivity or otherwise mitigate their  impact. The point is that, as policymakers, we have to be aware of them and be  open to adjusting our thinking and our policies in ways that take them into  account.\nLevels of Debt to GDP Another  factor potentially impacting economic conditions is growth in the levels of  debt relative to GDP. For much of my lifetime, the household, business and  government sectors of the United States have been able to increase their levels  of debt relative to overall GDP. This has had the effect, during some periods,  of increasing GDP growth rates. Some have referred to this as the so-called “debt super cycle” and  suggested that, in the future, additional borrowing will more likely need to be  supported by corresponding growth in incomes.\nCertainly,  since the Great Recession, the household sector in the U.S. has been  deleveraging. However, business debt as a share of GDP has grown somewhat  (although importantly, the financial sector has deleveraged), and government  debt to GDP has also risen. Currently, federal debt held by the public is  approximately 73 percent of GDP, up from 33 percent in 2000 [18] and, in addition, the present value of future unfunded obligations for  Medicare, Social Security and other entitlement programs is estimated by the  Congressional Budget Office to be approximately $40 trillion. [19] These  unfunded nondiscretionary obligations are expected to cause the U.S. budget  deficit to materially increase as a percentage of GDP over the next 10 years  and beyond. [20] This path may prove to be  unsustainable.\nOutside  the U.S., high levels of debt to GDP in certain countries are likely to impact  these countries’ future ability to grow. China and Japan, for example, may find  it difficult to stimulate GDP by growing debt beyond levels supported by income  growth.\nThe  level of borrowing relative to GDP is a key factor I will be watching, in the  U.S. and abroad, in assessing economic conditions in the months and years ahead.\nGlobalization Today,  U.S. companies are able to source and produce products and services in multiple  countries to lower their costs. Increasingly, U.S. consumers are able to  benefit from lower-cost imports as  well as lower-cost services due to  globalization. Companies increasingly think about their labor, products and  services with a global mindset. This greater amount of global connectivity  means that economic conditions in each country can much more quickly impact  economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries.\nOne  implication of this is that domestic labor slack has to be assessed in a global  context. This means that the headline unemployment rate necessary to achieve  full employment can likely be lower for a time than we’ve been historically  accustomed to without triggering undue inflation pressures.\nThe  point is that, as the world becomes even more interconnected and the  “transmission” of global economic conditions accelerates, we have to  increasingly consider world economic conditions in assessing our own.\nIncreasing Rates of Disruption Consumers  increasingly are able to use technology to rapidly compare prices for goods and  services. In addition, new business models are emerging, which offer products  and services that “disrupt” older models—think Uber versus a taxi or car  service, Airbnb versus a hotel room, Amazon versus a retail store. These new  business models are having the impact of lowering prices and improving service  and convenience. They are also helping improve the bargaining power of  consumers.\nThese  trends are encouraging many companies to look for new ways to use technology to  lower their costs as well as improve productivity and customer service. It may  be hard to measure, but I certainly believe these changes are putting some  downward pressure on the prices of many types of goods and services.\nCertainly,  there are various exceptions to this trend such as prescription drugs and  affordable luxuries (like a Starbucks coffee). However, increasingly, business  models are being disrupted in ways that would not have been imagined only a few  years ago. These changes are impacting the way companies think about  traditional capital spending and their choices for how to spend additional  resources.\nIt  is difficult to determine the ultimate impacts of aging demographics, high  levels of indebtedness, globalization and increasing disruption. However, these  are key issues that policymakers will need to better understand in order to  assess economic conditions and formulate appropriate economic policies.\nMonetary  Policy\nI agree with, and argued for, the  decision made in December by the FOMC to increase the federal funds rate. In  our post-FOMC meeting statement, we  emphasized that, even with this increase, monetary policy remains  accommodative. We also emphasized that future removals of accommodation will  likely be done gradually and will depend on our ongoing assessment of incoming  economic data and overall economic conditions.\nAs  we go forward, I will be closely monitoring various measures of labor market  slack to assess progress toward our full-employment  objective. As the unemployment rate moves below 5 percent, I would expect to  see the inflation rate gradually increase toward our 2 percent objective in the  medium term. Additionally, our economists will be considering how a stronger  dollar and more subdued rates of growth outside the U.S. might adversely affect  GDP, unemployment and inflation in this country. We’ll also be working to  better understand the potential impact of some of the secular issues I have  discussed tonight.\nI  believe that continuing along the path of monetary policy normalization is  important. There are various costs to maintaining excessive accommodation for  too long—particularly in terms of potential distortions in investment,  inventory and hiring decisions, which may need to be (painfully) unwound when  policy normalizes. My experience is that these imbalances are sometimes easier  to recognize in hindsight.\nIn  thinking about these questions, we’re sensitive to the fact that monetary  policy affects the economy with a lag. As consequence, if we delay further  normalization until we actually see evidence of excessive accommodation, there  is a risk that we will have waited too long.\nIn  addition, as we go through this period, I would not be surprised to see more  bouts of volatility in the financial markets. The challenge for policymakers is  to appropriately consider these movements, without over-reading or misinterpreting them, in assessing underlying economic  conditions.\nThank  you for the opportunity to speak today. I look forward to getting to know you  better in the months and years ahead. Now, I would be very happy to take your  questions.\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official   positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nRobert S.

    "text": "A Discussion of Key Secular Trends, Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy\nApril 29, 2016 Dallas\nI want to thank  the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum for inviting me here  today. I have worked extensively with British and European companies over the  past 25 years, so I am very pleased to be able to talk with you today.\nI have been president  of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas since the beginning of September. The  Dallas Fed has approximately 1,200 employees and oversees the Eleventh  District, which is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New  Mexico.\nAs you know, the  Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States. It was legally  established by Congress in 1913 and is charged with the mission of ensuring the  stability and flexibility of the nation’s monetary and financial systems. It is  responsible for monetary policy, regulation and supervision of banking  institutions, and providing certain financial services to banks and the U.S. federal  government (which includes playing a key role in the nation’s payment system).  It is comprised of a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., as well as 12  regional banks distributed across the United States. Each region is numbered  and referred to as a “district.”\nThe Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) is the key monetary policymaking body within the  Federal Reserve System. It holds eight scheduled meetings a year to assess economic  conditions in the U.S. and decide on the stance of monetary policy. FOMC  participants include all members of the Board of Governors as well as the 12  regional Bank presidents. The governors, the president of the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other regional Bank presidents  vote on policy at each FOMC meeting.\nThe Fed has been structured  to be independent within the federal government, and the chair of the Board of  Governors provides regular reports to Congress on the economy and monetary  policy. Most central banks globally have been set up in a similar manner, with independence  (that is, insulation from short-term political pressure) as a key feature of  their operating models.\nSince joining the  Fed, I have participated in six FOMC meetings. I have also spent a substantial amount  of time getting to know business and community leaders throughout the Eleventh  District and developed good working relationships with the other Federal  Reserve Bank presidents and the Board of Governors.\nI have so far been  very impressed with the dedication and commitment to excellence of my Fed  colleagues in the Eleventh District and across the nation. I have also learned  that the Fed benefits greatly from a diversity of views and a process which  seeks out insight from members of the private sector, community leaders and  other citizens. I have been impressed with the substantial amount of time  volunteered by business leaders and nonprofit leaders in monthly board  meetings, economic surveys and one-on-one meetings which inform and supplement  our analysis of economic conditions.\nToday,  I’d like to speak with you about my assessment of economic conditions as well  as my views regarding monetary policy. I’d like to start my remarks with a  brief discussion of some of the larger secular issues that I see forming the  broader context for our work.\nThe  Broader Context\nI came to the Fed  because I believe that, as challenging as the past eight years have been, the  next period of time is likely to be just as complex. While the U.S. and the world  have made good progress in recovering from the economic crisis, we still face a  number of significant challenges. Many of these issues arise from longer-term  secular forces that have been taking shape over the past several years and are  likely to exert even greater influence in the future.\nGlobalization The  world has become much more interconnected over the past several decades. Major  companies have become more global and have increasingly spread their operations  throughout the world in order to serve customers and improve their  competiveness. This geographic expansion has improved flexibility in sourcing  and producing in order to manage logistics and lower costs.\nCompanies  increasingly think about their labor, products and services with a global  mindset. By and large, corporate revenue and profit growth have been enhanced by  globalization even though this trend has clearly created strains on cities and  towns which have seen jobs and industries relocate to other geographic regions.  As evidence of this trend, S&P 500 companies now derive as much as 50  percent of their earnings from operations outside the United States. [1]\nAs global trade between  countries has expanded, economic conditions in one nation now have a greater potential  to impact economic conditions in other nations. These impacts are generally  transmitted through the trade of goods and services as well as through impacts  on labor market dynamics.\nWhile economies  are more globally connected, financial markets have also become much more interconnected.  Investment portfolios are increasingly global, and asset allocators increasingly  think globally in making investment decisions. Because financial markets trade  in real time, market strains or other challenges in one market now have the  potential to rapidly affect currency, debt and equity markets globally.\nWe  certainly saw the effects of this interconnectedness during the financial  crisis of 2008–09. More recently, and on a much smaller scale, we saw how turmoil  in currencies and local markets in certain countries in early 2016 helped lead  to global market volatility and a rapid tightening of overall financial  conditions.\nDemographics A second major  challenge is demographics. The United States and other major economies,  including Europe, Japan and China, are all facing the issue of aging populations.  For example, in the U.S. as the baby-boomer generation moves into retirement  age, the fraction of the labor force age 55 or older is projected to increase  from approximately 21.7 percent in 2014 to almost 25 percent in 2024. [2] Looking further ahead, the median age of the labor force is expected to rise  steadily through 2060.\nIn the Euro area,  we estimate that the working-age population, as a percentage of the total  population, has been declining since 1990. Further, we estimate that the  absolute size of the working-age population likely peaked in 2010 at  approximately 219 million and has since declined in absolute terms and will  continue to decline in the coming decades. [3] In the United Kingdom, we expect the  working-age population will continue to grow, although at a somewhat slower  pace than growth in the total population.\nThese  demographic trends bear directly on the rates of workforce participation and,  in turn, impact rates of potential economic growth in advanced economies. For  example, based on current demographic trends, the U.S. Bureau of Labor  Statistics estimates that the labor participation rate in the U.S. will decline  2 percentage points to approximately 61 percent by 2024. [4] Assuming no  mitigating actions are taken, this will likely have some negative impact on  potential GDP (gross domestic product) growth rates in the future.\nHigh Levels of  Debt to GDP While these demographic  trends continue to unfold, it is also the case that levels of debt to GDP have  increased in advanced economies. In the U.S., for example, household balance  sheets have improved since the crisis but business debt to GDP is somewhat  higher and government debt to GDP has also increased.\nWhile the U.S.  government debt held by the public is approximately 75 percent of GDP, [5] it is  estimated that the present value of underfunded “entitlements” is now in excess  of $40 trillion. [6] These underfunded obligations will increasingly work their  way into the annual budget deficit over the next five to 10 years and will help  to increase the U.S. budget deficit as a percentage of GDP.\nThe demographic  trends I just described are likely to put increasing strains on the ability of  advanced economies to meet these growing obligations. In light of these  demographics, there is some question as to whether these U.S. budget trends  will prove to be unsustainable and whether similar strains will be felt in  Japan, China and the U.K. as well as most major countries in Europe.\nIn addition, the  rising future burden of entitlements, coupled with a higher degree of political  polarization in certain countries, has likely impaired the capacity for fiscal policy  actions, which could have potentially contributed to economic recoveries around  the world. This, in turn, has put substantial focus on the role of monetary  policy to address important economic challenges. While monetary policy has a  key role to play in this regard, it was never designed nor intended to act in  isolation; fiscal policy as well as other governmental actions must also play  key roles.\nIncreasing  Rates of Disruption\nWhile  these larger forces are unfolding, the rate of disruption in industry is  increasing. Consumers increasingly are able to use technology to rapidly compare  prices for goods and services. New business models are emerging which offer  products and services in a superior manner to older models. Amazon versus a  retail store is a classic example.\nThese trends are  encouraging companies to look for new ways to use technology to lower costs,  improve productivity and enhance customer service. While the impacts can be  hard to measure, I believe these changes are reducing the pricing power of companies  and putting some degree of downward pressure on the prices of many types of  goods and services. This, in turn, is affecting the way companies think about  traditional capital spending and overall resource allocation.\nIt is difficult to  fully determine the ultimate impacts of these secular trends on economic  growth, labor market dynamics and price stability. However, I do believe that  these underlying forces are likely to have a significant impact on economic conditions  in the years ahead. These forces will also have significant implications for  monetary as well as fiscal policy. As the world has become more complex, central  bankers must work to better understand these issues in order to make sound  judgments regarding monetary policy.\nWith  this backdrop, let me turn to a discussion of economic conditions in the Eleventh  District, the United States and the world. I will then briefly discuss the  implications of these conditions for U.S. monetary policy.\nEleventh  District Discussion of Energy\nI’ll start with a  discussion of energy because of its impact on the Eleventh District as well as  its importance to the nation and the world.\nAs we sit here  today, Dallas Fed economists estimate that global daily oil production exceeds  daily consumption by more than 1 million barrels per day. [7] It is our current  expectation that global oil supply and demand will get into some degree of daily  balance by early 2017. This current estimate assumes that non-OPEC (Organization  of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) production will decline significantly  during the latter half of this year. This estimate is also underpinned by our forecast  that global demand will grow by approximately 1.2 million barrels per day in  2016. [8] Lastly, this forecast assumes that supply disruptions, such as those  that have occurred in Nigeria, Iraq and Kuwait, are ultimately resolved, with  production being restored.\nIt is worth noting  that, despite very significant cuts in capital spending in the U.S., supply  reductions have been slow to materialize over the past year. When supply  reductions have occurred in non-OPEC nations, they have been more than offset  by production increases from Iran, Russia and other nations.\nAs a result of this  recent prolonged period of oversupply, excess inventories in the OECD  (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) member countries now  stand at approximately 440 million barrels .[9] This is a record level of excess  inventory and has raised concerns about whether there is sufficient storage  capacity in certain geographic areas.\nWe believe that  market participants have taken some comfort—potentially too much comfort—from discussions  of a potential production freeze by OPEC members as well as Russia. We have  consistently believed that any such negotiations would be unlikely to lead to  actual production declines, and that Iran intends to increase its production  until its output reaches pre-sanction levels.\nWith  these various crosscurrents, we expect 2016 to be a year of continued price  volatility as production estimates continue to fluctuate and forecasts  regarding the timing of supply/demand balance continue to be adjusted. We also expect  to see a continuing high level of restructurings, bankruptcies and (where  possible) mergers in the energy industry.\nEleventh District Overall Economic  Conditions\nAs I mentioned  earlier, the Eleventh District of the Federal Reserve is comprised of Texas,  northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. While energy is an important part  of this region, its share of GDP has declined over the past two years. In  particular, the energy industry is now approximately 2 percent of Texas  employment [10] and 9 percent of GDP [11] (versus 3 percent of employment and 14  percent of GDP in 2014).\nTexas has  substantially diversified its economy over the past 25 years. Some of this  diversification has occurred organically, and a significant portion has  developed as a result of a sustained migration of people and firms to the  state. Since 2000, population growth in Texas has exceeded that of the nation  by a full 1 percentage point a year. This growth and diversification have  helped contribute to the resiliency of the state despite headwinds from energy  as well as a strong dollar.\nIn 2016, Dallas  Fed economists expect job growth between 0.5 and 1 percent, as compared with 1.3  percent in 2015 and 3.7 percent in 2014. [12] Manufacturing remains weak, but  the state’s service sector continues to show steady growth. Risks to our  forecast are to the downside as depressed conditions in the energy sector continue  to ripple through the Texas economy.\nAs  a result of a more highly diversified economy as well as the continued  migration of people and firms to Texas, I am very optimistic about the growth  prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the years ahead—particularly  as the negative impacts of declining oil prices begin to dissipate.\nEconomic  Conditions in the U.S. Economy\nEstimates  of first-quarter GDP growth in the U.S. have been disappointing. Based on a  strong consumer, our economists at the Dallas Fed expect that GDP growth will  improve over the remainder of this year—and we now forecast growth of approximately  2 percent in 2016. This is sluggish growth by historical standards but should  be sufficient to continue to drive down the unemployment rate below the current  5 percent reading.\nIn addition to the  headline unemployment rate, we also closely watch the labor participation rate,  which now stands at approximately 63 percent. [13] While the participation rate  is lower than the 66 percent reading in 2007, Dallas Fed economists believe  that more than half of the decline is due to aging of the population. We also  track estimates of the number of part-time workers who might convert to full  time in a stronger job market. Both of these measures have shown signs of improvement  in recent months.\nIt is my own view  that labor market slack needs to be viewed in a global context. That is, excess  capacity outside the United States may impact the level of labor slack within  the U.S. as companies increasingly think globally about their workforce  configuration and deployment. As a result, I believe that we may be able to achieve  levels of unemployment that are lower than we have been historically accustomed,  without creating near-term inflation pressures.\nIn  terms of inflation, our economists look at headline levels but also look  closely at the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE (personal consumption  expenditures) measure of core inflation. This measure trims out those items  with the most extreme upward and downward monthly price movements. While the  headline measure of inflation has been running well below our 2 percent  objective, the 12-month change in the trimmed mean ranged consistently between 1.6  and 1.7 percent from early 2014 until the end of 2015. This measure has ticked  up to between 1.8 and 1.9 percent in 2016. [14] These readings give us confidence  that headline inflation will ultimately increase toward our 2 percent objective  over the medium term.\nGlobal  Economic Conditions\nOur economists at  the Dallas Fed closely monitor economic conditions outside the U.S. because, in  a globally connected world, these conditions have the potential to impact the  U.S. economy.\n2016 estimates of  growth outside the U.S. continue to decline. The underlying composition of  these growth estimates is highly uneven. In particular, commodity-sensitive  countries such as Venezuela, Brazil and Russia are in recession, while most advanced  economies show steady but moderate rates of growth.\nAs mentioned in my  opening comments, most advanced economies are challenged by aging-demographic  trends as well as high levels of debt relative to GDP. In my view, both these  trends create headwinds for current and future economic growth. These issues  are particularly acute in Japan, where the population is declining and its  dependency ratio—the ratio of those age 14 and under plus those 65 and over  relative to those 15–64—has been rising since the early 1990s. [15] Similar  dynamics, although less severe, are also unfolding in Europe.\nIn addition, we  are closely watching China, given its size and importance to world GDP growth. China  grew at a reported rate of 6.9 percent in 2015. [16] We estimate that this  growth rate will slow to 6.5 percent in 2016 and likely trend lower in  subsequent years. [17] China is dealing with high levels of overcapacity  (particularly in state-owned enterprises), high levels of debt and an aging  workforce. In addition, it has embarked on a longer-term transition from being  an export- and investment-driven economy to one that is dominated by services  and the consumer. This is likely to be a very difficult transition, which will  play out over many years as opposed to quarters. Given these various  challenges, we believe that the world is going to need to adjust to lower levels  of Chinese growth in the years ahead.\nChina’s  challenges are likely to have some spillover effects on emerging-market  countries as well as the U.S. and other advanced economies. Possibly more  significantly, China’s challenges have the potential to transmit to financial  markets through heightened currency volatility as well as periodic bouts of  tightening in global financial conditions.\nImplications  for Monetary Policy\nAs you know, the  Fed has a mandate to pursue full employment and price stability. Regarding our  full-employment objective, I believe we are making good progress toward  reaching our goal.\nAs I mentioned  earlier, I believe that, in a more interconnected world, labor slack should be  assessed in a global context. Excess capacity outside the U.S. may dampen  inflation pressures in the U.S. at a given level of unemployment. I am  encouraged by the recent uptick in the labor participation rate to 63 percent.  I think it suggests that we can make even further progress on so-called  discouraged workers reentering the labor force. As a result, we may still have  capacity for healthy job growth without overheating the economy or unduly  stressing the capacity of the U.S. workforce.\nIn terms of price  stability, headline inflation continues to run below our 2 percent objective.  However, I believe that, as the impacts of lower energy prices and a strong  dollar ultimately dissipate, headline inflation will gradually trend toward our  core inflation readings. As mentioned earlier, the Trimmed Mean PCE now stands  at between 1.8 and 1.9 percent, and we expect this measure to rise to 2 percent  over the medium term as we move toward full employment.\nI am monitoring  how slowing growth, high levels of overcapacity, and high levels of debt to GDP  in advanced economies outside the U.S. impact economic conditions in the U.S. I  am also closely monitoring how these issues might be affecting the slope of the  U.S. Treasury yield curve as well as measures of tightness in financial  conditions.\nIn light of these  challenges, I have been suggesting that removal of accommodation should be done  gradually and patiently. I am also very cognizant that, from a risk-management  point of view, our monetary policies have an asymmetrical impact at or near the  zero lower bound.\nHowever, I do  believe that the effort to “normalize” monetary policy is important and that  excessive accommodation has a cost in terms of creating distortions in  investing, hiring and other decisions which can create unhealthy imbalances.  These imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very  painful to address.\nAs a result, as we  continue to make progress in achieving our dual mandate, I will advocate that  we take actions to remove some amount of accommodation. However, I will also advocate  that we take these steps in a gradual and patient manner.\nThank you for the  opportunity to speak with you today. Now, I would be very happy to take your  questions.\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official   positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nRobert S.

    "date": "I have been president and CEO of the Dallas Fed since the fall of 2015. The Dallas Fed is one of\nthe 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. The Eleventh District is composed of\nTexas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas accounts for 8.9 percent of U.S.\ngross domestic product (GDP).1 It is the largest exporting state in the U.S. and is home to 52\nFortune 500 companies. The characteristics of our district give the Dallas Fed unique insights\ninto energy, trade and immigration issues, as well as great insight into the regional, national and\nglobal economies.\nWith that backdrop, I’m going to briefly discuss my assessment of economic conditions in the\nU.S. and globally and the implications for monetary policy.\nEnergy\nLet me start with a discussion of energy, given its importance to my district as well as the\nnational and global economies.\nIt is our view at the Dallas Fed that global consumption and production of oil will get into rough\nbalance sometime during the first half of 2017. This process could be accelerated if there is\nimplementation of the agreement between OPEC (and some non-OPEC) nations to limit\nproduction levels.\nWhile there is some debate about the timing of reaching balance, we believe that the overall\ntrend is the key—we are moving toward balance. This balancing process has been more painful\nand taken longer than many expected. While U.S. crude oil production has fallen as much as 1\nmillion barrels per day over the past year, this decline has been more than offset by production\nincreases in Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran and other oil-producing countries. As a result of these\ndevelopments, global oil supply reductions have been slow to materialize, and inventories of oil\nproducts now stand at record-high levels.\nThe move toward balance is based on the expectation that global supply will grow at a slower\nrate and that global demand will to continue to grow, on average, at approximately 1.3 million\nbarrels per day in 2017. As this process unfolds, we expect the price of oil to be volatile but,\noverall, continue to firm.\nIn this context, our economists at the Dallas Fed expect U.S. crude oil production to rise\nthroughout 2017. Using rough numbers, it is estimated that U.S. production bottomed out at\napproximately 8.6 million barrels per day in the fall of 2016 and is now closer to 8.9 million\n3\nbarrels per day and is likely to steadily increase as the year unfolds.2 These estimates are subject\nto oil prices ranging between $55 and $60 per barrel.\nBased on the expectation of firming prices, our latest Dallas Fed Energy Survey reports a notable\nincrease in plans for capital spending in 2017 by exploration and production firms. We believe\nthat the bulk of this spending will be focused on shale production and is likely to involve\ninvestment in technologies that will create greater production efficiencies.\nMuch of our recent discussions with industry contacts are focused on the substantial potential\nsupply upside from the Permian Basin in the years ahead. The Permian Basin has oil-bearing\ndeposits that are layered, allowing multiple horizontal wells to run off a single well pad and\nmuch higher resource recovery per acre. The Permian currently produces approximately 2.2\nmillion barrels per day.3 With technological advances, many of our contacts believe that the\nPermian can grow production very substantially in the years ahead. As a result, we expect that\nmajor oil companies, in the near term, may continue to avoid large long-lived capital projects\nand will, instead, focus their capital spending on more flexible and shorter life cycle shale\nopportunities in the U.S.\nThe District\nTexas’ 2016 employment grew 1.4 percent. The year was very much a tale of two halves, with\njust 0.8 percent annualized job growth over the first six months and 2 percent growth over the\nfinal six months. Based on our surveys and discussions with business contacts, we expect job\ngrowth of approximately 2 percent in 2017, the strongest rate of growth in three years.\nTexas continues to benefit from the migration (as well as immigration) of people and firms to the\nstate. Aided by this trend, the state’s economy has become increasingly diversified. In addition,\nthe population of Texas is estimated to have grown from approximately 22.8 million in 2005 to\nalmost 28 million in 2016.4 Based on these trends, as the headwinds from a weak energy sector\ncontinue to dissipate, I am very optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh\nDistrict in the months and years ahead.\nAgainst this optimistic backdrop, my team of economists is closely monitoring policy decisions\nthat might negatively impact our outlook—in particular, policy decisions that could negatively\nimpact U.S. trading and cross-border investment relationships with Mexico, which we believe\nare important to enhancing job growth and competitiveness in the U.S. as well as economic\ngrowth in the Eleventh District. Mexico is the top destination for Texas exports. Manufactured\ngoods exports supported an estimated 1 million jobs in Texas in 2015, equal to 8.2 percent of the\nstate’s employment.5 In 2016, Texas exports to Mexico were $92.7 billion. Dallas Fed\neconomists believe that the trading relationship with Mexico has helped various industries in\nTexas6 (as well as the U.S.) gain global competitiveness. In addition, Texas border cities have\nbenefited tremendously from the increasing U.S.–Mexico economic integration—leading to job\ngains, primarily in service sectors, that have resulted in higher wages and improved standards of\nliving for many Texans.7\n4\nThe U.S.\nGDP in the U.S. grew approximately 2 percent in 2016—reflecting an improvement in growth in\nthe second half of the year. Underpinning weak growth in the first half of the year was the\nfinancial turmoil in the first quarter as well as a sizable inventory deceleration in the second\nquarter. We had expected a second-half bounce back due to our confidence in the health of the\nU.S. consumer. While the U.S. consumer has spent the past nine years deleveraging from record\nlevels of debt to GDP in 2008, as we sit here today, we believe the U.S. consumer is in relatively\ngood shape and has the capacity to spend.\nBased on our confidence in the continuing health of the U.S. consumer, we forecast 2017 GDP\ngrowth of approximately 2.3 percent. We believe this pace of growth will be sufficient to remove\nany remaining slack from the labor market. Forthcoming fiscal policy and structural reforms\nhave the potential to provide upside to this forecast.\nUnemployment\nWe are making good progress toward reaching our full-employment objective. The headline\nunemployment rate is 4.8 percent. In addition to the headline unemployment rate, we also look at\nseveral measures of labor market slack, including estimates of discouraged workers and people\nworking part time for economic reasons (otherwise known as U-6 unemployment), as well as the\nlabor force participation rate. The U-6 reading now stands at 9.4 percent, which is still more than\na full percentage point above its prerecession lows—which suggests there could still be some\namount of remaining slack in the U.S. labor force.\nThe labor force participation rate now stands at just under 63 percent, which compares with\napproximately 66 percent in 2007. We believe that a majority of the decline is due to the aging of\nthe population. This aging trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as across almost all\nadvanced economies. Furthermore, over the next 10 years, it is estimated that the U.S.\nparticipation rate will decline to below 61 percent.8 Without a material improvement in the rate\nof U.S. productivity growth, this trend is likely to have significant negative implications for\npotential GDP growth in the years ahead.\nWhen we look at measures of discouraged workers and those who are part time for economic\nreasons, I would note the high correlation between participation rates (as well as unemployment\nrates) and levels of educational attainment. To the extent that there is slack in the labor market, it\nis primarily associated with lower levels of educational attainment. This analysis suggests to me\nthat the U.S. must do much more to beef up public/private partnerships that focus on vocational\ntraining in order to help workers attain the skills needed to find employment in the 21st century\neconomy. These statistics also reinforce the need to invest in programs that improve earlychildhood literacy and generally enhance the level of educational attainment among our younger\npopulation. Both of these types of programs also have the added benefit of helping to potentially\nreduce income inequality by creating broader workforce productivity and prosperity.\n5\nInflation\nProgress toward reaching our 2 percent inflation objective has been frustratingly slow over the\npast few years. This had been due to a strong dollar and weak energy prices, as well as a number\nof persistent secular forces, such as globalization (see “Broader Secular Trends” below).\nIn addition to headline inflation, we closely track measures of core inflation, particularly the\nDallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate. This measure trims out the most extreme\nupward and downward monthly price movements. It is currently running at approximately 1.8\npercent, after having gradually increased from 1.7 percent through most of 2016 and\napproximately 1.6 percent in 2015. The gradual upward trend of this measure gives me\nconfidence that, as slack continues to be removed from the labor force, the headline inflation rate\nshould reach the Fed’s 2 percent objective in the medium term.\nNon-U.S.\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team closely monitors economic\ndevelopments outside the U.S. to assess how these developments might impact economic growth\ndomestically. In this regard, we are closely watching the impact of Brexit on the U.K. and\nEuropean economies as well as monitoring new developments in Europe. At this stage, I believe\nthat the impact of Brexit is likely to be manageable for the U.S., although we are continuing to\ncarefully monitor political developments and other policy decisions that could create a risk of\ncontagion among other European countries.\nWe also monitor emerging-market countries, particularly China. China has a high degree of\novercapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises) and high and growing levels of debt. The\nnation is also in the midst of a multi-year transition from being a manufacturing- and exportdriven economy to one that is based on consumer spending and services. This transition is likely\nto take many years, and the world is going to have to become accustomed to lower rates of\nChinese growth. In the meantime, China has worked to manage capital outflows and currency\nvolatility. As we saw in the first quarter of 2016, this situation has the potential to create periods\nof financial market volatility and lead to bouts of tightening in global financial conditions, which\ncan lead to slower domestic growth in the U.S.\nBroader Secular Trends\nIn addition to monitoring cyclical trends, my economic research team carefully considers and\nworks to understand several key secular drivers. These drivers can have a powerful influence on\nunfolding economic conditions.\nI am particularly focused on four key secular drivers:\n• Aging-workforce demographics in the U.S. and across major economies. As discussed\nearlier, aging-population trends, on balance, reduce labor force participation rates and\nultimately create headwinds for potential GDP growth. These demographic trends are\nalso likely to impact the “dependency ratio”—that is, they are likely to lead to a situation\n6\nin which an increasing share of the population is depending on those of working age to\npay for future medical and retirement benefits. These trends are likely to exacerbate the\nissues regarding the sustainability of U.S. government fiscal obligations (discussed\nfurther below).\n• Limits to the sustainability of the so-called global debt super cycle. Historically, the U.S.\nand other countries have used increasing debt—often through tax cuts and increased\ngovernment spending—to boost economic growth. At this point, there are likely limits to\nthe ability of countries, including the U.S., to further increase debt to GDP in order to\ngenerate higher levels of economic growth. As I discussed earlier, we have seen a\ndeleveraging of the U.S. household sector since 2008. This has likely created some\nheadwinds for economic growth over the past several years. The good news is that the\nhousehold sector is in much better shape today. However, while household balance sheets\nhave improved since the Great Recession, government debt held by the public now stands\nat approximately 77 percent of GDP, and the present value of future unfunded\nentitlements is now estimated at $46 trillion.9 These obligations will increasingly work\ntheir way into U.S. budget deficits over the next five to 10 years—raising questions\nregarding fiscal sustainability which, if not addressed, could negatively impact longer-run\neconomic growth.\n• Globalization. Economies, financial markets and companies are more closely intertwined\nthan ever before. For example, regarding trade, estimates indicate that approximately 40\npercent of the content of U.S. imports from Mexico is of U.S. origin.\n10 This is because\nmuch of this trade is related to integrated supply chains and logistical arrangements\nbetween U.S. and Mexican companies. As mentioned earlier, it is our view at the Dallas\nFed that these arrangements have helped improve U.S. competitiveness and created jobs\nin the U.S. Without these arrangements, these jobs might have otherwise been lost to\nother areas of the world, particularly Asia.\nWhile trade and globalization have yielded net economic benefits for the U.S. economy,\nthey have also created severe local hardships that the U.S. and other advanced economies\nhave struggled to address. The challenge is how to reap the benefits of globalization\nwhile addressing the disruptions it creates—failing to do so is likely to have negative\nimplications for trade and the pace of economic growth in the U.S. and globally.\n• Technology-enabled disruption. In order to improve their competiveness, many\ncompanies are actively investing in technology, which is leading to a significant\nreduction in the number of workers needed to produce goods and services. The result is\nthat U.S. workers across a range of industries are finding their jobs being eliminated.\nMany industries are facing a disruptive competitor that is offering lower-cost goods or\nservices. Think the digital camera versus the old film industry, Amazon versus retail\nstores, Kahn Academy versus brick-and-mortar schools, 3-D printing versus traditional\n7\nmanufacturing, Uber versus taxis and so on. This technology-enabled disruption has\nallowed consumers to achieve better value and more easily shop for merchandise and\nservices in a way that lets them easily choose the lowest price. It has also reduced the\npricing power of many companies and caused them to intensify their focus on creating\ngreater operational efficiencies.\nI believe that the dislocations resulting from technology-enabled disruption are\nsometimes confused with the impacts of globalization. This is a powerful trend, apart\nfrom globalization, which may help explain why employment among prime-age workers\nin the U.S. has not recovered to prerecession levels. It may also help explain why\ncompanies have been more hesitant to make capacity expansion decisions as well as\ninvest in major capital projects.\nFiscal and Structural Policies Beyond Monetary Policy\nIn light of these secular trends and the sluggish economic growth over the past several years, I\nhave been speaking the last several months about the need for structural reforms and fiscal policy\nto join the menu of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the\nkey structural challenges we face today stemming from changing demographic trends and lower\nlevels of productivity growth, as well as dislocations created by globalization and increasing\nrates of technology-enabled disruption. While monetary policy has a key role to play, it is not a\nsubstitute for actions that could address deeper fundamental challenges.\nFor the past eight years, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, advanced economies have relied\nheavily on monetary policy and much less on structural reforms and fiscal policy. However, at\nthis stage, if we are going to generate higher sustainable rates of GDP growth and address key\nsecular challenges, there needs to be policy action beyond monetary policy. This action could\ntake a variety of forms.\nGiven aging-workforce demographics, more could be done to explore policies that could grow\nthe workforce in the years ahead. Appropriate immigration policy is likely to be a key element of\nthis effort. Historically, immigration has played an important role in economic growth in the U.S.\nIt is estimated that immigrants and their children have constituted over half the workforce growth\nin the U.S. over the past 20 years. Over the next two decades, this percentage is likely to increase\nsubstantially.11 In Texas, immigration has been instrumental in bolstering the high-skilled labor\nforce. Today, it is estimated that foreign-born workers in the state make up approximately 54\npercent of medical scientists, 46 percent of computer software developers, 31 percent of\nphysicians, and over a quarter of chemical and mechanical engineers and nurses. Foreign-born\nworkers also constitute a substantial share of college instructors in the state.\n12\nPolicies that involve greater emphasis on improving levels of educational attainment and\nworkforce skills are needed to help ensure that an increasing percentage of the population can\nbecome productive members of the workforce. As discussed earlier, these efforts should include\na focus on substantially increasing the number of public/private partnerships that focus on\nvocational training that would increase the skill levels and/or retrain discouraged or\n8\nunderemployed workers. These programs could help grow the workforce and address the skills\ngap that has been identified by numerous companies we speak with in the Eleventh District.\nPublic investments that upgrade aging infrastructure could potentially improve productivity and\nhelp bolster sluggish demand. Given sizable private pools of capital that exist today, some\nmeaningful portion of this investment could come from public/private partnerships, with\nsubstantial capital coming from the private sector.\nMore broadly, tax and regulatory policies could be considered in order to create increased\nincentives for growth and investment. Some observers suggest conducting a thoughtful review of\nregulations at the national, state and local levels. They argue that, in some cases, excessive\nregulation and fees might be creating undue burdens on capital investment, lending and the\nformation and growth of small businesses.\nEntitlement reforms could help improve the sustainability of Social Security and Medicare and\nease the future fiscal burden of these programs. In addition, reforms might reduce disincentives\nto remain in the workforce while helping to soften the impact of aging-workforce demographics.\nThese are some examples of policy actions that could be considered. Whatever policy actions are\nenacted, I believe they need to center on the goals of growing the workforce and improving\nworkforce productivity. They should focus on sustainable economic growth over the medium\nand long term—that is, avoiding policies that create short-term growth while creating future\nproblems or raising government debt relative to GDP, thereby leaving future generations to\nresolve fiscal and/or other imbalances.\nMy Views Regarding the Current Stance of Monetary Policy\nAs I mentioned earlier, I believe we are making good progress in accomplishing our dualmandate objectives of full employment and price stability. Regarding our full-employment\nmandate, I believe there is still some amount of slack in the U.S. workforce. In addition, I\ncontinue to believe that in a more interconnected world, excess capacity outside the U.S. may be\ndampening inflation pressures in the U.S. As a result of these factors, I think we still may have\nsome scope for further job growth without overheating the economy or unduly stressing the\ncapacity of the U.S. workforce. However, having said that, it is my view that we are moving\ncloser to full employment.\nRegarding inflation, I believe that as the impact of lower energy prices begins to dissipate, and as\nthe labor market continues to tighten, headline inflation is likely to move toward our 2 percent\nobjective over the medium term.\nWhile the key secular drivers I discussed earlier will continue to pose challenges for economic\ngrowth, I also believe there is a cost to excessive accommodation in terms of penalizing savers,\nas well as creating distortions and imbalances in investing, hiring and other business decisions.\nThese imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very painful to address.\n9\nBased on these considerations, as we continue to make progress in achieving our dual-mandate\nobjectives, I believe that we should be taking steps to remove additional amounts of monetary\naccommodation. I believe that future removals of accommodation can likely be done in a gradual\nand patient manner. However, it is my view that moving sooner rather than later will make it\nmore likely that future removals of accommodation can be done gradually—that is, reduce the\nlikelihood that the Fed will get “behind the curve” and feel the need to remove accommodation\nmore rapidly.\nIn addition, as we make further progress in removing accommodation, I believe we should be\nturning our attention to a discussion of how we might begin the process of reducing the size of\nthe Federal Reserve balance sheet.\n\nNotes\n1 Bureau of Economic Analysis, Third Quarter 2016.\n2 Energy Information Administration, Short-Term Energy Outlook, Feb. 7, 2017. 3 February forecast from the Energy Information Administration, Drilling Productivity Report, Feb. 13,\n2017. 4 Census Bureau.\n5 “Texas Border Cities Illustrate Benefits and Challenges of Trade,” by Jesus Cañas, Federal Reserve\nBank of Dallas Southwest Economy, Fourth Quarter, 2016.

    "text": "Corporate debt as a potential amplifier in a slowdown\nMarch 05, 2019\nAs a central bank policymaker, I closely monitor various types of excesses and imbalances that may be developing in the economy. One of the areas I monitor is the level and growth of indebtedness in the household, government and corporate sectors. In previous essays , I have commented on the positive impacts of the deleveraging of the household sector since the Great Recession, and I have raised a cautionary flag regarding the growth of U.S. government debt, including a substantial increase in the present value of unfunded entitlements.\nThe purpose of this essay is to focus on trends in corporate debt growth and credit quality in the U.S. and discuss potential implications for economic conditions and financial stability.\nBackground on indebtedness in the U.S.\nIn the decade since the Great Recession, there has been an improvement in household balance sheets. In particular, it is estimated that household debt declined from 97 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) at year-end 2008 to approximately 75 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018. [1] This trend has been aided by a strong jobs market and improving wage growth. This household deleveraging is very important because consumer spending is approximately 70 percent of U.S. GDP. [2]\nWhile household balance sheets have improved, the U.S. government has become more highly indebted. Government debt (primarily in the form of Treasury obligations) held by the public as a percentage of GDP has grown from 44 percent at year-end 2008 to approximately 77 percent as of Dec. 31, 2018. [3] In addition, the present value of unfunded entitlements now stands at approximately $54 trillion. [4] This growing level of government debt as a percentage of GDP means, at a minimum, there is less capacity for infrastructure spending and other investments which might help build the productive capability of the U.S. economy. It also means that in the next downturn, there is likely to be less capacity for fiscal stimulus.\nHistorically, the U.S. government has tended to reduce its degree of leverage when the economy is strong—that has not been the case this cycle. At the later stages of a long economic expansion, recent fiscal actions have had the impact of increasing government debt to GDP and have provided meaningful stimulus to near-term growth. It is our view at the Dallas Fed that the current path of government debt to GDP is unlikely to be sustainable—and if we need to find ways to moderate our debt growth in the future, this moderation is likely to create headwinds for GDP growth.\nIn addition to household and government debt, Dallas Fed economists also keep track of the level and growth of corporate debt in the financial sector as well as the nonfinancial sector of the U.S. economy. On the positive side, U.S. financial sector debt has declined substantially from near its historical peak of approximately 124 percent of GDP at the end of 2008 to 78 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018. [5] This decline was accompanied by substantially more stringent postcrisis financial sector regulations and oversight intended to reduce the systemic risk and improve the resiliency of the U.S. financial sector.\nBy contrast, U.S. nonfinancial corporate debt as a percentage of GDP is now higher than the prior peak reached at the end of 2008. As seen in Chart 1, U.S. nonfinancial corporate debt as a percentage of GDP declined substantially in the aftermath of the Great Recession, but then rebounded from a postrecession low of approximately 40 percent in 2010 to 46 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018. [6] , [7]\nDownloadable chart\nThis rebound in the amount of nonfinancial corporate debt is something I am carefully considering in assessing economic conditions and financial stability in the U.S. In particular, it is worth noting that a number of research studies have indicated that relatively higher levels of corporate debt to GDP could potentially amplify the severity of a recession. [8] Several of these papers also suggest that strong growth in corporate debt to GDP is more likely to amplify a downturn when corporate leverage is historically elevated, as it is today. [9]\nTrends in nonfinancial corporate debt\nNonfinancial corporate debt consists primarily of bonds and loans (commercial paper outstanding is less than 5 percent of the total). Nonfinancial corporate bonds outstanding in the U.S. grew from approximately $2.2 trillion in 2008 to approximately $5.7 trillion at year-end 2018 ( Chart 2 ). The bulk of this growth occurred in the investment-grade sector. The amount of outstanding U.S. investment-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds grew from approximately $1.5 trillion in 2008 to $4.5 trillion at year-end 2018. [10]\nWithin the investment-grade sector, there was a notable increase in the amount of BBB bonds (the lowest level of investment-grade debt) outstanding, growing from approximately $0.8 trillion in 2008 to $2.7 trillion by year-end 2018. [11] In addition, the amount of high-yield (less than investment grade) nonfinancial corporate bonds outstanding grew from approximately $0.7 trillion in 2008 to $1.1 trillion by year-end 2018. This substantial growth in BBB and lower-rated bonds is indicative of a weakening in corporate credit quality in the U.S.\nIt is estimated that a substantial portion of the increase in nonfinancial corporate debt was used to fund share buybacks, dividends and merger activity. [12] This trend has been accompanied by more relaxed bond and loan covenants, [13] which have had the effect of reducing protections for investors. Downloadable chart There has also been an increase in syndicated leveraged loans over this period. Leveraged loans are loans made to highly indebted companies and are typically originated by commercial banks and then syndicated to nonbank investors, including special-purpose vehicles such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), private equity funds and other stand-alone entities. The size of the syndicated leveraged loan market, which is primarily made up of nonfinancial corporate borrowers, has increased from $0.6 trillion at the end of 2008 to $1.2 trillion at year-end 2018. [14] Much of this increase has occurred to fund corporate acquisitions and private-equity-backed transactions. [15] In addition to the syndicated leveraged loan market, there is also a direct lending market for leveraged loans in the U.S. This market primarily involves nonbank financial firms—such as asset managers, private equity funds, business development corporations (BDCs), hedge funds, insurance companies and pension funds—lending directly to smaller, mid-market companies. While it is difficult to obtain precise information on the size of this market, Standard and Poor’s (S&P) estimates that the amount of outstanding leveraged loans in the U.S. direct lending market has grown significantly over the past several years and now likely exceeds several hundred billion dollars. [16] CLO structure CLOs are investment vehicles that buy pools of floating-rate leveraged loans from banks. The CLO packages loans into tranches of debt with credit ratings ranging from AAA to BB and with one nonrated tranche of equity, as illustrated in Chart 3. These tranches are securitized and then sold primarily to institutional investors. Downloadable chart The ability of a CLO to turn lower-credit-quality loans into mostly investment-grade-rated bonds via securitization hinges on three key factors: 1) overcollateralization, 2) tranching of securities based on levels of subordination, and 3) portfolio diversification. As loans are paid off, the income flows to the buyers of the CLO securities. In case of a default in one of the underlying loans, the lowest tranche (equity) is the first to experience a loss, whereas the AAA tranche would be the last to experience a loss. Unlike mortgage-backed securities, the CLO structure proved relatively resilient during 2008–09. The U.S. CLO market has grown from roughly $300 billion at the end of 2008 to $615 billion at the end of 2018. [17] However, it is important to recognize that CLO loan-credit quality today is estimated to be somewhat weaker than 10 years ago. S&P estimates that in 2018, CLOs and loan mutual funds purchased approximately 60 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of syndicated leveraged loan volumes. It is estimated that less than 10 percent of new issuance was purchased by banks in the U.S. The remaining volumes were purchased by insurance companies, finance companies and others. [18] Because CLOs are today the largest buyer of these syndicated leveraged loans, disruptions to CLO creation could increase the likelihood that leveraged loans remain on bank balance sheets, which could, in turn, limit the ability of affected banks to extend credit during periods of stress. Implications of rising levels of BBB and less-than-investment-grade corporate debt As a central banker, I am carefully tracking the growth in BBB and less-than-investment-grade debt. In the event of a downturn, highly indebted companies may be more vulnerable to seeing their credit quality deteriorate, which could negatively impact their capital spending and hiring plans. If this deterioration were sufficiently widespread, credit spreads would likely widen in order to compensate lenders/bondholders for greater risk. This type of widening would likely be indicative of an overall tightening in financial conditions that could, in turn, lead to a more significant slowing in the economy. In a downturn, some proportion of BBB bonds may be at risk of being downgraded to less than investment grade. These downgrades, if they happen in sufficient size, could create dislocations for investors who tend to have specific allocations or restrictions based on credit-rating categories. These dislocations could further negatively impact credit spreads and market access for more highly indebted companies. Market liquidity One further issue is whether there is sufficient liquidity in the various corporate debt markets. Ample liquidity is particularly important in the event of market stress or dislocation. While there is debate regarding the evidence of a decline in various measures of corporate bond market liquidity—such as round-trip trading costs, bid–ask spreads or turnover [19] —it is generally agreed that bank-affiliated broker-dealers have been committing less capital to corporate bond trading since the financial crisis. In particular, it is estimated that inventories of corporate debt held by broker-dealers declined from $29.2 billion at the end of 2013 to $14.2 billion at the end of 2018. [20] This decline is notable given that the total corporate bond market increased 36 percent over this period. The decline in inventories held by broker-dealers may be due, at least in part, to postcrisis regulation, such as the Volcker rule (effective April 2014), as well as the growth in electronic trading and other market-related factors. [21] In the event of an economic downturn and some credit-quality deterioration, the reduction in bank broker-dealer inventories and market-making capability could mean that credit spreads might widen more significantly, and potentially in a more volatile manner, than they have historically. This concern may be somewhat heightened in light of the rapid growth in BBB and lower-rated securities issuance over the past 10 years. Conclusion: Continued Vigilance I will continue to closely monitor the level, growth and credit quality of corporate debt. Vigilance is warranted as these issues have the potential to impact corporate investment and spending plans. In the event of an economic downturn, these issues could also contribute to a deterioration in financial conditions which could, in turn, amplify the severity of a growth slowdown in the U.S. economy. I am also sensitive to these corporate debt developments in light of the historically high level of U.S. government debt and the forward estimates for the path of government debt to GDP. An elevated level of corporate debt, along with the high level of U.S. government debt, is likely to mean that the U.S. economy is much more interest rate sensitive than it has been historically.

This concern may be somewhat heightened in light of the rapid growth in BBB and lower-rated securities issuance over the past 10 years.\nConclusion: Continued Vigilance\nI will continue to closely monitor the level, growth and credit quality of corporate debt. Vigilance is warranted as these issues have the potential to impact corporate investment and spending plans. In the event of an economic downturn, these issues could also contribute to a deterioration in financial conditions which could, in turn, amplify the severity of a growth slowdown in the U.S. economy.\nI am also sensitive to these corporate debt developments in light of the historically high level of U.S. government debt and the forward estimates for the path of government debt to GDP. An elevated level of corporate debt, along with the high level of U.S. government debt, is likely to mean that the U.S. economy is much more interest rate sensitive than it has been historically.\nRobert S.

    "text": "Economic Conditions and the Path of Monetary Policy\nSeptember 29, 2020\nIn the September 2020 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  meeting, the Committee left the federal funds rate target range unchanged at 0  to 0.25 percent. The Committee also said that it “expects it will be  appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have  reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum  employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately  exceed 2 percent for some time.”\nI dissented from this statement  because, while I expect it will be appropriate to keep the federal funds rate  in the current range until the economy is on track to achieve the Committee’s  dual-mandate objectives, I believe that the Committee should retain greater  policy rate flexibility beyond that point. In this regard, I believe that the  difference between remaining “accommodative” and keeping rates at zero becomes  increasingly important as we approach achievement of our dual-mandate  objectives.\nOnce we have battled  and moved beyond the COVID-19 pandemic over the next two to three years, I  believe the world is likely to look very different than it does today—in  ways that are predictable and ways that are likely not predictable. I would like  future Committees to have the flexibility to adapt to those future economic  conditions so they can use their best judgment in deciding on the appropriate  stance of monetary policy.\nIn this essay, I will discuss various economic issues,  briefly explain the Fed’s new policy framework and discuss my views regarding the  appropriate stance of monetary policy.\nThe U.S. Economy—Addressing  the Pandemic\nAs a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the related  shutdown, the U.S. economy contracted approximately 32 percent on an annualized  basis in the second quarter of 2020, and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7  percent in April. [1] The U-6 measure of unemployment—which takes into account the unemployed, plus  workers who have given up looking for a job and those working part-time who  would prefer to work full-time—rose  to 22.8 percent in April. [2] These figures compare to a prepandemic  unemployment rate of 3.5 percent and a U-6 reading of 7.0 percent in February  of this year. [3]\nIn response to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve cut the federal  funds rate from a range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent in February to a range of 0 to 0.25  percent by March. In addition, the Committee initiated a program of purchases  of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) totaling at  least $500 billion and at least $200 billion, respectively, at a pace  appropriate to support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury  securities and agency MBS. From mid-March until the end of May, Fed holdings of  Treasury securities increased $1.5 trillion and holdings of agency MBS  increased approximately $500 billion. [4] Since May, the pace of additional  purchases has been $80 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion of agency MBS per  month.\nThe Fed also lowered the rate charged to banks at the discount  window from 225 basis points to 25 basis points (reflecting a 150 basis-point  reduction in the fed funds rate and a 50 basis-point narrowing in the spread of  the primary credit rate relative to the top of the target range) in order to  help ensure banks had sufficient liquidity and the ability to lend to  customers.\nIn late March, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,  and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This act authorized the Treasury to make  equity investments in a range of liquidity and credit facilities established by  the Federal Reserve under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. These  programs were aimed at stabilizing money market funds and the markets for  corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and municipal bonds. [5] These and  other actions helped to restore market functioning and helped to improve access  to capital for small, mid-sized and large businesses.\nAs part of the CARES Act, Congress also authorized the  Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). This program, administered by the Small  Business Administration, allowed banks to provide forgivable loans to small  businesses in order to maintain their payrolls, hire back employees who may  have been laid off, and cover applicable overhead. The CARES Act also  authorized additional unemployment insurance benefits and one-time cash  payments which allowed millions of families to receive vital income support as  a result of heightened unemployment amid the economic contraction.\nAs a result of extraordinary efforts to limit the spread of  the virus through lockdowns and adherence to public health protocols, the  incidence of the virus declined sufficiently in April and May to allow several  states to begin the process of reopening their economies. It is the view of  Dallas Fed economists that the U.S. economy likely bottomed out in April and  began to grow again in May and June.\nHowever, due to a resurgence of the virus in certain states  beginning in June, the rate of growth slowed somewhat in July and August.  Through the reimposition of targeted business closures and the heightened  emphasis on adherence to public health protocols of social distancing and mask  wearing, the rate of transmission of the virus began to moderate in August and  September. Even with these reopening challenges, the economy has recovered  faster than expected, and Dallas Fed economists forecast that third-quarter  gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the U.S. will be approximately 30 percent  at an annualized rate.\nThe Labor Market\nThe August headline unemployment rate stood at 8.4 percent,  and the U-6 measure of unemployment was 14.2 percent. [6] In addition, the labor  force participation rate—the  rate at which those 16 years old and older are either employed or actively  looking for work—was 61.7  percent (this compares with a reading of 63.4 percent in January 2020). [7] However, the overall labor statistics mask much greater hardship among key  groups in our society. In particular, the unemployment rates of Blacks and  Hispanics increased to 16.7 percent and 18.9 percent, respectively, in April. [8] This outpaced the unemployment rate of whites, which peaked at 14.2 percent. [9] While today the unemployment rate for whites has declined to 7.3 percent, the  unemployment rate for Blacks and Hispanics remains more elevated at 13.0  percent and 10.5 percent, respectively. [10] These disparities are indicative of  how the pandemic has disproportionately impacted person-to-person service  sector jobs, and those with lower levels of educational attainment ( see the later portion of this essay ). These  statistics reinforce the need for greater efforts to invest in education and  skills training in order to create a stronger and more inclusive labor market and  help ensure that key groups of our society are not left behind in this  recovery.\nConsumer Spending\nOne of the unusual aspects of this  pandemic has been the mix and overall resilience of consumer spending. In spite  of the severe damage to employment and small businesses since the start of the  pandemic, we have seen that consumer spending on goods has been very strong.  While goods spending has exceeded prepandemic levels since June, we are seeing  that spending on services has improved but is still below prepandemic levels.\nThe strength in  consumer goods spending is significantly different from prior recessions. In  past recessions, consumer spending on services has typically remained steady  while durable goods consumption has declined. Dallas Fed economists believe  that the resilience of consumer spending during this pandemic has been bolstered  by a substantial level of fiscal relief, particularly in the form of one-time  payments and supplemental unemployment benefits. As a result, aggregate  personal income levels have actually exceeded pre-COVID levels, [11] something  unique to this recession. Of course, a key risk we are watching carefully is  the potential waning of unemployment benefits and other forms of fiscal relief,  which could cause more typical recessionary dynamics to emerge. The emergence  of these dynamics would certainly create headwinds for continued recovery.\nThe Outlook\nDallas Fed economists expect continued growth through the  rest of this year. We expect that 2020 GDP will show a contraction of approximately  3.0 percent and that the unemployment rate will end the year at approximately  7.5 percent. Inflation, as measured by core personal consumption expenditures  (PCE), is expected to be running at approximately 1.6 percent by year-end 2020. [12] We forecast that the U.S. economy will grow by roughly 3.5 percent in 2021 and  that the unemployment rate will decline to approximately 5.7 percent by  year-end 2021. Inflation is expected to modestly accelerate, increasing to  approximately 1.8 percent by year-end 2021. These forecasts are, of course,  highly uncertain because they are heavily dependent on the path of the virus  and the level of adherence to public health protocols, such as mask wearing and  social distancing. They also depend heavily on continued fiscal support, as  well as the timing of a potential vaccine that is effective and can be widely  administered.\nTracking Mobility and Engagement\nA primary determinant of the rate of growth for the  remainder of this year and next year will be the incidence of the virus. In  order to monitor the impact of the virus on the economy, we track mobility  through a metric called the Dallas Fed Mobility and Engagement Index (MEI).  This index combines several different measures of the spatial behavior of anonymized  cellphone users in order to gauge the level of engagement of the population in  a wide range of activities. This measure has allowed our economists to gain  real-time insight into the economic impact of the pandemic. The MEI is measured  daily, at the national, state and county levels. [13]\nThe U.S. measure of this index stood at +3 in the week ended  Feb. 29. It began to deteriorate sharply in the week ended March 14. It  bottomed out at -100 in the week ended April 11 and then began to improve  substantially in late April. The index continued to improve sharply until  mid-June (with a reading of approximately -40) and then began to stall out as  COVID cases surged in the southern and western portions of the U.S. Since  August, this measure has shown modest improvement, and it currently sits at  approximately -38. Chart 1 tracks the progression of this index in the U.S.  since late-February 2020.\nIt is our view that this MEI measure is a good proxy for the  direct impact of the pandemic on economic activity and highlights trends in the  economy. Dallas Fed economists believe that the MEI is highly correlated with the  path of the virus, especially when cases are rising. This index highlights the  importance of limiting the spread of the virus while maintaining or improving  the level of mobility. Our effectiveness in managing this virus will continue  to be a primary determinant of economic growth in the U.S. How well do we  follow health protocols of social distancing and mask wearing? Will there be a  vaccine which can be widely distributed? These questions will help determine  how quickly we return to higher levels of engagement and, as a consequence, how  fast we recover from this pandemic.\nStructural Changes in the U.S. Economy: Demographics,  Productivity and Technology-Enabled Disruption\nIn the months and years leading up to the pandemic, I spoke  regularly about some of the key structural challenges facing the U.S. economy ( see  the essay “ Economic  Conditions and the Key Structural Drivers Impacting the Economic Outlook ,”  Oct. 10, 2019 ). Sluggish workforce growth due to aging of the population  has created a headwind for GDP growth. Finding ways to improve workforce growth  is likely to be critical to improving GDP growth in the U.S. Sluggish  productivity growth has also created headwinds to economic growth. Our  economists believe that addressing lagging early-childhood literacy, improving  educational attainment levels, beefing up skills training across the U.S. and  creating more access to broadband as well as other targeted infrastructure investments  are likely to be key structural changes necessary to improve productivity.  These investments will particularly help to improve the future adaptability and  employability of those with lower levels of educational attainment.\nWe have seen in this pandemic that job losses have  disproportionately impacted those with lower levels of educational attainment.  In April, at the height of the pandemic, those individuals with less than a  high school diploma had an unemployment rate of approximately 21.2 percent,  while those who had completed college with a bachelor’s degree had an  unemployment rate of approximately 8.4 percent. [14] This disparity reflects the  fact that those with lower levels of educational attainment may be more likely  to be employed in person-to-person service sector jobs and, as a consequence,  are less likely to be able to work remotely. [15] As a result, these workers have  been much more vulnerable to job losses and losses of income. In a world where  technology and technology-enabled disruption is accelerating, improving the  adaptability of lower-income workers is likely to be a major challenge.\nThe emphasis on remote work and engagement has meant that  people are spending their time and their money in dramatically different ways  than before. They are far more likely to be conducting meetings remotely,  traveling less, buying goods online and having their purchases of goods  delivered. This acceleration in the rate of technology and technology-enabled  disruption is changing the competitive landscape in a wide range of industries.  Some of these changes may reverse after we have weathered this pandemic, while  others are likely to be more lasting.\nAs was the case leading up to the pandemic, this trend is  likely limiting the pricing power of businesses. To respond to this trend,  businesses are investing substantially more in technology to replace people,  lower their costs and improve their competitiveness. This trend is evidenced by  the increasing percentage of nonresidential fixed investment accounted for by  investments in computer and peripheral equipment, and spending on software.\nEnergy Developments\nI have spoken throughout this year  about the enormous challenges the coronavirus has posed for the U.S. energy  industry. In early March, after OPEC-plus failed to reach an agreement on  production cuts, Saudi Arabia announced that it would cut its selling prices  and increase its crude oil production. This retaliatory announcement was  coincident with the beginning stages of an unprecedented decline in global oil  demand as a result of COVID. These events have had significant negative  implications for U.S. oil production.\nIt is the view of our energy economists that U.S. oil  production will decline from approximately 12.8 million barrels per day (mb/d)  in December 2019 to approximately 10.7 mb/d by December 2020. [16] Oil  production from the Permian Basin is expected to decline from approximately 4.7  mb/d in December 2019 to approximately 3.8 mb/d in December 2020. [17] Consistent with this, the number of oil wells completed is projected to fall 50  percent from 2019 to 2020, and overall U.S. exploration-and-development capital  spending will likely decline by approximately 50 percent in 2020. [18]\nOur economists believe that U.S. oil production growth will  likely be flat during 2021. This forecast assumes that new drilling and well  completions will be sufficient to replace declining production from existing  wells.\nGlobal energy consumption fell to approximately 83 mb/d in  the second quarter, a decline of nearly 17 percent from prepandemic levels. [19] During the subsequent recovery, consumption has risen to nearly 90 mb/d. [20] Of course, future levels of demand will be heavily impacted by the timing of  when individuals increase their engagement in a broader range of transportation  activities, including the extent to which they return to airline travel.  Balancing this weakness in demand with a substantial decline in production, it  is the view of Dallas Fed energy economists that global excess oil inventories  will not be worked off before late 2021.\nThe Fed’s New Monetary Policy Framework\nOn Aug. 27, the Federal Reserve announced amendments to its monetary  policy framework. [21] This announcement was the culmination of a two-year review  of its policy framework, which involved three  distinct components. First, the Federal Reserve hosted a series of Fed Listens  events across the country to engage various stakeholders to hear directly from  them about how monetary policy decisions affect their communities. Second, the  Federal Reserve convened a research conference at which prominent academic  experts addressed economic topics central to the review. Finally, over the  course of several meetings, the Committee explored a range of issues that were  brought to light during the review. In its new framework, the FOMC made key  changes with regard to both parts of its dual mandate—maximum employment and price stability.\nOn maximum employment, the FOMC emphasized that maximum  employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal and reported that its policy  decisions would be informed by its “assessments of the shortfalls of  employment from its maximum level.” The original document referred to “ deviations from its maximum level.” The previous expansion demonstrated the benefits of a  strong labor market and the difficulty of assessing the level of maximum  employment in real time. Unemployment fell to levels previously thought to be  unsustainable, and we were able to bring in many workers who had previously  been left behind. This occurred against the backdrop of relatively muted  inflation. Based on this experience, the Committee decided to change the policy  framework to signal that higher employment, in the absence of unwanted  increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks, will not by itself be a  cause for policy concern.\nOn price stability, the FOMC adjusted its strategy for  achieving its longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent by noting that it “seeks  to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.” The revised policy  states that “following periods when inflation has been running persistently  below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve  inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.” This change was made in an  effort to ensure that inflation expectations do not drift down over time and that  they remain well-anchored at 2 percent. If inflation expectations were to drift  lower, the nominal level of interest rates would be lower, too, leaving less  room for the FOMC to cut rates when needed to support the economy.\nThe Stance of Monetary Policy\nThe September FOMC Decision\nIn light of the economic devastation caused by the virus and  related lockdowns, I believe it has been appropriate for the Federal Reserve to  take extraordinary actions to stabilize markets and to improve access to capital  for small, mid-sized and large businesses. In addition, I believe it has been  appropriate for the Fed to maintain the setting of the federal funds rate at 0  to 0.25 percent and to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed  securities to support the smooth functioning of these markets and to provide  some additional level of accommodation during the pandemic.\nIn my September meeting dissent, I emphasized that I believe  the current setting of the federal funds rate will be appropriate until the  Committee is confident that the economy has weathered the pandemic and is on  track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals as  articulated by the new policy framework. My best judgment is that it will take  at least until late 2022 or sometime in 2023 for these criteria to be met. However,  beyond that point, I believe that the Committee should retain greater policy  rate flexibility to decide on the appropriate stance of monetary policy.\nAccommodative Versus Zero—The Role of R*\nThere is an important difference between remaining  “accommodative” and keeping rates at zero. I believe, after we have fully  weathered this crisis, we should be willing to be more accommodative than in the  past in order to create a stronger and more inclusive labor market and make  progress on achieving our 2 percent average inflation target. However, I am  cognizant that as the economy approaches full employment and we are on track to  reach our price stability objectives, the equilibrium nominal rate of interest  (the federal funds rate at which monetary policy is neither restrictive nor  accommodative—often referred to as R*) is likely to increase. This means that  as we approach achievement of our dual-mandate objectives, the stance of  monetary policy will actually become more accommodative if the fed funds rate  were to remain at zero. I can understand why future Committees will want to  remain accommodative at that point in order to ensure we achieve our goals, but  will they want to be effectively increasing the level of accommodation by  keeping the federal funds rate at zero? I would like future Committees to have  the flexibility to make this judgment.\nMonitoring Excessive Risk Taking\nI believe there are real costs to keeping rates at zero for  a prolonged period of time. Keeping rates at zero can adversely impact savers,  encourage excessive risk taking and create distortions in financial markets.  Excessive risk taking and distortions in financial markets could lead to  greater fragilities, excesses and imbalances which could ultimately jeopardize  the attainment of the Fed’s objectives. These fragilities and tail risks are  often much easier to recognize in hindsight than in real time. For example,  some market observers have commented that the seizing up of financial markets  in March was due in part to COVID and related shutdowns but may have also been  due, in part, to some amount of forced selling by over-risked market participants.  While the Federal Reserve has oversight and visibility regarding banks in the  U.S., it does not have supervisory jurisdiction or a high level of visibility  regarding the nonbank financial markets.\nAdapting to a Changing World\nThe post-COVID economy is likely to look very different from  the economy we are in today. I am reluctant to restrict the ability of future  Committees to use their best judgment to adapt to these changes in ways they  believe help achieve our dual-mandate objectives. Future Committees will need  to assess the implications of acceleration in the rate of new technology adoption  and technology-enabled disruption, changes in our views regarding how monetary  policy impacts inflation, changes in tax policy, changes in regulatory policy, changes  in trade policy, the role of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, and  other developments—some  foreseeable and some that are hard to predict as we sit here today. One of the  great strengths of the FOMC is the gathering of a diverse group of decision-makers  who are empowered to share views, energetically debate and ultimately use their  best judgment, based on analyses of current and expected economic conditions, in  order to make sound policy decisions that are forward looking.\nFor example, the pandemic has dramatically accelerated  investment by for-profit and not-for-profit enterprises in technology and the  adoption of new models that accelerate the trend of technology-enabled  disruption. These trends are likely to continue to mute the pricing power of  businesses. The expected strengthening of this structural trend may well offset  the cyclical inflationary impact of a tightening job market. It is unclear to  me how these structural forces will interact with the cyclical forces in  impacting inflation in the years ahead. In addition, I believe that we will  learn a lot over the next two years about the impact of monetary policy on  achieving our inflation goals, and I believe more research needs to be done on  pricing dynamics and technology-enabled disruption.\nThe Rationale for Forward Guidance\nForward guidance is communication by the Fed which indicates  its intentions regarding the likely future path of monetary policy. It can be a  powerful tool that comes with potential benefits and costs. A commitment to  keeping rates at zero based on certain conditions being met can, in principle,  help lower today’s longer-term yields and, thus, provide additional stimulus  that could accelerate the economy’s return toward our longer-run goals.  However, I am skeptical about the benefits of enhanced forward guidance at the  moment because rates are already historically low and, even before this  meeting, market expectations were for them to stay low for the next few years.  In addition, the latest FOMC Summary of Economic Projections indicated that the  bulk of FOMC participants expect the federal funds rate to remain at 0 to 0.25  percent through the end of 2023. Given these expectations, it was my preference  to defer using enhanced forward guidance as a tool until a time in the future  when the benefits would be more compelling.\nLooking Forward\nI believe that, today, our primary focus should be on  fighting the COVID pandemic and getting the U.S. economy on track to meet our  dual-mandate objectives of full employment and price stability. This means  keeping the federal funds rate at its current setting, continuing our 13(3)  programs until we judge that they are no longer required, and considering use  of other tools. In addition, I believe there needs to be continued focus on  doing more to help small and mid-sized businesses get access to capital.\nWhile monetary policy will play a critical role in the  recovery, we will also need additional fiscal measures that provide relief to the  unemployed and those working part time who would prefer to work full time. In  addition, fiscal relief would be highly beneficial to state and local  governments that are trying to recover from a fiscal hole created in the first  and second quarters of this year. Lack of additional fiscal relief would create  a key downside risk to my economic forecast for 2020 and 2021.\nWhile appropriate monetary and fiscal policies are critical  to recovery, a primary determinant of the rate of recovery will be how well we  manage the virus—particularly,  wearing masks, social distancing and rigorously following other public health protocols.  In addition, we must continue to invest in the development of widespread, rapid  and accurate testing as well as work to beef up our ability to do effective contact  tracing. Even with an effective vaccine, which will hopefully be approved in  the next several months, these measures are likely to be vital until we are  able to confidently inoculate the bulk of the population.\nI remain confident that the U.S. economy will recover from  the COVID crisis as each of us continues to do our part. I am also confident  that the Federal Reserve will do all that it can to make sure we successfully  recover from this pandemic and move the economy forward toward achieving our full  employment and price stability goals.\nNotes\nRobert S.

    "text": "A brief discussion regarding the impact of climate change on economic conditions in the Eleventh District\nJune 27, 2019\nBased on the essay, “ Economic Conditions and the Stance of Monetary Policy ,” published on June 24, 2019.\nBased on the essay, “Economic Conditions and the Stance of Monetary Policy,” published on June 24, 2019, found at https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/kaplan/2019/rsk190624.aspx.\nOverview\nThe Eleventh Federal Reserve District comprises Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas job growth in 2018 was approximately 2.3 percent, and we expect jobs to grow at a solid rate in 2019.\nIt is worth noting that the Eleventh District is particularly impacted by developments in the energy industry and international trade, as Texas is both the largest energy producer of any state and the nation’s largest exporter. It is also important to note that growth in Texas continues to be aided by the migration of people and firms to the state. This migration has helped bring human capital and new businesses to the state, which have helped fuel the diversification of industry and the development of its largest metropolitan areas: Houston, Dallas–Fort Worth, San Antonio and Austin. [1]\nOne factor we are increasingly discussing at the Dallas Fed is the impact of climate change on the Eleventh District. In particular, severe weather events can have a substantial human and economic cost to the district.\nOne recent example is Hurricane Harvey, which occurred in August 2017. It is estimated that Harvey caused approximately $74 billion in property damage and lost output in the state. [2] While the gross domestic product (GDP) and job losses appear to have been transitory, the lasting impact in Houston and along the Texas coast continues to be felt in the form of displacement of communities, ongoing rebuilding efforts, increased insurance costs, public spending on mitigation efforts, and more stringent building codes. In addition, the storm disproportionately impacted low-income families by wiping out their savings, impacting their ability to safely domicile their families and increasing their need for health care and related services. [3] Given the extent of the damage, a key question for civic leaders, businesses and residents is the extent to which severe weather events like Harvey are likely to be unusual and sporadic in the future or whether they are likely to become more frequent in the years ahead.\nThe Eleventh District is home to approximately 50 of the Fortune 500 companies. It is also a major infrastructure hub for the nation’s energy production, transmission and refining capability. The seaports along the Gulf Coast as well as the inland ports in our major metro areas and along the U.S.–Mexico border play a critical role for the U.S. in trade and immigration.\nIn this context, my Dallas Fed research team is focused on the extent that severe weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, flooding and tornadoes are increasingly likely to impact our people, cities, critical energy infrastructure and key industries. While our district has historically exhibited great resilience in response to the effects of severe weather, the latest National Climate Assessment, a comprehensive report on climate change and its impacts, indicates that the severity and damage caused by extreme weather events are likely to intensify in the years ahead. (See the appendix for a discussion of the National Climate Assessment findings and conclusions.)\nThe Impact of Climate Change: Frequency and Intensity of Severe Weather Events\nA hurricane is defined as a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Since 2000, approximately 20 hurricanes have impacted the Gulf of Mexico region of the U.S., comprising Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. [4] Over this period, 14 tropical storms passed through Texas, with six of these having sufficient maximum sustained winds to be categorized as hurricanes.\nThe National Climate Assessment asserts that the intensity of hurricane activity is likely to increase. This trend is likely to be associated with greater rainfall during these severe storms. [5] In addition, the report indicates that climate change is likely to cause global sea levels to rise an average of 1–4 feet during the remainder of the 21st century. [6] As a result of rises in sea level, it is probable that the risk of flooding on the western Gulf of Mexico coast will increase. [7]\nThese developments could impact economic conditions in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District and U.S. because of the impact on coastal infrastructure, which connects the nation to energy supplies as well as access to goods and services from overseas trade. In addition, as a result of these trends, the costs to repair damage to Gulf Coast facilities are expected to grow substantially. [8]\nAs discussed earlier, one recent example of the impact of severe storms is Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall on Aug. 25, 2017, in the area just north of Corpus Christi, Texas. As Harvey stalled over the Houston metro area, some areas recorded more than 50 inches of rain in a five-day period and experienced substantial flooding as local bayous, rivers and reservoirs overflowed their banks. [9] According to estimates by Moody’s Analytics, Hurricane Harvey had total direct costs of approximately $65 billion and indirect costs of approximately $8.5 billion. [10] Tragically, 68 people are estimated to have lost their lives as a direct result of the storm. More than 300,000 homes and businesses and approximately 500,000 cars were flooded. [11]\nHarvey led to an estimated 16,000 lost jobs in the Texas Gulf Coast region—however, the Dallas Fed estimates that as of the end of 2017, employment on the Gulf Coast had more than fully recovered. [12] While increased economic activity was associated with reconstruction efforts, there are more lingering impacts including lost homes and businesses, increased insurance costs and costs of government programs to mitigate future damages.\nAs mentioned earlier, the Gulf Coast is home to a substantial concentration of refinery capacity, chemical industry infrastructure and offshore production facilities. At its peak, approximately 25 percent of the Gulf of Mexico’s offshore oil and natural gas production was shut in as a result of Harvey. [13] Refinery utilization along the Gulf Coast fell from in excess of 90 percent to approximately 60 percent. [14] More than 50 percent of U.S. output of basic petrochemicals was temporarily disrupted. [15] The refinery outages resulting from Harvey-related shutdowns led to a temporary increase in U.S. gasoline prices of 28 cents. [16]\nIn the aftermath of this storm, Gulf Coast cities as well as the state of Texas and various federal agencies have been working together to undertake multibillion-dollar investments to upgrade reservoir and flood mitigation infrastructure to better protect the region (residents and businesses) in the event of future weather events.\nClimate change is expected to increase dryness in the Eleventh District as temperatures rise, as well as increase the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation. [17] For the agriculture sector, this increased weather variability will naturally lead to increased agricultural production variability and risk. These trends may also lead to challenges relating to water availability in the state.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, “drought is the leading driver of production risk in U.S. agriculture … [as it] can reduce crop yields, lead farmers to cut back planted or harvested acreage, reduce livestock productivity, and increase costs of production inputs such as animal feed or irrigation water.” [18] For the livestock sector—which accounts for more than 60 percent of agricultural production in Texas [19] —drought effects are often felt over multiple years due to the resulting pasture damage and herd reduction that take years to recover from.\nIn Texas, where farm employment makes up approximately 1.6 percent of employment, and farm output makes up approximately 0.4 percent of state GDP, [20] agricultural losses from the historic 2011 drought were estimated to be in excess of $7 billion, accounting for about 40 percent of the average value of agricultural production and far exceeding loss estimates from any prior drought on record. [21] Droughts also induce additional indirect effects from reduced agribusiness activity in drought years—fertilizer, crop storage, machinery—plus the decrease in expenditures in the local economy resulting from lost income for producers, harvest laborers, truck drivers and agribusinesses.\nHeavy precipitation, which is expected to continue to increase in both frequency and intensity as climate change progresses, [22] also causes problems for agriculture, as seen this year in Texas and in other parts of the country. When flooding happens early in the season, fields become too wet for farmers to prepare the soil and plant crops, causing delays which lead to reduced yields or crop substitution. Flooding late in the season causes harvest delays and crop quality issues, which both hamper farm income. Hotter temperatures prompted by climate change also pose additional pest problems for farmers, driving up pesticide use and costs, and hamper livestock productivity—increasing time to grow animals to a given weight and decreasing calving rates and milk production. [23]\nThe inherent risks in the agriculture industry may be exacerbated by climate change, which could make it more difficult for agricultural producers to get sufficient financing and insurance. As crop yields become more variable, lenders may become more concerned about repayment of crop production loans and tighten their lending standards and terms. Also, insurance costs will go up as insurers have more indemnities to pay out from droughts or floods. Adaptations in the agricultural sector to mitigate the impact of drought cycles include planting more drought-resistant crops, increasing irrigation, and technological advances in water retention and irrigation application. In Texas, we may see a shift to more cotton acreage, as cotton can tolerate more heat than grain crops and has a wider time frame for planting and harvesting, which is beneficial in times of flooding.\nBesides increased hurricane intensity and greater risk of drought, climate change may have additional impacts that could affect our district. Increased temperatures are likely to have an adverse effect on people’s health and quality of life. [24] They will likely lead to increased water evaporation and soil moisture deterioration, as well as aquifer drawdowns. [25] Increased ocean acidity and warming will affect aquatic life, impacting the commercial and recreational fishing industries along the Gulf Coast. [26]\nImplications for the Dallas Fed\nAs a central banker, I do not delve into the political and other controversial aspects of this subject. However, I do intently focus on the ways severe weather events and climate-related trends are likely impacting economic conditions and financial stability in the Eleventh District and the nation.\nIt is the view of Dallas Fed economists that severe weather events pose a “tail risk” for certain cities and industries in our district.\nIt is the view of Dallas Fed economists that severe weather events pose a “tail risk” for certain cities and industries in our district. This is not new. However, while many of the impacts of these severe weather events have historically been transitory, we are increasingly cognizant of the longer-term risks that are leading several cities and companies to make substantial capital investments in improving infrastructure in order to mitigate the damage of future severe weather.\nFor now, it is the view of the Dallas Fed that severe weather-related tail risks are unlikely to materially negatively impact the medium-term economic performance of Texas and overall outlook for the region. However, if the National Climate Assessment predictions regarding the likely frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events turn out to be accurate, these extreme weather events may begin to have a negative impact on the region’s longer-term business prospects and migration trends.\nBusinesses, elected officials and civic leaders are taking a number of steps to manage these risks. State and local leaders are studying various infrastructure investments in order to upgrade the viability of neighborhoods, protect at-risk populations who lack the resources to recover from severe weather events, protect businesses, and ensure the ongoing production, transportation and transmission of energy services in the event of a severe weather-related disruption.\nIn addition, in our extensive discussions with energy industry contacts as well as broad business contacts, we are learning that businesses are investing much more heavily in alternative energy projects and sustainability initiatives. Energy companies are making substantial investments in moderating the environmental impacts of shale oil production. A number of energy companies and private equity firms are actively investing in battery storage and wind and solar projects that could diversify sources of energy in the U.S. In addition, Texas is now the largest wind-energy-producing state in the nation. [27] Many companies are adopting greenhouse-gas emissions targets and making investments to reduce their carbon footprint.\nAt the Dallas Fed, we are actively working to play a research and convening role throughout the Eleventh District to help frame these issues and discuss approaches that would improve the region’s ability to manage the effects of future severe weather events. [28] In addition, in order to improve our sustainability leadership and enhance our insight into these matters, the Dallas Fed has established a sustainability initiative intended to reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions and empower our employees to take actions which will improve the sustainability performance of our Bank. [29]\nConclusion\nThe purpose of this essay (including the appendix) has been to lay out key elements of the National Climate Assessment and discuss some of the potential implications of severe weather events for the Eleventh District. Dallas Fed economists will continue to carefully monitor and consider the impact of climate change on economic and financial conditions in the district and the nation.\nAPPENDIX\nNational Climate Assessment Findings and Conclusions\nIn 1989, President George H.W. Bush created the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). It was more formally established by Congress in 1990 via the Global Change Research Act. The USGCRP was given the mandate to develop and coordinate “a comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.” [30]\nThe USGCRP is comprised of 13 federal agencies that conduct or use research on global change and its impact on society. These agencies include the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Interior, State and Transportation, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution and U.S. Agency for International Development.\nEvery four years, the USGCRP prepares an assessment, known as the National Climate Assessment (NCA). The NCA analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, transportation, human health and biological diversity; and it describes current trends in global change and projects trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.\nThe most recent NCA was completed in November 2018 and was produced by a team of more than 300 experts, with input from external stakeholders. An expert external peer review of the report was performed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. [31]\nThe NCA concludes “that the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic well-being are rising.” [32] The report cites “significant, clear, and compelling evidence that global average temperature is much higher, and is rising more rapidly, than anything modern civilization has experienced, with widespread and growing impacts.” [33]\nThe report also explains that greenhouse gases absorb heat in the atmosphere near the Earth’s surface, preventing it from escaping out into space. If the atmospheric concentrations of these gases rise, the average temperature of the lower atmosphere will gradually increase as the heat emitted by Earth is retained inside the climate system, warming the planet, a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. [34] Greenhouse gases include, for example, carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane.\nThe report cites studies which estimate that the global average temperature rose approximately 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit between 1901 and 2016, [35] and that for the period since 1986, global annual average temperatures appear to have increased at a more rapid rate than for any similar 20–30-year time period in at least the last 1,700 years. [36]\nThe NCA states that “annual average temperatures in the United States are projected to continue to increase in the coming decades.” [37] The report indicates that recent record-setting temperatures are expected to become common in the near future. By late this century, the report estimates that in the U.S., increases of 2.3°–6.7°F are expected under a relatively optimistic climate change scenario and 5.4°–11.0°F under a more dire scenario, relative to 1986–2015. [38]\nIn addition to temperature rise, the report suggests that we are likely to see further increases in ocean temperature as well as progressive melting in glaciers and ice sheets, some shrinking in snow cover and sea ice, rising sea levels, and more frequent high temperature extremes and heavy precipitation events. [39] , [40]\nThe NCA argues that heavy rainfall events are associated with climate change. The report explains that, due to the relationships between levels of temperature and humidity, the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events are expected to increase over the coming century. The report asserts that warmer temperatures lead to increasing evaporation rates. This trend is likely to cause higher levels of water vapor in the atmosphere, which is likely to lead to more frequent and intense precipitation extremes. [41]\nThe NCA indicates that climate change has contributed to increases in Atlantic hurricane activity since 1970. [42] It also asserts that hurricane rainfall and intensity are projected to increase as a result of rises in sea surface temperatures and changes in atmospheric conditions. [43] While the frequency of tropical storms is not expected to change, the number of more-severe storms—those with sustained wind speeds in excess of 130 mph (referred to as Category 4 and 5 hurricanes)—is expected to increase. [44]\nThe report warns that U.S. coastal infrastructure could be adversely impacted by this trend. This infrastructure provides critical energy supplies and access to goods and services from overseas trade. [45] The report further highlights that reliable and affordable energy supplies, which support broad sectors of the U.S. economy, are increasingly at risk from climate change and weather extremes. [46]\nAcross much of the U.S., climate change is also expected to decrease surface soil moisture due to increased evaporation rates associated with warmer temperatures. This means that future droughts in certain regions of the U.S. are likely to be stronger and potentially last longer. The NCA explains that when droughts occur simultaneously with especially warm temperatures, it creates conditions for substantial wildfires, which have increased in frequency across the western U.S. since the 1980s. [47] Droughts can also have a significant impact on agriculture.\nFor a fuller explanation of the NCA report, please see the link, National Climate Assessment .\nRobert S.

    "text": "A Discussion of Economic Conditions and the Role of Monetary Policy\nJune 23, 2016 New York\nThank  you for inviting me to speak with you.\nI want  to talk with you today about monetary policy—its proper role, how it’s  currently positioned, and the challenges facing policy makers in the years  ahead.\nLet me  begin with a brief discussion of current economic conditions and the  implications for monetary policy. I will then talk a bit about key issues  facing economic policy makers.\nEleventh  District Discussion of Energy\nI’ll  start with a discussion of energy because of its impact on the Eleventh Federal  Reserve District as well as its importance to the nation and the world.\nBased on  analysis as well as discussions with industry contacts, our Dallas Fed  economists believe that global oil production and consumption will get into  rough balance by early 2017. While there are varying estimates of the precise  timing of this balancing process, the key to us is the trend—we are gradually  moving toward balance. Our forecast is based on our expectation that global  demand will grow by approximately 1.3 million barrels per day in 2016 as  compared to 2015. [1]\nDespite  significant cuts in capital spending and rig counts in the U.S., global supply  reductions have been slow to materialize over the past year. As supply  reductions in the U.S. have occurred, they have been more than offset by  production increases in Iran, Russia and other nations.\nBased on  a slowing rate of global supply growth (including significant supply cuts  underway in the U.S.) as well as steady growth in demand, we expect excess oil  inventories in OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development)  countries to begin to decline in the near future. Inventory drawdowns will also  be impacted by periodic supply disruptions, such as those which have occurred  in Canada, Nigeria, Iraq and Kuwait.\nAs a  result of these trends, we would expect oil prices to continue to firm in the  coming months. Even with prices firming, because many energy companies are  highly leveraged or operate in areas where the breakeven cost of production is  above current market prices, we expect to see more bankruptcies, mergers and  restructurings in the energy industry during the remainder of 2016.\n(Note:  Next week the Dallas Fed will release the results of its new quarterly energy survey . The survey samples nearly 200 upstream energy companies headquartered  in the Eleventh District, many with national and global operations. Respondents  will report on their expectations for oil and gas prices, production levels,  cost information, employment, capital spending and the overall outlook.)\nThe  Eleventh District Overall Economic Conditions\nThe  Eleventh District is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New  Mexico. The challenges of the energy industry continue to create headwinds for  our district. The industry now comprises approximately 2 percent of Texas  employment [2] and 7 percent of its gross domestic product [3] (versus 3 percent of employment and 13 percent of GDP in 2014).\nTexas  has substantially diversified its economy over the past three decades. Some of  this diversification has occurred organically, and a significant portion has  developed as a result of a sustained migration of people and firms to the  state. Since 2000, population growth in Texas has exceeded that of the nation  by a full 1 percentage point per year. This growth and diversification has  helped contribute to the resiliency of the state despite recent headwinds from  lower energy prices and a strong dollar.\nIn 2016,  Dallas Fed economists expect Texas job growth of 1.3 percent—the same as in  2015, but down from 3.7 percent in 2014. [4] Manufacturing in Texas remains weak, but the state’s service sector continues  to show steady growth. While Houston and other energy-sensitive cities continue  to face economic headwinds, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin are growing at  healthy rates.\nDue to  an increasingly diversified economy as well as continued migration of people  and firms to Texas, I am very optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas  and the Eleventh District in the years ahead—particularly as the headwinds from  energy and a strong dollar continue to dissipate.\nEconomic  Conditions in the U.S. Economy\nGross  Domestic Product and Employment\nEstimates  of first quarter 2016 GDP growth were disappointing. In addition, the recently  released May jobs report showed a net increase of only 38,000 jobs. [5]\nThe  labor force participation rate, which measures the population 16 and older that  is either employed or actively looking for work, declined from approximately  62.8 percent to 62.6 percent. [6] While the unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent, [7] the  decline was driven primarily by the reduction in the participation rate.\nDespite  this most recent information, Dallas Fed economists continue to expect that GDP  will grow approximately 2 percent in 2016. This forecast is based on our  expectation of strong consumer demand in the U.S.\nAt this  stage in the economic cycle, it is our updated view that job growth of between  60,000 to 120,000 per month will be necessary to keep the unemployment rate  constant, depending on changes in the labor force participation rate.\nThe  labor force participation rate is now 3.4 percentage points below its  prerecession level. Dallas Fed economists believe that most of this decline is  due to an aging population. It is our view that if current trends continue, the  participation rate is likely to decline to below 61 percent by 2024. [8] This  expected decline will have negative implications for future potential GDP  growth in the U.S.\nInflation\nHeadline  inflation continues to run below the 2 percent longer-run objective set by the  Federal Reserve. The most recent PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) report  indicated headline inflation of 1.1 percent on a 12-month basis. [9]\nIn  addition to headline inflation, our economists carefully track measures of core  inflation. In particular, we look at the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean inflation rate,  which trims out the most extreme upward and downward monthly price changes. This  rate had been running between 1.6 and 1.7 percent from early 2014 until the end  of 2015. Since the start of this year, it has edged up to between 1.8 and 1.9  percent. The stability and trend of this measure bolsters our confidence that  headline inflation will reach 2 percent over the medium term as the effects of  declining energy prices and a stronger dollar ultimately subside.\nGlobal  Economic Conditions\nWhile we  are the central bank of the United States, it is critical to assess how global  economic conditions impact domestic economic conditions. Estimates of non-U.S. growth  continue to be revised downward, and the composition of this growth continues  to be uneven.\nBrazil,  Russia and Venezuela remain in recession in 2016 while advanced economies show  modest but steady growth. One particular concern is China, which continues to  be challenged by overcapacity in key industries, high levels of debt to GDP,  aging demographics as well as an initiative to transition its economy from one  that is heavily export and manufacturing based to one that is more consumer and  service-sector based.\nAs China  grapples with these issues, its future rates of GDP growth are likely to  decline. As the world adjusts to these lower levels of growth, China may be  vulnerable to periodic bouts of currency and financial turmoil, which have the  potential to trigger a tightening of conditions across global financial  markets. We saw this unfold in January and February when the devaluation of the  Chinese currency was accompanied by a steep selloff in Chinese markets, which  then transmitted to a tightening in global financial conditions. We will  continue to carefully monitor this situation as it unfolds over the next  several years.\nImplications  for Monetary Policy\nAs you  know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left policy unchanged at our  recent June meeting.\nIn the  coming weeks, I will be carefully assessing incoming economic data in order to  gauge our progress towards achieving our dual mandate objectives regarding full  employment and price stability.\nI am  closely monitoring how slowing growth, high levels of overcapacity and high  levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies outside the U.S. might be impacting  economic conditions in the U.S. I am also closely tracking how these issues  might be affecting the slope of the U.S. Treasury yield curve as well as  measures of tightness in financial conditions.\nIn light  of these challenges, I have been suggesting that removal of accommodation  should be done in a gradual and patient manner, based on a realistic assessment  of economic conditions. I am also very cognizant that, from a risk management  point of view, our monetary policies have an asymmetrical impact at or near the  zero lower bound.\nWith  that overview, let me turn to a broader discussion of the role of monetary policy.\nCurrent  Challenges of Monetary Policy\nAs you  know, the target range for the federal funds rate stands at 25 to 50 basis  points. The Federal Reserve raised the range by 25 basis points in December  2015 after seven years at the zero lower bound. Prolonged low rates, several  rounds of quantitative easing and other extraordinary Fed policy actions came  in response to the severe financial crisis and economic recession of 2008 and  2009.\nIt is  worth noting that the last time that short-term interest rates in the United  States were this low was during the middle and late 1930s, as the U.S. economy  struggled to emerge from the Great Depression. Policy rates in other countries  are also at historically low levels. Nominal rates in Japan, Switzerland,  Denmark, and Sweden are actually negative ,  as are government bond yields in Germany and Japan, even at maturities over five  years. [10] Real government bond yields—returns  after inflation—are at or below zero across a wide swath of countries,  including the United States.\nReal and  nominal yields at these low levels raise concerns for the economic outlook and  for monetary policy. Low real returns challenge those trying to accumulate  assets for retirement or those who rely on income from their investments. Low  nominal yields can be a sign that monetary policy is struggling to maintain  long-run price stability—or they can be a sign that central banks are pursuing  highly accommodative policies. High levels of accommodation have the potential  to distort asset-allocation decisions and the hiring and investment decisions  made by businesses. The stakes are high: History has shown that real and financial  market imbalances, once they accumulate, typically are painful to unwind. The  difficulty is that these imbalances often aren’t obvious until after the fact.\nWhy are  short-term interest rates so low? What can be done to stimulate growth and  create an environment that is conducive to normalizing the level of interest  rates in the United States? What should be the role of monetary policy, as well  as other government actions, in this effort?\nTo  address these questions, let me start with a discussion of the neutral real  interest rate.\nThe  Neutral Rate\nAs  central bankers, we aim for monetary policy to be accommodative when the  economy is operating below full employment and trend inflation is below target.  We typically begin to remove accommodation as we move closer to achieving those  dual goals. When our full-employment and price-stability goals are in conflict,  the FOMC makes an assessment of the “balance of risks” to the two objectives.\nWhile  there are disagreements about how much slack remains in the labor market and  about how best to gauge trend inflation, policy debates focus more  fundamentally on how to gauge the appropriate level of tightness or easiness in  monetary policy. This, in turn, depends on judgments about the “neutral rate”—the  rate that signifies the dividing line between an accommodative and a  restrictive monetary policy. This debate is complicated by the fact that the  neutral rate is “unobserved”—that is, we infer this rate based on observations  of financial and economic data.\nIn  January 2012, Federal Reserve policy makers submitted their projections of the  appropriate path of the federal funds rate over the medium term. Since that  date, the median projection of these policymakers has declined from a 4.25  percent longer-run nominal funds rate to 3.0 percent in the most recent June  submission. Given the FOMC’s commitment to a 2.0 percent longer-run inflation  target, these projections imply a reduction in the longer-run neutral real  interest rate from 2.25 percent to 1.0 percent today. Trading levels of  Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) have signaled a substantially similar  decline in the longer-run neutral real rate. [11]\nPotential  Reasons for Decline in Neutral Rate\nA major  driver of the decline in the neutral rate is a decrease in estimates of future  growth. In the first quarter of 2003, the Congressional Budget Office projected  five-year prospective growth would average 3.25 [12] percent per year; in the first quarter of 2008, the prospective five-year growth  estimate was 2.88 [13] percent per year, and  today, prospective five-year growth is estimated to be 2.28 [14] percent per year.\nThis  growth slowdown has been mostly due to demographics—baby boomers are moving  into their retirement years—but weaker productivity growth also contributes significantly  to this decline. Given the deterioration in U.S. growth prospects, it makes  sense that the longer-run neutral real interest rate has declined. This  deterioration appears to be occurring across all advanced economies, which  helps explain the historically low level of rates we are seeing.\nAnother  likely reason for the decline in the neutral rate is the emergence of the U.S.  as chief supplier of safe assets to the world. In an increasingly globally  connected world, the search for safety and return occurs globally—meaning that  low rates in one country can quickly impact interest rates in other countries.  Robert Hall of Stanford University and the Hoover Institution argues that the  representation of risk-averse foreign investors in U.S. financial markets has  increased and that this trend has contributed to downward pressure on the  neutral real rate. [15]\nMy  colleague John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, along with Thomas  Laubach, on the staff of the Board of Governors, has done pioneering work on  the neutral rate (r*) that argues the longer-run neutral real rate depends on  the economy’s potential growth rate, which varies over time, as well as other  unobserved factors. [16] As of the first quarter of 2016, the Laubach–Williams model implied a 0.2  percent neutral real rate.\nEvan  Koenig and Alan Armen at the Dallas Fed use movements in slack to help identify  the neutral real rate. They focus on shorter-run r* and, rather than make r* a  direct function of growth in potential output, Koenig and Armen draw on signals  from the financial markets and changes in household wealth. They argue that  wealth growth and long-term yields do a good job of picking up changes in  growth prospects and capture movements in other r* determinants. [17]\nThe  Koenig–Armen model says that the short-run neutral real rate was negative 1.3 percent in the first  quarter of 2016, about 1.5 percentage points below the latest Laubach–Williams  estimate of the longer-run rate and only 15 basis points above the actual real  rate. Policy was only modestly accommodative last quarter, according to Koenig–Armen.\nWhile  these approaches yield different estimates of the neutral real rate, they each  indicate that there has been a significant decline over the past several years.\nI am  strongly persuaded by arguments that aging demographics in advanced economies,  a decline in productivity growth and the continued emergence of the U.S. as a  source of safe assets have all contributed to the decline in the neutral rate.  I also believe that high levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies and higher  levels of political polarization have, at a minimum, limited the capacity of  these countries to use fiscal policy and structural reforms that could have stimulated  higher rates of growth. This situation has, in turn, caused the neutral rate to  be lower than it would be otherwise.\nThe  Role of Monetary Policy\nIn light  of the decline in the neutral rate, using monetary policy to help manage the  economy has become more challenging. One of the implications of very low  short-term rates is that there is less room for monetary policy makers to use  these rates to increase the level of accommodation in situations where it is  deemed advisable. This has led central banks around the world to try other,  more “unconventional” policies to create greater accommodation. Examples  include quantitative easing in various forms as well as negative interest  rates.\nMonetary  policy has a key role to play in economic policy. However, at or near the zero  lower bound, it may be less effective than other tools of economic policy. Monetary  policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural issues we face  today stemming from demographic changes, lower levels of productivity growth  and high levels of debt to GDP as well as dislocations created by globalization  and increasing rates of economic disruption. While monetary policy certainly  has a key role to play, it is not a substitute for actions that address  structural issues and other economic challenges.\nFor the  past eight years, advanced economies have relied heavily on monetary policy and  much less on fiscal policy as well as other structural reforms. However, at  this stage, if we are going to generate higher sustainable rates of GDP growth  and address key secular issues, there needs to be policy action beyond monetary  policy. This action could take a variety of forms.\nPotential  Policy Actions Beyond Monetary Policy\nGiven  that aging of the population is expected to continue to create headwinds for  future economic growth, more could be done to examine policies that could ensure  an inflow of workers to strengthen and grow the U.S. workforce. Appropriate immigration  policy is a key element of this effort.\nInvestment  in education is also a key element of ensuring that our population achieves  sufficiently high levels of educational attainment so they can become  productive members of the labor force. Many have argued that improving  educational attainment is critical to raising workforce productivity in the  U.S., thereby improving economic growth. Options for improving educational  attainment must include beefing up public/private partnerships that focus on  vocational training that equips workers for technical and other skills-based  opportunities of the 21st century.\nPublic  investments that upgrade aging infrastructure could potentially improve  productivity and help to bolster sluggish demand. Given the sizable private  pools of capital that exist today, some meaningful portion of this investment  could come from public/private partnerships, with substantial capital coming  from the private sector.\nMore  broadly, tax reform and regulatory policies that create incentives for growth  and investment could ultimately improve growth rates. Improved growth  expectations could help to counter the forces holding down the neutral real  interest rate, giving monetary policy makers greater scope for action without  resorting to unconventional tools.\nSome  observers suggest conducting a comprehensive review of regulations at the  national, state and local levels. They argue that, in some cases, excessive  regulation and fees might be creating undue burdens on capital investment,  lending, and the formation and growth of small business. This may help to  explain why business investment and small-business formation have been  disappointing over the past several years.\nAccording  to government estimates, the present value of future underfunding of “entitlements”  is in excess of $45 trillion. [18] This underfunding is expected to increase annual U.S. budget deficits, as a  percent of GDP, into the foreseeable future. Some have suggested that this  level of underfunding may create growth in federal debt burdens that is  unsustainable.\nEntitlement  reforms, which involve strengthening these programs without jeopardizing  potential benefits for those already 55 or older, could help improve the  sustainability as well as ease the future fiscal burden of these programs. In  addition, reforms might reduce current disincentives to remain in the labor  force, while helping to soften the demographic transition’s depressing effects  on growth and interest rates. Such reforms, insofar as they ease long-term  concerns regarding the sustainability of debt to GDP, might also reduce  uncertainty about future tax rates and boost growth expectations through that  channel.\nHistorically  during economic downturns, fiscal policy has often been used to assist monetary  policy. However, due to high levels of debt to GDP as well as political  polarization, governments have had difficulty coming to consensus on such  action. [19]\nThese  are some examples of policy actions which could be considered. There are  certainly other examples, including efforts to implement more comprehensive  trade policy. Policy makers would need to address which of these might make  sense to pursue. Whichever choices policy makers prefer, my point is that some  of these actions will be necessary to address the challenges we currently face.\nConcluding  Remarks\nI am optimistic about the  strength of the U.S. economy and the future of this nation. However, this optimism  is based on a belief that we as a nation will address pressing secular as well  as shorter-term cyclical challenges. Our ability to face key issues and come  together to address them has been an essential element of the enduring strength  and success of our great country.\nI believe our country is at the  stage where structural reforms, fiscal policy and other government actions need  to join the menu of economic policy. That is, to address several of the key  challenges we face, there needs to be economic policy action beyond monetary  policy. While there may be good reasons why monetary policy has been the  primary policy action over the past several years, we are now at the point  where policy makers must enter a new phase in our thinking and actions.\nWe need to think more expansively  about how to generate higher rates of GDP growth. Now, eight years after the Great  Recession, we need to take a new and broader approach to our economic policy  making.\nThank you. I look forward to  taking your questions.\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official   positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nRobert S.

    "text": "An assessment of economic conditions and the stance of monetary policy\nFebruary 18, 2020\nIn our most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  meeting, the Federal Reserve decided to leave the federal funds rate unchanged  in a range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent. In addition, we made a 5-basis-point upward  adjustment to the interest paid on excess reserves (IOER) held by banks on  deposit at the Fed. This was a technical adjustment intended to support the  setting of the federal funds rate well within the range set by the FOMC.\nI supported these decisions as well as the post-meeting  communication regarding the path of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. The Fed  balance sheet expanded rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2019 as repurchase  agreement (repo) operations and Treasury bills purchases were needed to  maintain reserve levels.\nIt is my hope and expectation that, as reserves in the  banking system meet or exceed ample levels of at least $1.5 trillion, the Fed  balance sheet will expand only gradually to reflect trend growth in the demand  for currency and other Federal Reserve liabilities. I would expect that, over  the first half of 2020, the pace of balance sheet expansion will moderate  significantly as active repo operations gradually decline and reserve  management purchases of Treasury bills slow in the second quarter.\nI continue to support a review of our supervisory guidance and  regulatory policies in an effort to assess whether we could put Treasury bills  and reserves on a more equal footing in terms of bank liquidity management. I  also remain open to consideration of other alternatives which could help the  Fed run an ample reserves regime with a sensitivity to limiting growth in the size  of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.\nEconomic outlook\nIt is the base-case view of Dallas Fed economists that U.S. gross  domestic product (GDP) will grow at a rate of approximately 2 to 2.25 percent  in 2020. This forecast is based on our expectation that global growth is likely  to remain sluggish but will show signs of stabilization due to some calming of  trade uncertainties—particularly  as a result of the ratification of the United States–Mexico–Canada  Agreement, the Phase One agreement with China, and some greater clarity  regarding Brexit. In this regard, we also expect U.S. manufacturing to remain  sluggish but show some signs of stabilization. Lastly, we expect business fixed  investment to firm somewhat from disappointing levels in 2019. These  developments, combined with a strong U.S. consumer (which accounts for approximately  70 percent of U.S. GDP), should lead to solid growth in 2020.\nOf course, this outlook is clouded by the impact of the  coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China. This development will likely mean  slower growth in China and risks to the downside for global growth. Dallas Fed  economists are considering various alternative scenarios for how this virus  could impact U.S. and global GDP growth. However, at this stage, it is still too  soon to predict with confidence the ultimate impact of this virus on the U.S.  and global economies. Our Dallas Fed team will continue to actively monitor  this situation and assess its ongoing implications.\nIn addition, I am cognizant that the delay in production of the  Boeing 737 Max airplane is likely to reduce U.S. GDP growth by as much as 0.4  percent (annualized) in the first quarter of 2020. The extent of the full-year  effect will ultimately be determined by the timing of a return to production,  likely later in the year. Finally, the first half of 2020 will benefit from the  return of post-strike production at General Motors.\nAgainst this backdrop, the U.S. consumer continues to be the  key underpinning of the U.S. economy. Household debt to GDP has gone from a  peak of 98 percent in 2008 to approximately 74 percent as of third quarter 2019. [1] In addition to this improvement in household balance sheets, the current rate  of unemployment in the U.S. is approximately 3.6 percent. [2] Furthermore, the U-6 measure of unemployment—which  takes into account the unemployed, plus discouraged workers who have given up  looking for work, plus workers who work part time but would prefer to work full  time—is currently running  at approximately 6.9 percent. [3] This reading is near its historic low of 6.7 percent reached in December 2019.  The labor force participation rate (the percentage of 16 year olds and above  either employed or actively looking for work) now stands at 63.4 percent, its highest  level since June 2013. [4] All this suggests to Dallas Fed economists that the U.S. economy is likely at  or past the level of full employment. This further bolsters our near-term  confidence in the strength of the U.S. consumer.\nBased on our forecast, we would expect headline unemployment  to drift down from the current reading of 3.6 percent to approximately 3.5  percent during 2020. In addition, Dallas Fed economists believe that the personal  consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation rate will gradually move toward the  Fed’s 2 percent target in the medium term. This confidence is bolstered by the  fact that the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE measure of inflation, which exes  out inflation components with extreme moves to the upside or the downside, is  currently running at approximately 2 percent on a 12-month basis. [5] Our research indicates that the trimmed mean is a good indicator of future headline  PCE inflation trends.\nPotential GDP growth\nExpected 2020 growth of 2 to 2.25 percent is in  line with the average growth rate of the U.S. economy since 2010. [6] However, this level of growth is sluggish by historical standards. GDP growth  is made up of growth in the workforce plus growth in productivity. As I’ve  discussed in previous essays, aging demographics and sluggish workforce growth  ( Chart 1 ) and more modest  productivity growth ( Chart 2 ) are  negatively impacting potential GDP growth in the U.S.\nDownloadable chart\nDownloadable chart\nThe rate of U.S. workforce growth has declined from a yearly  average of approximately 2.71 percent in the 1970s to 1.27 percent in the 1990s  to an expected 0.24 percent in the 2020s. [7] This deceleration in workforce growth is not being offset by improvements in  productivity per worker. The rate of U.S. productivity growth has declined from  a yearly average of almost 2 percent in the 1990s to 0.85 percent since 2010. [8]\nIt’s the view of Dallas Fed economists that structural  reforms are needed if we are to improve U.S. workforce growth. These reforms  could include policies that facilitate child care and transportation services,  which make it easier for marginally attached workers to enter and stay in the  workforce. In addition, immigration reform that focuses on skills and employer  needs could also help increase the rate of U.S. workforce growth.\nProductivity growth could be enhanced by policies that help  workers impacted by technology and technology-enabled disruption to get  reskilled. Dallas Fed economists believe that the emphasis on skills training  programs could be dramatically increased in the U.S. In addition, policies that  focus on improving early-childhood literacy and the overall math, science and  reading skills of our next generation of workers would help improve their  adaptability and productivity. Lastly, investments in selected infrastructure  improvements could help create greater efficiencies in the U.S. economy.\nWe would also note that, in this context, global trade is  likely an opportunity for the U.S. to grow faster. In particular, integrated logistics  and supply-chain arrangements, especially those with Mexico and, to a lesser  extent, Canada have been critical to improving the global competiveness of U.S.  firms, which has allowed these firms to add jobs and domicile their businesses  in the U.S.\nFinding ways to improve the potential growth rate of the  U.S. economy is critical given that the amount of U.S. government debt held by  the public is now approximately 79 percent of GDP [9] and the present value of unfunded entitlements is now approximately $59  trillion. [10]\nWhile monetary policy has a key role to play in enhancing the ability of  the U.S. economy to grow at its potential, it is not a substitute for  structural reforms and policies that can improve the level of potential growth  in the U.S. As a central banker, I believe it is important to point out the  limits of monetary policy and the need for broader policies to improve the  economic future of the U.S. (See the essay “Economic Conditions and the Key  Structural Drivers Impacting the Economic Outlook,” Oct. 10, 2019, which  discusses these structural challenges and opportunities).\nEnergy\nOil industry outlook\nThe Eleventh District of the Federal Reserve is  home to the Permian Basin, which accounts for approximately 36 percent of U.S. crude  oil production. [11] , [12] Due to the emergence of the U.S. shale industry, the U.S. now produces  approximately 12.9 million barrels per day (mb/d) of crude oil. [13] This compares with crude oil production of approximately 11.3 mb/d by Russia  and 9.7 mb/d by Saudi Arabia. [14]\nIt is the view of Dallas Fed economists that global oil production  (crude oil and liquids) will increase by 0.7 mb/d to approximately 102.3 mb/d from  fourth quarter 2019 to fourth quarter 2020. [15] This production forecast assumes growth of 0.7 mb/d in the U.S. and 0.7 mb/d in  other non-OPEC countries, and a decline of 0.7 mb/d in OPEC oil production.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that global  consumption will likely grow by approximately 1.0 mb/d to 102.2 mb/d in 2020. [16] The coronavirus presents a meaningful risk to demand growth globally as overall  Chinese oil consumption represented approximately 14 percent of total global  consumption and approximately 57 percent of global consumption growth in 2019. [17] The IEA consumption forecast indicates that, due to the impact of the virus,  first quarter 2020 global oil demand will decline by approximately 0.4 mb/d  versus the first quarter of 2019. It further assumes that a substantial portion  of this consumption decline will reverse in subsequent quarters of 2020. It is  worth noting that the expected first-quarter consumption decline would be the  first year-over-year drop in quarterly oil demand since the Great Recession of  2007–09.\nIn this context, Dallas Fed economists expect U.S. crude oil  production growth of approximately 0.4 mb/d in 2020. [18] This compares with production growth of 2.0 mb/d in 2018 and 0.9 mb/d in 2019. [19] These forecasts assume West Texas Intermediate oil prices stay in the range of  approximately $50 to $60 per barrel.\nThis expected decline in U.S. production growth is influenced  by weaker global demand growth and is also heavily influenced by a dramatic increase  in pressure from capital providers to see “discipline” in capital allocation  from energy and production firms. In practice, this means that capital  expenditures for drilling activity will have to be funded by internal cash flow  versus debt issuance. This is a fairly significant change from historic  practice. It should be noted that shale projects are more “short-cycle”  investments than typical conventional projects—they can be drilled and brought  onstream very quickly and, on average, for approximately $6 million to $8  million per well. However, as output of wells tends to decline rapidly in the  first few years of production, producers must continuously invest in order to  maintain overall production levels.\nAs a result of these developments, our Dallas Fed oil industry contacts  have indicated to us that they expect capital spending in the U.S. oil and gas  sector could be down by as much as 10 to 15 percent in 2020. This reduction in  capital spending is likely to have a substantial impact on energy service  companies. Several companies have already announced restructurings, charge-offs  and layoffs. In light of this, we would expect that 2020 will be a year of  restructurings, consolidation where possible, and general belt tightening.\nImplications for Texas and the U.S. Economy\nDespite a more challenging environment for oil and gas production,  Dallas Fed economists still expect 2020 job growth in Texas to be approximately  2.1 percent. [20] While the state’s economy  has grown substantially and become much more diversified over the past several  decades, the energy sector still represents approximately 9 percent of Texas  GDP [21] and remains a key economic driver in a number of important regions of the  state.\nIn the U.S. more broadly, lower oil prices should benefit  U.S. consumers by freeing up more of their disposable income for the consumption  of non-oil goods and services. However, because the U.S. is no longer a net  importer of oil and petroleum products, the benefit to U.S. GDP of lower oil  prices for consumers may be increasingly offset by the negative impact on  domestic energy producers in terms of capital spending and employee  compensation. Changes in oil prices will increasingly redistribute income  between sectors and states within the U.S., as opposed to impacting the  transfer of income between the U.S. and other oil-exporting nations.\nAs a result of these developments, over the past several years, the U.S.  has become somewhat less sensitive than in the past to oil price fluctuations. Additionally,  since the 1970s, the U.S. economy has become less oil-intensive due to substitution  for oil by other forms of energy, improved fuel efficiency, and growth in the  less-energy-intensive services sector as a share of the overall economy.\nGrowth in Renewables\nDallas Fed energy economists expect that global energy  consumption will increasingly reflect reduced reliance on fossil fuels (oil,  natural gas and coal) as a share of total consumption. This reduced reliance is  primarily due to expected growth in renewable energy. Renewable energy sources  include hydropower, solar power, wind power (offshore and onshore), geothermal  and modern bioenergy production (including energy content in solid, liquid and  gaseous products derived from biomass feedstocks and biogas). While estimates  of the increase in renewable energy production vary, there is clear evidence  that a transition is underway in the energy industry.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) base-case forecast  suggests that renewables are likely to substantially increase as a percentage  of global energy consumption over the next 20 years. [22] Their forecast indicates that, under stated policies, renewables will grow approximately  125 percent over the period, outpacing global oil and natural gas consumption  growth of approximately 21 percent. [23] However, the IEA notes that if global regulators take a much more aggressive  stance to achieve the energy-related goals of the United Nations Sustainable  Development agenda, [24] it estimates that renewables  could grow by over 200 percent and global oil and natural gas consumption could  decline by as much as 20 percent by 2040. [25] In that case, renewables would account for nearly 33 percent of global energy consumption. [26]\nOur Eleventh District industry contacts report to us that they believe  investments in sustainability and innovative approaches to mitigate the impacts  of climate change are likely to provide substantial growth opportunities for  U.S. businesses. We are already seeing a number of these investments in Texas.\nThe stance of monetary policy\nIt is my view that, based on my base-case outlook for the  U.S. economy, the current setting of the federal funds rate at 1.5 to 1.75  percent is roughly appropriate. Consistent with this view, my Summary of  Economic Projections (SEP) submission in December 2019 indicated that I  expected no movement in the federal funds rate through 2020.\nOf course, my views are subject to revision based on how the outlook for  the U.S. economy evolves over the course of this year. In that regard, I will  be closely monitoring a variety of economic developments and, in particular,  continuing to assess how the coronavirus ultimately will impact the U.S. and  global economies.\nRobert S. Kaplan was president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 2015–21.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jackson Crawford, Jim Dolmas, Scott Frame,  Marc Giannoni, Drew Johnson, Lutz Kilian, Evan Koenig, Pia Orrenius, Kunal Patel, Michael Plante, Kathy Thacker, Joe Tracy and Mine Yücel in preparing these remarks.\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

    "text": "Discussion of Economic Conditions and Implications for Monetary Policy\nMarch 3, 2016 Dallas\nThank  you for having me here today. I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you.\nA  little background: I have been president of the Dallas Fed since early  September of 2015. Since that time, I have had the opportunity to meet with and  get to know business and community leaders and talk with many other people  throughout this district (which includes Texas, northern Louisiana and southern  New Mexico). I have attended four Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings  and developed good working relationships with the other Federal Reserve Bank  presidents as well as with the Board of Governors.\nI’ve  been impressed with the quality of the people at the Fed and their unwavering  commitment to serve the citizens of the nation. I have seen a high level of rigor,  intensity and overall excellence in the Fed’s work on monetary policy and  supervision, as well as in the various other important functions it performs on  behalf of the American people.\nSince  taking this role, I have developed a much greater appreciation for the  complexity of the Fed’s work in analyzing economic conditions and making  decisions regarding monetary policy. I have learned that, in a rapidly changing  world, there are seldom “no brainer” or easy decisions. This work requires an  open mind, intellectual diligence and persistence, a willingness to work  through complexity, and a desire to understand arguments and counterarguments.  And yes, when appropriate, you have got to be able to change your mind and make  balanced judgments in order to serve the nation.\nOne  key aspect of the Fed is the vital role played by members of the private sector  as well as community leaders in our work. On the Dallas Fed boards of  directors, which include our branch boards in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso,  we have business, community and nonprofit leaders with diverse geographic,  cultural and functional backgrounds. They spend a substantial amount of time  with us sharing valuable insights regarding economic trends and overall  economic conditions.\nIn  addition, hundreds of private sector businesses in our district regularly  participate in our manufacturing, service sector, agricultural, energy and  Beige Book surveys. [1] These surveys are an essential information source regarding conditions in our  region. In addition to these activities, before every FOMC meeting, I speak  with numerous industry leaders to discuss their insights regarding economic  conditions in the district, the nation and the rest of the world. Our economic  research and policy work is dramatically enhanced by the enormous contribution  of time from this diverse group of leaders. Their contributions are essential  to our ability to make sound decisions for the country.\nWith  that background, let me make a few comments on economic conditions in the  district, the nation and the world. I will then comment on implications of  these conditions for monetary policy.\nThe Eleventh District:  Discussion of Energy\nIt  is our view at the Dallas Fed that, in 2016, global energy production will  exceed consumption by an average of approximately 1 million barrels per day. [2] By year-end, we believe that this excess will decline to approximately 500,000  barrels per day. [3] We expect that global demand will grow by approximately 1.2 million barrels per  day in 2016. [4]\nOECD  (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) inventories continue to  increase and now stand at roughly 400 million barrels above the historical  five-year average. [5] These excess inventory levels will increase through 2016, and there is now some  discussion in the industry about potential limits in storage capacity.\nWe  estimate that the market will not find some degree of daily production/consumption  balance until mid-2017 and, at that point, excess inventories will begin to  decline. This forecast has been influenced over the past several months by the official  return of Iran to the world oil markets, increased supply from OPEC nations,  slower-than-expected supply declines from U.S. producers despite substantial  cuts in drilling and capital spending, and slower-than-expected demand from  emerging-market countries. This outlook would be meaningfully impacted by a  change in OPEC production strategy.\nGiven  these various factors, the ultimate timing of market production/consumption  balance remains uncertain. In the meantime, we expect to see continued low  prices and high levels of price volatility, as well as more bankruptcies,  mergers and restructurings in the energy industry.\nOne  by-product of lower oil prices is wider credit spreads in the high-yield  market. Because corporate energy issuers comprise a material portion of high-yield  issuance, and because high-yield debt is heavily held in mutual-fund (with  daily liquidity obligations) and exchange-traded fund form, weakness in the  energy sector has the potential to create increased levels of fund redemptions.  This, in turn, can put pressure on funds to sell holdings more broadly in order  to meet liquidity needs. This is a good example of the potential negative  ripple effects that can come from persistent weakness in the energy sector.\nBroad Economic  Conditions in the Eleventh District\nAs  has been the case for the past year, the Eleventh District is being adversely affected  by low oil prices as well as the strength of the dollar. As a result of these  challenges, Texas job growth slowed from 3.6 percent in 2014 to 1.5 percent in  2015, and Dallas Fed economists expect only about 1 percent growth in 2016. [6] Risks  to this forecast are to the downside if oil stays at or below $30 per barrel  for an extended period.\nWhile  the nation’s unemployment rate has declined since the beginning of 2015, the  Texas unemployment rate increased from 4.4 percent at the beginning of the year  to 4.6 percent at year-end. [7] We  expect the state unemployment rate to rise further in 2016 even as the national  unemployment rate continues to fall.\nIn  2015, the Texas energy and manufacturing sectors lost jobs while the state’s  service sector showed steady, moderate growth. [8] This recent economic performance has been bolstered by the diversified nature  of the Texas economy. While Houston’s growth has been brought to a halt by the energy  downturn, Austin, Dallas and San Antonio have shown strong growth and continue  to attract people and firms from around the country and the world.\nThe  energy industry accounted for approximately 2 percent of Texas employment [9] and approximately 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015, [10] a  good deal lower than in the 1980s, when that oil bust pushed the Texas economy  into a major recession. While the downturn in the energy industry has created  negative ripple effects in the state, the Texas economy has proven to be highly  resilient. I expect this resiliency and underlying strength to continue as the  negative impacts of energy begin to dissipate in the years ahead.\nEconomic Conditions in  the Nation\nGross Domestic Product and  Unemployment The  Commerce Department estimates that the U.S. economy grew 1.9 percent in 2015,  and our economists expect a similar rate of growth in 2016. [11] This rate of GDP growth, while sluggish by historical standards, was sufficient  to drive down the U.S. unemployment rate from 5.6 percent at the start of the  year to approximately 5 percent by year-end, and to 4.9 percent in January. [12]\nThe  service sector continues to be the primary driver of growth in the U.S.  economy. In contrast, the manufacturing sector continues to struggle as a  result of a strong dollar and continued weakness outside the U.S.\nOur  economists expect the unemployment rate to continue to decline in 2016, but at  a slower pace. In addition to looking at the headline rate, we also track other  measures that gauge the degree of slack in the labor market. In particular, we  closely monitor the labor force participation rate, which is the share of the  population that is either employed or actively looking for work. This share is  currently 62.7 percent, which is approximately 3.5 percentage points below its  prerecession level. [13] Our Dallas Fed economists believe that over one-half of this decline is  explained by aging-workforce demographics. We are also tracking measures of  “discouraged” workers, who have given up looking for work, as well as estimates  of the number of part-time workers who might convert to full time in a stronger  job market.\nMy  own view is that overcapacity in non-U.S. economies must be considered along  with domestic labor slack in assessing the implications of a given U.S.  unemployment rate. In an increasingly globalized world, U.S. companies assess  their employment decisions in a global context. As a result, I believe that the  headline rate which constitutes “full employment” will likely be lower than the  level to which we have historically been accustomed.\nInflation Headline  inflation readings continue to run below the 2 percent long-run objective set  by the FOMC. A stronger dollar and lower oil prices are two key factors that  are negatively impacting the rate of inflation.\nAt  the Dallas Fed, we attempt to look past more transitory factors by focusing on  the Trimmed Mean PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rate, which excludes  those items with the most extreme upward and downward monthly price movements.  Since early 2014, the 12-month change in the trimmed mean ran between 1.6 and  1.7 percent. In January 2016, the 12-month rate ticked up to approximately 1.9  percent. The stability and trend of this measure are important to track as we  consider inflation prospects over the medium term. I  will be closely watching these measures as well as the impact of anticipated  further reductions in labor market slack in assessing the Fed’s progress toward  meeting its 2 percent objective.  I will  also be monitoring the impact of key secular trends discussed later in this  speech.\nWorld Economic  Conditions\nOur  economists at the Dallas Fed have lowered their expectations for growth outside  the U.S. In 2016, we expect global growth, excluding the U.S., to be  approximately 2.7 percent. This includes negative growth in commodity-exposed  countries such as Brazil, Russia and Venezuela as well as 7.4 percent GDP growth  in India. [14] This estimate of the non-U.S. growth rate comes with a high level of downside  risk.\nOne  particular concern is China, which is trying to manage high levels of  industrial overcapacity, high levels of leverage, aging demographics, and decreasing  levels of reserves (which they have used to manage their currency  devaluations). China is also working to manage a longer-term transition from a  manufacturing and export-driven economy to one that is more consumer and  service-sector based.\nThe  International Monetary Fund forecasts that China’s growth rate will slow to  approximately 6.3 percent in 2016 from 6.9 percent in 2015. Whatever the actual  number, it seems clear that the world will have to adjust to lower rates of  Chinese growth in the years ahead. China’s economic challenges have the  potential to create negative spillovers that impact economic conditions in the  U.S. as well as other economies.\nMonetary Policy\nAs  a businessperson, I am regularly reminded that it is important to be open to  learning from and adapting to changing circumstances. It is important to avoid  being rigid, closed minded, or ideological in my thinking. Asking the right  questions is more important than having all the answers. With that preamble,  let me discuss my views regarding monetary policy.\nFrom  January 1 through March 1 this year, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of  stocks declined approximately 3.2 percent. [15] Global  stock markets (excluding the U.S.) declined approximately 6 percent. [16] The  10-year Treasury rate declined from 2.27 percent to 1.82 percent. [17] The price of oil declined from $37.13 per barrel to $34.39. [18] The U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the yen moved from 120.38 yen/dollar to 113.17. [19] In that period, China devalued its currency. Investment-grade and high-yield credit  spreads widened.\nSuffice  it to say that global financial conditions have tightened. This tightening is  likely to have had a restraining impact on the underlying pace of economic  activity akin to some level of increase in the fed funds rate.\nOne  obvious question is the extent to which a decline in the S&P is reflective  of meaningfully weaker economic conditions in the U.S. In assessing this  question, it is worth noting that the S&P is not the same as the U.S.  economy. In particular, S&P 500 firms derive about 38 percent of their revenue [20] and as much as 50 percent [21] of their earnings from outside the U.S., while only about 11 percent of U.S.  GDP is derived from exports. [22] The S&P decline may suggest weaker expectations among market participants  for corporate earnings due to slowing global growth and wider credit spreads as  well as a stronger dollar. It may also reflect some level of normal and healthy  market revaluation.\nOn  the positive side, lower oil prices and a stronger dollar should benefit the  U.S. consumer. Due to a strong consumer, my own expectation is that the U.S.  economy will likely be resilient in 2016. Having said that, I believe that  recent developments call for patience and further diligence in assessing the  impacts of slowing global growth and tighter financial conditions on the U.S.  economy.\nIn  addition, I am also closely monitoring the impact of key secular trends  relating to high levels of debt and aging demographics in the United States and  other major economies, including Europe, Japan and China. These secular factors  could create downward pressure on potential growth rates and, all things being  equal, tend to lower the so-called “neutral” rate, the interest rate at which  the Fed is neither restrictive nor accommodative.\nWhile  I believe that excessive accommodation carries a cost in terms of distortions  and imbalances in hiring, asset allocation and investment decisions, I also  believe that, at this juncture, the Fed needs to show patience in decisions to  remove accommodation. Again, this is particularly true in light of key global  secular trends as well as recent developments relating to slowing global  economic growth and tightening financial conditions.\nI  believe that the Fed should avoid having a predetermined mindset regarding the  path of policy. This path should be driven by our ongoing analyses of cyclical  as well as secular trends.\nI  think it makes sense to emphasize that, at this juncture, monetary policy remains  accommodative; although I would note again that policy is somewhat less  accommodative than it was on January 1 in light of tightening global financial  conditions.\nLastly,  I would emphasize that monetary policy should serve as an element of overall  economic policy. It is not designed to act in isolation or as a substitute for  fiscal policy or structural reforms. There are limits to the potential impacts  of monetary policy.\nThe  broad domestic secular challenges of an aging population, access to education  and health care, underinvestment in infrastructure, high levels of debt to GDP,  and projected stresses on our ability to meet future obligations for retirement  and medical benefits are all examples of issues that may affect the long-run  path of sustainable economic growth. While monetary policy has a critical role  to play in promoting good economic performance and price stability, it has  limitations in being able to address these longer-run issues.\nNow, I would be very  happy to take your questions.\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official   positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nRobert S.

    "text": "Corporate debt as a potential amplifier in a slowdown\nMarch 05, 2019\nAs a central bank policymaker, I closely monitor various types of excesses and imbalances that may be developing in the economy. One of the areas I monitor is the level and growth of indebtedness in the household, government and corporate sectors. In previous essays , I have commented on the positive impacts of the deleveraging of the household sector since the Great Recession, and I have raised a cautionary flag regarding the growth of U.S. government debt, including a substantial increase in the present value of unfunded entitlements.\nThe purpose of this essay is to focus on trends in corporate debt growth and credit quality in the U.S. and discuss potential implications for economic conditions and financial stability.\nBackground on indebtedness in the U.S.\nIn the decade since the Great Recession, there has been an improvement in household balance sheets. In particular, it is estimated that household debt declined from 97 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) at year-end 2008 to approximately 75 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018. [1] This trend has been aided by a strong jobs market and improving wage growth. This household deleveraging is very important because consumer spending is approximately 70 percent of U.S. GDP. [2]\nWhile household balance sheets have improved, the U.S. government has become more highly indebted. Government debt (primarily in the form of Treasury obligations) held by the public as a percentage of GDP has grown from 44 percent at year-end 2008 to approximately 77 percent as of Dec. 31, 2018. [3] In addition, the present value of unfunded entitlements now stands at approximately $54 trillion. [4] This growing level of government debt as a percentage of GDP means, at a minimum, there is less capacity for infrastructure spending and other investments which might help build the productive capability of the U.S. economy. It also means that in the next downturn, there is likely to be less capacity for fiscal stimulus.\nHistorically, the U.S. government has tended to reduce its degree of leverage when the economy is strong—that has not been the case this cycle. At the later stages of a long economic expansion, recent fiscal actions have had the impact of increasing government debt to GDP and have provided meaningful stimulus to near-term growth. It is our view at the Dallas Fed that the current path of government debt to GDP is unlikely to be sustainable—and if we need to find ways to moderate our debt growth in the future, this moderation is likely to create headwinds for GDP growth.\nIn addition to household and government debt, Dallas Fed economists also keep track of the level and growth of corporate debt in the financial sector as well as the nonfinancial sector of the U.S. economy. On the positive side, U.S. financial sector debt has declined substantially from near its historical peak of approximately 124 percent of GDP at the end of 2008 to 78 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018. [5] This decline was accompanied by substantially more stringent postcrisis financial sector regulations and oversight intended to reduce the systemic risk and improve the resiliency of the U.S. financial sector.\nBy contrast, U.S. nonfinancial corporate debt as a percentage of GDP is now higher than the prior peak reached at the end of 2008. As seen in Chart 1, U.S. nonfinancial corporate debt as a percentage of GDP declined substantially in the aftermath of the Great Recession, but then rebounded from a postrecession low of approximately 40 percent in 2010 to 46 percent as of Sept. 30, 2018. [6] , [7]\nDownloadable chart\nThis rebound in the amount of nonfinancial corporate debt is something I am carefully considering in assessing economic conditions and financial stability in the U.S. In particular, it is worth noting that a number of research studies have indicated that relatively higher levels of corporate debt to GDP could potentially amplify the severity of a recession. [8] Several of these papers also suggest that strong growth in corporate debt to GDP is more likely to amplify a downturn when corporate leverage is historically elevated, as it is today. [9]\nTrends in nonfinancial corporate debt\nNonfinancial corporate debt consists primarily of bonds and loans (commercial paper outstanding is less than 5 percent of the total). Nonfinancial corporate bonds outstanding in the U.S. grew from approximately $2.2 trillion in 2008 to approximately $5.7 trillion at year-end 2018 ( Chart 2 ). The bulk of this growth occurred in the investment-grade sector. The amount of outstanding U.S. investment-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds grew from approximately $1.5 trillion in 2008 to $4.5 trillion at year-end 2018. [10]\nWithin the investment-grade sector, there was a notable increase in the amount of BBB bonds (the lowest level of investment-grade debt) outstanding, growing from approximately $0.8 trillion in 2008 to $2.7 trillion by year-end 2018. [11] In addition, the amount of high-yield (less than investment grade) nonfinancial corporate bonds outstanding grew from approximately $0.7 trillion in 2008 to $1.1 trillion by year-end 2018. This substantial growth in BBB and lower-rated bonds is indicative of a weakening in corporate credit quality in the U.S.\nIt is estimated that a substantial portion of the increase in nonfinancial corporate debt was used to fund share buybacks, dividends and merger activity. [12] This trend has been accompanied by more relaxed bond and loan covenants, [13] which have had the effect of reducing protections for investors. Downloadable chart There has also been an increase in syndicated leveraged loans over this period. Leveraged loans are loans made to highly indebted companies and are typically originated by commercial banks and then syndicated to nonbank investors, including special-purpose vehicles such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), private equity funds and other stand-alone entities. The size of the syndicated leveraged loan market, which is primarily made up of nonfinancial corporate borrowers, has increased from $0.6 trillion at the end of 2008 to $1.2 trillion at year-end 2018. [14] Much of this increase has occurred to fund corporate acquisitions and private-equity-backed transactions. [15] In addition to the syndicated leveraged loan market, there is also a direct lending market for leveraged loans in the U.S. This market primarily involves nonbank financial firms—such as asset managers, private equity funds, business development corporations (BDCs), hedge funds, insurance companies and pension funds—lending directly to smaller, mid-market companies. While it is difficult to obtain precise information on the size of this market, Standard and Poor’s (S&P) estimates that the amount of outstanding leveraged loans in the U.S. direct lending market has grown significantly over the past several years and now likely exceeds several hundred billion dollars. [16] CLO structure CLOs are investment vehicles that buy pools of floating-rate leveraged loans from banks. The CLO packages loans into tranches of debt with credit ratings ranging from AAA to BB and with one nonrated tranche of equity, as illustrated in Chart 3. These tranches are securitized and then sold primarily to institutional investors. Downloadable chart The ability of a CLO to turn lower-credit-quality loans into mostly investment-grade-rated bonds via securitization hinges on three key factors: 1) overcollateralization, 2) tranching of securities based on levels of subordination, and 3) portfolio diversification. As loans are paid off, the income flows to the buyers of the CLO securities. In case of a default in one of the underlying loans, the lowest tranche (equity) is the first to experience a loss, whereas the AAA tranche would be the last to experience a loss. Unlike mortgage-backed securities, the CLO structure proved relatively resilient during 2008–09. The U.S. CLO market has grown from roughly $300 billion at the end of 2008 to $615 billion at the end of 2018. [17] However, it is important to recognize that CLO loan-credit quality today is estimated to be somewhat weaker than 10 years ago. S&P estimates that in 2018, CLOs and loan mutual funds purchased approximately 60 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of syndicated leveraged loan volumes. It is estimated that less than 10 percent of new issuance was purchased by banks in the U.S. The remaining volumes were purchased by insurance companies, finance companies and others. [18] Because CLOs are today the largest buyer of these syndicated leveraged loans, disruptions to CLO creation could increase the likelihood that leveraged loans remain on bank balance sheets, which could, in turn, limit the ability of affected banks to extend credit during periods of stress. Implications of rising levels of BBB and less-than-investment-grade corporate debt As a central banker, I am carefully tracking the growth in BBB and less-than-investment-grade debt. In the event of a downturn, highly indebted companies may be more vulnerable to seeing their credit quality deteriorate, which could negatively impact their capital spending and hiring plans. If this deterioration were sufficiently widespread, credit spreads would likely widen in order to compensate lenders/bondholders for greater risk. This type of widening would likely be indicative of an overall tightening in financial conditions that could, in turn, lead to a more significant slowing in the economy. In a downturn, some proportion of BBB bonds may be at risk of being downgraded to less than investment grade. These downgrades, if they happen in sufficient size, could create dislocations for investors who tend to have specific allocations or restrictions based on credit-rating categories. These dislocations could further negatively impact credit spreads and market access for more highly indebted companies. Market liquidity One further issue is whether there is sufficient liquidity in the various corporate debt markets. Ample liquidity is particularly important in the event of market stress or dislocation. While there is debate regarding the evidence of a decline in various measures of corporate bond market liquidity—such as round-trip trading costs, bid–ask spreads or turnover [19] —it is generally agreed that bank-affiliated broker-dealers have been committing less capital to corporate bond trading since the financial crisis. In particular, it is estimated that inventories of corporate debt held by broker-dealers declined from $29.2 billion at the end of 2013 to $14.2 billion at the end of 2018. [20] This decline is notable given that the total corporate bond market increased 36 percent over this period. The decline in inventories held by broker-dealers may be due, at least in part, to postcrisis regulation, such as the Volcker rule (effective April 2014), as well as the growth in electronic trading and other market-related factors. [21] In the event of an economic downturn and some credit-quality deterioration, the reduction in bank broker-dealer inventories and market-making capability could mean that credit spreads might widen more significantly, and potentially in a more volatile manner, than they have historically. This concern may be somewhat heightened in light of the rapid growth in BBB and lower-rated securities issuance over the past 10 years. Conclusion: Continued Vigilance I will continue to closely monitor the level, growth and credit quality of corporate debt. Vigilance is warranted as these issues have the potential to impact corporate investment and spending plans. In the event of an economic downturn, these issues could also contribute to a deterioration in financial conditions which could, in turn, amplify the severity of a growth slowdown in the U.S. economy. I am also sensitive to these corporate debt developments in light of the historically high level of U.S. government debt and the forward estimates for the path of government debt to GDP. An elevated level of corporate debt, along with the high level of U.S. government debt, is likely to mean that the U.S. economy is much more interest rate sensitive than it has been historically.

    "text": "A Discussion of Economic Conditions and Federal Reserve Policy\nNovember 18, 2015 Houston\nThank you, President Khator for that very warm  introduction. Renu Khator is a fantastic president of the University of Houston  and chancellor of the University of Houston System. You may know that she also  chairs the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. This is an  important job, and we appreciate the contributions she makes to the Dallas Fed  and the Federal Reserve System. President Khator, thank you for your service  and for your leadership.\nIt is an honor for me to be here today. Growing up  in Kansas, I frequently traveled throughout Texas with my father, who was a  jewelry salesman. Through these visits, I learned firsthand the challenges of  running a small jewelry store. I learned about the importance of access to  credit in order to carry inventory. I learned about the key role that community  banks play in helping small businesses get started and flourish.\nIn my professional career, I visited Houston regularly  while working as a banker and, later, as a professor. Things here have changed  a lot over all these years—but I have always been impressed by the  entrepreneurial spirit and can-do attitude in this city and in this state. It  is a pleasure for me to be in Houston.\nI have been president of the Dallas Fed for about 2  1/2 months now and have represented the Eleventh District in two Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) meetings—in September and October. People often ask me  if there have been any surprises. The answer is yes—and they have all been  positive. First, I have been enormously impressed with the  quality, rigor and dedication of the Federal Reserve staff who work in the  Eleventh District and throughout the entire Federal Reserve System. They are  truly outstanding. They are focused on the mission of serving the people of  this district and the nation. If you could see what I see every day, you would  be enormously impressed.\nSecond, I have been gratified by the warm welcome  and hospitality of the people of the Eleventh District, which (as you probably  know) includes Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Louisiana. They have  been welcoming and have gone out of their way to help me integrate into the  community and get up to speed so I can effectively do my job. Since I started  this job, I have spent a substantial amount of time meeting with business and  community leaders, as well as a variety of other people in the district, and  talking with Federal Reserve staff to get their advice and perspectives. Through  these interactions, I have learned that an openness and a willingness to  embrace newcomers set Texas apart—I believe these are characteristics that have  helped to make this state so successful.\nSo now, I’m proud to say that, while I wasn’t born  in Texas, I got here as soon as I could!\nAs you may know, I worked in the global markets for  23 years and then taught leadership at Harvard University for 10 years. I lived  in Asia during five of those years (in the early 1990s). Over the course of my  career as an executive, I’ve run several global businesses, seen booms and busts  in the markets, and certainly made my share of mistakes. As a professor, I’ve had  a chance to work with a broad range of leaders across sectors and countries—and  learned a lot about what leadership practices work and about those practices  that usually do not. I bring these lessons and experiences to my new role as president  of the Dallas Fed and a participant in the FOMC.\nWith this as background, I’d like to discuss today  the economic conditions in the Eleventh District, the nation and the world.  Then I’ll discuss the implications of all this for U.S. monetary policy. Of  course, the views I express today are my own and are not necessarily shared by  my Federal Reserve colleagues.\nEleventh  District: Discussion of Energy\nLet me start with a discussion of the energy  industry because of its importance to the Eleventh District and its broader  impact on the national and global economies.\nPercentage-wise, the state’s energy sector is  smaller than it was in the mid-1980s. However, it is still a major driver of  the Texas economy. The industry in Texas accounts for roughly 3 percent of  employment but is responsible for 14 percent of the state’s gross domestic  product (GDP). [1] This industry has transformed itself over the past  two decades, which is a credit to many people in this great city.\nThe Department of Energy currently estimates that  the world production of crude oil exceeds consumption by about 1.6 million  barrels per day. [2] In the 34 member countries of the OECD  (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), excess oil inventories  now stand at record levels.\nIt is our view that it will not be until late 2016  or early 2017 before inventories stabilize and daily production and consumption  reach some reasonable degree of balance. Only after that point should demand be  sufficient to begin working down this high level of inventory. While several factors will influence this balancing  process, certainly supply will need to be further reduced among higher-cost  producers. Much of this reduction is already occurring in the United States—particularly  among companies that produce oil from shale formations. We have already seen  dramatic rig count declines as producers change their oil-price outlook to  “lower for longer” and cut back on the amount of capital allocated to drilling.\nSeveral additional factors will likely affect the  balance between global production and consumption of crude oil. These include  the level of demand in China as well as consumer demand in the U.S., and  additional production coming online in Iran and Libya. Of course, geopolitical  developments in the Middle East could impact production levels as well.\nAs market participants work to get a grip on the  speed of this balancing process, we expect to see significant price swings and  volatility. We also expect to see more bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings  in the energy industry. Unfortunately, much of this pain will be felt in the  U.S. because we have a large concentration of high-cost production coming from  shale. Houston is certainly feeling some of these negative repercussions.\nOn the bright side, lower energy prices help U.S.  consumers. However, the reduction in drilling continues to negatively impact  growth and employment in the Eleventh District.\nDiscussion  of Economic Conditions in the District\nThe energy situation and a stronger dollar have  created headwinds in the district. Despite this, the Texas economy is expanding—Texas  employment growth, which has typically been faster than that of the nation, has  slipped to 1.3 percent year to date through September, compared with 1.7  percent for the U.S. as a whole. We expect Texas job growth to finish this year  at 1.2 percent, much lower than the 3.6 percent growth the state experienced in  2014.\nThe Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys  (TBOS) and employment data point to continued weakness in the state’s  manufacturing sector but solid growth in the service sector. The service sector  has kept the Texas economy out of recession this year—with particular strength  in the health care and leisure-and-hospitality industries.\nEven with tepid job growth, the unemployment rate in  Texas has held steady this year at approximately 4.2 percent—well below the  national rate of 5.0 percent (it’s 4.4 percent in Houston, 3.7 percent in  Dallas, 3.6 percent in San Antonio, and 3.2 percent in Austin). The statewide  rate of 4.2 percent matches the 2007 prerecession cyclical low. This resilience  is due to the state’s diversified economy as well as continued significant  expansion of the petrochemical industry along the Gulf Coast—spurred by low prices  for natural gas (the primary feedstock).\nWe continue to see labor shortages in Texas in  construction, machinery and food manufacturing, nursing, truck driving, retail  and restaurants. Texas home prices are rising at a rapid pace—up 6.1 percent  year over year in September. [3] Home inventories remain tight at 2 to  4 months in most of the state’s major markets.\nIt’s worth emphasizing that the migration of people  and firms has been a key underpinning of the Texas economy. Over the past  several years, many foreign and domestic companies have moved their operations  to the state—and many others are considering moving to Texas. Since 2000, the average  rate of population growth has been almost a full 1 percentage point higher in  Texas than in the U.S. as a whole. I would expect this trend to continue over  the next several years.\nWhile facing challenges, the Texas economy is proving  to be highly resilient, and I’m very optimistic about the state’s future.\nNational  Economy\nGDP U.S. GDP growth slowed to approximately 2 percent in  the third quarter versus 2.3 percent over the first half of this year. [4] The Commerce Department reported a slowing of inventory accumulation during the  quarter. This deceleration in inventory investment was enough to subtract roughly  0.9 percentage points of growth from the U.S. economy. In the face of  uncertainty about foreign demand, along with a strengthening U.S. dollar, it  appears that U.S. firms decided to cut back their stock building in the quarter  in order to avoid excessive inventory accumulation. However, in this same quarter, the Commerce  Department estimates that real final demand in the U.S. increased at a 2.9  percent annual rate—slightly better than the 2.7 percent rate recorded over the  first half of the year. Most of the growth can be attributed to an increase in  domestic consumer demand as well as to some gains in business fixed investment,  residential investment and government purchases.\nThe U.S. economy maintained its forward momentum in  the third quarter, largely because of strength in the service-providing sector,  which represents about 80 percent of the U.S. economy. At this point, our economic team at the Dallas Fed  forecasts that U.S. GDP growth will average between 2 and 2.5 percent through  the end of 2016. While this is sluggish growth compared with past expansions,  given demographic trends, we believe it should be sufficient to continue to  drive down the unemployment rate. Unemployment As I mentioned earlier, the U.S. unemployment rate  has fallen to 5.0 percent—a rate that is near most estimates of full  employment. In 2015, the U.S. has added on average 206,000  nonfarm jobs per month. In addition, the pace of employment growth accelerated  in October to 271,000 jobs after decelerating in August and September. This  monthly rate of job growth has been strong enough to drive down the headline  unemployment rate by 0.6 percentage points since the start of the year.\nAt the Dallas Fed, we estimate that the breakeven  number of new jobs necessary to keep the unemployment rate steady likely ranges  between 100,000 and 150,000 per month—depending on assumptions regarding the  labor force participation rate as well as estimates of the relationship between  the number of jobs in the economy and the number of people who actually hold  jobs (these measures are not identical because some people work multiple jobs). At this point, the question is: How much “slack”  remains in the economy with the unemployment rate this low? My own view is that  excess capacity needs to be increasingly viewed in a global context—particularly  in assessing the level of unemployment that is consistent with price stability.  This is a critical point that has emerged as the global economy has become  increasingly interconnected. It means that overcapacity in non-U.S. economies  must be considered along with domestic labor slack in assessing the implications  of a given U.S. unemployment rate.\nIn order to assess the  level of domestic labor market slack, we closely monitor various measures  beyond the headline unemployment rate. In particular, we closely track the  transition of workers from part time to full time as well as the number of  would-be workers who are “discouraged” and have given up looking for a job.\nFor much of the current  recovery, these broader utilization measures suggested that there was more  labor slack than was implied by the headline unemployment rate. However,  particularly in the past two months, an increasing number of part-time workers  have converted to full-time status—which suggests that we are making more  progress toward reaching our full-employment objective.\nInflation Inflation continues to run below the Fed’s 2 percent  target. The headline year-over-year PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation  reading for September was only 0.16 percent. [5] This is a lower level  of inflation than we are accustomed to. Much of this recent weakness is due to  the near-term effects of lower energy and other commodity prices, with downward  pressure also coming from slowing economic growth and overcapacity outside the  U.S. and the impact of a stronger dollar on import prices.\nOur economists particularly focus on the Dallas Fed’s  Trimmed Mean PCE inflation reading, which strips out the most extreme monthly  upside and downside price movements. We believe that the trimmed mean is a more  useful guide to assessing the medium-term trend in headline inflation than is  the conventional, ex-food-and-energy core inflation reading.\nThis Trimmed Mean PCE inflation measure has been  running at approximately 1.7 percent year over year through September, and at a  somewhat faster rate on a six-month basis. [6] The stability of this Trimmed  Mean PCE inflation measure, in the face of commodity price declines and falling  import prices, gives us confidence that these influences will ultimately run  their course. This confidence, in combination with anticipated further reductions  in labor market slack, leads our Dallas Fed economists to forecast 1.8 percent  inflation in 2016 and 2 percent inflation by year-end 2017.\nThis is an analysis (and a judgment) that we’ll be  scrutinizing and revisiting over the coming weeks and months.\nInternational  Economy\nAssessments of economic conditions outside the  United States are critical because the world is becoming more and more  interconnected. What happens in China, emerging markets and advanced economies  around the world increasingly impacts the U.S economy. Our staff at the Dallas Fed estimates that second-quarter  global GDP growth (excluding the U.S.) was the slowest since the second quarter  of 2013. Advanced as well as emerging-market economies experienced slower  yearly growth rates in the second quarter. The International Monetary Fund (IMF),  in its latest World Economic Outlook, forecasts that this trend will likely  continue for the remainder of this year and through the end of 2016. Russia,  Brazil and Venezuela are in outright recession. Advanced countries are  experiencing only modest growth—with a forecast of 1.4 percent GDP growth for  2015. [7] While economies such as China and India still exhibit  relatively strong real output growth, their growth forecasts are being revised  downward due to various headwinds.\nFactors contributing to this uneven performance  include overcapacity in various economies, higher levels of debt, falling  commodity prices and exchange rate developments. Let’s focus more specifically on China. While the  Chinese economy grew 6.9 percent year over year in the third quarter, according  to official estimates, growth is clearly slowing. This slowing has been  manifested in dramatic price swings in the Chinese stock market and in government  actions to address key longer-term challenges.\nUnderstanding China’s slowdown is important because  China is still the largest individual contributor to global growth. [8] The effects of a slowdown in China will be felt in the United States as well as  other countries. The IMF forecasts that 2016 Chinese GDP growth will slow to  6.3 percent.\nAt the Dallas Fed, we estimate that a 1 percentage-point  decline in the Chinese GDP growth rate slows the U.S. GDP growth rate by about  0.2 percentage points due to direct and indirect third-country effects.\nIt is my own view that the primary economic  challenges faced by China—manufacturing overcapacity, an aging population,  higher levels of debt to GDP, and a structural transition to a more  service-based economy—are all secular. That is, they are likely to play out  over many years (versus months). As a result, the world will likely have to  adjust to lower expected rates of Chinese growth.\nImplications  for Monetary Policy\nGiven these factors and the situation I have laid  out, let me turn to a discussion of U.S. monetary policy and the decisions  facing the FOMC. The Fed has a dual mandate given to it by Congress—fostering  full employment and price stability. Further, the Fed has set 2 percent as its  longer-run target rate for inflation. At this stage, it appears that we are well on our  way to meeting our full-employment objective, although there is still some  question as to the rate of unemployment that constitutes full employment in a  more global world. As I mentioned earlier, a critical question I am focusing on  is: What is the unemployment rate at which we have depleted excess capacity in  the labor force? This rate may be lower than we would have previously thought.\nInflation continues to run below our 2 percent  long-run target. However, as the labor market tightens and certain transitory  factors ultimately pass through the data, our economic team in Dallas still  expects to see inflation gradually rising to 2 percent over the medium term. Our economic team is continuing to consider how  overcapacity, demographic trends, high degrees of leverage in some sectors and  other secular issues in countries outside the U.S. (particularly China) might  adversely affect GDP, unemployment and inflation within the U.S. In light of all these factors, it will likely be  appropriate that U.S. monetary policy remain accommodative for some time.  Moreover, a lower-than-usual federal funds rate may well be needed to achieve  any given desired level of accommodation. Accordingly, it is probable that the  return to “normal” interest rates will be gradual. As a business manager or as an  investor, I think these are key messages I would be taking from our FOMC  statements. However, accommodative policy does not necessarily  mean a zero fed funds rate. There are various costs to maintaining a zero fed  funds rate for too long—particularly in terms of potential distortions in  investment and business decisions. These distortions can create imbalances in  investments, inventory and hiring decisions that may later need to be  (painfully) unwound when policy normalizes. My experience is that these  imbalances are sometimes tough to see in real time but often relatively easier  to recognize in hindsight. In thinking about these potential imbalances, we’re  sensitive to the fact that monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. These are all issues that will have to be assessed  and reassessed as the economic outlook unfolds. In my view, the FOMC—in the  previous two meetings—has been prudent in waiting for more data before taking  policy action.\nThank you for the opportunity to speak today. I look  forward to getting to know you better in the months and years ahead. Now, I’d  be happy to take your questions.\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official   positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nRobert S.

    "text": "An assessment of economic conditions and the stance of monetary policy\nFebruary 18, 2020\nIn our most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  meeting, the Federal Reserve decided to leave the federal funds rate unchanged  in a range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent. In addition, we made a 5-basis-point upward  adjustment to the interest paid on excess reserves (IOER) held by banks on  deposit at the Fed. This was a technical adjustment intended to support the  setting of the federal funds rate well within the range set by the FOMC.\nI supported these decisions as well as the post-meeting  communication regarding the path of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. The Fed  balance sheet expanded rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2019 as repurchase  agreement (repo) operations and Treasury bills purchases were needed to  maintain reserve levels.\nIt is my hope and expectation that, as reserves in the  banking system meet or exceed ample levels of at least $1.5 trillion, the Fed  balance sheet will expand only gradually to reflect trend growth in the demand  for currency and other Federal Reserve liabilities. I would expect that, over  the first half of 2020, the pace of balance sheet expansion will moderate  significantly as active repo operations gradually decline and reserve  management purchases of Treasury bills slow in the second quarter.\nI continue to support a review of our supervisory guidance and  regulatory policies in an effort to assess whether we could put Treasury bills  and reserves on a more equal footing in terms of bank liquidity management. I  also remain open to consideration of other alternatives which could help the  Fed run an ample reserves regime with a sensitivity to limiting growth in the size  of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.\nEconomic outlook\nIt is the base-case view of Dallas Fed economists that U.S. gross  domestic product (GDP) will grow at a rate of approximately 2 to 2.25 percent  in 2020. This forecast is based on our expectation that global growth is likely  to remain sluggish but will show signs of stabilization due to some calming of  trade uncertainties—particularly  as a result of the ratification of the United States–Mexico–Canada  Agreement, the Phase One agreement with China, and some greater clarity  regarding Brexit. In this regard, we also expect U.S. manufacturing to remain  sluggish but show some signs of stabilization. Lastly, we expect business fixed  investment to firm somewhat from disappointing levels in 2019. These  developments, combined with a strong U.S. consumer (which accounts for approximately  70 percent of U.S. GDP), should lead to solid growth in 2020.\nOf course, this outlook is clouded by the impact of the  coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China. This development will likely mean  slower growth in China and risks to the downside for global growth. Dallas Fed  economists are considering various alternative scenarios for how this virus  could impact U.S. and global GDP growth. However, at this stage, it is still too  soon to predict with confidence the ultimate impact of this virus on the U.S.  and global economies. Our Dallas Fed team will continue to actively monitor  this situation and assess its ongoing implications.\nIn addition, I am cognizant that the delay in production of the  Boeing 737 Max airplane is likely to reduce U.S. GDP growth by as much as 0.4  percent (annualized) in the first quarter of 2020. The extent of the full-year  effect will ultimately be determined by the timing of a return to production,  likely later in the year. Finally, the first half of 2020 will benefit from the  return of post-strike production at General Motors.\nAgainst this backdrop, the U.S. consumer continues to be the  key underpinning of the U.S. economy. Household debt to GDP has gone from a  peak of 98 percent in 2008 to approximately 74 percent as of third quarter 2019. [1] In addition to this improvement in household balance sheets, the current rate  of unemployment in the U.S. is approximately 3.6 percent. [2] Furthermore, the U-6 measure of unemployment—which  takes into account the unemployed, plus discouraged workers who have given up  looking for work, plus workers who work part time but would prefer to work full  time—is currently running  at approximately 6.9 percent. [3] This reading is near its historic low of 6.7 percent reached in December 2019.  The labor force participation rate (the percentage of 16 year olds and above  either employed or actively looking for work) now stands at 63.4 percent, its highest  level since June 2013. [4] All this suggests to Dallas Fed economists that the U.S. economy is likely at  or past the level of full employment. This further bolsters our near-term  confidence in the strength of the U.S. consumer.\nBased on our forecast, we would expect headline unemployment  to drift down from the current reading of 3.6 percent to approximately 3.5  percent during 2020. In addition, Dallas Fed economists believe that the personal  consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation rate will gradually move toward the  Fed’s 2 percent target in the medium term. This confidence is bolstered by the  fact that the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE measure of inflation, which exes  out inflation components with extreme moves to the upside or the downside, is  currently running at approximately 2 percent on a 12-month basis. [5] Our research indicates that the trimmed mean is a good indicator of future headline  PCE inflation trends.\nPotential GDP growth\nExpected 2020 growth of 2 to 2.25 percent is in  line with the average growth rate of the U.S. economy since 2010. [6] However, this level of growth is sluggish by historical standards. GDP growth  is made up of growth in the workforce plus growth in productivity. As I’ve  discussed in previous essays, aging demographics and sluggish workforce growth  ( Chart 1 ) and more modest  productivity growth ( Chart 2 ) are  negatively impacting potential GDP growth in the U.S.\nDownloadable chart\nDownloadable chart\nThe rate of U.S. workforce growth has declined from a yearly  average of approximately 2.71 percent in the 1970s to 1.27 percent in the 1990s  to an expected 0.24 percent in the 2020s. [7] This deceleration in workforce growth is not being offset by improvements in  productivity per worker. The rate of U.S. productivity growth has declined from  a yearly average of almost 2 percent in the 1990s to 0.85 percent since 2010. [8]\nIt’s the view of Dallas Fed economists that structural  reforms are needed if we are to improve U.S. workforce growth. These reforms  could include policies that facilitate child care and transportation services,  which make it easier for marginally attached workers to enter and stay in the  workforce. In addition, immigration reform that focuses on skills and employer  needs could also help increase the rate of U.S. workforce growth.\nProductivity growth could be enhanced by policies that help  workers impacted by technology and technology-enabled disruption to get  reskilled. Dallas Fed economists believe that the emphasis on skills training  programs could be dramatically increased in the U.S. In addition, policies that  focus on improving early-childhood literacy and the overall math, science and  reading skills of our next generation of workers would help improve their  adaptability and productivity. Lastly, investments in selected infrastructure  improvements could help create greater efficiencies in the U.S. economy.\nWe would also note that, in this context, global trade is  likely an opportunity for the U.S. to grow faster. In particular, integrated logistics  and supply-chain arrangements, especially those with Mexico and, to a lesser  extent, Canada have been critical to improving the global competiveness of U.S.  firms, which has allowed these firms to add jobs and domicile their businesses  in the U.S.\nFinding ways to improve the potential growth rate of the  U.S. economy is critical given that the amount of U.S. government debt held by  the public is now approximately 79 percent of GDP [9] and the present value of unfunded entitlements is now approximately $59  trillion. [10]\nWhile monetary policy has a key role to play in enhancing the ability of  the U.S. economy to grow at its potential, it is not a substitute for  structural reforms and policies that can improve the level of potential growth  in the U.S. As a central banker, I believe it is important to point out the  limits of monetary policy and the need for broader policies to improve the  economic future of the U.S. (See the essay “Economic Conditions and the Key  Structural Drivers Impacting the Economic Outlook,” Oct. 10, 2019, which  discusses these structural challenges and opportunities).\nEnergy\nOil industry outlook\nThe Eleventh District of the Federal Reserve is  home to the Permian Basin, which accounts for approximately 36 percent of U.S. crude  oil production. [11] , [12] Due to the emergence of the U.S. shale industry, the U.S. now produces  approximately 12.9 million barrels per day (mb/d) of crude oil. [13] This compares with crude oil production of approximately 11.3 mb/d by Russia  and 9.7 mb/d by Saudi Arabia. [14]\nIt is the view of Dallas Fed economists that global oil production  (crude oil and liquids) will increase by 0.7 mb/d to approximately 102.3 mb/d from  fourth quarter 2019 to fourth quarter 2020. [15] This production forecast assumes growth of 0.7 mb/d in the U.S. and 0.7 mb/d in  other non-OPEC countries, and a decline of 0.7 mb/d in OPEC oil production.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that global  consumption will likely grow by approximately 1.0 mb/d to 102.2 mb/d in 2020. [16] The coronavirus presents a meaningful risk to demand growth globally as overall  Chinese oil consumption represented approximately 14 percent of total global  consumption and approximately 57 percent of global consumption growth in 2019. [17] The IEA consumption forecast indicates that, due to the impact of the virus,  first quarter 2020 global oil demand will decline by approximately 0.4 mb/d  versus the first quarter of 2019. It further assumes that a substantial portion  of this consumption decline will reverse in subsequent quarters of 2020. It is  worth noting that the expected first-quarter consumption decline would be the  first year-over-year drop in quarterly oil demand since the Great Recession of  2007–09.\nIn this context, Dallas Fed economists expect U.S. crude oil  production growth of approximately 0.4 mb/d in 2020. [18] This compares with production growth of 2.0 mb/d in 2018 and 0.9 mb/d in 2019. [19] These forecasts assume West Texas Intermediate oil prices stay in the range of  approximately $50 to $60 per barrel.\nThis expected decline in U.S. production growth is influenced  by weaker global demand growth and is also heavily influenced by a dramatic increase  in pressure from capital providers to see “discipline” in capital allocation  from energy and production firms. In practice, this means that capital  expenditures for drilling activity will have to be funded by internal cash flow  versus debt issuance. This is a fairly significant change from historic  practice. It should be noted that shale projects are more “short-cycle”  investments than typical conventional projects—they can be drilled and brought  onstream very quickly and, on average, for approximately $6 million to $8  million per well. However, as output of wells tends to decline rapidly in the  first few years of production, producers must continuously invest in order to  maintain overall production levels.\nAs a result of these developments, our Dallas Fed oil industry contacts  have indicated to us that they expect capital spending in the U.S. oil and gas  sector could be down by as much as 10 to 15 percent in 2020. This reduction in  capital spending is likely to have a substantial impact on energy service  companies. Several companies have already announced restructurings, charge-offs  and layoffs. In light of this, we would expect that 2020 will be a year of  restructurings, consolidation where possible, and general belt tightening.\nImplications for Texas and the U.S. Economy\nDespite a more challenging environment for oil and gas production,  Dallas Fed economists still expect 2020 job growth in Texas to be approximately  2.1 percent. [20] While the state’s economy  has grown substantially and become much more diversified over the past several  decades, the energy sector still represents approximately 9 percent of Texas  GDP [21] and remains a key economic driver in a number of important regions of the  state.\nIn the U.S. more broadly, lower oil prices should benefit  U.S. consumers by freeing up more of their disposable income for the consumption  of non-oil goods and services. However, because the U.S. is no longer a net  importer of oil and petroleum products, the benefit to U.S. GDP of lower oil  prices for consumers may be increasingly offset by the negative impact on  domestic energy producers in terms of capital spending and employee  compensation. Changes in oil prices will increasingly redistribute income  between sectors and states within the U.S., as opposed to impacting the  transfer of income between the U.S. and other oil-exporting nations.\nAs a result of these developments, over the past several years, the U.S.  has become somewhat less sensitive than in the past to oil price fluctuations. Additionally,  since the 1970s, the U.S. economy has become less oil-intensive due to substitution  for oil by other forms of energy, improved fuel efficiency, and growth in the  less-energy-intensive services sector as a share of the overall economy.\nGrowth in Renewables\nDallas Fed energy economists expect that global energy  consumption will increasingly reflect reduced reliance on fossil fuels (oil,  natural gas and coal) as a share of total consumption. This reduced reliance is  primarily due to expected growth in renewable energy. Renewable energy sources  include hydropower, solar power, wind power (offshore and onshore), geothermal  and modern bioenergy production (including energy content in solid, liquid and  gaseous products derived from biomass feedstocks and biogas). While estimates  of the increase in renewable energy production vary, there is clear evidence  that a transition is underway in the energy industry.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) base-case forecast  suggests that renewables are likely to substantially increase as a percentage  of global energy consumption over the next 20 years. [22] Their forecast indicates that, under stated policies, renewables will grow approximately  125 percent over the period, outpacing global oil and natural gas consumption  growth of approximately 21 percent. [23] However, the IEA notes that if global regulators take a much more aggressive  stance to achieve the energy-related goals of the United Nations Sustainable  Development agenda, [24] it estimates that renewables  could grow by over 200 percent and global oil and natural gas consumption could  decline by as much as 20 percent by 2040. [25] In that case, renewables would account for nearly 33 percent of global energy consumption. [26]\nOur Eleventh District industry contacts report to us that they believe  investments in sustainability and innovative approaches to mitigate the impacts  of climate change are likely to provide substantial growth opportunities for  U.S. businesses. We are already seeing a number of these investments in Texas.\nThe stance of monetary policy\nIt is my view that, based on my base-case outlook for the  U.S. economy, the current setting of the federal funds rate at 1.5 to 1.75  percent is roughly appropriate. Consistent with this view, my Summary of  Economic Projections (SEP) submission in December 2019 indicated that I  expected no movement in the federal funds rate through 2020.\nOf course, my views are subject to revision based on how the outlook for  the U.S. economy evolves over the course of this year. In that regard, I will  be closely monitoring a variety of economic developments and, in particular,  continuing to assess how the coronavirus ultimately will impact the U.S. and  global economies.\nRobert S.

Kaplan\nIn the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Federal Reserve cut the\nfederal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. I supported this rate cut as\nwell as the previous rate cut in July.\nIn addition, since mid-September, the New York Fed has announced a series of overnight and term\nrepurchase agreement (repo) operations intended to provide additional liquidity to the overnight\nand term lending markets in order to maintain the federal funds rate within the target range. In the\npost-FOMC meeting press conference, Chairman Powell suggested that the Fed will consider\nadditional actions in order to provide sufficient reserves consistent with our decision to implement\npolicy in an ample-reserves regime. I do not plan to comment extensively on additional options,\nas we continue to debate and discuss them, other than to emphasize that I support more-permanent\nsteps to ensure the proper functioning of repo and other short-term funding markets. I am also\nsupportive of taking steps to adjust the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in order to help\nachieve our objective of implementing policy in an ample-reserves regime.\nIn this essay, I will briefly review economic conditions in the U.S. I will then step back and discuss\nseveral key structural drivers that I believe are critical to the prospects for economic growth in the\nU.S. Finally, I will outline my current thinking regarding the stance of U.S. monetary policy.\nEconomic Outlook for the U.S.\nDallas Fed economists forecast growth for 2019 of approximately 2.1 percent. This forecast is\nbased on estimated first-half growth of approximately 2.5 percent and an expectation for second-\nhalf growth of approximately 1.7 percent. This compares with a 2.5 percent rate of growth achieved\nin 2018.1\nDallas Fed economists had predicted some of the recent slowing due to the expected waning of the\nimpact of fiscal stimulus. However, some of the slowing is also due to heightened trade tensions,\nwhich have contributed, at least in part, to decelerating rates of global growth as well as weakness\nin manufacturing and business direct investment in the U.S. Despite these headwinds, U.S. growth\nhas been resilient primarily due to the strength of consumer spending, which accounts for\napproximately 70 percent of the U.S. economy. The consumer is bolstered, in particular, by a\nstrong jobs market as well as improvements in the level of household debt to gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) which have occurred since 2008.2\nOn October 4, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported September jobs growth of 136,000. The\ncurrent rate of unemployment is now approximately 3.5 percent.3 This is the lowest level of U.S.\nunemployment in the past 50 years. To further gauge labor market slack, Dallas Fed economists\nalso look at the U-6 measure of unemployment, which includes people who are unemployed, plus\n2\n\ndiscouraged workers, plus workers who are working part time but would prefer to work full time.\nThis measure now stands at approximately 6.9 percent,4 below its prerecession low of 7.9 percent\n(reached in December 2006) and only slightly above its historical low of 6.8 percent (reached in\nOctober 2000).5 These measures, as well as our Eleventh District surveys of employers and\ndiscussions with contacts, indicate that the U.S. economy is at or past the level of full employment.\nMany of our contacts report particular difficulty in hiring and retaining lower-skilled workers (who\nearn wages in a range of 12 to 15 dollars per hour), as well as finding and retaining more skilled\nworkers, who typically require some level of advanced specialized training.\nRegarding inflation, the headline measure of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation\nis currently running at 1.4 percent on a 12-month basis.6 At the Dallas Fed, we prefer to focus on\nthe Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE measure of inflation, which removes the most extreme moves\nup and down in PCE components. This measure is currently running at approximately 2 percent\non a 12-month basis.7 Dallas Fed research suggests that the trimmed mean measure of inflation is\na good indicator of future inflation trends. On that basis, it is our expectation that the headline PCE\ninflation rate will reach the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target over the medium term.\nKey Structural Drivers Impacting the Economic Outlook\nI am often asked: Why is growth today so much slower than it was in the 1980s and the 1990s?\nWhy are market-determined interest rates so much lower? Why is the federal funds rate today so\nmuch lower than in these previous periods?\nA big part of the answer to these questions lies in the fact that there have been substantial secular\nchanges in the U.S. economy. At the Dallas Fed, we refer to these as “structural drivers.” These\nstructural drivers include:\n1. Demographic Trends\n2. Technology, Technology-Enabled Disruption, and Education/Skills Training\n3. Globalization and Trade\n4. The Path of U.S. Government Debt to GDP\nOf course, there are other major trends. One of the most significant is climate change and its\nimplications for the increased frequency and intensity of severe weather events, such as hurricanes,\ndroughts, floods, and other disruptive impacts (see the essay “A Brief Discussion Regarding the\nImpact of Climate Change on Economic Conditions in the Eleventh District,” June 27, 2019). At\nthe Dallas Fed, we will continue to do research and analyze the various impacts of climate change\non the Eleventh District, as well as the U.S. and the world.\nThe following is a discussion of four primary structural drivers. Over the past several years, our\nDallas Fed economists have spent a substantial amount of time discussing these key structural\ndrivers and trying to understand their implications for economic outcomes and economic policy\ndecisions in the U.S.\n3\n\n1. Demographic Trends\nThe U.S. population is aging. The median age of the population has risen from approximately 35.3\nyears in 2000 to 38.2 in 2018.8 The share of population 65 years or older has risen from 12.4\npercent in 2000 to 16.0 in 2018.9 As baby boomers increasingly leave the workforce, U.S. labor\nforce growth is slowing. Slower labor force growth is critically important because GDP growth is\nmade up of growth in the workforce plus growth in labor productivity. Unless slower workforce\ngrowth is offset by improved productivity growth, U.S. GDP growth will slow. Chart 1 shows the\nongoing trends of population aging and declines in population and labor force growth rates in the\nU.S.\nChart 1\nLabor Force and Working-Age Population Growth Rates Declining over Time\nPercent change,annualized\n3.0\n2.71 Labor force, 20-64 years old\nPopulation, 20-64 years old\n2.5\n2.05\n1.95\n2.0\n1.5 1.37\n1.27\n1.16\n1.11\n1.0 0.84\n0.45e\n0.5 0.39e\n0.24e\n0.21e\n0.0\n1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s 2020s\nNOTE: “e” denotes an estimated value(2018–2028 growth rates from Employment Projectionsprogram; 2020sestimates only through 2028).\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nAnother way to look at labor force growth is to look at the labor force participation rate. This rate\nis the percentage of the population age 16 and older that either has a job or is actively looking for\nwork. This rate has decreased from approximately 66 percent in 2007 to 63.2 percent today.10\nDallas Fed economists believe that the bulk of this decline is due to the aging of the population.\nWe expect this measure to decline further to 61 percent over the next 10 years as the population\ncontinues to age and the rate of workforce growth continues to decelerate.11 As discussed earlier,\nthese trends create a significant headwind for GDP growth.\nLabor force growth has been a key aspect of sustained U.S. growth over the past several decades.\nIncreasing female labor force participation boosted growth from the 1950s to the 1990s. Since the\n1990s, U.S. labor force growth has been helped by older workers staying in the workforce longer.\nThroughout our history, immigration of workers has also been a key aspect of U.S. labor force\ngrowth.\n4\n\nThe Dallas Fed does a substantial amount of research on immigration trends. Pia Orrenius, senior\neconomist at the Dallas Fed, has pointed out that more than 50 percent of workforce growth over\nthe past 20 years has come from immigrants and their children.12 Her research indicates that\nimmigrants tend to take jobs at both the low end and the high end of the workforce and do not\nappear to have negatively impacted wages of indigenous workers overall. Her research also\nindicates that, from a policy point of view, the U.S. might be well-served to restructure its\nimmigration policies to be more employer- and skills-based. Her work suggests that if the U.S. is\nto improve workforce growth in the years ahead, immigration is likely to be a key element of this\neffort.\nIn summary, slowing workforce growth is likely to be a continuing headwind for U.S. economic\ngrowth. Finding ways to grow the workforce will be critical to improving GDP growth prospects\nfor the U.S.\n2. Technology, Technology-Enabled Disruption, and Education/Skills Training (See Appendix)\nWhile the U.S. has experienced rapid improvements in technology and substantial development of\ntechnology-enabled disruption in a variety of industries, measures of labor force productivity\ngrowth have been surprisingly sluggish. As explained earlier, GDP growth is made up of growth\nin the workforce and growth in productivity. If workforce growth is slowing due to aging of the\npopulation, it is critical that we find ways to improve productivity growth.\nOutput per worker grew on average approximately 1.9 percent per year in the 1990s, slowed to 1.4\npercent in the 2000s and has slowed further to 1.1 percent since 2010.13 Our hypothesis at the\nDallas Fed is that intensifying technology and technology-enabled disruption is improving the\nproductivity of a substantial number of U.S. companies and industries. Productivity improvement\nis measured not by industry, but by improvement in average output per worker in the overall\neconomy. Part of the issue is that technological innovation may impact output per worker with a\nlag, and some believe that we may see improvements in these output statistics in the future, after\na period of adoption and adaptation. However, Dallas Fed economists also believe that a key reason\nthat we don’t see better workforce productivity data is that technological innovations are likely\nbeing experienced differently by workers based on their educational attainment and/or skill levels.\nIn particular, if you are one of the 46 million workers in this country with a high school education\nor less, and/or have a routine type of middle-skills job, you are likely finding your job is being\neither restructured or eliminated as a result of technology. Many of those workers with less\neducation may be finding that their real wages and productivity are declining in a new age in which\nskills training and educational achievement levels are increasingly critical to adapting to the jobs\nmarket.\nThe increase in technology and technology-enabled disruption is also putting a spotlight on the\nadaptive capabilities of the workforce. In particular, better educational achievement and improved\nskill levels are critical to improving workforce adaptability. Various research studies have\nhighlighted that the educational achievement and skill levels of the U.S. workforce have lagged\nthose of other developed countries. In surveys of 29 participating Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development countries, the U.S. ranked 20th in assessments of adult literacy and\n5\n\nmath skills.14 It also ranked 24th out of 35 developed countries in measures of math, science and\nreading skills among 15-year-olds.15\nResearch by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University with Ludger Woessmann of the University of\nMunich suggests that improvements in math and science skills could translate into meaningful\nimprovements in potential U.S. GDP growth.16\nDallas Fed economists believe that in order to address the powerful structural driver of technology\nand technology-enabled disruption, the U.S. must do more to improve early-childhood literacy,\ncollege readiness, and skills training at our high schools and community colleges. These efforts\nshould be a powerful investment in improving the quality and productivity of our human capital\nwhich, in a technological age, are essential to higher levels of GDP growth in the U.S.\n3. Globalization and Trade\nThe U.S. has less than 5 percent of the world’s population.17 It is estimated that the Standard and\nPoor’s 500 companies in the U.S. now generate in excess of 40 percent of their revenues from\noutside the U.S.18 In addition, in order to be globally competitive, many of our companies have\ndeveloped highly sophisticated cross-border supply-chain and logistics arrangements with Mexico\nand Canada. Dallas Fed economists believe these arrangements have helped these companies\nimprove their global competitiveness.\nDallas Fed economists have suggested that U.S. trade analysis should segment our trading\nrelationships into those which are primarily final goods versus those which are largely intermediate\ngoods. For example, the trading relationship with Mexico is predominantly intermediate goods.\nThis helps explain why approximately 40 percent of the value of U.S. imports19 from Mexico\nconsists of value added from the U.S., which is indicative of integrated supply-chain and logistics\nrelationships that have allowed U.S. companies to add jobs and increase their global\ncompetitiveness.20 On the other hand, the trading relationship with China is primarily a final-goods\nrelationship (approximately 4 percent of the value of U.S. imports from China contains value\nadded from the U.S.).21 In addition, as has been much discussed, the trade relationship with China\nis fraught with issues related to technology transfer and intellectual property rights.\nWhile trade is important to the U.S., it is vital to many countries outside the U.S. Exports currently\naccount for approximately 12 percent of U.S. GDP.22 However, exports account for approximately\n47 percent of German GDP,23 20 percent of euro-area GDP24 and 27 percent of emerging-market\nGDP.25 As a result, it is not surprising that escalating trade tensions disproportionately impact non-\nU.S. economic growth. It is also not surprising that as trade uncertainty has risen, particularly with\nMexico and Canada, it has had some dampening impact on U.S. manufacturing and investments\nrelating to global supply-chain arrangements.\nIf your job is being disrupted or eliminated in the U.S., the recent public narrative has suggested\nthat it is probably due to globalization—either trade or immigration. Dallas Fed economists believe\nthat this disruption is more likely due to technology and/or technology-enabled disruption. Our\neconomists point out that if policymakers get this diagnosis wrong, we are likely to make policy\ndecisions which impede globalization—and the net effect is likely to be slower growth in the U.S.\n6\n\nThis misdiagnosis would not be so consequential if we weren’t so highly leveraged at the federal\ngovernment level.\n4. The Path of U.S. Government Debt to GDP\nU.S. government debt held by the public now stands at approximately 76 percent of GDP,26 and\nthe present value of unfunded entitlements is estimated at approximately $59 trillion.27 The recent\ntax legislation and bipartisan budget compromise legislation are likely to exacerbate these issues,\nand the U.S. deficit is poised to exceed $1 trillion in 2020.28 As a consequence of this rising level\nof debt, the U.S. will have less fiscal capacity to fight the next recession.\nThe U.S. relies heavily on the presumption that the dollar is likely to be the world’s reserve\ncurrency for the foreseeable future. That is, global investors tend to overweight their asset\nallocations to dollars. This, of course, is highly beneficial when the projected issuance of U.S.\nTreasury securities is likely to rise substantially. However, it is worth considering the implications\nif the dollar ceases to be the world’s reserve currency sometime in the future. Is it wise for the U.S.\nto rely so heavily on this presumption in managing its financial affairs?\nPreviously, I have written about the historically elevated level of corporate debt in the U.S. I have\nnoted that this is probably not, at this point, a systemic risk but more likely an amplifier in the\nevent of an economic slowdown (see “Corporate Debt as a Potential Amplifier in a Slowdown,”\nMarch 5, 2019). It is worth noting that high levels of government debt, along with elevated levels\nof corporate debt, mean that the U.S. economy is becoming much more interest rate sensitive. That\nis, increases in interest rates would likely require a higher proportion of cash flow in order to\nservice corporate and government debt obligations.\nStructural reforms and other actions that moderate the path of future government debt growth may\nbe advisable to keep this short-term-growth tailwind from becoming a medium- and longer-term\nheadwind to economic growth in the U.S. In the meantime, this historically high level of U.S.\ngovernment debt means that there will likely be less capacity to use fiscal policy in the event of an\neconomic downturn.\nImplications of Key Structural Drivers\nMany of the issues raised by these structural drivers are primarily outside the purview of monetary\npolicy. That is, while monetary policy has a key role to play, I believe it is likely that we will need\nbroader economic policy actions if we are to improve the growth potential of the U.S. economy\nand the future prosperity of our citizens.\nImmigration and trade policies, education reform and skills training, and managing the future path\nof U.S. government debt are all policy judgments that are made outside the purview of monetary\npolicy and the remit of the Federal Reserve. However, part of my job as a central banker at the\nDallas Fed is to share our economic research and call out these issues to elected and appointed\nofficials in hopes that our research will help inform their judgments and highlight the need for\nbroader economic policy at the city, state and federal levels. I am hopeful that this effort will help\nimprove economic performance in the Eleventh District and the nation.\n7\n\nDiscussion of the Current Stance of U.S. Monetary Policy\nAs discussed earlier, I supported the FOMC’s 25-basis-point reductions in the federal funds rate\nat the July and September meetings. I am concerned that if non-U.S. growth continues to\ndecelerate, and weakness in U.S. manufacturing and business investment intensifies, this weakness\ncould spread to the broader U.S. economy, ultimately impacting consumer confidence and\nspending.\nWhile strong consumer spending is a welcome underpinning to growth, I recognize that it is more\nof a “coincident” indicator; that is, it doesn’t provide great insight regarding future prospects for\nthe economy. Consumer confidence can be fragile—one or two months of weak jobs reports could\nput a dent in consumer confidence and spending habits, which could further slow GDP growth.\nThis is why I’ve repeatedly said that if we wait to see weakness in the consumer before taking\naction, we will have likely waited too long. From a risk-management point of view, that is a\nmistake I prefer not to make.\nA reality check for my thinking has been the level and shape of the U.S. Treasury curve. The 10-\nyear Treasury rate has declined from 3.24 percent on November 8, 2018, to 1.59 percent at the\ntime of this essay.29 During that same time period, the federal funds rate has declined from a range\nof 2 to 2.25 percent to 1.75 to 2 percent. It is worth noting that the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP) median estimate of the federal funds rate at the end of 2021 has gone from 3.25\nto 3.50 percent in the September 2018 summary30 to 2 to 2.25 percent in the recent September\n2019 submission.31\nIt is my view that the level and shape of the Treasury curve are reflective of slowing global growth,\nheightened trade tensions and a more pessimistic view regarding the prospects for U.S. economic\ngrowth. Pessimism regarding prospects for global growth is also one key reason why\napproximately 22 percent of global government debt is now trading at negative yields.32\nI believe that moves in U.S. market-determined rates are consistent with concerns about economic\nweakness spreading more broadly to other parts of the U.S. economy. For me, these moves in\nmarket-determined rates are a reality check that suggests the setting of the federal funds rate was\ntighter than appropriate prior to the July and September FOMC meetings. In this regard, I intend\nto continue to carefully monitor the yield curve and gauge the ongoing implications of negative\ngaps between the federal funds rate and yields on longer-dated Treasury securities.\nAt this juncture, having adjusted the policy rate twice this year, it is my intention to take some\ntime to carefully monitor economic developments. I am mindful of the potential excesses and\nimbalances that can be created as a result of excessive accommodation. I am also alert to the\npossibility that recent escalations in trade tensions could moderate somewhat and this, in turn,\nmight alleviate some of the downside risks to the U.S. and global economies. In any event, I intend\nto avoid being rigid or predetermined from here, and plan to remain highly vigilant and keep an\nopen mind as to whether further action on the federal funds rate is appropriate.\n8\n\nAPPENDIX\nA Note on Technology-Enabled Disruption\nAs Dallas Fed economists have been discussing for the past several years, technology-enabled\ndisruption means workers are increasingly being replaced by technology. It also means that\nexisting business models are being supplanted by new models, often technology-enabled, for more\nefficiently selling or distributing goods and services. In addition, consumers are increasingly using\ntechnology to shop for goods and services at lower prices with greater convenience—having the\nimpact of reducing the pricing power of businesses which has, in turn, caused them to further\nintensify their focus on creating greater operational efficiencies. These trends appear to be\naccelerating.\nIt is likely that disruption is a factor in economic outcomes being increasingly skewed by the\neducational attainment levels of workers. For example, for those who have a college degree, the\nunemployment rate stands at 2.0 percent, and the labor force participation rate is 73.9 percent. If\nyou have some college education, the unemployment rate is 2.9 percent and the participation rate\nis 65.1 percent; a high school diploma, the unemployment rate is 3.6 percent and the participation\nrate is 57.8 percent; and some high school education, the unemployment rate is 4.8 percent and the\nparticipation rate is 46.0 percent.33\nIncreasingly, workers with lower levels of educational attainment are seeing their jobs restructured\nor eliminated. Unless they have sufficient math and literacy skills or are retrained, these workers\nmay likely see their productivity and incomes decline as a result of disruption. This may help\nexplain the muted levels of wage gains and overall labor productivity growth we see in the U.S. as\nwell as other advanced economies.\nThe impact of technology-enabled disruption on the workforce is likely less susceptible to\nmonetary policy—addressing this challenge requires structural reforms. The reforms could include\nactions which would be aimed at improving early childhood literacy, as well as improving math,\nreading and science achievement levels among high school students. These efforts could help boost\noverall college readiness in order to increase the percentage of students who graduate college in\nsix years or less—now estimated at 60 percent in the U.S.34 Addressing the impacts of technology-\nenabled disruption will also require stepped-up efforts to increase middle-skills training in cities\nacross the U.S. in order to improve employment, close the skills gap (not enough workers to fill\nskilled jobs) and raise worker productivity. These initiatives could improve educational\nachievement levels in order to better equip our citizens to thrive in a world that increasingly\ndemands greater education, training and adaptability.\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive competitors, have\nbeen more cautious about making capacity-expansion decisions and investing in major capital\nprojects. The recent tax legislation may help create incentives to improve the level of capital\ninvestment.\n9\n\nTo deal with disruptive changes and lack of pricing power, many companies are seeking to achieve\ngreater scale economies in order to maintain or improve profit margins. This may help explain the\nrecord level of merger-and-acquisition activity globally over the past few years.\nNotes\n1 Data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Annual Update, published July 26, 2019.\n2 Data are from the BEA, Federal Reserve Board and Haver Analytics.

    "text": "Economic Conditions and the Stance of\nMonetary Policy\nRobert S. Kaplan\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nJune 24, 2019\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Alexander Chudik, Jackson Crawford, Jim Dolmas,\nMarc Giannoni, Stephanie Gullo, Evan Koenig, Emily Kerr, Anthony Murphy, Michael Morris, Pia Orrenius, Keith\nPhillips, Laton Russell, Amro Shohoud, William Simmons, Martin Stuermer, Kathy Thacker, Joe Tracy, Mark\nWynne, and Mine Yücel in preparing these remarks.\n\nEconomic Conditions and the Stance of Monetary Policy\nRobert S. Kaplan\nAt the recent June meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the federal funds\nrate unchanged in a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent. In our statement, the FOMC indicated that\nuncertainties about the outlook have increased and stated that “in light of these uncertainties and\nmuted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming\ninformation for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a\nstrong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.”1\nThe purpose of this essay is to describe my assessment of economic conditions in the U.S. and\nglobal economies. In addition, I will discuss business activity in the Eleventh Federal Reserve\nDistrict and describe how the implications of climate change are impacting Dallas Fed economic\nanalysis of the district and the nation. Lastly, I will discuss my views regarding the appropriate\nstance of U.S. monetary policy.\nThe U.S. Economy\nDallas Fed economists expect U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) to grow at a rate of\napproximately 2 percent in 2019. This is slower than the 3 percent growth achieved in 2018,\nprimarily due to continued waning of U.S. fiscal stimulus, a lower rate of global growth and\nincreased business uncertainty due mostly to heightened trade tensions.\nThe U.S. economy has been bolstered by a strong consumer. Household balance sheets are in\nrelatively healthy shape—household debt declined from 97 percent of GDP at year-end 2008 to\napproximately 75 percent in the first quarter of 2019.2 In addition, a tight labor market has given\nan added boost to consumer spending and confidence. The consumer is approximately 70 percent\nof the U.S. economy, so this strength provides a solid underpinning to the outlook for growth.\nOn the cautionary side, trade tensions and uncertainty have increased significantly over the past\ntwo months. Tariffs and trade uncertainty appear to be having a negative impact on companies’\nability to manage input costs and some chilling influence on their capital spending plans. Even\nbefore this recent escalation, nonresidential fixed investment had contributed only 0.3 percentage\npoints to GDP growth in the first quarter versus an average of 0.9 for 2017 and 2018.3 In a recent\nDallas Fed Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey, more than half of companies responding\nreported that tariffs are increasing their input costs, and a material number of companies reported\na reduction in their capital spending plans.4\nThere is evidence that tariffs and trade uncertainties may be impacting manufacturing activity. The\nmost recent manufacturing sector surveys from the Federal Reserve Banks of New York,\nPhiladelphia and Dallas all show significant deterioration in manufacturing business sentiment.\n1\n\nOne positive development worth noting is that balance sheets of U.S. banks appear to be in much\nbetter shape than 10 years ago. While I have flagged the high level of corporate debt as a potential\namplifier in the next downturn, I would also note that the improvement in bank balance sheets\nmeans that they should be capable of extending credit in a way that is supportive of further\neconomic expansion. The Fed’s recent stress tests indicate that, after adjusting for stress-scenario\nlosses, capital levels at the largest U.S. banks would still be above capital levels those banks held\nbefore the financial crisis of 2008–09.5\nThe Labor Market\nThe U.S. unemployment rate is 3.6 percent.6 At the Dallas Fed, we particularly focus on U-6, a\nbroader measure of unemployment that tracks unemployed plus discouraged workers who have\ngiven up looking for work, plus part-time workers who would prefer to work full time. This\nmeasure is now 7.1 percent, which is well below its prerecession low of 7.9 percent in December\n2006.\nThe labor force participation rate now stands at 62.8 percent. It has ranged between 62.4 percent\nand 63.2 percent for the past five years. The participation rate is the percentage of people 16 years\nof age and older who participate in the workforce by either working or looking for work.\nOne factor supporting the overall participation rate is the improvement in the participation rate of\nprime-age workers (25 to 54). Prime-age participation has increased from 80.9 percent in 2015 to\n82.1 percent today. Chart 1 highlights these trends in labor force participation.\nIt is important to recognize that the aging of the U.S. workforce is negatively impacting the overall\nparticipation rate because as workers age, an increasing percentage are more likely to retire. It is\nthe view of Dallas Fed economists that increasing participation of prime-age workers is unlikely\nto last indefinitely—aging population demographics will tend to bring down the overall labor force\nparticipation rate. In light of these trends, it is our view that the labor force participation rate will\nlikely decline to below 61 percent over the next 10 years, even as workers tend to remain in the\nlabor force later in their careers.7\nThe May jobs growth number was approximately 75,000—lower than the average monthly job\ngrowth of approximately 223,000 in 2018 and 186,000 in 2019 through April.8 It is the view of\nDallas Fed economists that moderation in the rate of job growth is consistent with a labor market\nthat is tight and likely at or past the level of full employment in the U.S. As a consequence of this\ntightness, we would expect job growth to remain moderate in the months ahead. Long-run GDP\ngrowth is made up of growth in the workforce and growth in labor productivity. Assuming there\nis not an offsetting burst in productivity growth, a slowing rate of workforce growth will likely\ntranslate into slowing GDP growth in the U.S.\n2\n\nChart 1\nLabor Force Participation Rates\nPercent Percent\n68 84\n67 83\nTotal, 16+ years (left axis)\nMay '19\nPrime age, 25-54 years (right axis) 82.1\n66 82\n65 81\n64 80\n63 79\n62.8\n62 78\n'07 '08 '09 '10 '11 '12 '13 '14 '15 '16 '17 '18 '19\nNOTES: Labor force participation rates are seasonally adjusted. Gray bar indicates recession.\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nWage Growth and Continuing Strong Jobs Gains\nIf we are at or past full employment, why is the average nominal rate of wage growth only 3.1\npercent?9 Also, even with the moderation in May jobs growth, why has job growth in 2019\naveraged approximately 164,000 workers per month, well over what is necessary to keep up with\npopulation growth?10\nRegarding wages, our Dallas Fed economists believe that more muted inflation and inflation\nexpectations, as compared with previous expansions, are factors tempering nominal wage growth\nin this expansion. Also, they argue that older workers have increased as a share of the labor force\nover the past 10 years—and their rate of wage growth tends to be more tepid than that of younger\nworkers.11 Lastly, our economists believe that more subdued productivity growth has likely had a\nsomewhat muting impact on wage growth.\nOn a related point, research by the Dallas Fed’s Joe Tracy and Michael Morris along with Robert\nRich of the Cleveland Fed indicates that individual wage growth is, in fact, higher than standard\nstatistics have suggested. Their research finds that the growth rate of widely followed wage\nindicators like average hourly earnings are disproportionately weighted to high-wage earners, who\nare also typically older and have a lower rate of wage growth. They find that an average of\nindividual wage growth rates, which equally weights the wage growth of all workers, has been\nclose to 5 percent in recent years—materially higher than the 3.1 percent average hourly earnings\nmeasure recorded in May 2019.12\n3\n\nRegarding recent job gains, one key driver has been the improvement in prime-age labor force\nparticipation (described earlier). As part of this improvement, it is important to note recent gains\nreflect disproportionate improvements in participation by previously underrepresented groups. For\nexample, Hispanic women across educational attainment levels, as well as black men with a high\nschool diploma or less, have disproportionately improved their levels of labor force participation.\nChart 2 provides a breakdown of recent changes in participation rates, based on educational\nattainment, race/ethnicity and gender.\nChart 2\nChange in Prime-Age Labor Force Participation Rate, May 2018 to May 2019\nWomen\nPercentage points High school or less\n2.50\nSome college\nBachelor's or higher\n1.50\n0.50\n-0.50\n-1.50\n-2.50\nNon-Hispanic white Hispanic Black Other\n(31% of prime-age pop.)

Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nThese recent improvements in the participation of previously underrepresented groups as well as\nthe growth in wages are welcome developments. To the extent historically underrepresented\ngroups can be drawn into the workforce and gain the skills and experience that enhance their\nlikelihood of staying in the labor force, this should have the impact of increasing the size and\nproductive capacity of the U.S. labor force.\nIncreasing the size and productive capacity of the labor force is especially important as firms face\nsignificant difficulties trying to find workers. A recent Dallas Fed Texas Business Outlook Survey\n4\n\nfinds that 71 percent of firms surveyed are seeking to hire and 83 percent of those firms report that\nthey are having difficulty finding qualified workers.13\nAs discussed earlier, it is the view of Dallas Fed economists that while there is some scope for\nfurther gains in labor force participation, it will not be sufficient to offset the effects of a\nhistorically tight labor market. As a result, it is likely that the rate of job growth will remain\nmoderate in the months ahead. In this regard, we believe that job growth in the range of 60,000 to\n120,000 jobs per month will be consistent with a “strong”14 jobs market for the remainder of 2019.\nInflation\nThe most recent personal consumption expenditures (PCE) reading of inflation was approximately\n1.5 percent on a 12-month basis.15 Our Dallas Fed economists prefer to look at the Dallas Fed\nTrimmed Mean PCE measure of inflation, which has been running consistently between 1.9 and 2\npercent over the past year—and is currently running at approximately 2 percent.16 This reading of\ncore inflation exes out extreme moves to the upside and downside in individual inflation\ncomponents. Research by my Dallas Fed colleagues Evan Koenig and Jim Dolmas suggests that\nthe trimmed mean measure is a highly useful indicator of future headline PCE inflation trends.17\nIt is our expectation that the trimmed mean will end this year in the range of 2 percent and that\nheadline PCE inflation will move higher over the next 12 months.\nI have written and spoken about the idea that there are two key elements of inflation: the cyclical\nand the structural. Dallas Fed economists believe these two forces are currently working in\nopposing fashion.\nCyclical inflationary forces are building. These cyclical forces are driven primarily by a tightening\nlabor market and continuing wage gains. Historically, economists would have expected a\ntightening labor market to contribute to greater price pressures. This connection between labor\nmarket slack, wages and prices is sometimes referred to as the “Phillips curve.”18 Given these\ncyclical factors, why hasn’t inflation been more apparent? Why have we spent most of the past\nseven years—and particularly the past two years, when the unemployment rate has been below\nmost estimates of the natural rate of unemployment—with a headline PCE inflation rate below the\nFed’s 2 percent objective?\nOur view at the Dallas Fed is that the structural forces of technology, technology-enabled\ndisruption and, to some lesser extent, globalization are muting the relationship between labor\nmarket tightening and wage gains, and are even further muting the connection between wage gains\nand prices. Technology advancements such as artificial intelligence are allowing businesses to\nreplace people with technology. In addition, new business models, often technology enabled and\naided by the proliferation of mobile computing power, are disrupting old business models and\nallowing consumers to have more power in choosing the lowest price at a high level of\nconvenience. Think Amazon, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and so on. These models are often further enabled\nby the fact that the cost of capital is historically low, and financial markets are willing to assign\nthese businesses substantial valuations and advance substantial amounts of capital, even though\nthese companies frequently generate little or no profitability in their early years.\n5\n\nAgainst this background, numerous Dallas Fed business contacts report having materially less\npricing power today than they have had historically. Based on these discussions, it is our view that\nas cyclical forces build, which lead to increased costs, these cost increases are just as likely to lead\nto business margin erosion as they are higher prices.\nIn a historically tight labor market, cyclical inflationary pressures will likely remain elevated. The\nquestion is whether they are strong enough to offset the structural forces that are muting inflation.\nTime will tell, but we are watching this dynamic very carefully at the Dallas Fed. While the Phillips\ncurve appears to have flattened, it might be a mistake to assume that it is dead—it may just be that\nthe level of unemployment that creates undue price pressures is lower than we have historically\nexperienced—but the overall dynamic hasn’t gone away completely.\nThe Global Economy\nGlobal (ex the U.S.) GDP growth was approximately 4.3 percent in 2017, declined to 4.0 percent\nin 2018 and is expected to be 3.6 percent in 2019.19 Furthermore, risks to this outlook appear to be\ntilted to the downside. Growth expectations are sluggish due to slowing growth in the euro area\nand in other advanced economies, as well as somewhat more muted growth in emerging\neconomies.\nTrade tensions likely play some role in this softening. While exports are approximately 12 percent\nof U.S. GDP, they are 20 percent for China, 47 percent for Germany and 18 percent for Japan.20\n(See Chart 3.)\nChart 3\nExports as Percent of Gross Domestic Product\nU.S.\nJapan\nChina\nU.K.\nCanada\nMexico\nGermany\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\nPercent of GDP\nNOTES: Exports include goods and services.

This is particularly true in North America.\nFor example, it is estimated that 73 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico are composed of\nintermediate goods; that is, goods that are part of integrated supply-chain and logistics\nrelationships that allow U.S.-domiciled companies to increase their global competitiveness and\nkeep jobs in this country.22\nEconomic Conditions in the Eleventh District: Including a Brief Discussion Regarding the\nImpact of Climate Change\nOverview\nThe Eleventh Federal Reserve District comprises Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New\nMexico. Texas job growth in 2018 was approximately 2.3 percent, and we expect jobs to grow at\na solid rate in 2019.\nIt is worth noting that the Eleventh District is particularly impacted by developments in the energy\nindustry and international trade, as Texas is both the largest energy producer of any state and the\nnation’s largest exporter. It is also important to note that growth in Texas continues to be aided by\nthe migration of people and firms to the state. This migration has helped bring human capital and\nnew businesses to the state, which have helped fuel the diversification of industry and the\ndevelopment of its largest metropolitan areas: Houston, Dallas–Fort Worth, San Antonio and\nAustin.23\nThe Impact of Climate Change: Frequency and Intensity of Severe Weather Events\nOne factor we are increasingly discussing at the Dallas Fed is the impact of climate change on the\nEleventh District. In particular, severe weather events can have a substantial human and economic\ncost to the district.\nOne recent example is Hurricane Harvey, which occurred in August 2017. It is estimated that\nHarvey caused approximately $74 billion in property damage and lost output in the state.24 While\nthe GDP and job losses appear to have been transitory, the lasting impact in Houston and along\nthe Texas coast continues to be felt in the form of displacement of communities, ongoing\nrebuilding efforts, increased insurance costs, public spending on mitigation efforts, and more\nstringent building codes. In addition, the storm disproportionately impacted low-income families\nby wiping out their savings, impacting their ability to safely domicile their families and increasing\ntheir need for health care and related services.25 Given the extent of the damage, a key question\nfor civic leaders, businesses and residents is the extent to which severe weather events like Harvey\nare likely to be unusual and sporadic in the future or whether they are likely to become more\nfrequent in the years ahead.\n7\n\nThe Eleventh District is home to approximately 50 of the Fortune 500 companies. It is also a major\ninfrastructure hub for the nation’s energy production, transmission and refining capability. The\nseaports along the Gulf Coast as well as the inland ports in our major metro areas and along the\nU.S.–Mexico border play a critical role for the U.S. in trade and immigration.\nIn this context, my Dallas Fed research team is focused on the extent that severe weather events\nsuch as hurricanes, droughts, flooding and tornadoes are increasingly likely to impact our people,\ncities, critical energy infrastructure and key industries. While our district has historically exhibited\ngreat resilience in response to the effects of severe weather, the latest National Climate\nAssessment, a comprehensive report on climate change and its impacts, indicates that the severity\nand damage caused by extreme weather events are likely to intensify in the years ahead. (See the\nappendix for a discussion of the National Climate Assessment findings and conclusions, as well\nas a discussion of certain major considerations for the Eleventh District.)\nAs a central banker, I do not delve into the political and other controversial aspects of this subject.\nHowever, I do intently focus on the ways severe weather events and climate-related trends are\nlikely impacting economic conditions and financial stability in the Eleventh District and the nation.\nIt is the view of Dallas Fed economists that severe weather events pose a “tail risk” for certain\ncities and industries in our district. This is not new. However, while many of the impacts of these\nsevere weather events have historically been transitory, we are increasingly cognizant of the\nlonger-term risks that are leading several cities and companies to make substantial capital\ninvestments in improving infrastructure in order to mitigate the damage of future severe weather.\nFor now, it is the view of the Dallas Fed that severe weather-related tail risks are unlikely to\nmaterially negatively impact the medium-term economic performance of Texas and overall\noutlook for the region. However, if the National Climate Assessment predictions regarding the\nlikely frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events turn out to be accurate, these extreme\nweather events may begin to have a negative impact on the region’s longer-term business prospects\nand migration trends.\nAdaptation and Mitigation Efforts\nBusinesses, elected officials and civic leaders are taking a number of steps to manage these risks.\nState and local leaders are studying various infrastructure investments in order to upgrade the\nviability of neighborhoods, protect at-risk populations who lack the resources to recover from\nsevere weather events, protect businesses, and ensure the ongoing production, transportation and\ntransmission of energy services in the event of a severe weather-related disruption.\nIn addition, in our extensive discussions with energy industry contacts as well as broad business\ncontacts, we are learning that businesses are investing much more heavily in alternative energy\nprojects and sustainability initiatives.\nEnergy companies are making substantial investments in moderating the environmental impacts\nof shale oil production. A number of energy companies and private equity firms are actively\ninvesting in battery storage and wind and solar projects that could diversify sources of energy in\n8\n\nthe U.S. In addition, Texas is now the largest wind-energy-producing state in the nation.26 Many\ncompanies are adopting greenhouse-gas emissions targets and making investments to reduce their\ncarbon footprint.\nAt the Dallas Fed, we are actively working to play a research and convening role throughout the\nEleventh District to help frame these issues and discuss approaches that would improve the\nregion’s ability to manage the effects of future severe weather events.27 In addition, in order to\nimprove our sustainability leadership and enhance our insight into these matters, the Dallas Fed\nhas established a sustainability initiative intended to reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions and\nempower our employees to take actions which will improve the sustainability performance of our\nBank.28\nThe Stance of Monetary Policy\nIn light of relatively solid rates of economic growth, a labor market at or past full employment and\na PCE inflation rate somewhat below target, I believe it is appropriate to take a balanced approach\nto monetary policy. I would note that, while headline PCE inflation is running below target, the\nDallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of PCE inflation has been running at approximately 2 percent\nand our economists expect this measure of inflation to end the year in the neighborhood of 2\npercent. In assessing economic conditions, I am cognizant of the structural challenges of slowing\nworkforce growth due to an aging population and limitations on business pricing power due to\ntechnology and technology-enabled disruption as well as globalization.\nI am also highly attuned to the fact that, since early May, downside risks to the outlook have\nincreased due to heightened trade tensions and decelerating rates of global growth. The economy\nis also being impacted by the waning of fiscal stimulus. The question is whether trade and global\ngrowth uncertainties are likely to persist in a manner that leads to a material deterioration in the\noutlook for U.S. economic growth.\nAt this stage, I believe it is too early to make a judgment on this question. These heightened\nuncertainties have intensified over the past seven weeks, and it is certainly possible that events\ncould occur in the near future which would substantially reduce these uncertainties. In this\nsituation, I believe it would be wise to allow events to unfold a bit more before making judgments\nregarding the stance of monetary policy. I think this approach would be particularly wise in light\nof the fact that, as mentioned earlier, my base case is for solid GDP growth in 2019, and I expect\nlabor market conditions to remain at levels I would consider at or past full employment. In addition,\nfinancial conditions—the cost and availability of credit—are particularly robust by historical\nstandards.\nAs I have said previously, monetary accommodation is not “free.” I am concerned that adding\nmonetary stimulus, at this juncture, would contribute to a build-up of excesses and imbalances in\nthe economy which may ultimately prove to be difficult and painful to manage.\nI have spoken about the level of corporate debt as potentially one of those excesses that is likely\nto be a “burden” on the economy in the event of a downturn. Persistently low interest rates make\nborrowing for share repurchase and merger transactions highly accretive to a company’s earnings\n9\n\nper share. In a world where businesses have less and less pricing power and managing costs is\nessential, debt-financed activity becomes harder to resist. Debt-financed share repurchase and\nmerger activity may help fuel growth in earnings per share when times are good, but in a downturn,\nincreased debt levels will mean that a higher percentage of cash flow will be necessary to service\ninterest and principal repayments. This is just one example of the type of excess that may seem\ninnocuous when times are good but can become more troublesome in a downturn.\nIn this regard, I think it is important to emphasize that we are well-served by rigorous\nmacroprudential policies, particularly tough capital requirements and stress testing for large banks\nas well as oversight of nonbank financials. In a period of persistently low interest rates, the\npotential exists for excesses and imbalances to build, and rigorous macroprudential oversight\nshould provide more flexibility for monetary policy to deal primarily with economic conditions.\nI am closely monitoring the shape of the yield curve in the U.S. The three-month Treasury yield is\ntoday at 2.12 percent. In my view, the one-year Treasury at 1.93 percent, the five-year at 1.77\npercent and the 10-year at 2.03 percent are indicative of sluggish expectations for future growth—\nand recent heightening of trade tensions has likely exacerbated these growth concerns.29 It is\nimportant to emphasize that financial markets can change very rapidly and are highly sensitive not\nonly to increased economic uncertainties, but also to expectations of Federal Reserve monetary\npolicy actions.\nAs I have said before, I would be concerned about an inversion of the curve—either three-month\nto 10-year or one-year to 10-year—of some size and duration. My concern emanates from my\nbelief that an inverted curve ultimately makes it more difficult for financial intermediaries to\nborrow short and lend long—and, if the inversion persists, it would likely begin to impede the\ncreation of credit and lead to a tightening of financial conditions. I will continue to watch this\ncarefully.\nI believe that we currently are in the neighborhood of a neutral setting for monetary policy—that\nis, we are likely neither accommodative nor restrictive. Over the coming weeks and months, I will\nbe closely monitoring developments in the U.S. and global economies as well as the status of\nfinancial conditions (especially credit spreads and availability of credit). In particular, I intend to\nbe highly vigilant with regard to the persistence of heightened trade tensions and indications that\nslowing global growth is spilling over into a material deterioration of the economic outlook for the\nU.S. In the meantime, I believe it would be wise to take additional time and allow events to unfold\nas we consider whether it is appropriate to make changes to the stance of U.S. monetary policy.\n10\n\nAPPENDIX\nNational Climate Assessment Findings and Conclusions\nIn 1989, President George H.W. Bush created the U.S. Global Change Research Program\n(USGCRP). It was more formally established by Congress in 1990 via the Global Change Research\nAct. The USGCRP was given the mandate to develop and coordinate “a comprehensive and\nintegrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand,\nassess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.”30\nThe USGCRP is comprised of 13 federal agencies that conduct or use research on global change\nand its impact on society. These agencies include the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce,\nDefense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Interior, State and Transportation, as well as the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National\nScience Foundation, Smithsonian Institution and U.S. Agency for International Development.\nEvery four years, the USGCRP prepares an assessment, known as the National Climate\nAssessment (NCA). The NCA analyzes the effects of global change on the natural environment,\nagriculture, energy production and use, transportation, human health and biological diversity; and\nit describes current trends in global change and projects trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.\nThe most recent NCA was completed in November 2018 and was produced by a team of more\nthan 300 experts, with input from external stakeholders. An expert external peer review of the\nreport was performed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.31\nThe NCA concludes “that the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and\ncontinues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and\nthat climate-related threats to Americans’ physical, social, and economic well-being are rising.”32\nThe report cites “significant, clear, and compelling evidence that global average temperature is\nmuch higher, and is rising more rapidly, than anything modern civilization has experienced, with\nwidespread and growing impacts.”33\nThe report also explains that greenhouse gases absorb heat in the atmosphere near the Earth’s\nsurface, preventing it from escaping out into space. If the atmospheric concentrations of these\ngases rise, the average temperature of the lower atmosphere will gradually increase as the heat\nemitted by Earth is retained inside the climate system, warming the planet, a phenomenon known\nas the greenhouse effect.34 Greenhouse gases include, for example, carbon dioxide, water vapor\nand methane.\nThe report cites studies which estimate that the global average temperature rose approximately 1.8\ndegrees Fahrenheit between 1901 and 2016,35 and that for the period since 1986, global annual\naverage temperatures appear to have increased at a more rapid rate than for any similar 20–30-year\ntime period in at least the last 1,700 years.36\nThe NCA states that “annual average temperatures in the United States are projected to continue\nto increase in the coming decades.”37 The report indicates that recent record-setting temperatures\n11\n\nare expected to become common in the near future. By late this century, the report estimates that\nin the U.S., increases of 2.3°–6.7°F are expected under a relatively optimistic climate change\nscenario and 5.4°–11.0°F under a more dire scenario, relative to 1986–2015.38\nIn addition to temperature rise, the report suggests that we are likely to see further increases in\nocean temperature as well as progressive melting in glaciers and ice sheets, some shrinking in\nsnow cover and sea ice, rising sea levels, and more frequent high temperature extremes and heavy\nprecipitation events.39,40\nThe NCA argues that heavy rainfall events are associated with climate change. The report explains\nthat, due to the relationships between levels of temperature and humidity, the frequency and\nintensity of heavy rainfall events are expected to increase over the coming century. The report\nasserts that warmer temperatures lead to increasing evaporation rates. This trend is likely to cause\nhigher levels of water vapor in the atmosphere, which is likely to lead to more frequent and intense\nprecipitation extremes.41\nThe NCA indicates that climate change has contributed to increases in Atlantic hurricane activity\nsince 1970.42 It also asserts that hurricane rainfall and intensity are projected to increase as a result\nof rises in sea surface temperatures and changes in atmospheric conditions.43 While the frequency\nof tropical storms is not expected to change, the number of more-severe storms—those with\nsustained wind speeds in excess of 130 mph (referred to as Category 4 and 5 hurricanes)—is\nexpected to increase.44\nThe report warns that U.S. coastal infrastructure could be adversely impacted by this trend. This\ninfrastructure provides critical energy supplies and access to goods and services from overseas\ntrade.45 The report further highlights that reliable and affordable energy supplies, which support\nbroad sectors of the U.S. economy, are increasingly at risk from climate change and weather\nextremes.46\nAcross much of the U.S., climate change is also expected to decrease surface soil moisture due to\nincreased evaporation rates associated with warmer temperatures. This means that future droughts\nin certain regions of the U.S. are likely to be stronger and potentially last longer. The NCA explains\nthat when droughts occur simultaneously with especially warm temperatures, it creates conditions\nfor substantial wildfires, which have increased in frequency across the western U.S. since the\n1980s.47 Droughts can also have a significant impact on agriculture.\nFor a fuller explanation of the NCA report, please see the link, National Climate Assessment.\nDiscussion of Certain Major Considerations for the Eleventh District\nHurricane Activity\nA hurricane is defined as a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Since\n2000, approximately 20 hurricanes have impacted the Gulf of Mexico region of the U.S.,\ncomprising Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.48 Over this period, 14 tropical\n12\n\nstorms passed through Texas, with six of these having sufficient maximum sustained winds to be\ncategorized as hurricanes.\nThe NCA asserts that the intensity of hurricane activity is likely to increase. This trend is likely to\nbe associated with greater rainfall during these severe storms.49 In addition, the report indicates\nthat climate change is likely to cause global sea levels to rise an average of 1–4 feet during the\nremainder of the 21st century.50 As a result of rises in sea level, it is probable that the risk of\nflooding on the western Gulf of Mexico coast will increase.51\nThese developments could impact economic conditions in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District\nand U.S. because of the impact on coastal infrastructure, which connects the nation to energy\nsupplies as well as access to goods and services from overseas trade. In addition, as a result of\nthese trends, the costs to repair damage to Gulf Coast facilities are expected to grow substantially.52\nOne recent example of the impact of severe storms is Hurricane Harvey, which made landfall on\nAug. 25, 2017, in the area just north of Corpus Christi, Texas. As Hurricane Harvey stalled over\nthe Houston metro area, some areas recorded more than 50 inches of rain in a five-day period and\nexperienced substantial flooding as local bayous, rivers and reservoirs overflowed their banks.53\nAccording to estimates by Moody’s Analytics, Hurricane Harvey had total direct costs of\napproximately $65 billion and indirect costs of approximately $8.5 billion.54 Tragically, 68 people\nare estimated to have lost their lives as a direct result of the storm. More than 300,000 homes and\nbusinesses and approximately 500,000 cars were flooded.55\nHarvey led to an estimated 16,000 lost jobs in the Texas Gulf Coast region—however, the Dallas\nFed estimates that as of the end of 2017, employment on the Gulf Coast had more than fully\nrecovered.56 While increased economic activity was associated with reconstruction efforts, there\nare more lingering impacts including lost homes and businesses, increased insurance costs and\ncosts of government programs to mitigate future damages.\nAs discussed earlier, the Gulf Coast is home to a substantial concentration of refinery capacity,\nchemical industry infrastructure and offshore production facilities. At its peak, approximately 25\npercent of the Gulf of Mexico’s offshore oil and natural gas production was shut in as a result of\nHarvey.57 Refinery utilization along the Gulf Coast fell from in excess of 90 percent to\napproximately 60 percent.58 More than 50 percent of U.S. output of basic petrochemicals was\ntemporarily disrupted.59 The refinery outages resulting from Harvey-related shutdowns led to a\ntemporary increase in U.S. gasoline prices of 28 cents.60\nIn the aftermath of this storm, Gulf Coast cities as well as the state of Texas and various federal\nagencies have been working together to undertake multibillion-dollar investments to upgrade\nreservoir and flood mitigation infrastructure to better protect the region (residents and businesses)\nin the event of future weather events.\n13\n\nImpact on Water Supplies, Flooding and Agriculture\nClimate change is expected to increase dryness in the Eleventh District as temperatures rise, as\nwell as increase the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation.61 For the agriculture sector,\nthis increased weather variability will naturally lead to increased agricultural production variability\nand risk. These trends may also lead to challenges relating to water availability in the state.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, “drought is the leading driver of production risk\nin U.S. agriculture … [as it] can reduce crop yields, lead farmers to cut back planted or harvested\nacreage, reduce livestock productivity, and increase costs of production inputs such as animal feed\nor irrigation water.”62 For the livestock sector—which accounts for more than 60 percent of\nagricultural production in Texas63—drought effects are often felt over multiple years due to the\nresulting pasture damage and herd reduction that take years to recover from.\nIn Texas, where farm employment makes up approximately 1.6 percent of employment, and farm\noutput makes up approximately 0.4 percent of state GDP,64 agricultural losses from the historic\n2011 drought were estimated to be in excess of $7 billion, accounting for about 40 percent of the\naverage value of agricultural production and far exceeding loss estimates from any prior drought\non record.65 Droughts also induce additional indirect effects from reduced agribusiness activity in\ndrought years—fertilizer, crop storage, machinery—plus the decrease in expenditures in the local\neconomy resulting from lost income for producers, harvest laborers, truck drivers and\nagribusinesses.\nHeavy precipitation, which is expected to continue to increase in both frequency and intensity as\nclimate change progresses,66 also causes problems for agriculture, as seen this year in Texas and\nin other parts of the country. When flooding happens early in the season, fields become too wet\nfor farmers to prepare the soil and plant crops, causing delays which lead to reduced yields or crop\nsubstitution. Flooding late in the season causes harvest delays and crop quality issues, which both\nhamper farm income. Hotter temperatures prompted by climate change also pose additional pest\nproblems for farmers, driving up pesticide use and costs, and hamper livestock productivity—\nincreasing time to grow animals to a given weight and decreasing calving rates and milk\nproduction.67\nThe inherent risks in the agriculture industry may be exacerbated by climate change, which could\nmake it more difficult for agricultural producers to get sufficient financing and insurance. As crop\nyields become more variable, lenders may become more concerned about repayment of crop\nproduction loans and tighten their lending standards and terms. Also, insurance costs will go up as\ninsurers have more indemnities to pay out from droughts or floods. Adaptations in the agricultural\nsector to mitigate the impact of drought cycles include planting more drought-resistant crops,\nincreasing irrigation, and technological advances in water retention and irrigation application. In\nTexas, we may see a shift to more cotton acreage, as cotton can tolerate more heat than grain crops\nand has a wider time frame for planting and harvesting, which is beneficial in times of flooding.\nBesides increased hurricane intensity and greater risk of drought, climate change may have\nadditional impacts that could affect our district. Increased temperatures are likely to have an\nadverse effect on people’s health and quality of life.68 They will likely lead to increased water\n14\n\nevaporation and soil moisture deterioration, as well as aquifer drawdowns.69 Increased ocean\nacidity and warming will affect aquatic life, impacting the commercial and recreational fishing\nindustries along the Gulf Coast.70\nConclusion\nThe purpose of this appendix has been to lay out key elements of the National Climate Assessment\nand discuss some of the potential implications of severe weather events for the Eleventh District.\nDallas Fed economists will continue to carefully monitor and consider the impact of climate\nchange on economic and financial conditions in the district and the nation.\n15\n\nNotes\n1 Federal Open Market Committee statement, Federal Reserve Board of Governors press release, June 19,\n2019.\n2 Data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Federal Reserve Board and Haver Analytics.\nHousehold debt is from the Federal Reserve Board’s flow of funds series and is defined as households\nand nonprofit organizations; debt securities and loans; liability.\n3 Data are from the BEA.\n4 Texas Business Outlook Surveys, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, June 24, 2019.\n5 See “Business Debt and Our Dynamic Financial System,” speech by Jerome H.

The logic supporting\nthe Phillips curve is that when there are lots of unfilled jobs and few unemployed workers (i.e., a tight\nlabor market with little slack), employers will have to offer higher wages, boosting inflation, and vice\nversa.\n19 Data are from the Database of Global Economic Indicators, Haver Analytics and Consensus Forecasts.\nCalculations are based on a representative sample of 40 countries, aggregated using gross domestic\nproduct at PPP (purchasing power parity) weights on an annual average basis.\n20 Data are calculated as a four-quarter moving average as of first quarter 2019.

    "text": "Assessment of Current Economic Conditions\nand Implications for Monetary Policy\nRobert S. Kaplan\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nDallas\nMay 22, 2017\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAssessment of Current Economic Conditions\nand Implications for Monetary Policy\nRobert S. Kaplan\nAs you know, at its May meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to leave the federal\nfunds rate unchanged at a range of 75 to 100 basis points. I believe that this action is consistent\nwith an approach of removing accommodation only in a gradual and patient manner, based on\nour ongoing assessment of economic conditions.\nThe purpose of this essay is to provide a synopsis of my current views regarding economic\nconditions in the U.S. and globally, and my thoughts regarding the appropriate stance of U.S.\nmonetary policy.\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. The\nEleventh District is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas\naccounts for 8.8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).1 It is the largest exporting state\nin the U.S. and is home to 52 Fortune 500 companies. The characteristics of our district give the\nDallas Fed unique insights into energy, trade and immigration issues, as well as great insight into\nthe regional, national and global economies.\nWith that background, let me begin with a discussion of energy, given its importance to the\nEleventh District as well as the nation and the world.\nEnergy\nIt is the view of our economists at the Dallas Fed that we are in the midst of a fragile equilibrium\nregarding global oil supply and demand.\nBased on the expectation that global daily oil demand will grow, on average, at approximately\n1.3 million barrels per day, we estimate that global consumption and production of oil will move\ninto rough balance sometime in 2017. This balancing process has been helped by the\nimplementation of the December 2016 agreement between OPEC and certain non-OPEC nations\nto decrease production levels by as much as 1.8 million barrels per day.\nThe fragility comes from the fact that, while OPEC has agreed to reduce production levels, U.S.\noil production is increasing for the first time in over two years. Since the fall of 2016, U.S. oil\nproduction has risen from a low of approximately 8.6 million barrels per day to approximately\n9.2 million barrels a day currently. It is our estimate that U.S. production will increase to\napproximately 9.7 million barrels per day by year-end 2017. The question is whether OPEC\nmembers, and other oil-producing nations, will stick to their commitments to reduce production\n2\n\nin the face of steadily rising U.S. production. This fragile balancing process is happening in the\ncontext of record levels of excess global oil inventories.\nAssuming that OPEC and non-OPEC countries extend their production agreements, as we\nexpect, our economists anticipate excess inventory levels should begin to consistently decline\nsometime later this year. Based on the expectation that the market will unfold in this manner, I\nwould expect continued price volatility but within a roughly stable band of the mid-$40s to the\nmid-$50s for the remainder of 2017.\nBased on these price expectations, our latest Dallas Fed Energy Survey reports a notable increase\nin plans for capital spending in 2017 by exploration and production firms. We observe that the\nbulk of these spending plans are focused on shale production and are likely to involve investment\nin technologies that will create greater production efficiencies. Survey participants report that, in\na number of locations, current market prices are sufficiently above breakeven levels to encourage\nfurther rig count growth, particularly in the Permian Basin.\nMany of our recent discussions with industry contacts continue to be focused on the substantial\npotential supply upside of the Permian Basin in the years ahead. The Permian Basin has oil-\nbearing deposits that are layered, allowing multiple horizontal wells to run off a single well pad\nand much higher resource recovery per acre. The Permian currently produces approximately 2.3\nmillion barrels per day.2 With technological advances, many of our contacts believe that the\nPermian can expand production substantially in the years ahead. As a result, we expect that\nmajor oil companies, in the near term, may continue to avoid large long-lived capital projects\nand will, instead, focus their capital spending on more flexible and shorter life-cycle shale\nopportunities in the U.S.\nThe District\nAided in part by improvement in the state’s energy sector, Dallas Fed economists expect Texas\njob growth of approximately 2 to 2.5 percent in 2017, the strongest rate in three years. Our\nbusiness surveys suggest improving conditions in the state’s manufacturing sector as well as\ncontinued strength in services.\nTexas continues to benefit from the migration (as well as immigration) of people and firms to the\nstate. Aided by this trend, the state’s economy has become increasingly diversified. The\npopulation of Texas is estimated to have grown from approximately 22.8 million in 2005 to\nalmost 28 million in 2016.3 Based on these trends, and as the energy sector continues to\nstrengthen and recover, Dallas Fed economists are optimistic about the growth prospects for\nTexas and the Eleventh District in the months and years ahead.\nAgainst this optimistic backdrop, I am cognizant that U.S. trade policy decisions could impact\nour outlook. In particular, we believe that U.S. trading and cross-border investment relationships\nwith Mexico are important to enhancing job growth and competitiveness in the U.S. as well as\neconomic growth in the Eleventh District.\n3\n\nMexico is the top destination for Texas exports. Manufactured goods exports supported, directly\nand indirectly, an estimated 1 million jobs in Texas in 2015, equal to 8.2 percent of the state’s\nemployment.4 In 2016, Texas exports to Mexico were $92.7 billion. Dallas Fed economists\nbelieve that the trading relationship with Mexico has helped various industries in Texas5 (as well\nas the U.S.) gain global competitiveness. If this trading relationship were severely weakened, it’s\nour judgment that the U.S. would lose competiveness and that jobs would be lost to other parts of\nthe world, particularly Asia. In addition, Texas border cities have benefited tremendously from\nthe increasing U.S.–Mexico economic integration—leading to job gains, primarily in service\nsectors, that have resulted in higher wages and improved standards of living for many Texans.6\nThe U.S.\nGDP in the U.S. is estimated to have grown at a 0.7 percent rate in the first quarter of 2017. This\ndisappointing level of growth was due to weak growth in consumer spending as well as a\nsignificant inventory deceleration.\nDespite this poor start to the year, our Dallas Fed economists expect GDP growth of\napproximately 2.25 percent in 2017. The key underpinning of our forecast is our expectation of a\nstrong U.S. consumer. The U.S. consumer has spent the past nine years deleveraging from record\nlevels of debt to GDP and is today in relatively good financial shape and, as a result, has capacity\nto spend.\nIn addition to a strong consumer, we also expect GDP growth in 2017 to be bolstered by some\nimprovement in the level of nonresidential fixed business investment. We expect that our\nestimate of GDP growth, while sluggish by historical standards, will be sufficient to remove\nremaining slack from the labor market.\nPotential changes in fiscal policy and structural reforms have the potential to provide upside to\nthis forecast. However, I am also closely monitoring the potential negative effects of policies that\ncould reduce the affordability of and access to health care, and policies that could negatively\ninfluence the spending habits of immigrants who reside in the U.S. Policy uncertainty in these\nkey areas and the rhetoric associated with the public debate regarding these potential policies\nbear watching as our economists assess the propensity of consumers to spend versus save.\nUnemployment\nWe are making good progress toward reaching our full-employment objective. The most recent\nApril jobs report showed an increase of 211,000 jobs and a decline in the headline\nunemployment rate to 4.4 percent. This report is consistent with the three-, six- and nine-month\naverage gains of approximately 180,000 new jobs per month. As we move forward, I would not\n4\n\nbe surprised if the average rate of job growth slowed somewhat, consistent with a declining level\nof labor slack in the economy.\nIn addition to the headline unemployment rate, my economic team looks at several measures of\nlabor market slack, including estimates of discouraged workers and people working part time for\neconomic reasons (otherwise known as U-6 unemployment), as well as the labor force\nparticipation rate.\nU-6 unemployment (see chart below) now stands at 8.6 percent, which compares with a\nprerecession low of 8.1 percent. Looking at this historical data suggests to me that we are\nmoving very close to full employment in the U.S.\nUnemployment at or Near Prerecession Levels\nPercent*\n18\nU-6 unemployment rate\n16\nHeadline unemployment rate\n14\n12\nApr-17\n10\n8.6\n8\n6\n4.4\n4\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n*Seasonally adjusted.\nNOTES: U-6 is the total unemployed, plus marginally attached workers and total employed part time for\neconomic reasons. The shaded bar indicates an NBER recession.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).\nIn addition to U-6, we also closely look at the labor force participation rate, which now stands at\n62.9 percent. This compares with a participation rate of 66 percent in 2007. Our economists\nbelieve that a majority of the decline in participation is due to the aging of the population. This\naging trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as across almost all advanced economies.\nOver the next 10 years, we estimate that, due to aging of the workforce, the U.S. participation\nrate will decline to below 61 percent.7\n5\n\nThe net impact of this aging trend has been, and is likely to be in the future, a reduction in the\nrate of labor force growth. You can see from the chart (below) that, beginning in the 2000s,\npopulation growth among those 20 to 64 years old has outpaced overall labor force growth. This\ntrend has been due to a steadily increasing percentage of the 55–64 population within the 20–64\nage range as well as a slowdown in the rate at which women have been entering the workforce.\nDallas Fed economists expect these trends to continue as we head toward the 2020s.\nBecause GDP growth is comprised of growth in the workforce plus gains in productivity, weaker\nexpected workforce growth trends will likely have significant negative implications for potential\nGDP growth in the years ahead—unless we take steps to mitigate these effects.\nDeclining Rates of Labor Force and Population Growth\nPercent change, annualized\n3.0\n2.71\nLabor force, 20-64 years old\n2.5\n2.05 Population, 20-64 years old\n1.95\n2.0\n1.5 1.37\n1.27\n1.16\n1.11\n1.0 0.84\n0.51e\n0.5 0.37e\n0.26e\n0.0\n1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s 2020s\nNOTE: “e” denotes an estimated value.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics through April 2017 for labor force growth data; Census Bureau\nfor historical and estimated population growth\ndata from 1970s through 2020s.\nTackling the Skills Gap in the U.S.\nWhen we look at measures of discouraged workers and those who are working part time for\neconomic reasons, I would note the high correlation between participation rates (as well as\nunemployment rates) and levels of educational attainment. The labor force participation rate for\nprime-age workers is approximately 88 percent for college graduates and 81 percent for those\nwho have attended some college. However, prime-age worker participation is only 76 percent for\nthose with a high school diploma and only 66 percent for those who have less than a high school\ndiploma.\n6\n\nOur economists at the Dallas Fed believe that the skills gap in the U.S. is substantial. The\nNational Federation of Independent Business reports that as of April 2017, 48 percent of small\nbusinesses indicated that they were unable to find qualified applicants to fill job openings. CEOs\nreport difficulty in hiring workers for middle-class-wage jobs such as nurses, construction\nworkers, truck drivers, oilfield workers, automotive technicians, industrial technicians, heavy\nequipment operators, computer network support specialists, web developers and insurance\nspecialists. When these types of jobs go unfilled, U.S. businesses expand more slowly and the\nnation’s growth is impeded.\nThis is why I have been regularly talking about the need for the U.S. to do much more to beef up\npublic/private partnerships that focus on skills training in order to help workers attain the skills\nneeded to find employment in the 21st-century economy. We also need to invest in programs that\nimprove early-childhood literacy and generally enhance the level of educational attainment\namong our younger population. Both of these types of initiatives have the added benefit of\nhelping to potentially reduce income inequality by creating broader workforce productivity gains\nand prosperity.\nInflation\nProgress toward reaching our 2 percent inflation objective has been slow over the past several\nyears. I believe this has likely been due to a rising dollar and weaker energy prices, as well as a\nnumber of persistent secular forces, such as globalization and technology-enabled disruption (see\n“Broader Secular Trends” below).\nTwelve-month measures of headline and core inflation fell in March. Inflation readings, to date,\nfor April show further weakness. While I believe that these recent readings are likely not\nindicative of a weakening trend, I intend to be patient and open minded in assessing upcoming\ndata releases in this regard.\nIn order to analyze inflation trends, our economists look at headline inflation but also track\nseveral measures of core inflation. In particular, Dallas Fed economists closely monitor our\nDallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate (see chart below). This measure trims out the most\nextreme upward and downward monthly price movements and, our economists believe,\nrepresents a more reliable indicator of the trend of inflation. This measure gradually increased\nfrom 1.7 to 1.8 percent through most of 2016 and ran at approximately 1.6 percent in 2015.\nThrough March, it is running at approximately 1.8 percent on a 12-month basis after having\ntouched 1.9 percent in January and February. The gradual upward trend of this measure has\ngiven me confidence that, as slack continues to be removed from the labor market, headline\ninflation should reach, or exceed, the Fed’s 2 percent longer-run objective in the medium term. I\nwill be closely watching this measure in the months ahead in order to confirm that we are\ncontinuing to make progress in reaching our inflation objective.\n7\n\nTrimmed Mean Inflation Captures Headline Inflation’s Medium-Term Trend\nPercent change, year/year\n2.5\nMar-17\n2.0\n1.83\n1.81\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\nHeadline PCE\nTrimmed Mean PCE\n0.0\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\nNOTE: The dashed line represents the Federal Open Market Committee's 2 percent inflation target.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Economic Analysis; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nNon-U.S.\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team closely monitors economic\ndevelopments outside the U.S. to evaluate how these developments might impact economic\ngrowth domestically. In this regard, we are closely watching the impact of Brexit on the U.K.\nand European economies as well as monitoring new developments in Europe. At this stage, I\nbelieve that the impact of Brexit is likely to be manageable for the U.S., although we are\ncontinuing to carefully monitor political developments and other policy decisions that could\ncreate a risk of contagion among other European countries.\nWe also monitor emerging-market countries, particularly China. China has a high degree of\novercapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises) and high and growing levels of debt. The\nnation is also in the midst of a multiyear transition from being a manufacturing- and export-\ndriven economy to one that is based on consumer spending and services. This transition is likely\nto take many years, and the world is going to have to become accustomed to lower rates of\nChinese growth. In the meantime, China has worked to manage capital outflows and currency\nvolatility. As we saw in the first quarter of 2016, this situation has the potential to create periods\nof financial market volatility and lead to bouts of tightening in global financial conditions, which\ncould, in turn, slow economic growth in the U.S.\n8\n\nBroader Secular Trends\nIn addition to monitoring cyclical trends, my economic research team carefully considers and\nworks to understand several key secular drivers. As I have emphasized over the past year, these\ndrivers are likely having a powerful influence on unfolding economic conditions.\nI have particularly focused on four key secular drivers:\n• Aging-workforce demographics in the U.S. and across major economies. As discussed\nearlier, aging-population trends, on balance, reduce labor force participation rates and\nultimately create headwinds for potential GDP growth. These demographic trends are\nalso likely to impact the “dependency ratio”8—that is, they are likely to lead to a situation\nin which an increasing share of the population is depending on those of working age to\npay for future medical and retirement benefits. These trends are likely to exacerbate the\nissues regarding the sustainability of U.S. government fiscal obligations (discussed\nfurther below).\n• Limits to the sustainability of the so-called global debt super cycle. Historically, the U.S.\nand other countries have used increasing debt—often through tax cuts and increased\ngovernment spending—to boost economic growth. At this point, there are likely limits to\nthe ability of countries, including the U.S., to further increase debt to GDP in order to\ngenerate higher levels of economic growth. As I discussed earlier in this essay, we have\nseen a deleveraging of the U.S. household sector since 2008. This has likely created some\nheadwinds for economic growth over the past several years. The good news is that the\nhousehold sector is in much better shape today. However, while household balance sheets\nhave improved since the Great Recession, government debt held by the public stands at\napproximately 76 percent of GDP (see chart below), and the present value of future\nunfunded entitlements is now estimated at $46 trillion.9 These obligations will\nincreasingly work their way into U.S. budget deficits over the next five to 10 years—\nraising questions regarding fiscal sustainability which, if not addressed, could negatively\nimpact longer-run economic growth.\n9\n\nGovernment Debt Levels Have Climbed Significantly\nPercent\n80 Q1:2017\n76\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\nFederal debt\n20\nheld by the\npublic as a\n10\npercent of GDP\n0\n1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\nNOTES: Debt held by the public excludes intragovernmental holdings. The shaded bars indicate NBER\nrecessions.\nSOURCES: U.S. Treasury; Bureau of Economic Analysis; National Bureau of Economic Research\n(NBER).\n• Globalization. Economies, financial markets and companies are more closely intertwined\nthan ever before. For example, regarding trade, estimates indicate that approximately 40\npercent of the content of U.S. imports from Mexico is of U.S. origin.10 This is because\nmuch of this trade is related to integrated supply chains and logistical arrangements\nbetween U.S. and Mexican companies. As mentioned earlier, it is our view at the Dallas\nFed that these arrangements have helped improve U.S. competitiveness and created jobs\nin the U.S. Without these arrangements, these jobs might have otherwise been lost to\nother areas of the world, particularly Asia.\nWhile trade and globalization have yielded net economic benefits for the U.S. economy,\nthey have also created severe local hardships that the U.S. and other advanced economies\nhave struggled to address. The challenge is how to reap the benefits of globalization\nwhile addressing the disruptions it creates—failing to do so is likely to have negative\nimplications for trade and the pace of economic growth in the U.S. and globally.\n• Technology-enabled disruption. In order to improve their competiveness, many\ncompanies are actively investing in technology, which is leading to a significant\nreduction in the number of workers needed to produce goods and services. The result is\nthat U.S. workers across a range of industries are finding their jobs being eliminated.\n10\n\nMany industries are facing a disruptive competitor that is offering lower-cost goods or\nservices. Think the digital camera versus the old film industry, Amazon versus retail\nstores, Kahn Academy versus brick-and-mortar schools, 3-D printing versus traditional\nmanufacturing, Uber versus taxis and so on. This technology-enabled disruption has\nallowed consumers to achieve better value and more easily shop for merchandise and\nservices in a way that lets them easily choose the lowest price. It has also reduced the\npricing power of many companies and caused them to intensify their focus on creating\ngreater operational efficiencies.\nI believe that the dislocations resulting from technology-enabled disruption are\nsometimes confused with the impacts of globalization. This is a powerful trend, apart\nfrom globalization, which may help explain why the rate of employment among prime-\nage workers in the U.S. has not recovered to prerecession levels. It may also help explain\nwhy companies have been more hesitant to make capacity expansion decisions as well as\ninvest in major capital projects.\nIn light of these secular trends and the sluggish economic growth over the past several years, I\nhave been speaking the past several months about the need for structural reforms and fiscal\npolicy to join the menu of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address\nthe key structural challenges we face today stemming from changing demographic trends and\nlower levels of productivity growth, as well as dislocations created by globalization and\nincreasing rates of technology-enabled disruption. While monetary policy has a key role to play,\nit is not a substitute for structural reforms and other actions that could address deeper\nfundamental challenges.\nThe primary prism I use to judge new structural reforms and potential fiscal policies is whether\nthey help grow the labor force and/or improve productivity growth in the U.S. GDP growth is\ncomprised of these two components, and I believe potential new policies should be judged in the\ncontext of whether they create sustainable improvement in these measures.\nThe Current Stance of Monetary Policy\nAs I mentioned earlier in this essay, I believe that we are making good progress in accomplishing\nour dual-mandate objectives of full employment and price stability. However, I am cognizant\nthat progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal has been slow and, at times, uneven. I intend to\nbe patient in critically assessing upcoming data to evaluate whether we are continuing to make\nprogress in reaching our inflation objective.\nI have consistently stated that I believe there is a cost to excessive accommodation in terms of\nlimiting returns to savers, as well as creating distortions and imbalances in investing, hiring and\nother business decisions. Monetary policy accommodation is not costless. It has been my\nexperience that significant imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very\npainful to address.\n11\n\nHowever, I also believe that the key secular drivers discussed earlier in this essay will continue\nto pose challenges for economic growth. As a result, my view is that the neutral rate, the rate at\nwhich we are neither accommodative nor restrictive, is likely to be much lower than we are\nhistorically accustomed.\nBased on these considerations, I have argued that future removals of accommodation should be\ndone in a gradual and patient manner. In that regard, I continue to believe that three rate\nincreases for 2017, including the March increase, is an appropriate baseline case for the near-\nterm path of the federal funds rate.\n“Gradual and patient” means to me that I need to be open to assessing incoming economic\ninformation in order to update my analysis regarding the appropriate stance of economic policy. I\nwill avoid being rigid or unduly predetermined in my views. If I see information that suggests\nthe economy is developing more slowly than I expect, then the pace of rate increases could be\nslower than my baseline path, and if economic growth is stronger than I expect, the pace of\nincreases could be faster.\nIn addition, as we make further progress in removing accommodation, I believe we should begin\nthe process of gradually reducing the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. I think it will\nlikely be appropriate to begin this process sometime later this year.\nNotes\n1 Bureau of Economic Analysis, Fourth Quarter 2016.\n2 Based on the Drilling Productivity Report, Energy Information Administration, May 15, 2017.\n3 Census Bureau.\n4 “Texas Border Cities Illustrate Benefits and Challenges of Trade,” by Jesus Cañas, Federal Reserve\nBank of Dallas Southwest Economy, Fourth Quarter, 2016.

Th e economy is also being impacted\nby the waning of fi scal stimulus.

My concern emanates from my belief that an inverted\ncurve ultimately makes it more diffi cult for fi nancial intermediaries to borrow short and lend long—and, if\nthe inversion persists, it would likely begin to impede the creation of credit and lead to a tightening of fi nan-\ncial conditions.

    "text": "Where We Stand:\nAssessment of Economic Conditions\nand Implications for Monetary Policy\nRobert S. Kaplan\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nAugust 21, 2018\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jennifer Chamberlain, Jim Dolmas, Marc Giannoni, James\nHoard, Evan Koenig, Karel Mertens, Pia Orrenius, Kunal Patel, William Simmons, Irfan Taj, Kathy Thacker, Joe Tracy,\nMark Wynne and Mine Yücel in preparing these remarks.\n\nWhere We Stand: Assessment of Economic Conditions\nand Implications for Monetary Policy\nRobert S. Kaplan\nIn our most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the committee agreed to keep the\nfederal funds rate in a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. Our August 1 statement characterized the current\nstance of monetary policy as “accommodative” and described growth in economic activity and\nemployment as “strong.”\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. The Eleventh\nDistrict is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas accounts for\napproximately 8.8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and 8.4 percent of U.S. nonfarm\nemployment. It is the largest energy-producing state in the U.S. as well as the nation’s largest\nexporting state.1 It is home to approximately 50 Fortune 500 companies and numerous industry-\nleading small and mid-sized firms. The characteristics of our district give the Dallas Fed unique\ninsight into energy, trade and immigration issues as well as great insight into the regional, national\nand global economies.\nThe purpose of this essay is to discuss economic conditions in the Eleventh District and the U.S. I\nwill also discuss the implications of this assessment for the stance of monetary policy in the U.S.\nEconomic Conditions\nThe Eleventh District\nTexas jobs increased at an annualized rate of approximately 3.2 percent for the first seven months\nof 2018. This rate of job growth is estimated to be the second-highest of any state in the nation.\nDallas Fed economists expect Texas jobs to increase nearly 3 percent for the full-year 2018. This\nstrong rate of growth is broad based geographically and across industries. While growth is highly\ndiversified, the energy sector is adding jobs at a faster rate than any other industry. Our Texas\nBusiness Outlook Surveys lend further evidence to continued widespread and broad-based\nexpansion.2\nThe Texas economy continues to benefit from domestic migration (as well as immigration) of\npeople and the movement of firms to the state. Aided by this trend, the state’s economy has become\nincreasingly diversified and its population continues to grow rapidly. The population of Texas is\nnow approaching approximately 29 million. This population growth has been associated with\nfaster workforce growth than in other states in the U.S., which has helped fuel the district’s very\nstrong rate of economic growth.\nEnergy Industry. Due to the significant industrial diversification in the state, the energy industry\nnow accounts for approximately 9.4 percent of Texas GDP. The state’s energy production,\ntransmission and refining industries have expanded considerably over the past few years. Due to\n\nsubstantial growth in the Permian Basin, the United States is now producing approximately 10.7\nmillion barrels of oil per day (mb/d) and is expected to produce approximately 11.2 mb/d by the\nend of 2018.3 This compares with current production in Russia of approximately 11.2 mb/d and in\nSaudi Arabia of 10.4 mb/d.4 Texas is the largest oil-producing state in the U.S. and accounts for a\nsignificant percentage of U.S. production growth. The state is expected to produce approximately\n4.7 mb/d by year-end. As a geographic entity, Texas would be the fourth-largest oil producer in\nthe world.5\nDallas Fed economists believe that global oil supply and demand are now in rough balance. Due\nto growth in global demand for oil, lack of investment in long-lived production projects over the\npast several years, and various production constraints (particularly pipeline capacity, worker\nshortages and other infrastructure challenges) in the Permian Basin as well as outages due to\ngeopolitical issues (e.g., Iran and Venezuela), we believe that we are more likely to move to a\nglobal undersupply situation in the years ahead—with oil price risk tilted to the upside. These\nelements underpin our forecasts that Texas oil production, even with constraints, will grow\nsubstantially over the next several years.\nThe Outlook. Based on all these factors, Dallas Fed economists are optimistic about the prospects\nfor Eleventh District growth in the short and medium term. However, worker shortages as well as\nU.S. trade policy, particularly regarding NAFTA, are issues that could negatively impact the\noutlook. Research by Dallas Fed economists indicates that the U.S. trading relationship with\nMexico is substantially an “intermediate goods” relationship—part of integrated supply chain and\nlogistics relationships that allow U.S.-domiciled companies to keep jobs in this country and\nincrease their global competitiveness.6 It is our view that without these trading relationships, the\nU.S. would likely lose market share to other countries, particularly in Asia. Based on this research,\nwe are very hopeful that NAFTA will ultimately be modernized and that the basic elements of this\ntrading relationship will be reaffirmed in a new NAFTA agreement.\nU.S. Economy\nU.S. GDP is estimated to have grown at a 3.1 percent annual rate over the first half of 2018. Rising\nconsumer spending accounted for a little less than half of this growth, and unusually strong\ncontributions from nonresidential business investment (approximately 1.2 percentage points) and\nnet exports (approximately 0.5 percentage points) also contributed to growth. Dallas Fed\neconomists forecast full-year GDP growth of approximately 3 percent. Based on this forecast, we\nexpect the headline unemployment rate to reach 3.7 percent by year-end. In addition, we expect\nthat headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation will remain in the neighborhood\nof the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target during the remainder of 2018.\nThe unemployment rate currently stands at 3.9 percent. Despite job growth averaging 224,000 per\nmonth over the past three months, the unemployment rate remains the same as in April due to a\nstrong flow of net entrants into the labor force. While our economists are hopeful that a strong\nlabor market might continue to draw in new entrants who are currently out of the workforce, it is\nour base-case view that the current rate of labor force growth is unlikely to continue and that the\nunemployment rate will continue to decline, reaching 3.5 percent by the second quarter of 2019.\n2\n\nIn short, it is our judgment that we are in a tight labor market and are already past the level of full\nemployment in the U.S. This tightness is likely to increasingly constrain economic growth.\nCurrently, the headline PCE inflation rate stands at approximately 2.2 percent for the 12 months\nending June 2018. As mentioned earlier, Dallas Fed economists expect inflation to remain around\nthe Federal Reserve’s longer-run PCE inflation target of 2 percent through the end of the year. The\nDallas Fed tracks a number of measures beyond headline inflation to gauge overall inflation trends.\nIn particular, Dallas Fed economists have developed the Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate, which\nis a core inflation measure that, each month, excludes the most extreme upward and downward\nprice movements. This measure now stands at 1.9 percent, and we expect it to reach 2 percent by\nthe end of 2018.\nDue to the tight labor market as well as higher input costs, it is my view that cyclical forces are\ncreating upward pressure on inflation. However, I also believe that strong structural forces\n(discussed below)—particularly automation and globalization—are helping to mute the\ninflationary impact of these cyclical forces. These crosscurrents are worth keeping in mind as we\ncontinue to consider the appropriate stance of monetary policy.\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nBased on this forecast, it is my judgment that the Federal Reserve is meeting its full employment\nand price stability objectives. As such, we should be removing accommodation in a gradual\nmanner in order to get to a neutral policy stance.\nThe Neutral Rate\nThe neutral rate of interest is the federal funds rate at which monetary policy is neither\naccommodative nor restrictive. It is a theoretical concept, meaning that it can’t be directly\nobserved—it must be inferred from market and other economic data. Economists’ views on this\nrate are necessarily estimates and inherently uncertain. However, while theoretical, estimates of\nthe neutral rate are critical to assessing and making decisions regarding the stance of monetary\npolicy.\nMy own view, informed by the work of my colleagues Evan Koenig at the Dallas Fed7 as well as\nJohn Williams of the New York Fed and Thomas Laubach at the Federal Reserve Board,8 is that\nthe longer-run neutral real rate of interest is in a broad range around 0.50 to 0.75 percent, or a\nnominal rate of roughly 2.50 to 2.75 percent.\nWith the current fed funds rate at 1.75 to 2 percent, it would take approximately three or four more\nfederal funds rate increases of a quarter of a percent to get into the range of this estimated neutral\nlevel.\nAt this stage, I believe the Federal Reserve should be gradually raising the fed funds rate until we\nreach this neutral level. At that point, I would be inclined to step back and assess the outlook for\nthe economy and look at a range of other factors—including the levels and shape of the Treasury\nyield curve—before deciding what further actions, if any, might be appropriate.\n3\n\nBeyond 2018\nDallas Fed economists have consistently forecast that 2018 will be a strong year for economic\ngrowth in the U.S. Reasons include a strong consumer sector, improved prospects for business\ninvestment due to tax incentives, solid global growth and substantial fiscal stimulus due to recent\ntax legislation and budget agreements.\nMy economic team has consistently cautioned that while 2018 will be strong, economic growth is\nlikely to moderate in 2019 and 2020 as the impact of fiscal stimulus wanes and monetary policy\napproaches a more neutral stance. Their view has been that potential GDP growth in the U.S. is in\nthe range of 1.75 to 2 percent and actual real GDP growth will likely reach this level by 2020 or\n2021.\nOur economists at the Dallas Fed believe that potential GDP growth is likely to be more muted\nthan we have historically experienced due to the impact of four key structural drivers:\n1. Demographics\nThe U.S. population is aging. The median age of the population has gone from 35.3 years in 2000\nto 38.0 in 2017.9 The share of population 65 years or older has risen to 16.1 percent from 12.8\npercent 10 years ago. Chart 1 shows the ongoing trend of aging population—leading to declines\nin labor force growth rates and contributing to slowing population growth in the U.S.\nChart 1\nLabor Force and Working-Age Population Growth Rates Declining\nPercent change,annualized\nLabor force, 20-64 years old\n3.0\nPopulation, 20-64 years old\n2.71\n2.5\n2.05\n1.95\n2.0\n1.5 1.37\n1.27\n1.16\n1.11\n1.0\n0.84\n0.5 0.37e\n0.44e\n0.39e\n0.29e\n0.0\n1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s 2020s\nNOTE: “e” denotes an estimated value.\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics(2018–2026 growth rates from the 2017 Employment Projections report; 2020sestimates only through 2026).\n4\n\nGDP growth is made up of growth in the workforce plus the rate of improvement in labor\nproductivity. If workforce growth is slowing—unless we can make up for it through improvements\nin labor productivity—we will see lower rates of potential GDP growth. This slower potential GDP\ngrowth is crucial because it has significant implications for future living standards in the U.S.\nBecause the projected path of government debt to GDP is historically elevated, higher rates of\ngrowth will be needed to service and pay off this debt and meet future entitlement obligations.\nFurthermore, the labor force participation rate has declined from 66 percent in 2007 to\napproximately 63 percent today. Dallas Fed economists believe the bulk of this decline is due to\naging of the workforce. In fact, we expect this trend to continue so that the labor force participation\nrate should decline to 61 percent over the next 10 years.10 A declining fraction of the population\nparticipating in the workforce should lead to lower output growth.\n2. Lagging Education and Skill Levels\nIt is my view that lagging education and skill levels in the U.S. are likely having a negative impact\non productivity growth despite substantial innovations in technology and increased business\ninvestment.\nWhile we have witnessed very rapid technological change and improvements, productivity growth\nhas remained sluggish. Output per worker grew on average by approximately 1.9 percent per year\nin the 1990s, slowed to 1.4 percent in the 2000s and has slowed further to 1.0 percent since 2010.\nOur hypothesis at the Dallas Fed is that advancements in technology are having a profound impact\non the workforce. This, in turn, is putting a premium on education and skill levels in order to\nimprove workforce adaptability. A case in point is the changing nature of middle-skills jobs.\nIf you are one of the 46 million workers in this country with a high school education or less, or\nhave a “routine” type of middle-skills job, you are likely finding that your job is being either\nrestructured or eliminated as a result of technology. These workers may find another job in a strong\njob market, but unless they have gotten retrained, they are likely to see constraints on growth in\ntheir income and productivity. This may be one reason we haven’t seen a bigger productivity-\ngrowth payoff from recent advances in technology. Productivity growth that has occurred does not\nappear to have benefited all workers; those workers with less education may be finding their real\nwages and productivity declining in a new age where skills training and educational achievement\nlevels are increasingly critical to adapting to the job market.\nIt is important to recognize that various research studies highlight that skill levels and educational\nachievement levels of the U.S. workforce have lagged those of other developed countries for the\npast several years. In surveys of 29 participating Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD) countries, the U.S. ranked 20th in assessments of adult literacy and math\nskills.11 In addition, according to recent OECD surveys, the U.S. ranked 24th out of 35 developed\ncountries in measures of math, science and reading skills among 15-year-olds.12\nResearch by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University with Ludger Woessmann of the University of\nMunich suggests that improvements in U.S. math and science skills could translate into meaningful\n5\n\nimprovements in potential GDP growth.13 While these efforts are likely to take years, they could\nhave substantial potential to improve future growth and prosperity in the U.S.\nAt the Dallas Fed, we believe that in order to address this powerful structural driver, the U.S. must\ndo more to improve early childhood literacy and college readiness and beef up skills training at\nour high schools and community colleges. These efforts are a powerful investment in improving\nthe quality of our human capital, which is essential to higher levels of GDP growth in the U.S.\n3. The Potentially Unsustainable Path of U.S. Government Debt to GDP\nPotentially unsustainable government debt growth in the U.S. is creating a fiscal tailwind in 2018\nand 2019 but may turn into a headwind if the U.S. takes steps to moderate its historically high\nexpected path of debt growth. Despite the fact that the current economic expansion is the second\nlongest in the postwar period, U.S. government debt held by the public now stands at 75.8 percent\nof GDP,14 and the present value of unfunded entitlements is estimated at approximately $54\ntrillion.15 The recent tax legislation and bipartisan budget compromise legislation are likely to\nexacerbate these issues. As a consequence of this level of debt, the U.S. is much less likely to have\nthe fiscal capacity to fight the next recession.\nFurther, high and rising levels of government debt as well as elevated levels of corporate debt\nmean that the U.S. economy is becoming much more interest rate sensitive. That is, increases in\ninterest rates would likely require a higher proportion of cash flow in order to service corporate\nand government debt obligations. Structural reforms and other actions that flatten the path of future\ngovernment debt growth may be advisable to keep this short-term-growth tailwind from becoming\na medium- and longer-term headwind to economic growth in the U.S.\n4. Globalization\nFailing to take advantage of the opportunities of globalization is likely to lower U.S. GDP relative\nto potential. With less than 5 percent of the world’s population,16 the U.S. faces growth capacity\nconstraints and has developed integrated supply chains and logistics arrangements in this\nhemisphere which have helped improve U.S. competitiveness. Dallas Fed economists believe it\nmakes sense to segment U.S. trading relationships into those which are primarily final goods\nversus intermediate goods. For example, our trade deficit with China is primarily final goods.\nConversely, our trading relationships with Mexico and Canada are primarily intermediate goods.\nAs mentioned earlier, intermediate-goods trading relationships are more indicative of integrated\nsupply chain and logistics arrangements which have allowed U.S. companies to add jobs and\nincrease their global competitiveness.\nIn addition, the U.S. has historically added to its workforce growth through immigration.\nImmigrants and their children have made up over half the workforce growth in the U.S. over the\npast two decades,17 and this proportion is likely to be even higher over the next two decades, as\nshown in Chart 2.\n6\n\nChart 2\nContribution of Immigration to Working-Age Population Growth\nNet change in working-age population (25–64), millions\n30\nNatives\n20 Children of immigrants\nImmigrants\n10.6\n15.1\n20.0\n0.3 4.8\n10\n13.3 2.4\n5.7\n10.8 7.9\n6.9 6.1\n3.8 3.5\n1.0 1.2\n0\n-2.5 -3.1 -1.8 -4.3 -3.8\n-10\n1965 to 1975 1975 to 1985 1985 to 1995 1995 to 2005 2005 to 2015 2015 to 2025 2025 to 2035\nSOURCE: Pew Research Center population estimates and projections (2016).\nDallas Fed research indicates that immigration generally contributes to a larger labor force, which\nhas benefits for economic growth.18 Our research also indicates that high-skilled immigration has\nbeen shown to positively influence productivity growth. Nearly half of college-educated\nimmigrants majored in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM). This far outpaces U.S.-\nborn college-educated workers, about one quarter of whom major in STEM fields. High-skilled\nforeign-born workers have also been shown to patent at higher rates than native workers, largely\nas a result of their concentration in the STEM fields.19 This type of innovative activity has been\nshown to be a key factor in U.S. productivity growth in the post-World War II period.20\nHow the U.S. navigates these globalization challenges will have critical impacts on potential GDP\ngrowth.\nWhere We Go from Here\nWhen I joined the Fed in September of 2015, the federal funds rate was 0.0 to 0.25 percent. This\nrate had not been adjusted since late 2008. The Fed’s balance sheet stood at approximately $4.5\ntrillion.\nSince that time, the Fed has been able to gradually remove accommodation and implement a plan\nto reduce the size of its balance sheet. Over this period, the unemployment rate has moved down\nsubstantially and inflation is now running at approximately 2 percent.\n7\n\nAt this juncture, the challenge for the Fed is to raise the federal funds rate in a gradual manner\ncalibrated to extend this expansion, but not so gradually as to get behind the curve so that we have\nto play catch-up and raise rates quickly. Having to raise rates quickly would likely increase the\nrisk of recession.\nAs I judge the pace at which we should be raising the federal funds rate, I will be carefully watching\nthe U.S. Treasury yield curve. Currently the one-year Treasury rate is 2.44 percent, the two-year\nis 2.61 percent and the 10-year is 2.87 percent.21 My own view is that the short end of the Treasury\ncurve is responding to Federal Reserve policy expectations. The longer end of the curve is telling\nme that, while there is substantial global liquidity and a search for safe assets, expectations for\nfuture growth are sluggish—and this is consistent with an expectation that U.S. growth will trend\nback down to potential. Overall, the shape of the curve suggests to me we are “late” in the\neconomic cycle. I do not discount the significance of an inverted yield curve—I believe it is worth\npaying attention to given the high historical correlation between inversions and recession.\nI will also be closely monitoring global financial and economic developments and their potential\nimpact on domestic financial and economic conditions. As global financial markets and economies\nhave become increasingly interconnected, the potential for spillovers to the U.S. is greater than in\nthe past. That is, global economic and financial instability has the potential to transmit to domestic\nfinancial markets, potentially leading to a tightening of financial conditions which, if prolonged,\ncould lead to a slowing in U.S. economic activity.\nBased on these various factors, as well as the current strength of the U.S. economy and my outlook\nfor economic conditions over the medium term, I believe it will be appropriate for the Fed to\ncontinue to gradually move toward a neutral monetary policy stance. I believe that this gradual\napproach to removing monetary policy accommodation will give us the best chance of managing\nagainst imbalances and further extending the current economic expansion in the U.S.\n8\n\nNotes\n1 Data are from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and Census Bureau,\nwww.eia.gov/state/rankings/#/series/101 and www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/2018pr/06/exh2s.pdf.\n2 The Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys can be found at www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys.aspx.\n3 International Energy Agency, as of July 2018.

    "text": "Impact of Hurricane Harvey and a Discussion\nof Key Structural Drivers Affecting U.S.\nMonetary Policy\nRobert S. Kaplan\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nOctober 2017\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, John Duca, Marc Giannoni, Evan Koenig,\nPia Orrenius, Keith Phillips, Jason Saving, William Simmons, Mark Wynne, and Mine Yucel in preparing these remarks.\n\nImpact of Hurricane Harvey and a Discussion of Key\nStructural Drivers Affecting U.S. Monetary Policy\nRobert S. Kaplan\nAt the September 2017 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced plans\nto begin the process of gradually reducing the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. I\nstrongly support the decision to begin the process of reducing the balance sheet. I believe that the\ngradual and phased-in design of this plan should allow the Fed to reduce the Treasury and\nmortgage-backed securities portfolios without materially impacting either of these important\nmarkets. In the September meeting, the committee also decided to leave the target federal funds\nrate in a range of 100 to 125 basis points but left open the possibility of gradual removals of\naccommodation (i.e., raises in the federal funds rate) in the future.\nThe purpose of this essay is to provide a synopsis of my current views regarding the economic\nimpact of Hurricane Harvey as well as economic conditions in the Eleventh District, U.S. and\nglobally. I will also discuss key structural drivers, such as aging demographics, high levels of\ngovernment debt to gross domestic product (GDP), globalization, and technology-enabled\ndisruption and their implications for U.S. monetary policy.\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. The\nEleventh District is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. Texas\naccounts for 8.8 percent of U.S. GDP1 and 8.4 percent of U.S. nonfarm employment.2 It is the\nlargest exporting state in the U.S. and is home to more than 50 Fortune 500 companies.3 The\ncharacteristics of our district give the Dallas Fed unique insights into energy, trade and\nimmigration issues, as well as great insight into the regional, national and global economies.\nWith that background, let me begin with a discussion of Hurricane Harvey and its impact on the\nEleventh District as well as the U.S.\nImpact of Hurricane Harvey\nThe Eleventh District is working to recover from the effects of Hurricane Harvey. It is our base-\ncase assumption that property damage from the storm is likely to be in the range of\napproximately $75-$100 billion. Most of this damage was due to flooding versus wind and other\nforms of hurricane damage. Of that amount, we estimate that approximately $45-$55 billion was\ndue to damage to residential property. In addition, approximately $16-$20 billion was due to\ncommercial property damage, approximately $10-$12 billion was due to vehicle damage and\nanother $6-$10 billion was due to infrastructure damage.4 Unfortunately, some substantial\npercentage of these losses will ultimately prove to be uninsured.\n2\n\nBefore the storm, the Dallas Fed estimated that multifamily rental housing in Houston had a\nrelatively high vacancy rate. Since the storm, because many displaced homeowners have elected\nto rent (if only temporarily), occupancy rates have risen substantially and the multifamily\noverhang appears to have been eliminated. Further, our contacts suggest that multifamily\ndeveloper/operators in Houston may accelerate their plans to build additional rental housing\ncapacity.\nWe expect some short-term job loss in the Gulf Coast region of Texas in the range of 55,000 to\n75,000 jobs. However, we believe that these losses will prove to be temporary.\nThe storm has also spurred substantial discussion of undocumented workers, in Houston\nspecifically and in Texas generally. It is estimated that approximately 575,000 undocumented\npeople live in the Greater Houston area.5 Our contacts estimate that a substantial percentage of\nconstruction workers in Houston are likely undocumented. In studying the aftermath of other\nsevere-weather events, we note that undocumented workers have historically been critical\nparticipants in the rebuilding and recovery effort.\nThere is significant concern about the potential failure rate of small businesses in Houston due to\nan extended period of business interruption and a significant amount of uninsured losses. In our\nDallas Fed September surveys, 58 percent of respondents who suffered Hurricane Harvey\ndamage reported physical capital losses that were uninsured, and 74 percent of hurricane-\nimpacted respondents reported lost revenue and/or production that was uninsured.6 We are\nmindful that banks will need to work with borrowers and make tough judgments regarding future\nbusiness viability in order to help the small business community weather this crisis.\nOf course, the Gulf Coast is home to a substantial concentration of refinery capacity and offshore\nproduction facilities. The refinery outages resulting from Harvey-related shutdowns temporarily\nimpacted oil inventories and gasoline prices. Our estimate is that the refinery industry came\nsubstantially back online by late September. Offshore production has more recently been\nimpacted by Hurricane Nate, which caused substantially all Gulf of Mexico oil production\nfacilities as well as two refineries to temporarily halt operations. While the full impact of the\nmost recent storm has yet to be determined, Dallas Fed economists believe it will likely have\nonly modest and temporary effects on refinery and production operations.\nThe recent hurricanes have not changed our basic outlook regarding global supply and demand\nfor oil. We continue to believe that we are in a fragile equilibrium over the next few years. While\nthere is certainly a risk that oil prices could break to the downside, the Dallas Fed’s baseline\nview is that there will be continued price volatility but within a band between the mid-$40s to the\nmid-$50s for the remainder of 2017 and 2018. Prices moving to the lower end of that range will\ntend to reduce prospective drilling activity, and prices moving to the higher end of that range will\ntend to encourage greater drilling activity.\nOur energy industry contacts continue to indicate that the bulk of their capital spending plans are\nfocused on shale oil production and involve investment in technologies that will create greater\nproduction efficiencies. Our recent Dallas Fed Energy Surveys suggest that the rate of growth in\n3\n\ncapital spending on shale oil production has slowed materially relative to earlier in the year.\nSurvey participants also continue to report that, in a number of locations, current market prices\nare above break-even drilling levels, particularly in the Permian Basin.\nOverall, we estimate that Hurricane Harvey reduced economic activity in the Eleventh District\nduring the third quarter of 2017. We expect that the fourth quarter will show a rebound in\neconomic activity that should more than offset the decline in the third quarter. Dallas Fed\neconomists expect Texas job growth of approximately 2.6 percent in 2017, the strongest rate in\nthree years. Our business outlook surveys suggest continued strong growth in the state’s\nmanufacturing sector as well as continued strength in services.\nOur study of the aftermath of previous severe storms gives us confidence that, after a period of\nweakness, Texas economic activity will “catch up” and return to previous rates of trend growth.\nOur confidence in this recovery is bolstered by the continued migration (as well as immigration)\nof people and firms to the state. Aided by this trend, the Texas economy has, over time, become\nincreasingly diversified. The population of Texas is estimated to have grown from approximately\n22.8 million in 2005 to almost 28 million in 2016.7 Based on these trends, and as the energy\nsector continues to stabilize and recover, Dallas Fed economists are optimistic about the growth\nprospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the months and years ahead.\nThe U.S.\nGDP in the U.S. is estimated to have grown at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter of 2017 and a\n3.1 percent rate in the second quarter. First-quarter GDP was negatively impacted by weak\nconsumer spending and a deceleration of net inventory investment. The strong second quarter\nwas primarily due to a rebound in consumer spending and a stabilization of inventory\ninvestment.\nOur Dallas Fed economists recently increased their forecast of U.S. GDP growth to\napproximately 2.4 percent in 2017. Embedded in this forecast is a likely drag on third-quarter\nGDP growth due to recent hurricanes. However, we expect a rebound in economic activity in the\nfourth quarter which should substantially offset hurricane-related impacts from the third quarter.\nThe key underpinning of our forecast is our expectation of a healthy U.S. consumer. The U.S.\nconsumer has spent the past nine years deleveraging from record levels of debt to GDP and is\ntoday in relatively good financial shape and, as a result, has capacity to spend.\nIn addition to a healthy consumer, we also expect GDP growth in 2017 will continue to be\nbolstered by some improvement in nonresidential fixed investment and international trade. We\nexpect that this rate of GDP growth, while sluggish by historical standards, should be sufficient\nto remove any remaining slack from the labor market.\nPotential changes in fiscal policy and structural reforms could provide upside to this forecast.\nHowever, it is also the case that U.S. policy regarding trade and immigration bears watching and\ncould have some negative impact on future rates of growth.\n4\n\nUnemployment and the Impact of Demographic Trends\nThe September jobs report showed a decrease of 33,000 in payroll employment. Our Dallas Fed\neconomists believe that the September report was significantly negatively impacted by recent\nhurricanes, and it will likely take some time to separate “signal” from “noise” in this report.\nEven with the weak September data, the year-to-date average monthly pace of job gains in 2017\nhas been approximately 148,000. This compares to an average of approximately 171,000 through\nAugust 2017 and 187,000 in 2016. As we move toward full employment, I would continue to\nexpect the average rate of job growth to slow, consistent with a declining level of labor slack in\nthe economy.\nIn addition to the most recent headline unemployment rate of 4.2 percent, my economic team\nlooks at several measures of labor market slack, including estimates of discouraged workers and\npeople working part time for economic reasons (otherwise known as U-6 unemployment), as\nwell as the labor force participation rate.\nU-6 unemployment (see chart below) stands at 8.3 percent, which is the lowest rate since June\n2007. Looking at this historical data suggests to me that we have moved very close to full\nemployment in the U.S.\nUnemployment At or Near Prerecession Levels\nPercent*\n18\nU-6 unemployment rate\n16\nHeadline unemployment rate\n14\n12\n10\nSep-17\n8.3\n8\n6\n4.2\n4\n2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\n*Seasonally adjusted.\nNOTES: U-6 is the total unemployed, plus marginally attached workers and total employed part time for economic reasons. The shaded barindicates an NBER\nrecession.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics; National Bureauof Economic Research (NBER).\n5\n\nIn addition to U-6, we also closely look at the labor force participation rate, which now stands at\n63.1 percent. This compares with a participation rate of 66 percent in 2007. Our economists\nbelieve that a majority of the decline in participation is due to the aging of the population. This\naging trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as across almost all advanced economies.\nOver the next 10 years, we expect that, due to aging of the workforce, the U.S. participation rate\nwill decline to below 61 percent.8\nThe likely net impact of this aging trend will be to reduce the rate of labor force growth in the\nUnited States. You can see from the chart below that, beginning in the 2000s, population growth\namong those 20 to 64 years old has outpaced overall labor force growth. This trend has been due\nto a steadily increasing percentage of the 55–64 population within the 20–64 age cohort as well\nas a plateauing of the rate at which women have been entering the workforce. Dallas Fed\neconomists expect these trends to continue as we enter the next decade.\nBecause GDP growth is comprised of growth in the workforce plus gains in productivity, weaker\nexpected workforce growth trends will likely negatively affect potential GDP growth in the years\nahead—unless we take steps to mitigate these effects.\nDeclining Rates of Labor Force and Population Growth\nPercent change,annualized\n3.0\n2.71\n2.5\nLabor force, 20-64 years old\n2.0 2.05 1.95 Population, 20-64 years old\n1.5\n1.37\n1.27\n1.16\n1.11\n1.0\n0.84\n0.51e\n0.5 0.36e\n0.26e\n0.0\n1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s 2020s\nNOTE: “e” denotes an estimated value.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics through September 2017 for labor force growth data; Census Bureau for historicaland estimated population growth\ndata from 1970s through 2020s.\nEducational Attainment and the Skills Gap in the U.S.\nWhen we look at measures of discouraged workers and those who are working part time for\neconomic reasons, I would note the high correlation between participation rates (as well as\nunemployment rates) and levels of educational attainment. The labor force participation rate for\n6\n\nprime-age workers is approximately 88 percent for college graduates and 83 percent for those\nwho have attended some college. However, prime-age worker participation is only 77 percent for\nthose with a high school diploma and only 66 percent for those who have less than a high school\ndiploma.9\nWhile the labor participation rate is disappointing for those with lower levels of educational\nattainment, our Dallas Fed economists also note that there is a substantial skills gap in the U.S.\nThat is, there are more job openings than workers for various types of middle-skills positions.\nThe National Federation of Independent Business reports that as of September 2017, nearly half\nof small businesses indicated that they were unable to find qualified applicants to fill job\nopenings. CEOs report difficulty in hiring workers for middle-class-wage jobs such as nurses,\nconstruction workers, truck drivers, oilfield workers, automotive technicians, industrial\ntechnicians, heavy equipment operators, computer network support specialists, web developers\nand insurance specialists. When these types of jobs go unfilled, U.S. businesses expand more\nslowly and the nation’s growth is impeded.\nWhile a college education is highly correlated with better employment outcomes, it is also the\ncase that the substantial skills gap highlights the need for the U.S. to do much more to beef up\npublic/private partnerships that focus on middle-skills training. This training is critical to help\nworkers, who may not have attended college, attain the capabilities needed to find attractive\nemployment in the 21st century economy.\nOne other significant educational concern is the lagging levels of early-childhood literacy among\nfast-growing demographic groups in the U.S. Studies suggest that, if a child begins first grade\nwith reading capability behind grade level, they typically fail to catch up during their educational\ncareer.10 This has significant implications for their ultimate level of educational attainment. As a\nresult of this trend, the Dallas Fed has consistently highlighted the need, nationally and locally,\nto invest in programs that improve early-childhood literacy and generally enhance the level of\neducational attainment among our younger population.\nEducation initiatives are an investment in our future. They are likely to help in the effort to\nreduce income inequality by creating broader workforce productivity gains and more inclusive\nprosperity.\nInflation\nProgress toward reaching the Fed’s 2 percent inflation objective has been slow over the past\nseveral years. I believe this has likely been due to past strengthening of the dollar and weaker\nenergy prices as well as a number of persistent secular forces, such as globalization and\ntechnology-enabled disruption (see “Broader Secular Trends” below).\nTwelve-month measures of both headline and core inflation have weakened since February 2017.\nWhile I believe that this recent weakening may well be transitory, I will continue to be patient\nand open-minded in assessing upcoming data releases in this regard.\n7\n\nIn order to analyze inflation trends, our economists look at headline inflation but also track\nseveral measures of core inflation. In particular, Dallas Fed economists closely monitor our\nDallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate (see chart below). This measure trims out the most\nextreme upward and downward monthly price movements and, our economists believe,\nrepresents a more reliable indicator of trend inflation. After running at approximately 1.6 percent\nin 2015, Trimmed Mean PCE inflation gradually increased from 1.7 to 1.9 percent during 2016.\nThrough August 2017, this measure has fallen back to 1.6 percent on a 12-month basis.\nI am of the view that, despite recent weakness, as slack continues to be removed from the labor\nmarket, headline inflation should reach, or exceed, the Fed’s 2 percent objective over the\nmedium term. However, I will be closely watching this measure in the months ahead in order to\nconfirm that recent weakness is indeed transitory and that we are continuing to make progress in\nreaching our inflation objective.\nTrimmed Mean Inflation Captures Headline Inflation’s Medium-Term Trend\nPercent change, year/year\n2.5\n2.0\nAug-17\n1.62\n1.5\n1.43\n1.0\n0.5\nHeadline PCE\nTrimmed Mean PCE\n0.0\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\nNOTE: The dashed line represents the FederalOpen Market Committee's 2 percent inflation target.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Economic Analysis;Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\nNon-U.S.\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team closely monitors economic\ndevelopments outside the U.S. to evaluate how these developments might impact economic\ngrowth domestically. Over the past year, we have seen a broad-based improvement in global\neconomic activity. Brazil and Russia appear to be emerging from recession; Japan and the euro\narea are now growing more robustly.\n8\n\nThe United Kingdom is still growing but at a much-reduced rate. The British government is\nworking toward articulating a coherent vision for its post-Brexit arrangements with the European\nUnion. Dallas Fed economists continue to believe that the impact of Brexit is likely to be\nmanageable for the U.S.\nDallas Fed economists continue to carefully monitor emerging-market countries, particularly\nChina. As discussed in previous essays, China is challenged by a high degree of overcapacity\n(particularly in state-owned enterprises) and high and growing levels of debt. The nation is also\nin the midst of a multiyear transition from being a manufacturing- and export-driven economy to\none that is based on consumer spending and services. As this transition unfolds, the world is\nlikely going to have to become accustomed to lower rates of Chinese growth. In the meantime,\nChina is working to manage capital outflows and currency volatility. As we saw in the first\nquarter of 2016, this situation has the potential to create periods of financial market volatility and\nlead to bouts of tightening in global financial conditions, which could, in turn, slow economic\ngrowth in the U.S.\nBroader Secular Trends\nAs I have discussed in almost all my recent essays and speeches, my economic research team\ncarefully considers and works to understand cyclical forces in the economy as well as several\nkey secular drivers. As I have emphasized over the past two years, these drivers are likely having\na powerful influence on unfolding economic conditions.\nI have particularly focused on four key secular drivers:\n Aging-workforce demographics in the U.S. and across major economies. As discussed\nearlier, aging-population trends, on balance, reduce labor force participation rates and\nultimately create headwinds for potential GDP growth. These demographic trends are\nalso likely to impact the “dependency ratio”11—that is, they are likely to exacerbate a\nsituation in which an increasing share of the population is depending on those of working\nage to pay for future medical and retirement benefits. These trends are likely to create\nfurther strains on the ability of the U.S. government to manage its fiscal obligations\n(discussed further below).\n Limits to the sustainability of the so-called global debt super cycle. Historically, the U.S.\nand other countries have used increasing public debt—often through tax cuts and higher\ngovernment spending—to boost economic growth. In some countries, such as China,\nlarge quantities of private sector debt have also been used to fuel growth. At this point,\nthere are likely limits to the ability of countries, including the U.S., to further increase\ndebt to GDP in order to bolster economic growth. As I discussed earlier in this essay, we\nhave seen a deleveraging of the U.S. household sector since 2008. As a result, the\nhousehold sector is in much better shape today. However, while household balance sheets\nhave improved since the Great Recession, government debt held by the public stands at\n9\n\nthe highest levels since the World War II era12—approximately 75 percent of GDP (see\nchart below)—and the present value of future unfunded entitlements is now estimated at\n$49 trillion.13 These obligations will increasingly work their way into U.S. budget deficits\nover the next five to 10 years—raising questions regarding fiscal sustainability which, if\nnot addressed, could negatively impact longer-run economic growth.\nGovernment Debt Levels Have Climbed Significantly\nPercent\n80 Q2:2017\n75\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10 Federal debt held by the\npublic as a percent of\nGDP\n0\n1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\nNOTES: Debtheld by the public excludes intragovernmental holdings. The shaded bars indicate NBER recessions.\nSOURCES: U.S.Treasury; Bureau of Economic Analysis; National Bureauof Economic Research (NBER).\n Globalization. Economies, financial markets and companies are more closely intertwined\nthan ever before. For example, regarding trade, estimates indicate that in excess of 40\npercent of the content of U.S. imports from Mexico is of U.S. origin.14 Furthermore,\nDallas Fed economists estimate that as much as 70 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico\nare “intermediate goods.”15 This is because much of the U.S. trade with Mexico is related\nto integrated production chains and logistical arrangements between U.S. and Mexican\ncompanies. It is our view at the Dallas Fed that these arrangements have helped improve\ncompetitiveness and create jobs in the U.S. Without these arrangements, these jobs might\nhave otherwise been lost to other areas of the world, particularly Asia.\nWhile trade and globalization have yielded net economic benefits for the U.S. economy,\nthey have also created severe local hardships that the U.S. and other advanced economies\nhave struggled to address. The challenge is how to reap the benefits of globalization\nwhile addressing the disruptions it creates—failing to address these disruptions is likely\n10\n\nto reduce public support for global trade, which could have negative implications for the\npace of economic growth in the U.S. and globally.\n Technology-enabled disruption. In order to improve their competiveness, many\ncompanies are actively investing in technology, which is leading to a significant\nreduction in the number of workers needed to produce goods and services. The result is\nthat U.S. workers across a range of industries are finding that their jobs are being\nrestructured or eliminated. While this trend has increased productivity in most industries,\nI believe one key reason that overall labor productivity growth has been sluggish is that\ndisplaced workers are often going to less-productive jobs. This issue is a key reason I\nhave been emphasizing the need for beefed-up skills training to help displaced workers\nget retrained so they can find more-productive employment. It is also why the Dallas Fed\nhas been working on highlighting the need for early-childhood literacy and other\ninitiatives which could improve educational-attainment levels in order to help our citizens\nbetter thrive in a world which increasingly demands greater education, training and\nadaptability.\nMany industries are also facing a disruptive technology-enabled competitor that is\nthreatening their business model by offering lower cost and greater convenience in the\nsale of goods or services. Think the digital camera versus the old film industry, Amazon\nversus retail stores, Khan Academy versus brick-and-mortar schools, 3-D printing versus\ntraditional manufacturing, Uber and Lyft versus taxis, and so on. This technology-\nenabled disruption has allowed consumers to achieve better value and more easily\ncomparison shop for merchandise and services. It has also reduced the pricing power of\nmany companies and caused them to intensify their focus on creating greater operational\nefficiencies.\nI believe that the dislocations resulting from technology-enabled disruption are\nsometimes confused with the impacts of globalization. That is, a substantial number of\njob losses may have more to do with technology-enabled disruption even though they\nmay be attributed to globalization.\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive\ncompetitors, have been more cautious about making capacity-expansion decisions as well\nas investing in major capital projects. In my view, it may also help explain the record\nlevel of merger activity globally, as companies attempt to address disruptive changes and\nlack of pricing power by achieving greater scale economies in order to maintain or\nimprove profit margins.\nIn light of these secular trends and the sluggish economic growth over the past several years, I\nhave been speaking the last several months about the need for structural reforms and fiscal policy\nto join the menu of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the\nkey structural challenges we face today stemming from changing demographic trends and lower\nrates of productivity growth as well as dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates\n11\n\nof technology-enabled disruption. While monetary policy has a key role to play, it is not a\nsubstitute for structural reforms and other actions that could address deeper fundamental\nchallenges.\nThe primary prism I use to judge new structural reforms and potential fiscal policies is whether\nthey help grow the labor force and/or improve productivity growth in the U.S. GDP growth is\ncomprised of these two components, and I believe potential new policies should be judged in the\ncontext of whether they create sustainable improvement in these measures.\nThe Current Stance of Monetary Policy\nI believe that we are making good progress in reaching our full-employment objective. The U.S.\nconsumer is healthy, and business activity continues to strengthen. Global growth has been\nstronger than expected in 2017. While our estimate of 2.4 percent U.S. GDP growth in 2017 is\nsluggish by historical standards, it should be sufficient to continue to remove slack from the\nlabor market.\nNormally, at this stage in the recovery and with a tightening labor market, we would expect to\nsee increasing evidence of inflation pressures. I believe that cyclical inflationary pressures are\nbuilding as we remove slack from the labor market and approach full employment. However, I\nalso believe that these cyclical forces are being at least partially offset by secular forces\n(described earlier in this essay), particularly an intensifying rate of technology-enabled\ndisruption and, to a lesser extent, globalization. These secular forces are likely limiting the\npricing power of businesses and muting inflationary pressures.\nFrom a risk-management point of view, I am mindful that if we wait too long to see signs of\ngreater inflation, we may get “behind the curve” and have to play catch up by increasing rates\nmore rapidly. Historically, this has increased the likelihood of recession.\nI am also mindful that there is a cost to excessive accommodation in terms of limiting returns to\nsavers as well as creating distortions and imbalances in investing, hiring and other business\ndecisions. Monetary policy accommodation is not costless—it carries risks. It has been my\nexperience that significant imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very\npainful to address.\nHowever, I believe that structural forces, particularly slowing workforce growth due to an aging\npopulation, will continue to pose challenges for future economic growth. As a result, my view is\nthat the neutral rate, the interest rate at which we are neither accommodative nor restrictive, is\nlikely to be much lower than we are historically accustomed. Therefore, I have argued that future\nremovals of accommodation should be done in a gradual and patient manner.\nBased on these considerations, I intend to keep an open mind about removing accommodation in\nupcoming FOMC meetings. In the months ahead, I will continue to assess the economy’s\n12\n\nprogress in removing labor slack, and I will be looking for evidence that building cyclical forces\nhave the prospect of offsetting structural headwinds, such that we can expect to make progress\ntoward meeting our 2 percent inflation objective in the medium term. Given the strength of the\nU.S. economy, I think it is likely we will see greater evidence of this progress and, as a\nconsequence, it will be appropriate to continue the process of gradually removing monetary\naccommodation.\nNotes\n1 Bureau of Economic Analysis, first quarter 2017.\n2 Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and Bureau of Labor Statistics, second quarter 2017.\n3 See the 2017 Fortune 500 list of companies headquartered in Texas,\nhttp://fortune.com/fortune500/list/filtered?statename=Texas.\n4 “Hurricane Irma Losses $58–$83 Billion: Moody’s Analytics,” Artemis, Sept. 13, 2017,\nwww.artemis.bm/blog/2017/09/13/hurricane-irma-economic-losses-58-83-billion-moodys-analytics/.\n5 “Twenty Metro Areas Are Home to Six-in-Ten Unauthorized Immigrants in the U.S.,” by Jeffrey S.\nPassel and D’Vera Cohn, FactTank, Pew Research Center, Feb. 9, 2017, www.pewresearch.org/fact-\ntank/2017/02/09/us-metro-areas-unauthorized-immigrants/.\n6 Texas Business Outlook Surveys special questions, Sept. 25, 2017.\nwww.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/tssos/2017/1709/specquest.aspx.\n7 Census Bureau.\n8 “Labor Force Projections to 2024: The Labor Force Is Growing, but Slowly,” Monthly Labor Review,\nBureau of Labor Statistics, December 2015, www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/labor-force-projections-\nto-2024.htm.\n9 Census Bureau, Current Population Survey 2017 Annual Social and Economic Supplement,\nwww.census.gov/cps/data/cpstablecreator.html.\n10 See “Catch Them Before They Fall: Identification and Assessment to Prevent Reading Failure in\nYoung Children,” by Joseph K.

    "text": "A Perspective on Oil\nRobert S. Kaplan\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nJune 19, 2018\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, Soojin Jo, Evan Koenig, Marc Giannoni, Kunal Patel,\nMichael Plante, William Simmons, Martin Stuermer, Kathy Thacker, Joe Tracy and Mine Yücel in preparing these remarks. In\naddition, I want to thank the members of the Dallas Fed Energy Advisory Council for their contributions.\n\nA Perspective on Oil\nRobert S. Kaplan\nU.S. crude oil production is estimated to have grown from 5.1 million barrels per day in May 2008 to\napproximately 10.6 million barrels per day in May 2018.1, 2 As a result of this growth, the U.S. now\nrepresents approximately 13 percent of global crude oil production, up from 7 percent 10 years ago.\nImprovements in shale oil drilling and completion techniques have been a critical element of this growth,\nwith much of the new production occurring in Texas as well as North Dakota, New Mexico, Oklahoma and\nColorado.3 While the U.S. continues to be a substantial crude oil importer, the shale boom has allowed our\ncountry to substantially reduce the percentage of petroleum product consumption that is supplied by\nimports.\nDallas Fed economists focus on energy market dynamics because of their implications for oil prices, which\nin turn, affect U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), employment and inflation. As we’ve seen in past\neconomic cycles, changes in oil prices particularly impact consumer spending and input costs for\nbusinesses, as well as capital investment and job creation in energy-producing regions of the U.S.\nGiven the importance of oil to the U.S. and global economies, the Dallas Fed has assembled an experienced\nteam of energy economists, created key industry surveys and built relationships with industry executives in\norder to build a deep understanding of the energy industry and global energy markets. In the fall of 2017,\nwe created an Energy Advisory Council to more systematically build our insights into energy market trends\nand developments. Through these various channels, we seek to gain insights that are critical to our\nunderstanding of the impact of energy market developments on economic conditions and their implications\nfor monetary policy in the U.S.\nWhile this essay focuses primarily on oil, Dallas Fed economists also focus on understanding renewable\nenergy sources. As discussed in recent Dallas Fed publications, Wind Power a Growing Force in Oil\nCountry and Texas Has ‘All-of-the-Above’ Energy Approach, Texas is the nation’s largest producer of\nwind-generated electricity.4 In the years ahead, we expect renewables such as wind and solar power to\ncomprise a larger percentage of the nation’s energy mix. However, even with substantial growth in\nrenewables, it is expected that fossil fuels will comprise approximately 77 percent of global energy use in\n2040 (as estimated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration).5\nBackground\nDallas Fed economists believe that global oil supply and demand are now in relative balance. First quarter\n2018 estimates indicate that global average oil production was approximately 98.3 million barrels per day\nand global consumption was approximately 98.4 million barrels per day.6 These estimates incorporate the\nDecember 2016 agreement made by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and\nother oil-producing countries to cut crude oil production by approximately 1.8 million barrels per day.\nRecently, OPEC and other oil-producing countries have discussed restoring some of this crude oil\nproduction cut. In the short run, such a restoration of production might help offset expected production\noutages from countries such as Venezuela and Iran. However, in the medium term, Dallas Fed economists\ncontinue to believe that, due to expected growth in daily global demand, the trend of global supply/demand\nis fundamentally toward balance.\n2\n\nOil supply is substantially comprised of three main segments: crude oil, natural gas liquids and biofuels.7\nIt is our view, based on Dallas Fed analysis, surveys and discussions with industry contacts, that U.S. crude\noil production will grow by more than 1 million barrels per day in 2018 and exceed approximately 11.2\nmillion barrels per day by year-end. In addition, we expect U.S. production of natural gas liquids of\napproximately 4.5 million barrels per day and production of biofuels of approximately 1.2 million barrels\nper day by year-end 2018.8\nIn terms of crude oil production, only Russia, which currently accounts for approximately 11 million barrels\nper day, produces more than the U.S.9 By comparison, Saudi Arabia currently produces approximately 10\nmillion barrels of crude oil per day, having cut approximately 0.5 million barrels per day from its crude oil\nproduction as a result of the OPEC agreement.\nDallas Fed economists estimate that by year-end 2018, the U.S. will consume approximately 20.6 million\nbarrels per day of oil. Our economists believe that, over the next several years, the U.S. will continue to\nincrease its oil production, while consumption growth is expected to flatten due to energy efficiency gains\nas well as greater use of natural gas and renewable energy sources to meet energy demand.\nGlobal oil markets face a number of uncertainties and challenges. How these issues unfold will likely have\nimplications for energy prices as well as economic conditions and monetary policy in the U.S.\nKey Issues and Challenges\nReduction in Spending on Long-Lived Projects\nOne potential issue facing the global oil market is the recent decline in capital investment in long-lived\nexploration and production (E&P) projects. Historically, major oil companies have allocated substantial\nportions of their capital expenditure budgets to these long-lived investments. These investments have\nincluded deepwater and ultra-deepwater offshore wells,10 Arctic drilling and oil sands production. These\nprojects typically cost hundreds of millions to billions of dollars to complete, take several years to build\nand have useful lives in excess of 20 years. These projects are important to global energy markets because\nthey fundamentally increase medium- and longer-term global oil supply.\nAs Chart 1 indicates, since 2014, major oil companies have reduced their capital expenditures relating to\nlong-lived projects. As a consequence of several years of lower investment spending on these projects, the\nglobal energy market has increased its dependence on future production growth from shale oil.\n3\n\nChart 1\nCapital Expenditures Committed to Long-Lived Projects Decline\nBillions of dollars\n160\nTraditional\n140 Deepwater\nHeavy oil\n120 Exploitation\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018P 2020P 2022P 2024P\nNOTES:Years followed by \"P\" indicate projections. Data exclude OPEC, Russia and shale. Exploitation refers to large resource fieldswith low costs and little to no\nexploration risk.\nSOURCE: GoldmanSachs Global Investment Research.\nShale production has the benefit of being more financially manageable and operationally nimble. However,\nshale wells typically have very rapid production decline characteristics (discussed below). Specifically, a\nshale project is a much more “short-cycle” investment than a typical conventional project—it can be drilled\nand brought onstream very quickly and, on average, for approximately $6 million to $8 million per well.\nHowever, because of its rapid production decline features, shale requires additional and continuous\ninvestment in order to maintain production levels.\nChart 2 shows the growth in shale crude oil output in the U.S. Less than 10 years ago, U.S. shale produced\napproximately 0.5 million barrels per day, or less than 1 percent of global crude oil production.11 In 2017,\nU.S. shale produced approximately 4.7 million barrels per day and made up approximately 6 percent of\nglobal crude oil production. As shale makes up an increasing percentage of global crude oil supply, the\nchallenge will be to find ways to increase shale well productivity, overcome input shortages and ramp up\nproduction to meet incremental global demand growth.\n4\n\nChart 2\nU.S. Shale Becoming Larger Share of Global Crude Oil Production\nMillion barrels per day Global crude oil production excluding shale Percent\n100 10\nShale crude oil production\n90 9\nShale as a percent of global crude oil production\n80 8\n70 7\n60 6\n50 5\n40 4\n30 3\n20 2\n10 1\n0 0\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018P 2019P\nNOTE: Yearsfollowed by \"P\" indicate projections.\nSOURCES: Global crude production from International Energy Agency (IEA), with forecast from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; shale,orlight tight oil,\nestimates for 2007–17 from Energy Information Administration and 2018–19 forecast from IEA.\nGrowth in Global Demand\nDemand for oil grew from an average of 90.4 million barrels per day in 2012 to approximately 98.4 million\nbarrels per day in the first quarter of 2018.12 Much of this growth has come from emerging-market\neconomies, particularly China, India and countries in the Middle East region (see Chart 3 for analysis of\nglobal demand growth).\n5\n\nIt is estimated that global oil demand is likely to increase from an average of 98.4 million barrels per day\nin the first quarter of 2018 to approximately 101.5 million barrels per day by 2020. World Bank and\nInternational Monetary Fund projections suggest that global demand growth will continue to be driven\nprimarily by emerging-market economies.\nThis forecast rate of global demand growth (approximately 1.1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day) should\nprovide a strong underpinning for global energy markets and the resulting price of oil. The challenge will\nbe producing enough oil to meet demand growth over the next three to five years.13\nImpediments to Growth of U.S. Shale Oil Production\nWhile estimates for growth of U.S. shale vary among industry observers, our contacts believe that U.S.\nshale production should be sufficient to supply a substantial portion of incremental global demand growth\nfor the next few years. However, our industry contacts are concerned about key production impediments\nthat have the potential to limit the ability of shale to supply incremental global demand growth beyond that\ntime frame.\nWhile there are a number of shale formations across the U.S., the most prolific is the Permian Basin, a\ngeologic area rich in oil and gas that is 250 miles wide and 300 miles long across West Texas and eastern\nNew Mexico. The Permian was responsible for approximately 63 percent of U.S. crude oil production\ngrowth in 2017, far outpacing the next-most-prolific U.S. shale formation, the Bakken in North Dakota and\nMontana (which accounted for approximately 18 percent of U.S. crude oil production growth).14\nIndustry contacts cite the Permian’s advantage over other areas due to its multiple layers of thick shale rock,\nthe quality of the oil and the relatively close proximity to refiners, export terminals and pipelines. The\nMarch 2018 Dallas Fed Energy Survey indicated that the Midland Basin portion of the Permian appears to\nbe more economically attractive than other shale formations, on average, as shown in Chart 4. However,\n6\n\nseveral of our industry contacts suggest that the Delaware Basin has attractive drilling characteristics that\nare as compelling as the Midland Basin’s.\nAs West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices have remained above $60 for most of 2018, drilling outside\nthe most attractive portions of the Permian has become more economically appealing for E&P companies.\nThese areas include the Bakken, parts of the Eagle Ford in South Texas and most of the SCOOP/STACK\nin Oklahoma. If prices persist at current levels, industry contacts expect to see oil companies more\naggressively expand their production activities beyond the Permian Basin.\nChart 4\nIn the TopTwo Areas in Which Your Firm Is Active:\nWhat WTI Oil Price Does Your Firm Need to Profitably Drill a New Well?\nDollars perbarrel\n90\nPermian Other U.S.\n80 Permian Permian (Other) Other U.S. (Non-shale)\n(Midland) (Delaware) SCOOP/ (Shale)\n70 STACK\nBakken\n60 $52 $53 $54 $55\n$49 $50\n$47\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n15 13 4 18 7 7 34\nNumberof responses\nNOTES: Responses are to questions in the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas' Energy Survey.

The most significant potential\nchallenges are described below.\n1. Rapid production decline curve of shale.\nThe primary method for drilling wells in shale-rock formations is known as horizontal drilling—where a\nwell is drilled vertically (averaging approximately 10,000 feet) before being guided horizontally through\nthe rock (averaging a distance of between 5,000 and 10,000 feet). Although a highly effective method,\nhorizontal wells often reach peak crude oil production in the first few months, with output declining rapidly\nthereafter, sometimes as much as 80 percent after one year. As a result, in order to grow overall crude oil\nproduction, more wells must be drilled and well productivity must be boosted substantially. While\ncompanies are drilling more wells this year to overcome this decline curve, they face constraints regarding\nlabor, input costs, infrastructure and the return requirements of capital providers.\n7\n\n2. Shortages of labor.\nDallas Fed industry contacts report that the oil and gas industry in the Permian Basin faces a shortage of\nworkers. Our contacts note that industry service companies are facing higher levels of turnover as workers\neither leave for higher pay at competitors or leave the industry due to the highly strenuous working\nconditions. In addition, companies report finding it difficult to attract previously laid-off workers back to\nthe industry. Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate that layoffs during the oil price decline of 2014–15\nresulted in an estimated loss of one-third of the workforce,15 and industry contacts report that many workers\neither are reluctant to return to the industry or need significant financial and/or job security incentives to\nreturn given the boom/bust nature of the industry.\nWhile the oil and gas industry has become more efficient, drilling and completing wells is still a labor-\nintensive endeavor. The oil production sector has added more than 40,000 jobs in Texas and more than\n60,000 jobs in the U.S. from December 2016 through April 2018, and high demand for workers has led to\nsignificant wage pressures. Our Dallas Fed Energy Survey shows that energy companies based in the\nEleventh Federal Reserve District (which includes Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico)\nincreased wages and benefits throughout 2017 and have been accelerating this pace in 2018.\nLabor shortages are particularly acute in the Permian Basin. The May 2018 unemployment rate in Midland,\nTexas, the heart of the Permian, was 2.2 percent.16 Housing is also in short supply in the Permian Basin,\nand companies have again resorted to using temporary housing structures for their workers. House prices\nin Midland have risen substantially since 2016, and housing inventories are estimated at one month of\nsupply.17\n3. Raw material, environmental and infrastructure challenges.\nWater and sand are key inputs used in shale production, accounting for 30 to 35 percent of the cost of\ndrilling and completing a well.18 Contacts report that sand costs have increased substantially during the past\n12 months. Specifically, increasing volumes of sand used in well fracking are creating strains on\ninfrastructure in the region (10,000 tons of sand per well is not uncommon, requiring 100 railcars or 400\ntruckloads for transport).\nIn addition, water availability has become more of a logistical and financial challenge. As operators pursue\nlarger well-completion projects and often operate on multiple well pads, the need for more advanced\nplanning to arrange for water-supply logistics is becoming a more significant challenge. Another concern\nis water disposal. While companies often source water used in fracking from an underground aquifer in the\nPermian, operators cite greater concerns regarding the disposal of wastewater that is produced as a\nbyproduct of oil. On average, three to five barrels of water come out of the ground for every barrel of oil\nthat is produced.19 This water must either be transported to an approved saltwater disposal well, further\nstraining transportation infrastructure, or recycled and used as frack water—a process that is generally\nconsidered too expensive for most operators.\nSeveral industry contacts and other observers have cited their concerns regarding water and air pollution,\nwastewater management and other issues relating to emissions of greenhouse gases. These are critical issues\nwhich state as well as federal regulatory agencies must actively monitor and are important operating\nconsiderations for firms participating in this industry. Several of our contacts, and industry observers, have\ndiscussed the critical need for proper safeguards in order to prevent degradation of water and air quality,\nand loss of land use.\n8\n\nIn the Permian, oil and natural gas pipeline capacity—used to transport oil and natural gas to refineries and\nprocessing plants hundreds of miles from the well site—remains a potential problem in 2018 and 2019. Our\nexpectation is that oil pipeline capacity will become very tight late in 2018 and early 2019, as shown in\nChart 5, and possibly sooner if production surprises to the upside or pipelines and refineries experience\nunforeseen downtime. However, the pipeline bottlenecks should be alleviated in the second half of 2019 as\nnew pipelines come onstream.\n4. Capital discipline exerted by equity owners.\nEnergy executives report that public-market capital providers are much more focused on capital discipline\nfrom oil and gas companies. From January 2, 2017, through June 13, 2018, energy stocks increased only\n1.1 percent, while the price of oil and the S&P 500 increased 35.8 percent and 24.2 percent, respectively,\nas shown in Chart 6.20\nAs a result of this underperformance, industry contacts report that capital providers are increasingly\npressuring management teams to increase their focus on achieving higher rates of return, rather than\nfocusing primarily on increasing overall production levels. Contacts report that this capital-discipline focus\nis causing many boards of directors to revise incentive structures and compensation arrangements for\ncompany management teams. It may also have the impact of encouraging some independent production\ncompanies to more proactively consider mergers and other actions that increase scale and improve operating\nmargins.\n9\n\nChart 6\nEnergy Stocks Lag the Market and the Price of Oil\nPercent\n60\nSpot price of Brent oil\n50 S&P 500\n40 S&P 500 - energy sector 35.8%\n30\n24.2%\n20\n10\n1.1%\n0\n-10\n-20\n-30\n-40\nNOTE: Daily closingprices are indexed to zero at 1/2/2017.\nSOURCE: Bloomberg (as of June 13, 2018).\nProduction Outages and Geopolitical Risks\nA large percentage of global oil production is in politically unstable areas of the world, and political and\nmilitary conflict as well as governance challenges have given rise to oil supply disruptions in the past\nseveral years. These disruptions (or “supply shocks”) have the potential to cause a rise in oil prices in the\nshort term.\nSome of the more significant disruptions in recent years have occurred in Venezuela, Libya and Iran. Daily\nVenezuelan crude oil production is estimated to have fallen by 1.1 million barrels since 2013 and is\ncontinuing to decline.21 Libya has experienced civil strife since the fall of Gaddafi. After declining from a\nhigh of 1.6 million barrels per day in January 2011 to zero in August 2011, Libyan crude oil production\nmoved back up to roughly 1.0 million barrels per day in May 2018. Iran has seen its crude oil production\nincrease by approximately 0.8 million barrels per day following the removal of sanctions in 2016. However,\nthe recent U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement has the potential to reduce Iranian exports and\ncrude oil production.\nIn a global market that is in relative oil supply/demand balance, supply outages due to geopolitical events\nhave the potential to cause sporadic episodes of spikes in oil prices.\nImplications for Energy Markets\nDallas Fed economists and our industry contacts increasingly are of the view that we have gone from a\nglobal oversupply situation (2014 to mid-2017) to one currently of relative balance (taking into account\nOPEC supply restrictions). Over the next few years, we believe that global oil markets will be in a “fragile\nequilibrium” in which demand growth should likely be met in large part by growth in U.S. shale oil\n10\n\nproduction. This, of course, assumes no new material disruptions from major oil-producing countries in the\nMiddle East or other producers such as Russia, Nigeria or Venezuela.\nHowever, given the current lack of investment in long-lived production projects, and assuming global oil\ndemand continues to grow between 1.1 million and 1.5 million barrels per day,22 we would expect future\nworld consumption growth to be more dependent on shale production growth. Due to the potential\nimpediments described above, there is a growing likelihood of an eventual global undersupply situation in\nwhich shale will be unable to keep up with demand growth. Industry contacts acknowledge that higher oil\nprices could well induce producers to find ways to overcome these potential impediments.\nIn particular, some industry participants are hopeful that this situation could be mitigated by continued\ntechnological innovation in shale production and increases in OPEC production, as well as greater future\ninvestment in long-lived projects such as oil sands production in Canada and offshore drilling. In general,\nindustry contacts emphasize that higher oil prices certainly have the potential to make these mitigants more\nlikely to occur.\nOverall, given our forecast and the potential impediments to substantial growth in shale oil production, we\nbelieve global oil markets are likely to be more vulnerable in the medium term to geopolitical shocks and\ndisruptions that would create a potential for price risk to the upside.\nA More Muted Impact of Higher Oil Prices on the U.S. Economy\nIncreases in oil prices can be caused by higher-than-expected demand (so-called “demand shocks”) from a\nstronger global economy or from unexpected reductions in supply (so-called “supply shocks”), such as\nthose resulting from certain types of geopolitical events. Today, Dallas Fed economists believe that the\nrecent run-up in oil prices is due to a combination of both demand and supply factors.\nHistorically, recessions in the U.S. have often followed oil price shocks. Higher oil prices tend to increase\ncosts to consumers, which can, in turn, reduce their disposable income and consumption of non-oil goods\nand services. For example, Dallas Fed analysis indicates that every dollar increase in the oil price leads to\na 2.4 cent increase in gasoline prices—all other factors staying the same—which over the course of a year\nwould amount to approximately $3.4 billion in additional expenditures on gasoline.23 Oil price increases\nalso tend to cause firms to experience higher energy, shipping and input costs.\nOver time, several factors have mitigated the impact of higher oil prices on the U.S. economy. The\nemergence of U.S. shale is one factor, as increased domestic production means that a larger share of the\neconomy is helped by higher oil prices. Reduced crude oil imports also benefit our trade balance.\nFinally, as shown in Chart 7, the U.S. economy is less oil-intensive than in the past due to substitution for\noil by other forms of energy, improved fuel efficiency and growth in the less-energy-intensive services\nsector as a share of the overall economy. For example, in 1970, the U.S. consumed 1.1 barrels of oil for\nevery $1,000 of GDP; by 2017, only 0.4 barrels of oil were consumed for every $1,000 of GDP.24\nBased on these various factors, it is the view of Dallas Fed economists that the negative impact of higher\noil prices on GDP growth is likely to be more muted than in the past. It is our view that a 10 percent increase\nin the oil price should have a relatively modest negative impact on U.S. GDP growth.25 This negative impact\nshould further diminish as the U.S. continues to grow its domestic oil production.\n11\n\nChart 7\nOil Intensity of U.S. Economy Declines from 1970 to 2017\nBarrels of oil consumed\nper $1,000 of GDP*\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\n*Real 2009dollars.\nSOURCES:U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis; Energy Information Administration.\nUnderstanding Evolving Oil Market Dynamics\nThe purpose of this essay has been to lay out the key factors the Dallas Fed closely tracks in analyzing the\nglobal energy markets and in considering the impact of oil prices on economic conditions in the U.S. Like\nany dynamic market, the oil market can be unpredictable, and key elements are often shifting, which can\nhave profound impacts on global supply and demand. Given the importance of oil to the U.S. and global\neconomies, our Dallas Fed research team is highly focused on understanding these market dynamics and\ndetermining their implications for GDP, unemployment and inflation in the U.S.\nAs discussed in this essay, Dallas Fed economists believe that the global oil market is now in relative\nsupply/demand balance. Based on various factors discussed, it is our judgment that this market is likely in\nthe years ahead to be more vulnerable to geopolitical events and other dynamics that could create price\nrisks to the upside. As these dynamics unfold, we will continue to work with our industry contacts to better\nunderstand the oil market and its implications for monetary policy in the U.S.\n12\n\nNotes\n1 In this essay, when the term “crude oil” is used, it refers to crude oil and condensates. The term “oil” refers to\ncrude oil, condensates, natural gas liquids and biofuels. Prior to being consumed, oil is refined into “petroleum\nproducts” such as motor gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel, residual fuel and other products.\n2 International Energy Agency (IEA).\n3 U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).\n4 As of June 2018.

Middle distillates consist broadly of jet fuel/kerosene, gasoil/diesel and heating oil—products that fuel\nemerging-market economies and international trade. Shale oil is a relatively light oil and does not yield as much\nmiddle distillate as heavier oils (from, for example, Middle East or Venezuela crude oils) in the refining process.

    "text": "Taking the Long View: Creating a Better\nFuture for Our Children and\nGrandchildren\nRobert S. Kaplan\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nApril 16, 2018\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, Marc Giannoni, Evan Koenig, Pia Orrenius,\nWilliam Simmons and Mark Wynne in preparing these remarks.\n\nTaking the Long View: Creating a Better Future for Our Children\nand Grandchildren\nRobert S. Kaplan\nTurn on the television or pick up a newspaper and you’ll likely see a discussion of what’s\nhappening now—the latest scandal, current geopolitical developments, stock market movements,\nthe latest GDP numbers or corporate earnings announcements. This focus on the here and now is\nso ingrained that we may not be aware of the short-term nature of the news flow. In the midst of\nthis, it is sometimes easy to lose focus on the fact that short-term events often occur as a result of\nmore persistent underlying forces that can take many years to unfold.\nWhat does all this have to do with the work of a central banker? I spend a good part of my time\ntrying to understand economic conditions and make sound monetary policy decisions based on my\nanalysis of those conditions. In this job, I am keenly aware that short-term cyclical developments\nare only part of the story in understanding the U.S. and global economies.\nThe Cyclical Versus the Secular\nThe U.S. economy has historically moved in cycles. That is, it typically behaves in patterns that\ntend to be, with variations, repeating. There are stretches of time when GDP grows, and these tend\nto be followed by periods of GDP decline, followed eventually by a return to growth, followed\nagain by a period of decline, and so on. These cycles often repeat themselves although the exact\nlength, magnitude and character of the pattern varies based on a variety of underlying factors.\nEconomists use models and other analytical techniques to assess and attempt to forecast the\nperformance of the economy in these cycles. Based on these models, economists look for markers\nand other data that indicate where we are in the cycle as well as the strength and character of the\neconomy’s performance. GDP, unemployment, various gauges of manufacturing and service\nsector activity, and inflation measures are examples of economic indicators that are regularly\nmonitored. These measures are widely reported and tend to fluctuate based on factors such as\nindustry developments, commodity prices, market developments, global developments as well as\nmonetary and fiscal policies, and the stage of the current economic cycle.\nIn contrast to cyclical events, longer-term secular trends are usually not discussed on the evening\nnews. They are much slower moving underlying trends that usually develop over an extended\nperiod of time. They may not be visible or widely reported and can take years to unfold. Examples\ncould include demographic and migration trends, changes in consumer and industry behaviors due\nto automation and labor-saving technologies, and elements of global economic integration and\ndevelopment.\nIn my experience, while cyclical fluctuations often attract our attention, the underlying secular\ntrends usually help explain these shorter-term developments. Underlying structural forces may not\n2\n\ncapture the headlines because they are slower moving and may not have a material impact for\nseveral years. However, these forces are ultimately enormously powerful.\nThe purpose of this essay is to first discuss the shorter-term cyclical aspects of the U.S. economy\nand then focus on the longer-term structural trends. In my judgment, it is critical that we more fully\nunderstand and address these secular trends if we are to have a more prosperous economic future.\nThe Near Term\nDallas Fed economists expect U.S. GDP growth of 2.5 to 2.75 percent in 2018. This growth is\nunderpinned by a strong household sector, improved business investment and stronger growth\noutlook outside the U.S.\nBased on this forecast, Dallas Fed economists expect unemployment to dip from 4.1 percent to\napproximately 3.7 percent during the year. We also expect other measures of labor force slack to\ntighten. In particular, we focus on U-6, which comprises the unemployed, plus “marginally\nattached workers” (workers who indicate that they would like a job but have stopped looking for\none), plus people who are working part time who would prefer to work full time. This measure\nnow stands at 8.0 percent, near its prerecession low, and we expect it to improve further during\n2018. We also consider estimates of the numbers of disabled workers, previously incarcerated\nindividuals as well as other sources of available workers who could potentially return to the\nworkforce in a strengthening job market.\nBased on their analysis of the labor market, our economists continue to believe that, while\nimprovements can be made in increasing employment, we are likely at or already past “full\nemployment” in the U.S. Dallas Fed surveys suggest that businesses are increasingly struggling to\nfind workers to fill low- and middle-skills positions. For example, in one of our recent surveys, 61\npercent of Texas small-business respondents suggested they are unable to find workers to fill these\ntypes of positions.1 Due to this labor force tightness, it is our view that cyclical wage pressures\nshould build during 2018.\nRegarding inflation, we believe that cyclical inflationary pressures are building. However, our\neconomists also believe that these forces are being at least partially offset by the impacts of\nautomation and, to a lesser extent, globalization. Discussions with our business contacts continue\nto indicate that, due to the impact of automation and business model disruption, pricing power of\nbusinesses is more limited than we’re historically accustomed to seeing at this stage in an economic\nexpansion.\nWhile we expect GDP growth to be strong in 2018, we also expect that this growth will moderate\nin 2019 and 2020. In fact, Dallas Fed economists are forecasting GDP growth of less than 2 percent\nin 2020 as the short-term stimulus of the recent tax legislation and budget agreement begin to fade\nand monetary policy and financial conditions become less accommodative.\n3\n\nLonger-Term Structural Trends\nWhile the near-term cyclical outlook is solid, underlying structural trends are more concerning. I\nmake a point of discussing secular trends in every speech because, as policymakers, if we focus\non them, we can impact how they will unfold over the medium and longer term. If we pay\ninsufficient attention to these issues, we may find that they ultimately overwhelm shorter-term\ncyclical factors and lead to less growth and prosperity in the U.S. economy. I will discuss four\noverarching secular trends.\nDemographics\nThe U.S. population is aging. In fact, the median age of the population has gone from 35.3 years\nin 2000 to 37.9 in 2016.2 The share of population 65 years or older has risen to 15.7 percent from\n12.6 percent 10 years ago.3 Chart 1 shows the ongoing trend of aging demographics—leading to\ndeclines in labor force and population growth in the U.S.\nGDP growth is made up of growth in the workforce plus the rate of improvement in labor\nproductivity. If workforce growth is slowing, unless we can make up for it through more rapid\nimprovement in labor productivity, we will see lower rates of GDP growth. This slower GDP\ngrowth is crucial because it has significant implications for future living standards in the U.S.\nBecause government debt to GDP is historically elevated, growth will be needed to service and\npay off this debt and meet future entitlement obligations.\nChart 1: Declining rates of labor force and working-age population growth\nPercent change,annualized\n3.0\n2.71\n2.5\nLabor force, 20-64 years old\n2.05\n1.95 Population, 20-64 years old\n2.0\n1.5\n1.37\n1.27\n1.16\n1.11\n1.0\n0.84\n0.45e\n0.5 0.36e\n0.19e\n0.0\n1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s 2020s\nNOTE: “e” denotes an estimated value.\nSOURCES: Bureau of Labor Statistics through 2017 for labor force growth data; Census Bureau for historicaland estimated population growth\ndata from 1970s through 2020s.\n4\n\nThe labor force participation rate has declined from 66 percent in 2007 to approximately 63 percent\ntoday. Dallas Fed economists believe the bulk of this decline is due to aging of the workforce. In\nfact, we expect this trend to continue so that the labor force participation rate should decline to 61\npercent over the next 10 years.4\nThis demographic challenge is occurring, to varying degrees, across most advanced economies.\nFor example, Germany and Japan have more challenging demographic trends than the U.S.5\nWhat can we do about this demographic challenge? First, we could implement programs and\npolicies that encourage higher birth rates among our population. This could help address workforce\ngrowth 25 years from now. We can adopt policies that encourage people not in the workforce to\njoin the workforce; these policies could include improved child care, better transportation services\nfor at-risk populations, and incentives for discouraged workers to rejoin the workforce. Another\nsupplement to workforce growth is immigration. Immigrants and their children have made up over\nhalf the workforce growth in the U.S. over the past 20 years, and this proportion is likely to be\neven higher over the next 20 years. (See Appendix for a further discussion of the role of\nimmigration in the economy.)\nTechnology-Enabled Disruption and Its Implications for Educational Achievement and the\nSkills Gap\nWorkers are increasingly being replaced by automation. Consumers are increasingly able to use\ntechnology to shop for goods and services. Business models are being disrupted by new approaches\nto delivering goods and services at lower prices and potentially better convenience. As a result,\nbusiness pricing power is increasingly being challenged. In response, businesses are investing\nmore in technology and merging with other companies to achieve greater scale in order to protect\ngross profit margins. These trends appear to be accelerating globally.6\nDespite rapid technological change, productivity growth has remained sluggish. Output per worker\ngrew on average by approximately 1.9 percent per year in the 1990s, slowed to 1.3 percent in the\n2000s and has slowed further to 1.0 percent since 2010. One explanation may be that technology\nis having a profound impact on the workforce. In particular, it is changing the nature of middle-\nskills jobs.\nIf you are one of the 46 million workers in this country with a high school education or less, or\nhave a “routine” type of middle-skills job, you are likely finding that your job is being either\nrestructured or eliminated as a result of technology. These workers may find another job in a strong\njob market, but unless they have gotten retrained, they are likely to see their incomes and\nproductivity decline. This may be one reason that we haven’t seen a bigger productivity-growth\npayoff from recent advances in technology. We measure productivity growth workforce-wide\nrather than by company or industry. While most industries are materially improving their\nproductivity, workers with less education may be finding their real wages and productivity\ndeclining in a new age where skills training and educational achievement levels are increasingly\ncritical to adapting to the job market.\n5\n\nRegarding education, the U.S. is a leader in many areas versus the rest of the world. Unfortunately,\nseveral studies suggest that the skill levels and educational achievement levels of our workforce\nhave lagged other developed countries for the last several years. In surveys of 29 participating\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the U.S. ranked\n20th in assessments of adult literacy and math skills.7 In addition, according to recent OECD\nsurveys, the U.S. ranks 24th out of 35 developed countries in measures of math, science and\nreading skills among 15-year-olds.8\nResearch by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University with Ludger Woessmann of the University of\nMunich suggests that improvements in U.S. math and science skills could translate into meaningful\nimprovements in potential GDP growth.9 While these efforts are likely to take years, they could\nhave substantial potential to improve future growth and prosperity in the U.S.\nIn order to address this powerful structural driver, the U.S. must do more to improve early\nchildhood literacy and college readiness, and do more to strengthen skills training at our high\nschools and community colleges.\nThe Potentially Unsustainable Path of Government Debt to GDP\nU.S. government debt held by the public now stands at 75 percent of GDP,10 and the present value\nof unfunded entitlements is estimated at approximately $49 trillion.11 The recent tax legislation\nand bipartisan budget compromise legislation are likely to exacerbate these issues. While\nincreasing the level of debt to GDP is a stimulus to economic growth in the short run, that stimulus\ncan turn into a growth headwind when the government takes steps to moderate debt growth, as it\ncertainly must consider doing in the years ahead. As a consequence of this level of debt, the U.S.\nis much less likely to have fiscal capacity to fight the next recession.\nFurther, due to this level of government debt as well as historically high levels of corporate debt\nas a percentage of GDP, the economy is becoming much more interest rate sensitive. That is,\nincreases in interest rates have greater potential to require a higher proportion of cash flow in order\nto service corporate and government debt obligations. Structural reforms and other actions that\nflatten the path of future government debt growth may be advisable at this stage of the economic\ncycle.\nGlobalization\nWorld economies and financial markets are increasingly integrated and interconnected. This trend\nis not new, but it certainly has been intensifying over the past many years. Companies increasingly\nthink about their labor force and capital investment decisions in a global manner. Investors\nincreasingly think globally about where to allocate capital. This helps explain why lower labor\ncosts in one country can have an impact on inflation and labor market developments in other\ncountries and it also helps explain why interest rate levels, stock market valuations and occasional\nmarket turmoil in one country can ripple through currencies and global markets very rapidly.\n6\n\nTrade is certainly part of this globalization trend. With the World Trade Organization, North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement and other trade agreements, global trade has increased. In many\ncases, this increase in trade, along with technological advances, has been good for the U.S. in terms\nof consumer benefits and improving corporate efficiency and profits, but, at the same time, it has\nled to painful job disruption and dislocations in many cities and towns in our nation.\nToday, a new trend has emerged which is likely surpassing globalization in terms of job\ndisruption—technology-enabled disruption (described above). That is, if your job is being\ndisrupted today, it is far more likely due to technology-enabled disruption rather than globalization.\nDallas Fed economists believe it makes sense to segment U.S. trading relationships into those\nwhich are primarily final goods versus intermediate goods. For example, our trade deficit with\nChina is primarily final goods. Conversely, our trading relationship with Mexico and Canada are\nprimarily intermediate goods. Intermediate goods trading relationships are more indicative of\nintegrated supply chain and logistics arrangements. Dallas Fed research indicates that intermediate\ngoods relationships have allowed U.S. companies to add jobs and increase their global\ncompetitiveness.\nIn this regard, Dallas Fed economists believe that, at this stage in our history, globalization is more\nlikely an opportunity for the U.S. to grow as opposed to a “threat.” With less than 5 percent of the\nworld’s population, we believe that trade is critical to future growth in the U.S. Emerging markets\nand other growing economies are increasingly important sources of demand for U.S. goods and\nservices.\nIt is critical that we accurately diagnose globalization and untangle it from the impacts of\ntechnology-enabled disruption. Dallas Fed economists believe that updating and modernizing\ntrade agreements is highly appropriate, but our research also indicates that trade is a critical\nopportunity for the U.S. to grow faster and improve the future prosperity of our nation.\nImplications\nPopular press and current national discussions tend to focus heavily on shorter-term cyclical\ndevelopments. Because the near-term outlook for GDP growth is positive, this may lull observers\ninto believing we are on a path to sustained improvement in the economic performance of the U.S.\neconomy. This belief may well distract policymakers and the public from focusing on the powerful\nstructural trends that are likely to create challenges for growth in the medium and longer term.\nLeadership is required to take a longer-term view and take steps to create a better economic future\nfor our children and grandchildren. The Dallas Fed forecasts that 2018 will be a solid year for\neconomic growth in the U.S. However, unless our nation initiates structural reforms that improve\nworkforce growth, education and skill levels of our labor force, moderate the expected path of\ngovernment debt growth, and adopts policies that allow us to capture the opportunities provided\nby globalization, we are likely to see sluggish rates of GDP growth in the medium and longer term.\n7\n\nAPPENDIX\nThe Impact of Immigration on U.S. Workforce and Demographic Trends\nDallas Fed research indicates that immigration has been a key element of economic growth in the\nU.S. However, immigration is not a purely economic issue—which is why it is a highly sensitive\nand controversial subject. The purpose of this note is to discuss the economic aspects of\nimmigration as a key element in growing the workforce and to explore alternative immigration\npolicies. This discussion is particularly important today in light of the aging U.S. workforce.\nImmigrants and their children have made up more than 50 percent of working-age population\ngrowth in the U.S. over the past 20 years.12 As shown in Chart A-1, we expect immigrants and\ntheir children to make up an even larger share of working-age population growth over the next 20\nyears as the retirement of baby boomers leads to a net decline in the working-age population of\nnative-born workers.\nChart A-1: Contribution of immigration to working-age population growth\nNet change in working-age population (25-64), millions\n30\nNatives\n20\nChildren of immigrants\n10.6 Immigrants\n15.1\n20.0\n0.3 4.8\n10\n13.3 2.4\n5.7\n10.8 7.9\n6.9 6.1\n3.8 3.5\n1.0 1.2\n0\n-2.5 -3.1 -1.8 -4.3 -3.8\n-10\n1965 to 1975 1975 to 1985 1985 to 1995 1995 to 2005 2005 to 2015 2015 to 2025 2025 to 2035\nSOURCE: Pew Research Center population estimates and projections (2015).\n8\n\nThe Mix of Immigration Flows\nAlthough immigration is becoming increasingly important to workforce growth, immigration\nflows to the U.S. have slowed over the past 10 years. The biggest declines have been in\nunauthorized immigration, in part, due to housing market declines as a result of the Great\nRecession (which led to a decline in residential construction work opportunities) as well as more\nstringent enforcement policies along the Southwest border and in the U.S. interior. Improved\neconomic conditions and falling population growth in Mexico have also played a role in\ndampening migration to the U.S.\nTemporary worker visas have recently increased, as has the flow of new legal permanent residents.\nTighter labor markets are likely playing a role in boosting the demand for hiring foreign-born\nworkers, and there is some evidence that this demand can be channeled through legal means. See\nChart A-2 for measures of immigration.\nChart A-2: Measures of U.S. immigration\nThe Importance of Skilled Immigration\nImmigration generally contributes to a larger labor force, which has benefits for economic growth,\nbut high-skilled immigration has also been shown to positively influence productivity growth.\n9\nM ig ra n t in flo w s a s a p e rc e n t o f w o rk in g\na g e p o p u la tio n\n1 .0\n0 .9\n0 .8\n0 .7\nA p p re h e n s io n s\n(s o u th w e s t b o rd e r)\n0 .6\n0 .5\nL e g a l p e rm a n e n t 0 .4\nre s id e n ts (n e w a rriv a ls )\n0 .3\n0 .2\n0 .1\n0 .01\n9 9 2 1 9 9 4 1 9 9 6 1 9 9 8 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\nN O T E : W o rk in g a g e p o p u la tio n is 1 6 to 6 4 .

This far outpaces U.S.-born college-educated workers, about one\nquarter of which major in STEM fields. High-skilled foreign-born workers have also been shown\nto patent at higher rates than native workers, largely as a result of their concentration in the STEM\nfields.13 This type of innovative activity has been shown to be a key factor in U.S. productivity\ngrowth in the post-World War II period.14\nChart A-3: College major selection, 2014-16 average\nMajors of Native-Born Workers Majors of Foreign-Born Workers\nwith a Bachelor's degree or higher with a Bachelor's degree or higher\nSTEM (Science, Technology,\n12%\nEngineering, Math)\n20%\nBusiness and Economics 25% 6%\nHumanities 7% 44%\nSocial Science 11%\n8%\nEducation\n23%\n11%\nOther\n24%\n10%\nSOURCE:American Community Surveys, 2014-2016.\nImpact of Immigration on Native Workers\nDoes immigration adversely affect the working conditions of native workers? Pia Orrenius, a\nsenior economist at the Dallas Fed, finds very little empirical evidence that immigrants create\nadverse wage effects among high-skilled workers, while wage and employment effects on low-\nskilled workers tend to be small.15 Based on her research with Madeline Zavodny, she has also\nadvocated for greater focus in the U.S. on employment- and merit-based immigration—which\ntends to bring in higher skilled workers than family-based immigration policies. They argue that\ndemand for low-skilled immigration can be met through a temporary-worker program and that this\nis preferable to relying on illegal immigration, which has historically tended to be the case.16\nWhile immigration is a politically sensitive topic, Dallas Fed research indicates that, due to aging\ndemographic trends, we need to come to grips with immigration reform in order to supplement\nlabor force growth in the U.S.17 These reforms could encourage greater emphasis on employer-\nbased and skills-based immigration. Whatever the decisions made by policymakers, this discussion\nis important to creating greater GDP growth in the U.S.\n10\n\nNotes\n1 Based on respondents with fewer than 500 employees, Texas Business Outlook Survey, Federal Reserve Bank of\nDallas, February 2018.\n2 “The Nation’s Older Population Is Still Growing, Census Bureau Reports,” press release, Census Bureau,\nwww.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/cb17-100.html.\n3 Census Bureau data.\n4 Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n5 For example, the share of the population age 65 or older is 21.5 percent in Germany, and 27.1 percent in Japan,\naccording to UN World Population Prospects 2017 data.\n6 “Global Deals Surge Past $1tn at Fastest Ever Pace,” Financial Times, March 21, 2018.\n7 According to the Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies’ Survey of Adult Skills (2012,\n2015) by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the U.S. ranks 17th in literacy and\n23rd in math out of 29 countries and 15th in problem-solving in technology-rich environments out of 26 countries.\nAn average of scores across the literacy and math categories places the U.S. 20th.\n8 According to the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) (2015) by the OECD, the U.S. ranks 19th\nin science, 20th in reading and 31st in mathematics out of 35 OECD countries. An average of scores across the three\ncategories places the U.S. 24th.\n9 Hanushek and Woessmann (2016) estimate that a sustained 25-point increase in U.S. students’ average PISA\nscores could lead to an increase of 0.5 percentage points in potential gross domestic product growth in the longer\nrun.

Kaplan\nBackground\nThe target federal funds rate stands in a range of 100 to 125 basis points. The Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) raised the federal funds rate in March as well as June of this year. I voted for\nboth of these increases. I also supported the FOMC’s decision in September to begin the process\nof gradually reducing the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. I believe that the gradual and\nphased-in design of this plan should allow the Fed to reduce the size of its Treasury and mortgage-\nbacked securities portfolios without materially impacting either of these important markets.\nBalancing Full Employment and Price Stability\nAs of November 2017, several key labor market indicators suggest that the U.S. economy is at or\nnear full employment. The headline unemployment rate and other measures of labor market\nutilization are now at or below pre-recession lows. In addition, Dallas Fed economists expect the\nU.S. economy to continue to grow at rates which should cause labor market conditions to tighten\nfurther. While real wage growth has been sluggish, we are beginning to see welcome signs of\nincreasing wage pressures which are consistent with removal of remaining slack from the labor\nmarket.\nInflation has remained below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target. Moreover, the 12-month\nDallas Fed Trimmed Mean PCE, a measure of core inflation (which Dallas Fed economists believe\nprovides a better indicator of underlying inflationary trends than headline readings), started the\nyear at 1.9 percent and has drifted down to 1.6 percent in the latest reading. While some of this\nrecent decline is likely transitory, my view is that some of the more persistent weakness is due to\nstructural forces, which are limiting the pricing power of businesses and are likely having a muting\neffect on wage pressures for certain types of workers. These structural forces include technology-\nenabled disruption and, to a lesser extent, globalization (see Appendix A, Technology-Enabled\nDisruption and Its Implications).\nHow should the FOMC address the current situation in which one aspect of our mandate is being\nmet while another objective is not yet being met? In this essay, I intend to address this question.\nThe Fed’s Mandate\nTo help the public understand its framework for monetary policy, the FOMC released in January\n2012, and reaffirmed in January 2017, its “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy\nStrategy.”1 This document articulates the FOMC’s commitment to fulfilling its statutory mandate\n2\n\nfrom Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest\nrates.\nIn public discussions, Fed officials typically express this framework as a “dual mandate”—full\nemployment and price stability. The Fed uses a variety of economic and labor market indicators\nto judge whether the full employment objective is being met. To judge whether the price stability\nobjective is being met, the FOMC has articulated a “symmetric” inflation goal of 2 percent, as\nmeasured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).\nThe term “symmetric” means that the FOMC would be equally concerned if inflation ran either\npersistently above or persistently below this 2 percent objective.\nThese dual-mandate longer-term goals are generally complementary. However, in those cases\nwhere they are not, the FOMC has said that it will seek to follow a “balanced approach” in\npromoting these goals, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially\ndifferent time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels\njudged consistent with its mandate.\nThe Current Situation\nAs we sit here today, the headline unemployment rate stands at approximately 4.1 percent. In\naddition, our Dallas Fed economists also look at the U-6 rate, a broader measure that includes the\npercent of unemployed, plus the number of discouraged workers, plus people working part time\nwho want to work full time. This measure of labor market utilization now stands at approximately\n7.9 percent, matching its prerecession low.\nIn addition, we also look closely at the labor force participation rate (the number of employed plus\nunemployed looking for a job as a percentage of the population 16 and older), which now stands\nat 62.7 percent. This compares with a participation rate of 66 percent in 2007. Our economists\nbelieve that a majority of the decline in participation is due to the aging of the population and, as\nsuch, we believe that current participation levels are consistent with an economy that is at or near\nfull employment. Looking ahead, Dallas Fed economists expect this aging trend to continue in the\nU.S., as well as across almost all advanced economies.\nOver the next 10 years, we expect that, due to aging of the workforce, the U.S. participation rate\nwill decline further to 61 percent.2 This aging trend will likely reduce the rate of labor force growth\nin the United States. Because GDP growth is comprised of growth in the workforce plus gains in\nlabor productivity, weaker expected workforce growth is likely to negatively affect potential GDP\ngrowth in the years ahead—unless steps are taken to mitigate these effects.\nThe question arises as to the actual level of maximum sustainable employment, which can be\ndefined as the maximum level of employment that does not generate undue price pressures.\nBecause inflation pressures typically manifest themselves with a lag, this is a judgment that is\nmuch easier to make in hindsight than in real time. Having said this, Dallas Fed economists\n3\n\ncurrently believe that we are either at or near the level of maximum sustainable employment, and\nmay well move materially beyond maximum sustainable employment sometime in 2018.\nRegarding inflation, we have been notably running behind our 2 percent target for the past several\nyears. My own view has been that, while cyclical inflationary pressures are building, which should\nbecome more apparent over time, these pressures are being at least partially offset by the structural\nheadwinds of technology-enabled disruption (see Appendix A) and, to a lesser extent,\nglobalization. Our Dallas Fed economists believe that, as labor market conditions continue to\ntighten, cyclical inflationary forces should ultimately offset these structural headwinds such that\nwe will likely achieve our 2 percent target in the medium term. We are of course mindful that\nprogress in reaching our inflation mandate may well be slower and more uneven than many\nanalysts currently anticipate.\nIn summary, as a policymaker, I am balancing a labor market that is likely to become increasingly\noverheated in the months ahead with a level of inflation that is running somewhat below our 2\npercent goal. While I believe cyclical inflationary forces are building, there is some question\nregarding how long it will take to reach our price stability objective.\nMonitoring for Evidence of Building Imbalances\nAs a central banker, I want to be vigilant to imbalances and distortions that can build as a result of\naccommodative monetary policy. I have argued that monetary policy accommodation is not “free”\n—there are costs to accommodation in the form of distortions and imbalances in consumer\ndecisions as well as in investing, hiring and other business decisions. More specifically, experience\nsuggests that the greater the overshoot of full employment, the more difficult it is to unwind\nimbalances when growth ultimately slows—as it certainly must.\nWhen excesses ultimately need to be unwound, this can result in a sudden downward shift in\ndemand for investment and consumer related durable goods. There are surprisingly few historical\nexamples of “soft landings” in cases where employment has risen above its maximum sustainable\nlevel.\nIt is of course possible that “this time will be different,” but as I assess the condition of the U.S.\neconomy, I am carefully monitoring evidence that might suggest growing risks of real imbalances,\nwhich could threaten the sustainability of the current economic expansion. For example, the\nheadline unemployment rate has fallen by 70 basis points over the past year, nearly matching the\naverage rate of decline over the prior seven years of the expansion. If this rate of decline continues,\nthis will further tighten labor market conditions and would likely add to excesses and imbalances\naccumulating in the economy.\nExcesses can also manifest themselves in financial imbalances. While I would prefer to rely\nprimarily on macroprudential policy tools to manage financial imbalances, I am nevertheless\nmonitoring various measures of potential financial excess. I monitor these and other market\n4\n\nmeasures because I am aware that, as excesses build, we are more vulnerable to reversals which\nhave the potential to cause a rapid tightening in financial conditions, which in turn, can lead to a\nslowing in economic activity. Examples of potential excesses might include:\n The U.S. stock market capitalization now stands at approximately 135 percent of GDP, the\nhighest since 1999/2000.3 Correspondingly, commercial real estate cap rates and valuation\nmeasures of debt and other markets appear notably extended.\n Measures of stock market volatility are historically low.4 We have now gone 12 months\nwithout a 3 percent correction in the U.S. market.5 This is extraordinarily unusual.\n While household debt to GDP has improved over the past eight years, corporate debt is\nnow at record highs.6 I am not overly concerned about current levels of corporate debt\nbecause, importantly, financial sector leverage has declined substantially since the Great\nRecession. However, U.S. government debt now stands at approximately 75 percent of\nGDP,7 and the present value of unfunded entitlements now stands at approximately $49\ntrillion.8 In my view, the projected path of U.S. government debt to GDP is unlikely to be\nsustainable—and has been made to appear more manageable due to today’s historically\nlow interest rates.\n Debt and equity securities trading volumes have markedly declined over the past several\nyears. For example, NYSE equity trading volume on average for 2017 is down 51 percent\nfrom 2007 levels, while the NYSE market cap has increased 28 percent over the same time\nperiod.9 I would also note that margin debt is now at record-high levels.10 In the event of a\nsell-off, high levels of margin debt can encourage additional selling, which could, in turn,\nlead to a more rapid tightening of financial conditions. Sufficient market trading liquidity\nis key to managing the resulting increased volume. I am cognizant that lower trading\nvolumes may be due, in part, to low levels of market volatility and may also be due to\nregulations such as the Volcker rule.\nIn the context of managing potential financial imbalances, I believe that we have been well served\nby strong macroprudential bank regulatory policies which have created tough capital requirements\nand regular stress testing for large systemically important institutions. These measures have helped\nguard against excessive debt buildup and creation of other imbalances which often accompany\nelevated levels of asset valuation.\nI strongly favor a prudent review of Dodd–Frank and the Volcker rule, as well as regulatory relief\nfor small- and mid-sized banks. However, I also believe that maintaining strong macroprudential\npolicies for big banks—particularly stringent capital requirements and rigorous annual stress\ntesting—is very important for managing potential financial imbalances at this stage in the\neconomic cycle.\n5\n\nImplications for the Stance of Monetary Policy\nIn assessing progress in reaching our dual mandate, I am increasingly cognizant of the risks\nposed by potential economic and financial imbalances. Such imbalances, if allowed to build,\nhave the potential to, at some point, threaten the sustainability of the expansion and the\nattainment of our dual-mandate objectives.\nThe FOMC’s stated strategy indicates that when objectives are in conflict—such as appears to be\nthe case today—we are committed to following a “balanced approach” to policy. This approach\ninvolves assessing “other” factors, such as the magnitude of deviations from our longer-run\ninflation goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessment of its maximum\nlevel, as well as the timing of expected return to mandated and/or sustainable levels. Put more\nplainly, even though we are not meeting our inflation objective, the size of the expected full\nemployment overshoot is growing and should be taken into account in assessing appropriate\nmonetary policy actions.\nRegarding inflation, I would reiterate that cyclical forces are building, which should increasingly\noffset the structural forces of technology-enabled disruption and, to a lesser extent, globalization.\nI am also mindful that if we wait too long to see actual evidence of inflation, we may get behind\nthe curve and have to subsequently raise rates more rapidly. This type of rapid rate rise has the\npotential to increase the risk of recession.\nLastly, due to the structural headwinds of aging demographics and slowing workforce growth in\nthe U.S. as well as most developed economies, I believe that the neutral nominal rate of interest is\nlikely in the neighborhood of 2.5 percent—materially lower than we are historically accustomed.\nAs such, I think it is important that, to the extent possible, monetary policy accommodation be\nremoved in a gradual and patient manner. I would like to avoid a situation where the FOMC is\nplaying “catch-up” in raising interest rates.\nTaking all these factors into account, and from a risk management point of view, I believe it will\nlikely be appropriate, in the near future, to take the next step in the process of removing monetary\naccommodation. This should be done in the context of an overall strategy of removing\naccommodation in a gradual and patient manner. I believe this strategy will increase the likelihood\nof sustaining and extending the economic expansion in the U.S.\n6\n\nAppendix A\nTechnology-Enabled Disruption and Its Implications\nAs I have been discussing for the past two years, technology-enabled disruption means workers\nincreasingly being replaced by technology. It also means that existing business models are being\nsupplanted by new models, often technology-enabled, for more efficiently selling or distributing\ngoods and services. In addition, consumers are increasingly being able to use technology to shop\nfor goods and services at lower prices with greater convenience—having the impact of reducing\nthe pricing power of businesses which has, in turn, caused them to further intensify their focus on\ncreating greater operational efficiencies. These trends appear to be accelerating.\nIt is likely that disruption is a factor in economic outcomes being increasingly skewed by\neducational attainment levels of workers. That is, for those who have a college education, the\nunemployment rate stands at 2.0 percent and the labor force participation rate is 73.7 percent. If\nyou have some college, the unemployment rate is 3.7 percent and participation is 65.8 percent; a\nhigh school diploma, the unemployment rate is 4.3 percent and participation is 56.9 percent; and\nsome high school education, the unemployment rate is 5.7 percent and participation rate is 46.1\npercent.\nIncreasingly, workers with lower levels of educational attainment are seeing their jobs restructured\nor eliminated. Unless they are retrained, these workers often see their productivity and incomes\ndecline as a result of disruption. This may help explain the muted levels of wage gains and overall\nlabor productivity growth we see in the U.S. as well as other advanced economies.\nThe impact of technology-enabled disruption on the workforce is likely less susceptible to\nmonetary policy—it requires structural reforms. The reforms could include improving early\nchildhood literacy and overall college readiness in order to increase the percentage of students who\ngraduate college in six years or less—now estimated at 59 percent in the U.S.11 It would also\ninclude stepped-up efforts to increase middle-skills training in cities across the U.S. in order to\nimprove employment, close the skills gap (not enough workers to fill skilled jobs) and raise worker\nproductivity. These initiatives could improve educational attainment levels in order to help our\ncitizens better thrive in a world that increasingly demands greater education, training and\nadaptability.\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive competitors, have\nbeen more cautious about making capacity-expansion decisions as well as investing in major\ncapital projects. It may also help explain the record level of merger and acquisition activity globally\nover the last few years, as companies attempt to address disruptive changes and lack of pricing\npower by achieving greater scale economies in order to maintain or improve profit margins.\n7\n\n1 See the statement at: www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.\n2 Refers to total participation rate for those age 16 and older; estimates are as of October 2017.

    "text": "The Neutral Rate of Interest\nRobert S. Kaplan\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nOctober 24, 2018\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jennifer Chamberlain, Daniel Crowley, Jim Dolmas,\nMarc Giannoni, Everett Grant, James Hoard, Evan Koenig, Karel Mertens, Alex Richter, William Simmons, Kathy Thacker,\nJoe Tracy and Mark Wynne in preparing these remarks.\n\nThe Neutral Rate of Interest\nRobert S. Kaplan\nIn the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Federal Reserve raised\nthe federal funds rate to a range of 2 to 2.25 percent. In our statement announcing the decision, we\nceased to include language that described the current stance of monetary policy as\n“accommodative.”\nI supported the most recent federal funds rate increase. In my recent speeches and essays, I have\nbeen arguing that the Federal Reserve should be gradually and patiently raising the federal funds\nrate until we get into the range of a “neutral stance.” Once we’ve reached that point, I intend to\nassess the outlook for the U.S. economy and look at a broad range of factors before deciding what\nfurther actions, if any, might then be appropriate.\nOne challenge in moving toward a neutral stance is the inherently imprecise and uncertain nature\nof estimating what constitutes “neutral.” This judgment is more of an art than a science and\ninvolves observing and analyzing a wide variety of factors. The uncertainty of this judgment is\ncomplicated by the fact that 2018 U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been\nsubstantially aided by sizable fiscal stimulus, whose impact is likely to fade somewhat in 2019 and\nfurther in 2020.\nThe purpose of this essay is to explore a number of the key issues associated with using the neutral\nrate concept in formulating monetary policy. In particular, I will discuss several of the challenges\nassociated with estimating this rate, describe limitations on the use of this concept, and explain\nhow it might best be used in debating and determining the appropriate path for the U.S. federal\nfunds rate.\nWhat Is the Neutral Rate?\nThe neutral rate is the theoretical federal funds rate at which the stance of Federal Reserve\nmonetary policy is neither accommodative nor restrictive. It is the short-term real interest rate\nconsistent with the economy maintaining full employment with associated price stability.\nYou won’t find the neutral rate quoted on your computer screen or in the financial section of the\nnewspaper. The neutral rate is an “inferred” rate—that is, it is estimated based on various analyses\nand observations.\nThis rate is not static. It is a dynamic rate that varies based on a range of economic and financial\nmarket factors. A number of economists inside as well as outside the Federal Reserve System do\nextensive work to model and estimate this rate. While the estimates produced by these models can\ndiffer substantially, they all typically draw on a variety of inputs which reflect, to varying degrees,\nprospects for U.S. economic growth, global growth and various aspects of overall financial\nconditions. (See the Appendix, “Modeling the Neutral Rate.”)\nThe neutral rate can be measured for different time horizons. Estimates of the “shorter-run” neutral\nrate are typically influenced by nonmonetary drivers of near-term GDP growth such as changes in\ncurrent fiscal policy.\n1\n\nEstimates of the “longer-run” neutral rate are typically influenced by nonmonetary drivers which\nreflect more enduring secular factors such as expected medium-term growth in the workforce and\nthe expected rate of increase in labor productivity. Productivity growth, in turn, is influenced by\ninvestment in capital equipment and technology, regulatory policies, and policies which impact\nthe education and skill levels of the U.S. workforce. In addition, the longer-run neutral rate is likely\nto be influenced by trends in the global supply and demand for safe and liquid financial assets.\nTo illustrate the difference between short- and long-run measures, I will use an example regarding\nfiscal policy. If the federal government passes a substantial tax cut or increases government\nspending, it may create a short-term stimulus that materially increases near-term GDP, which will\nlikely be accompanied by an increase in the shorter-run neutral rate. However, if these policies do\nnot fundamentally increase the medium- or longer-term growth potential of the U.S. economy,\nthey may have only a marginal impact on the longer-run neutral rate.\nIn assessing the stance of monetary policy and making judgments about the future path of the\nfederal funds rate, I prefer to focus on measures of the neutral rate that de-emphasize the impact\nof more volatile, shorter-run transitory factors. I tend to focus more on a range of indicators that\nreflect the sustainable (medium-term and longer-run) growth potential for the U.S. economy.\nWhy Is the Neutral Rate Important?\nDespite the fact that judging the level of the neutral rate is inherently uncertain and imprecise,\nmany of us at the Federal Reserve pay close attention to the various models that seek to estimate\nthis rate. The reason is that, despite the relatively wide confidence bands around these estimates,\nthey can provide an indication, albeit imperfect, of whether our monetary stance is\naccommodative, neutral or restrictive. Making a judgment on the stance of monetary policy is a\nkey part of my job as a central banker.\nMonetary policy is accommodative when the federal funds rate is below the neutral rate. When\nthis is the case, economic slack will tend to diminish—the economy will tend to grow faster, the\nunemployment rate should decline and inflation should tend to rise. When the federal funds rate is\nabove the neutral rate, monetary policy is restrictive. When this is the case, economic slack will\ntend to increase—economic growth will tend to slow, the unemployment rate should tend to rise\nand the rate of inflation should be more muted or decline. The challenge for the Federal Reserve\nis managing this process and getting the balance right.\nA good analogy is comparing this judgment to the assessment you typically make in approaching\nan intersection while driving your car. Should you be pressing on the accelerator, easing off the\naccelerator or pressing your foot on the brakes? In this analogy, being accommodative is equivalent\nto pressing on the accelerator; being restrictive is equivalent to stepping on the brakes. If the\nFederal Reserve is raising the federal funds rate in order to remove accommodation and move\ntoward a neutral stance, this is analogous to easing your foot off the accelerator. Every driver is\nfamiliar with making these judgments even though they are inherently imprecise and uncertain—\nand tend to be made through “feel” by assessing a variety of factors.\nWhile I look at the more volatile and imprecise measures of the shorter-run neutral rate, I am\nhesitant to base my monetary policy judgments on these potentially transitory fluctuations. I prefer\nto adjust the federal funds rate in response to my assessments of economic conditions, including\n2\n\nmy outlook for inflation, in a patient and gradual manner. This approach is more consistent with\ngreater emphasis on my estimates of the longer-run neutral rate.\nAs mentioned earlier, because monetary policy acts with a lag, policymakers have to make\njudgments on the stance and direction of policy well in advance, just as a driver has to make a\ndecision to speed up or slow down well before reaching an intersection. When driving, if you wait\ntoo long to ease up on the accelerator, and consequently need to slam on the brakes, you risk losing\ncontrol of your vehicle. Similarly, keeping monetary policy accommodative for too long can lead\nto creation of excesses and imbalances that can be very difficult to address—and can create a need\nfor the Federal Reserve to play “catch-up,” which has historically increased the probability of\nrecession. History has shown that some moderation can, in fact, increase the likelihood of\nextending an economic expansion.\nA Reality Check: Historical Trends in Global Interest Rates\nAs a reality check on estimates of the neutral federal funds rate, I find it very useful to look at\ntrends in market-determined interest rates—which are not theoretical and can be observed. For\nexample, it is worth noting that nominal yields on long-term bonds in the Group of Seven (G-7)\ncountries—Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States—\nhave recently touched their lowest levels in the past 150 years (Chart 1). One driver of the decline\nin nominal yields since the 1970s is likely a significant reduction in longer-run inflation\nexpectations.\n3\n\nChanges in inflation-adjusted global government bond yields should, over time, reflect changes in\nthe longer-run neutral real rate of interest. After adjusting for inflation, the real interest rates on\nsafe and liquid assets—primarily global government bonds of various countries—have declined\nsignificantly over the past 30 years, a decline that precedes the Great Recession. Our economists\nat the Dallas Fed believe that this decline in real interest rates is likely due to lower rates of trend\neconomic growth in these various countries, at least partly as a result of demographic shifts\n(particularly aging populations) and lower rates of trend productivity growth.1\nAnother major factor in the downward trend in bond yields is the substantial growth in worldwide\ndemand for safe and liquid assets arising from a considerable increase in the size of pension funds,\nglobal central bank balance sheets, and other fixed-income investment pools. When global\ninvestors look for safety and liquidity, they naturally gravitate to U.S. Treasury bonds as well as\nother sovereign obligations.\nAs financial markets have become much more globally integrated, the search for safe assets has\nincreasingly become global. In this search, much has been made of the shortage of safe assets in\nwhich these global pools of money can be invested. The impact has been to drive down interest\nrates on government debt in the U.S. as well as globally. Dallas Fed economist Marc Giannoni and\nhis research co-authors have argued that the increased demand for safety and liquidity explains a\ndecline of more than 60 basis points in long-term real rates around the world over the past two\ndecades.2\nIt stands to reason that, as global interest rates decline, our estimates of the neutral rate of interest\nhave also correspondingly declined.\nNeutral Rate Uncertainty and the Challenge of ForecastingProductivity Growth\nAs I mentioned earlier, I tend to view estimates of shorter-run and longer-run neutral rates as just\none factor among several indicators which influence my assessment of the stance of monetary\npolicy. I also rely on my regular conversations with a broad range of business contacts, our Federal\nReserve business surveys, assessments of labor market dynamics, inflation indicators, the behavior\nof various financial market indicators and the shape of the yield curve in assessing overall\neconomic conditions.\nIn this context, I use estimates of the neutral rate as part of an overall mosaic of indicators which\nhelp shape my overall assessments of current and future economic activity. When looking at\nneutral rate estimates, I am highly cognizant that there is likely to be significant disagreement\nbetween different models, and their outputs can be volatile based on changes in economic and\nfinancial conditions. I always keep in mind that these estimates are inherently uncertain and\nimprecise.\nOne reason for the uncertainty and imprecision is that potential GDP growth is a key driver of the\nneutral rate—and this is inherently challenging to forecast. GDP growth is comprised of growth in\nthe labor force plus growth in the rate of productivity. I would emphasize that, while economists\nare reasonably proficient in estimating likely changes in labor force growth, it is far more difficult\nand challenging for economists to anticipate changes in the sustainable rate of improvement in\nproductivity.\n4\n\nIf the rate of workforce growth is likely to slow, can this be offset by improvements in\nproductivity? Higher rates of sustained productivity growth would mean, all things being equal, a\nhigher neutral interest rate. The uncertainty regarding future improvements in productivity creates\nuncertainty for estimates of the neutral rate of interest. Chart 2 illustrates the difficulty in\nforecasting productivity growth by comparing actual productivity growth in the U.S. versus\nforecasts.\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nCurrently, with the U.S. unemployment rate at approximately 3.7 percent and the headline personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) rate of inflation at slightly more than 2 percent, I believe that the\nFederal Reserve is achieving its dual-mandate objectives.\nAs we reach our dual-mandate objectives, I believe that the Federal Reserve should be gradually\neasing off the accelerator—we no longer need to be stimulating the U.S. economy. As such, I\nbelieve we should be gradually and patiently moving toward a neutral policy stance.\nDue to improvements in expectations for near-term U.S. economic growth, estimates of the\nshorter-run neutral rate have risen over the past 12 months. However, because these shorter-run\nestimates are subject to great uncertainty and can be heavily influenced by near-term transitory\nfactors, I tend to focus a bit more heavily on expectations for medium- and longer-term growth in\nthe U.S. economy. As a consequence, estimates of the longer-run neutral rate weigh more heavily\non my thinking.\nAs mentioned earlier, it is our expectation at the Dallas Fed that the impact of recent fiscal\nstimulus, which has substantially contributed to 2018 economic growth, is likely to wane\nsomewhat in 2019 and further in 2020. At the same time that the recent stimulus begins to wane,\n5\n\nour Dallas Fed economists believe that the rate of workforce growth, a key driver of longer-term\nGDP growth, is likely to slow due to aging-population demographics.\nA key question is whether this slowing in workforce growth will be offset by improvements in the\nrate of productivity growth in the U.S. How the rate of productivity growth unfolds in 2019 and\n2020, and beyond, will have a significant impact on future GDP growth. Because the sustainable\nrate of productivity growth is inherently difficult to predict, I have been somewhat cautious in my\njudgments regarding the appropriate pace and ultimate level of the federal funds rate.\nTo help make these assessments, I carefully monitor the Treasury yield curve. This curve serves\nas a reality check for my outlook regarding the U.S. and global economies. As of the date of this\nessay, the one-year Treasury rate stands at 2.65 percent, the two-year stands at 2.88 percent and\nthe 10-year and 30-year Treasury rates are at 3.15 percent and 3.36 percent, respectively.3 In my\nopinion, the one- and two-year short-term rates are substantially reflective of communications by\nthe Federal Reserve regarding our expectations for the path of the federal funds rate. I think those\nexpectations are heavily priced into these shorter-term Treasury securities. While I believe the\nmore muted rise in the 10- and 30-year Treasuries is reflective of a substantial amount of global\nliquidity and demand for safe assets, I also think the yield levels of these securities are consistent\nwith more sluggish expectations for future economic growth in the U.S. and globally.\nI am also cognizant that the 10-year Treasury has recently moved from 2.90 percent at the\nbeginning of September to 3.15 percent today.4 This may reflect several factors, including greater\noptimism regarding the prospects for future GDP growth.\nEach of us around the FOMC table submits quarterly, as part of the Summary of Economic\nProjections (sometimes referred to as the SEP or the “dot plot”), our best judgments regarding the\nappropriate path for the federal funds rate and the “longer-run” federal funds rate. My longer-run\nrate submission is my best estimate of the longer-run neutral rate for the U.S. economy. In the\nSeptember SEP, the range of submissions by FOMC participants for the longer-run rate was 2.5 to\n3.5 percent, and the median estimate was 3.0 percent.\nMy own estimate of the longer-run neutral rate is modestly below the median of the estimates\nmade by my colleagues. My suggested rate path for 2019 is also modestly below the 3 to 3.25\npercent median of the ranges suggested by my fellow FOMC participants. My SEP estimates are\nconsistent with my recent public statements which indicated that my base case for 2019 is to\ngradually and patiently raise the federal funds rate into a range of 2.5 to 2.75 percent or, more\nlikely, into a range of 2.75 to 3 percent.\nOf course, my judgments regarding both the stance of monetary policy and the appropriate path of\nthe federal funds rate are subject to change based on incoming economic and financial inputs which\nwill either confirm or cause me to adjust my views. In particular, as we proceed along this path, I\nwill be regularly assessing the outlook for the U.S. economy and also closely monitoring prospects\nfor global economic growth, as well as reviewing indicators of overall financial conditions and a\nrange of other factors in order to update my judgments regarding the appropriate pace and precise\nnumber of moves necessary to get to a neutral stance.\n6\n\nI intend to avoid prejudging what, if any, further actions we should take once we get into the range\nof our best estimate of a neutral stance. I intend to make that judgment sometime in the spring or\nsummer of 2019 based on the economic outlook at that time.\nConclusion\nMy purpose in writing this essay has been to discuss the neutral rate, explore several of the key\nissues surrounding this concept, and point out that it is just one aspect of assessing the stance of\nU.S. monetary policy. It is worth emphasizing that there are limitations to using the neutral rate\nconcept—estimates of the neutral rate are imprecise and uncertain, as are estimates of the natural\nrate of unemployment, potential GDP and other theoretical concepts we utilize to judge the state\nof the U.S. economy. One key reason for uncertainty regarding estimates of the neutral rate is the\ndifficulty in predicting future changes in the sustainable rate of productivity growth.\nDespite its inherent uncertainties, I believe that the neutral rate concept is a useful tool. However,\nbecause it has limitations, it is best used in conjunction with a broad range of other economic\nanalyses as well as extensive conversations with private sector leaders and a focus on identifying\nand differentiating between cyclical and structural drivers of the U.S. and global economies.\n7\n\nAPPENDIX\nModeling the Neutral Rate (r*)\nThere are various models in use inside and outside the Federal Reserve that produce estimates of\nr*. One estimate I closely monitor is produced by Federal Reserve economist Thomas Laubach\nand New York Fed President John Williams.5 Another estimate is done by Dallas Fed economist\nEvan Koenig along with Alan Armen,6 and yet another is produced by Dallas Fed Research\nDirector Marc Giannoni along with Marco Del Negro, Domenico Giannone and Andrea\nTambalotti (referred to as “DGGT” in Chart A-1) of the New York Fed.7\nThese models differ in terms of their structural assumptions and the data they use to produce\nestimates of the neutral rate. For example, Laubach–Williams uses data on real GDP, core PCE\ninflation, oil prices, import prices and the federal funds rate as inputs for their model. This model\nattempts to estimate an output gap to assess the neutral rate of interest. The Koenig model uses\ndata on long-term bond yields, survey measures of long-term GDP growth and long-term inflation\nas inputs for its estimates of long-run r*. Giannoni’s model uses a broad set of key macroeconomic\nand financial data series to generate estimates of the neutral rate at different time horizons.8 Chart\nA-1 provides a summary of the outputs of these models over the past 30 years.\n8\n\nWhile these models produce estimates which can vary widely, they all agree that the longer-run\nneutral rate of interest has declined over the past several years in comparison with the period 1985–\n2005. Our Dallas Fed economists believe that drivers of the declines in estimates of the longer-run\nneutral rate include lower trend GDP growth due to relatively sluggish productivity growth and to\ndemographics—namely, an aging population, which slows workforce growth. Increased global\ndemand for safe, liquid assets also contributes to the decline in estimates.\nSeparately, our economists find that their shorter-run r* estimates now exceed their longer-run\nestimates (see Chart A-2 for estimates of shorter-run r*). They attribute this divergence to recent\nfiscal stimulus and other factors that have boosted the confidence of households and firms, leading\nthem to borrow and invest.\n9\n\nNotes\n1 See, for example, “Measuring the World Natural Rate of Interest,” by Mark Wynne and Ren Zhang, Globalization\nand Monetary Policy Institute Working Paper no. 315, revised June 2017,\nwww.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2017/0315.pdf, and “Global Trends in Interest Rates,” by\nMarco Del Negro, Domenico Giannone, Marc Giannoni and Andrea Tambalotti, Working Paper no. 1812, Federal\nReserve Bank of Dallas, 2018, www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2018/wp1812.pdf.\n2 See note 1, Del Negro et al.\n3 As of Oct. 24, 2018, 8:10 a.m. ET.\n4 Yield for beginning of September is as of Sept. 4, 2018.\n5 “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” by Thomas Laubach and John C.

    "text": "Discussion of Economic Conditions and\nKey Challenges Facing the U.S. Economy\nRobert S. Kaplan\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas\nFebruary 21, 2018\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\nI would like to acknowledge the contributions of Tyler Atkinson, Jim Dolmas, James Hoard, Marc Giannoni, Evan Koenig,\nAlex Musatov, Pia Orrenius, William Simmons, Elizabeth Sobel Blum and Dianne Tunnell in preparing these remarks.\n\nDiscussion of Economic Conditions and Key Challenges\nFacing the U.S. Economy\nRobert S. Kaplan\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in its January meeting decided to leave the federal\nfunds rate unchanged in a range of 125 to 150 basis points. In our FOMC statement after the\nmeeting, the committee explained that it expects “economic conditions will evolve in a manner\nthat will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.” The purpose of this essay is\nto briefly discuss my views regarding economic conditions, the implications for monetary policy\nand address a few of the fundamental challenges facing the U.S. economy.\nEconomic Conditions\nThe Dallas Fed expects that U.S. GDP will grow at approximately 2.5 to 2.75 percent in 2018. We\nbelieve that consumer spending will be strong, owing to a healthy jobs market and the multiyear\nimprovement in household balance sheets. We also expect business investment to be stronger than\nin 2017, and we believe that improved global growth could also help support economic growth in\nthe U.S.\nOur forecast reflects the positive near-term impact of the recent tax legislation. It is our view that\nthe bulk of this impact will be felt in 2018 and to a lesser extent in 2019 and 2020.\nBased on our forecast, we expect U.S. labor market conditions to tighten this year. We forecast\nthat headline unemployment will decline from 4.1 percent to approximately 3.6 percent by year\nend. We also expect U-6—a measure of labor slack that tracks the number of unemployed plus\n“marginally attached workers” (workers who indicate that they would like a job but have stopped\nlooking for one) plus those working part time for economic reasons—to decline from 8.2 percent\nto well below 8 percent. It is the judgment of Dallas Fed economists that current levels of headline\nunemployment as well as U-6 are indicative of an economy that is either at or has moved past the\nlevel of full employment.\nOur economists expect cyclical inflation pressures to build during 2018. While these pressures will\nlikely be at least partially offset by the impact of technology-enabled disruption (see Appendix A),\nI believe the headline rate of inflation is likely to firm during the year, and we are likely to make\nprogress toward reaching the Fed’s 2 percent longer-run inflation target. I also believe we’ll see\nfirming in the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean measure of core inflation, which excludes extreme price\nmovements (both high and low) in goods and services. This measure continues to be the Dallas\nFed’s preferred gauge of underlying inflation in the U.S.\nImplications for Monetary Policy\nBased on these expectations, I believe the Federal Reserve should be gradually and patiently\nraising the federal funds rate during 2018. While my views on the appropriate path of policy will\nbe impacted by economic conditions as they unfold during the year, I continue to believe that\n2\n\ngradual and patient removals of accommodation will increase the likelihood of extending the\neconomic expansion in the U.S.\nHistory suggests that if the Fed waits too long to remove accommodation at this stage in the\neconomic cycle, excesses and imbalances begin to build, and the Fed ultimately has to play catch-\nup. In my judgment, getting behind the curve and then trying to catch up would increase the\nlikelihood of recession in the U.S.\nChallenges Facing the U.S. Economy\nWhile Dallas Fed economists forecast strong economic growth in 2018, they also expect growth\nto moderate to 1.75 to 2 percent by 2020. In addition, our view is that “potential” GDP growth, the\nsustainable underlying growth capability of the U.S. economy, is approximately 1.75 percent. This\nlevel of potential GDP growth is lower than we’ve historically been accustomed due to several\nstructural issues discussed below. Dallas Fed economists believe that the current level of growth\nabove potential is due to accommodative monetary policy as well as recent fiscal stimulus. As the\nimpact of this stimulation wanes, we expect U.S. GDP growth to trend back toward potential.\nWhy is potential GDP growth lower than we have historically been accustomed? Specifically, why\nare current assessments of potential GDP growth materially lower than during the 1990s and early\n2000s? What has changed?\nThere are a few key structural drivers that are impacting prospects for medium-term economic\ngrowth in the U.S. How we manage and adapt to these structural challenges will fundamentally\nimpact prospects for future growth and prosperity in the U.S.\nAging Demographics\nGDP growth is composed of growth in the workforce plus growth in labor productivity. Due to the\naging of our population, workforce growth in the U.S. is slowing and is likely to continue slowing.\nThe labor force participation rate has declined from 66 percent in 2007 to approximately 63 percent\ntoday. Dallas Fed economists believe that the bulk of this decline is due to aging of the workforce.\nUnfortunately, our economists believe that these demographic trends will cause the labor force\nparticipation rate to decline to below 61 percent over the next 10 years.\nPossible remedies to the effects of aging demographics could include incentives for workers to\nwork later in their careers, inducing discouraged workers to return to the workforce and/or other\nmeasures that could help improve the rate of workforce growth in the U.S.\nIn addition, immigration has historically been an important element of our nation’s workforce\ngrowth. Based on published data, our Dallas Fed economists estimate that immigrants and their\nchildren have comprised over half of the workforce growth in the U.S. over the last 20 years and\nexpect this group to comprise an even higher percentage over the next 20 years.1\nOur economists have done extensive research regarding U.S. immigration as well as the\nimmigration policies of other countries. This research indicates that it would be appropriate for the\n3\n\nU.S. to consider reforms to the current immigration system to more heavily take into account\nimmigrant skills as well as other employment-based criteria. Such reforms could help enhance the\neconomic and societal benefits from immigration.2 Whatever policy decisions are made, it is clear\nthat the resolution of current debates relating to immigration policy has the potential to either\nsupplement or create headwinds for future workforce growth in the U.S.\nOne potential offset to these demographic trends could be improvements in labor productivity.\nLabor productivity is a key driver of GDP growth. However, average growth in labor productivity\nover the past decade has been sluggish at approximately 1.1 percent per year.3 Labor productivity\ngrowth averaged approximately 2 percent from 1977 through 2007. While Dallas Fed economists\nare hopeful that increased capital spending could help improve labor force productivity, they also\nobserve that technological progress may not contribute to productivity growth as much as it once\ndid. One reason for this sluggishness may be lagging skills and educational achievement levels of\nthe U.S. workforce.\nThe Skills Gap and Lagging Educational Achievement Levels\nThe U.S. is a leader in many areas versus the rest of the world. Unfortunately, several studies\nsuggest that skill levels and educational achievement levels of our workforce have lagged other\ndeveloped countries for the last several years. According to recent Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD) surveys, the U.S. ranks 24th out of 35 developed countries\nin measures of math, science and reading skills among 15-year-olds.4 In addition, in surveys of 29\nparticipating OECD countries, the U.S. ranked 20th in assessments of adult literacy and math\nskills.5\nResearch by Eric Hanushek of Stanford University with Ludger Woessmann of the University of\nMunich suggests that improvements in U.S. math and science skills could translate into meaningful\nimprovements in potential GDP growth in the U.S.6 While these efforts are likely to take years,\nthey could have substantial potential to improve future growth and prosperity in the U.S.\nIn addition, in the most recent National Federation of Independent Business small-business survey,\n49 percent of respondents said they were unable to find qualified workers to fill open positions. 7\nSimilarly, respondents to Dallas Fed surveys report that they are unable to find workers with\nadequate technical, organizational and other basic skills to fill open positions.\nKansas City Fed economists estimate that approximately 43 percent of all jobs in the U.S. are so-\ncalled “middle-skills” positions.8 These include pipe fitters, automotive technicians, registered\nnurses, IT specialists and so on. Every one of these jobs that goes unfilled means a lost opportunity\nfor higher GDP. These positions require more than a high school education. Due to technology-\nenabled disruption, the training levels for these middle-skills positions have intensified over the\nlast several years. In order to train these workers, local junior colleges and high schools must work\nwith local businesses to provide training opportunities in order to close this “skills gap.”\nThere are approximately 46 million members of the labor force in this country with a high school\neducation or less.9 It is our view at the Dallas Fed that, due to technology-enabled disruption, these\nworkers are increasingly finding that their jobs are being restructured or eliminated. Unless they\n4\n\nhave sufficient levels of math and reading capability and/or are retrained, these workers are likely\nto struggle to adapt to the changing nature of the job market. As a result, they are likely to see their\nincomes and productivity decline.\nImproving math, reading and science capabilities, improving college readiness and beefing up the\navailability of skills training for potential workers will likely be essential to improving our\nworkforce productivity, reducing the number of discouraged workers and contributing to higher\nGDP growth in the U.S.\nThe Projected Path of U.S. Government Debt\nWhen assessing the level of debt in the economy, Dallas Fed economists look at debt held by the\nhousehold sector, the business sector and the U.S. government. Since the Great Recession, the\nhousehold sector in the U.S. has substantially deleveraged. The financial health of the household\nsector is crucial because the consumer comprises approximately 70 percent of GDP. In 2008, the\nhousehold sector was historically highly leveraged relative to their incomes. It was not as apparent\nbecause household assets, particularly home prices, were elevated and appeared to support higher\nleverage. While consumer leverage helped fuel GDP growth leading up to 2007, in 2008, it became\napparent that the consumer had to deleverage. It has taken several years—along with an improving\njob market—for the consumer to reduce debt relative to their income. Today's healthy consumer\nprovides a key underpinning to the U.S. economy.\nUnfortunately, while the U.S. consumer has deleveraged since the Great Recession, business debt\nas a percentage of GDP has increased, and U.S. government debt levels have increased\nsubstantially. While increased business debt is likely manageable, U.S. government debt held by\nthe public is now 75 percent of GDP, 10 and the present value of underfunded entitlements is now\napproximately $49 trillion.11 There is a legitimate concern that the projected path of U.S.\ngovernment debt relative to GDP is unlikely to be sustainable.\nThe corporate tax reform elements of recent tax legislation should help to encourage greater\nbusiness formation and investment, which should lead to greater productivity and some increase\nin the growth potential of the U.S. economy. However, the debt-financed tax cuts included in the\nlegislation are likely to temporarily stimulate demand, with effects that will peak in 2018, and\ngradually fade in 2019 and 2020. Ultimately, we believe that growth will return back to trend.\nDallas Fed economists believe that the expected near-term boost to GDP needs to be balanced with\nthe concern that debt to GDP is likely to materially increase in the years ahead. This projected\nincrease in government debt to GDP comes at a point in the economic cycle when it would be\npreferable to be moderating the rate of debt growth at the government level.\nWhile leverage can stimulate the economy as it is being added, deleveraging is likely to be\ndepressing to GDP growth. At a minimum, higher government leverage will make it less likely\nthat fiscal policy will be a realistically available tool during the next recession. While addressing\nthis issue involves difficult political considerations and policy choices, the U.S. may need to more\nactively consider policy actions that would moderate the path of projected U.S. government debt\ngrowth.\n5\n\nConclusion\nDallas Fed economists are optimistic about economic prospects for 2018. We expect progress this\nyear on our dual mandate of full employment and price stability.\nDespite this optimism, we believe longer-term challenges remain. These challenges present\nopportunities for the U.S. to take action and adopt policies that could improve sustainable\neconomic growth and prosperity. Addressing these challenges is likely to require fundamental\nstructural reforms and a broader menu of policy actions beyond monetary policy.\n6\n\nAppendix A\nA Background Note on Technology-Enabled Disruption and Its Implications\nAs I have been discussing for the past two years, technology-enabled disruption means workers\nincreasingly being replaced by technology. It also means that existing business models are being\nsupplanted by new models, often technology-enabled, for more efficiently selling or distributing\ngoods and services. In addition, consumers are increasingly being able to use technology to shop\nfor goods and services at lower prices with greater convenience—having the impact of reducing\nthe pricing power of businesses which has, in turn, caused them to further intensify their focus on\ncreating greater operational efficiencies. These trends appear to be accelerating.\nIt is likely that disruption is a factor in economic outcomes being increasingly skewed by\neducational attainment levels of workers. That is, for those who have a college degree, the\nunemployment rate stands at 2.1 percent, and the labor force participation rate is 73.4 percent. If\nyou have some college education, the unemployment rate is 3.4 percent and participation rate is\n66.0 percent; a high school diploma, the unemployment rate is 4.5 percent and participation rate\nis 57.5 percent; and some high school education, the unemployment rate is 5.4 percent and\nparticipation rate is 44.8 percent.12\nIncreasingly, workers with lower levels of educational attainment are seeing their jobs restructured\nor eliminated. Unless they have sufficient math and literacy skills or are retrained, these workers\nmay likely see their productivity and incomes decline as a result of disruption. This may help\nexplain the muted levels of wage gains and overall labor productivity growth we see in the U.S. as\nwell as other advanced economies.\nThe impact of technology-enabled disruption on the workforce is likely less susceptible to\nmonetary policy—addressing this challenge requires structural reforms. The reforms could include\nactions which would be aimed at improving early childhood literacy and improving math, reading\nand science achievement levels among high school students. These efforts could help boost overall\ncollege readiness in order to increase the percentage of students who graduate college in six years\nor less—now estimated at 59 percent in the U.S.13 As mentioned in this essay, addressing the\nimpacts of technology-enabled disruption will also require stepped up efforts to increase middle-\nskills training in cities across the U.S. in order to improve employment, close the skills gap (not\nenough workers to fill skilled jobs) and raise worker productivity. These initiatives could improve\neducational achievement levels in order to help our citizens better thrive in a world that\nincreasingly demands greater education, training and adaptability.\nDisruption may also help explain why companies, facing one or more disruptive competitors, have\nbeen more cautious about making capacity-expansion decisions as well as investing in major\ncapital projects. The recent tax legislation may help create incentives to improve the level of capital\ninvestment.\nTo deal with disruptive changes and lack of pricing power, many companies are seeking to achieve\ngreater scale economies in order to maintain or improve profit margins. This may help explain the\nrecord level of merger and acquisition activity globally over the past few years.\n7\n\n1 “Immigration Projected to Drive Growth in U.S. Working-Age Population Through at Least 2035,” by Jeffrey S.\nPassel and D’Vera Cohn, Pew Research Center, March 8, 2017, www.pewresearch.org/fact-\ntank/2017/03/08/immigration-projected-to-drive-growth-in-u-s-working-age-population-through-at-least-2035/.\n2 Beside the Golden Door: U.S. Immigration Reform in a New Era of Globalization, by Pia M.
