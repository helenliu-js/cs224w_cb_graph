Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nMay 25, 2023\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nKey Takeaways\n1. Collins wanted her first visit to an educational institution as Boston Fed president to be at a\ncommunity college – because they provide affordable, accessible higher education to learners\nfrom all backgrounds. Community colleges play a crucial role in helping students develop the\nnecessary skills to contribute in the economy of today and of the future. It is essential that our\neconomy has opportunities for everyone to thrive, and that makes community colleges particularly\nimportant.\n2. High inflation impacts everyone – and we need to make sure it does not become entrenched.\nAn inflation rate that is low and predictable is needed for fostering conditions that promote a\nvibrant, resilient, and inclusive economy – and for maximum employment that is sustainable over\ntime. This is why it is so important to remain resolute in bringing inflation back down to the Fed’s 2\npercent target in a reasonable amount of time.\n3. While inflation is still too high, there are some promising signs of moderation. Collins believes\nwe may be at, or near, the point where monetary policy can pause raising interest rates. This will\nprovide an opportunity to more fully assess the impact of the actions taken to date and the\ngeneral tightening of credit conditions on economic activity. However, it is important to make\neach policy decision based on a wholistic assessment of information available at the time.\n4. Collins noted the breadth of ways the Fed advances its mission – e.g., providing back-end\ninfrastructure that underpins the financial system that people and organizations depend on;\nsupervising banks for safety, soundness, fair lending, and community reinvestment and serving\nas a “lender of last resort”; working to support community economic development and identify\nimpediments to participation in the job market and economy; and conducting economic research\nand analysis to support monetary policymaking, in pursuit of the dual mandate from Congress to\npromote price stability and maximum employment.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, May 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nGood morning. It is truly a pleasure to be here with you today, at CCRI, the\nCommunity College of Rhode Island.\nSince I started in this job about 10 months ago, being out and meeting with\nstakeholders has been a key focus. I like to say that the Fed’s overarching mission is to\nfoster conditions supporting a vibrant, inclusive economy that works for all. So it is\nessential for us to connect with and learn from people across the Boston Fed’s district\n(which is essentially New England) – about their experiences, challenges, and\nopportunities.\nMy initial remarks today revolve around what we at the Fed are doing, and you at\nCCRI are doing, to support a vibrant and inclusive economy that works for all.\nGiven my background as a professor, dean, and provost, I’ve been fortunate to\nreceive speaking invitations at a number of educational institutions. But this is the first\ntalk at an educational institution that I am giving as president of the Boston Fed,\nbecause I wanted my first visit with students, and faculty to be at a community college.\nOverview\nI would like to touch briefly on three things – and then look forward to a\nconversation with President Hughes, and to questions from all of you:\n• First, I want to highlight why I wanted to prioritize speaking at a community\ncollege like CCRI; and why community colleges, and all of you engaged with\nthem, are so important to our economy and society.\n• Then, I’ll talk briefly about the range of things we do at the Federal Reserve, to\nadvance our mission.\n• And finally, I’ll share some of the lessons I’ve learned from my own career path,\nin case my experiences may be helpful to you.\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, May 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nBut before I begin, let me note, as always, that my remarks today are my own\nviews; I’m not speaking for any of my colleagues at other Federal Reserve Banks or at\nthe Board of Governors.\nThe Importance of Community Colleges\nCommunity colleges provide affordable, accessible higher education to millions\nof learners from all backgrounds. They support a wide range of needs for students,\nemployers and communities, and provide opportunities for upward mobility.1 And\ncommunity college students exemplify working hard, juggling multiple responsibilities,\nand developing additional skills to contribute to the economies of today and the future.\nI would especially like to acknowledge the cohort of entrepreneurs and owners of\nsmall businesses who are here today. You play such an important role in a vibrant\neconomy.\nAs I travel around New England and talk with employers, one of the most\nprevalent themes is the need for skilled personnel, to power their organizations and\nindustries. Indeed, our region’s labor market provides opportunities for good jobs,\nenabling people to prosper and thrive. But those jobs require evolving sets of skills and\nexpertise. So I congratulate all of you for investing in yourselves and your skills here at\nCCRI. Doing so is not only good for you; it also helps the organizations, households,\nand communities that make up our economy.\nAs a policymaker, it is critical to me that our economy provides opportunities for\neveryone, not just for some. This makes community colleges, like CCRI, particularly\nimportant in the broader higher education and skill-development landscape.\n1 See the recent study by Jack Mountjoy, “Community Colleges and Upward Mobility,” American\nEconomic Review, 2022, 112(8): 2580–2630.\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, May 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nAt the Fed, part of our mandate from Congress is to use our tools to maximize\nemployment. So if things like a lack of childcare, or insufficient housing, prevent some\npeople from participating in the job market and economy, we need to study those\nimpediments. We need to deepen our understanding of the obstacles and help explore\nways, locally and more broadly, that progress can be made to address them. The\nBoston Fed has been doing this through our research-based Working Places program,\nin locations across New England – including Cranston, Newport, and Providence here in\nRhode Island.2 Working Places encourages and fosters local, cross-sector\ncollaboration to identify issues and work on solutions to address complex economic\nproblems.\nOur Roles at the Federal Reserve\nIn fact, the Federal Reserve’s portfolio of activities is much more extensive than\nmany realize – and I’d like to speak briefly about the breadth of ways we, at the Fed,\nwork to achieve our mission.\nThe Fed, which is the U.S. central bank, was created almost 110 years ago by\nCongress. I’ll mention four of our key roles:\n• We provide a lot of back-end infrastructure that underpins the financial system,\nsupporting stable and reliable payments that people and organizations\nthroughout the economy depend on. Think cash, direct deposits, wire transfers,\nand a new service we’re about to unveil, FedNowSM instant payments.3 It is the\nfirst new payments “rail” the Fed has built in 50 years, and it will allow individuals\n2 Learn more about these efforts at https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx\n3 Learn more about the FedNow service at https://explore.fednow.org/\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, May 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nand businesses to send and receive instant payments and have access to the\nfunds immediately.\n• Second, we supervise some of the country’s banks for safety, soundness, fair\nlending, and community reinvestment. And we serve as a “lender of last resort”\nto the financial system, to ensure liquidity and to support financial stability.\n• Third, we work to support community economic development initiatives, like the\nWorking Places program I just mentioned.\n• Fourth, and importantly, we conduct monetary policy in the pursuit of our dual\nmandate from Congress to promote price stability and maximum employment. I’ll\nsay a bit more about this area of our work.\nTo me, maximum employment refers to the broad, inclusive goal of job\nopportunities for all. Price stability means inflation that is low and stable enough that it\nis not on people’s minds. Inflation at 2 percent, the target the Fed has defined,\naccomplishes that goal. But as you all know, prices have been rising more rapidly than\nthat, so much attention has been focused on inflation. In my conversations with people\nacross the region, I have heard from small business owners ending projects due to cost\nincreases, and from workers having to take on additional jobs given rising prices on\nnecessities.\nThese and other discussions are a constant reminder that inflation impacts\neveryone, and is particularly challenging for those with lower incomes. The Federal\nReserve has been responding forcefully to make sure that high inflation does not\nbecome entrenched.\nI’ll note that wage increases that are simply chasing higher prices do not make\nworkers better off, they just fuel more inflation. What matters for workers are gains in\ninflation-adjusted, or real wages.\nThus, I see the two dimensions of the Fed’s mandate – stable prices and\nmaximum employment – as intertwined, especially over the medium and longer term.\nLow, predictable inflation is needed for fostering conditions that promote a vibrant,\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, May 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nresilient, and inclusive economy – and for maximum employment that is sustainable\nover time. This is a key reason why it is so important for us to remain resolute in\nbringing inflation back down to the 2 percent target in a reasonable amount of time.\nThere are several factors behind the inflation we’ve been experiencing, but\nultimately it reflects demand outpacing supply, resulting in pressures on wages and\nprices that fuel inflation. The Fed raising interest rates is intended to slow spending,\ncool the labor market, and bring demand back into alignment with supply.\nSince March 2022, the Fed has raised rates from near zero to just over 5 percent\n– with the most recent increase occurring just a few weeks ago. And recent stresses in\nthe banking system are likely to further tighten credit conditions for businesses and\nconsumers, also cooling demand.\nWhile inflation is still too high, there are some promising signs of moderation. I\nbelieve we may be at, or near, the point where monetary policy can pause raising\ninterest rates. This will provide an opportunity to more fully assess the impact of the\nactions taken to date and the general tightening of credit conditions on economic\nactivity. However, I also believe it is important to make each policy decision based on a\nwholistic assessment of information available at the time – and the next policy meeting\nwill be in mid-June. In the meantime, we continue to monitor a wide range of data –\nabout price developments, labor markets, financial conditions and more – to evaluate\nhow the economy is doing.\nMy Own Path, and Some Lessons Along the Way\nLet me turn, for a moment, to my own career path. I’ll just mention a few\ndimensions of my journey, and then wrap up.\nFirst, I was inspired to be a lifelong learner by my parents and relatives. While I\nrealize that not everyone has that support, I hope you will be inspired by those you meet\nhere at CCRI, to never stop learning and developing your skills. The pace of change in\nour economy, and the skills it requires, make that essential.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, May 25, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nDuring my studies, I encountered instructors who were inspiring, challenging …\nor both. It was the challenging ones who taught me the most. I encourage you to seek\nout opportunities to stretch yourself – maybe by asking questions, to be sure you have\nmastered a subject, or taking a class here at CCRI that will push you. I know many\npeople around you at CCRI care about your success – so, seek out those who will\ninspire and challenge you.\nAnd throughout my career, I have been fortunate to have encouragement from\nfriends and family – especially my husband and (now adult) children. Again, I realize\nnot everyone is so fortunate. I’ll just say that it is vital to have allies and supporters as\nyou do the hard work of juggling everything, both while attending CCRI and in the\nfuture. So I encourage you to seek out allies … and perhaps most importantly, to be an\nally. I’ve found that working together, building networks and partnerships, is a key to\nsuccess – whether in school, or in a new job, or as President of the Boston Fed.\nConcluding Observations\nLet me close by encouraging you to keep at what you are doing here at CCRI,\nand to embrace being a lifelong learner. I have such respect for all of you, who are\nworking so hard to broaden your skills. You’re building a more prosperous future for\nyourselves, and also for our economy.\nIndeed, as someone who thinks about and works on our economy all the time, I\nwant to thank you, students – and your instructors and supporters as well as the staff\nhere at CCRI – for helping to build a vibrant, high-skill, inclusive economy – in Rhode\nIsland and beyond.\nWith that, thank you again for having me here today. I look forward to questions\nand conversation.\n6",

    "text": "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nPerspectives on the Economy\nRemarks at the Annual Convention\nof the Maine Bankers Association\nSusan M. Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nSeptember 22, 2023\nBoston, Massachusetts\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nKey Takeaways\n1. Price stability is essential for a well-functioning economy, and an important precondition for\nmaximum employment that is sustainable over time.\nCollins continues to hear about the challenges households and firms face related to too-high inflation. The\nfocus at the Fed remains bringing inflation down to the 2 percent target.\n2. While recent inflation readings have been encouraging, inflation remains too high. Some\nimportant components of inflation have yet to show sustained improvement.\nAlthough still elevated, inflation is down from its earlier peak. However, most of the moderation in core\ninflation has come from a decline in goods inflation. Shelter inflation has also moderated recently, and will\nlikely ease further. However, inflation in core services excluding shelter (over half of the Fed’s preferred\ninflation measure) has yet to show improvement consistent with price stability.\n3. Collins fully supports the FOMC’s attentiveness to inflation risks and commitment to price\nstability.\nSustained reductions in inflation will require demand coming into better balance with supply across the\neconomy. While there is some evidence this realignment is underway, especially in the labor market,\neconomic activity continues to be above trend and it is too soon to be confident that inflation is on a\nsustainable trajectory back to target. Collins agrees with the policy guidance in the median SEP projections\nwhich show rates staying higher, and for longer, than previous projections had suggested; and further\ntightening is certainly not off the table.\n4. This phase of policymaking requires considerable patience, to extract the signal from noisy data\nand to allow some temporary factors to play out. Collins is realistic about risks, but optimistic\nabout restoring price stability with an orderly realignment of demand with supply.\nThe economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic and recovery have been, and continue to be,\nhighly unusual. This phase of monetary policy requires patience. Collins is a “realistic optimist” – realistic\nabout the uncertainties, but optimistic that price stability can be restored with only a modest increase in the\nunemployment rate. She believes the pathway to achieving this outcome has widened.\n5. Across Maine (and New England), local leadership efforts are addressing economic challenges\nand promoting resurgence.\nThere are many dimensions to economic prosperity – so the Fed has a broad portfolio, including\nencouraging local initiatives to foster economic resurgence in areas facing long-term struggles. An\nessential element is cross-sector collaboration among local individuals. In Maine, there are six such\n“Working Places” efforts, and the Fed simply helps the local networks emerge and flourish. Collaborating\nto improve opportunities for people and places to not be left behind – but rather join in the economy – is\ngood economics, good citizenship, and good business.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nGood morning. It is a pleasure being with you. I am always grateful for the\nopportunity to meet with Mainers, no matter the location, and have been to Maine\nmultiple times. In fact, I’ve made a point of visiting all the New England states in this role\n– and will continue to do so.\nI’ll start by thanking two people. First is Jim Roche, president of the Maine\nBankers’ Association. We appreciate his continued engagement with us at the Boston\nFed, as we all work to support a safe and sound banking system, which is so essential\nto a vibrant and inclusive economy. Second, I want to thank Jeanne Hulit, president and\nCEO of Maine Community Bancorp. Jeanne is of course a member of your association’s\nexecutive committee. She’s also a member of the Boston Fed’s board of directors. We\nso appreciate the insights into Maine and New England business conditions she shares\nas a member of our board.\nIn the time we have today, I’ll make some initial remarks, before taking a few\nquestions. Of course, I’ll share my views about the economic outlook and monetary\npolicy. Then I’ll provide a few perspectives on banking in New England and in particular\nMaine – highlighting the importance of banks of all sizes to a vibrant, inclusive\neconomy. I’ll end with a few points about the Fed’s work across the region, and our\nshared opportunities to collaborate in the public interest.\nThe Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nI’ll start with some of my current views on the economy, the outlook, and\nmonetary policy – especially given the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC’s)\ndecision on policy rates this week.1 But first, my standard disclaimer: the views I\nexpress are my own; I’m not speaking for any other Fed policymaker.\nOur focus at the Fed remains bringing inflation down to our 2 percent target.2\nPrice stability is essential for a well-functioning economy, and an important precondition\n1 https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230920a.htm\n2 “The FOMC judges that low and stable inflation at the rate of 2 percent per year, as measured by the\nannual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent with\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nfor maximum employment that is sustainable over time – so reducing inflation relates to\nboth parts of our dual mandate from Congress. And as I travel around the district, I\ncontinue to hear about the challenges households and firms face related to too-high\ninflation. On one of my trips to Maine I recall hearing about residents who were unable\nor unwilling to move within the state to take job offers, due in part to the rising costs of\nfuel, shelter, transportation, and other necessities.\nHowever, there has been some promising news. Although still too high, inflation\nis down from its earlier peak. And there is some evidence demand and supply are\nrealigning, especially in labor markets, which is needed to reduce the upward pressure\non prices. Importantly, the current policy phase requires patience, allowing time to better\nseparate the signal from the noise in the data.\nI’d like to say a bit about the FOMC’s decision earlier this week, and the related\neconomic projections from policymakers. As widely expected, the FOMC left interest\nrates unchanged. However, the policy statement makes clear that this decision need not\nimply having reached the peak federal funds rate in this tightening cycle. Future\ndecisions will depend on a holistic assessment of incoming data.\nThe FOMC also released an updated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)\nprepared by all the Fed Board’s governors and Reserve Bank presidents, which\ncertainly reinforces the statement’s message. The median expectation for the federal\nfunds rate in the SEP features one more 25 basis-point increase this year and, relative\nto the June projections, a more gradual process of policy normalization in 2024 and ’25.\nThis federal funds rate projection underscores the Committee’s focus on\nrestoring price stability while also recognizing the other part of our mandate: maximum\nsustainable employment. Indeed, the median SEP forecast expects a normalization of\nlabor market conditions that contributes to inflation running at levels consistently close\nto target by 2025 to ‘26.\nachievement of both parts of the dual mandate.”\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary-policy-what-are-its-goals-how-does-it-work.htm\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nI fully support the FOMC statement and agree with the policy guidance in the\nmedian SEP projections. I expect rates may have to stay higher, and for longer, than\nprevious projections had suggested, and further tightening is certainly not off the table.\nPolicymakers will stay the course to achieve the Fed’s mandate.\nMy views on policy reflect my assessment of current conditions and the outlook\nfor inflation and real activity. I noted earlier that there are some promising signs that\ninflation is moderating and the economy rebalancing. But progress has not been linear\nand is not evenly distributed across sectors.\nStarting with inflation, I’ll focus on so-called core inflation, which excludes the\nimportant but volatile food and energy components, because it is typically a better\ngauge of underlying trends than total inflation. Recent readings have been encouraging\n– but disaggregating the key components provides valuable insight into recent pricing\npatterns. In particular, doing so highlights that most of the moderation in core inflation\nhas come from a noticeable decline in core goods inflation, as supply bottlenecks have\nresolved. A second key component, shelter inflation, has also moderated recently, and\nwill likely ease further as slower growth in new market rents is reflected in the overall\nindex. However, inflation in core services excluding shelter, which accounts for over half\nof our preferred core inflation measure, has yet to show the sustained improvement that\nwould be consistent with price stability.\nSo while there have been promising developments, it is too soon to be confident\nthat inflation is on a sustainable trajectory back to the 2 percent target. I’ll also note the\nimportance of caution in reading too much from individual data points, or even from a\nfew months of information. The monthly inflation data, for example, have always been\nnoisy. But the variability of core inflation has increased since the pandemic.\nConsiderable uncertainty remains around underlying inflation conditions. Extracting\ntrends and patterns from noisy incoming data will take patience.\nI’ve also noted that sustained reductions in inflation will require demand coming\ninto better balance with supply across the economy. Some signs that a broad\nrebalancing process is underway can be found in the labor market – which is still\nresilient overall, but cooling. In particular, the pace of hiring has slowed, although it\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nremains above trend. Job vacancies have declined and quit rates are nearly down to\npre-pandemic levels. Also contributing to the labor market rebalancing is an\nimprovement in supply. Indeed, we’ve seen some encouraging recent increases in labor\nforce participation, especially for prime-age workers (those aged 25-54).\nOver time, labor market rebalancing should result in wage growth that reflects, in\naddition to productivity gains, cost-of-living increases consistent with the Fed’s 2\npercent target. Such rebalancing should contribute to a moderation in inflation in the\ncontext of maximum sustainable employment.\nThis brings me to my outlook for the economy. Monetary policy has tightened\nconsiderably to date, but economic activity has been resilient – and it may be taking\nlonger than usual to see the broader economic impact of monetary policy actions.\nIn particular, demand may have been less sensitive to higher interest rates so\nfar, because policy tightening has occurred amidst business and household\nfundamentals that are sound compared with previous cycles. Many firms have been\ninsulated from the rate hikes by extending the maturity of their debt when rates were\nlow, and because of higher profit margins. But cash levels are returning to pre-\npandemic norms and debt-market activity is picking up. In addition, households’ excess\nsaving accumulated during the pandemic is declining, while reliance on credit card\nspending is rising. This all suggests that business and household spending are likely to\nbecome more interest sensitive, helping to temper demand growth and realign it with\nsupply.\nI continue to expect that the full effects of monetary policy will eventually show\nthrough and place inflation on a sustainable trajectory back to 2 percent. But I’ll note\nthat the timing and ultimate impact of policy tightening to date remain uncertain.\nHistorical evidence is largely based on experiences in which policy rates moved more\nslowly than in the current cycle.\nIn all, the economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic and recovery have\nbeen, and continue to be, highly unusual, with important implications for policy setting.\nAs I’ve said before, this phase of policy requires considerable patience, enabling\npolicymakers to better extract the correct signal from the incoming data, and allowing\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nsome factors that have been supporting near-term activity to play out. The risk of\ninflation remaining persistently high must be weighed against the risk that activity will\nslow more than expected. I also recognize the potential for higher short-term rates to\nplace more pressure on some banks' balance sheets and reduce bank credit provision\nmore than I anticipate.\nI continue to be a “realistic optimist” – realistic about the uncertainties and risks\nto my baseline outlook, but optimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly\nslowdown in activity, and only a modest unemployment rate increase associated with\nsupply and demand in labor markets coming into better balance. Importantly, the\nongoing resilience I see in the economy and the progress on inflation so far lead me to\nbelieve that the pathway to achieving this desirable outcome has widened.\nPolicy remains well positioned to proceed cautiously in this uncertain economic\nenvironment, recognizing and balancing the risks while remaining resolute and data-\ndependent, with the flexibility to adjust policy appropriately as conditions warrant.\nMaine’s Economy and Banking Sector\nI’ll turn now from the national economy to Maine’s. In my recent visits to your\nstate, I spoke with a range of people, and learned about some of the unique challenges\nand economic strengths. Challenges include the fact that Maine has a population that is\nolder, and aging faster, than the New England region and the rest of the nation. That\nreality tends to reduce the availability of labor, which is something businesses large and\nsmall mentioned often.\nAccess to affordable housing also remains a major issue. Maine employers told\nme about their difficulties finding and hiring workers for needed roles, in part because\nprospective employees are unable to find affordable housing in the area. And I know\nthat expanding access to broadband in Maine’s rural counties has been challenge, but\nremains a priority.\nI’ve also learned about Maine’s many wonderful economic strengths. Among\nthem are the state’s rich natural resources – on land and in the Gulf of Maine – as well\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nas strong retail and healthcare industries, robust tourism and hospitality sectors,\nabundant small businesses, and a strong sense of community and pride of place.\nAnother strength, of course, is Maine’s banking industry. Your banks employ as\nmany as 9,000 Mainers, serving households and businesses across the state in\ncommunities large and small. Of course, banks face challenges, in addition to those in\nthe current interest rate environment. Evolving customer preferences require increasing\ninvestment in technology, and you’re seeing increased margin pressure related to\ncompetition for deposits, and competition from new market entrants.\nToday I want to recognize the critical role that banks of all sizes play in creating\nvibrant, inclusive economies. Community banks, like those in Maine, have remained\nresilient and continue to leverage the close working relationships they have within\nsmaller cities, towns, and rural areas. Community banks provide a critical source of\nfunding for small businesses. This was demonstrated, for example, during the\nimplementation of the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program, as\ncommunity banks played a major role in ensuring those funds reached businesses.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has noted that a robust and dynamic banking system,\nalong with effective and efficient regulation and supervision, helps to ensure that banks\nof all sizes can meet the needs of households and businesses in every community\nthroughout our country, in good times and in bad. And I fully agree that we must\npreserve and build on these strengths, and that diversity.\nThe Federal Reserve and the New England Region\nFinally, let me say a bit about the Fed’s activities. I like to say that our\noverarching mission at the Boston Fed is supporting a vibrant, inclusive economy that\nworks for everyone. As you know, an economy’s strength has many dimensions – so\nthe Fed has a broad portfolio of activities and engagements – all in the public interest –\nincluding monetary policymaking, economic research and analysis, bank supervision,\nfinancial stability work, serving as lender of last resort for banks, community and\neconomic development activities, and initiatives and infrastructure related to payments,\ntechnology, and finance. They all support our mission and our mandate.\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, September 22, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nI’ll very briefly mention some of our work to support economic vibrancy in all\nareas of New England, with a goal of expanding opportunities for everyone to\nparticipate in the economy. Since 2014, we have focused on encouraging local efforts to\nfind economic resurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing long-term struggles –\nwe call it “Working Places.” It’s based on research showing that an essential element of\nplace-based economic resilience is cross-sector collaboration, among local individuals\nwilling to take on shared leadership. In Maine, there are such local efforts in six areas:\nGreater Bangor, the Katahdin region, Lewiston-Auburn, Maine Highlands, Sagadahoc\nCounty, and in Washington County with the Passamaquoddy Tribe.\nThe Fed’s work helps the local, collaborative networks emerge and flourish. We\nfind that people really do want to work together to solve problems. I suspect that’s\nbecause improving opportunities for people and places to not be left behind – but rather\njoin in the economy – is good economics, good citizenship, and good business! I’m\nencouraged that local, tangible efforts like these are adding up to real strength in our\nregion.

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nApril 10, 2025\nWashington, D.C.\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 10, 2025\nKey Takeaways\n1. Supply improvements have played an important role in helping to support economic activity\nto date, while bringing inflation down. Key drivers have been increases in labor supply, and\nsustained growth in output per hour.\nRecent work by Boston Fed researchers illustrates the importance of positive supply developments\nsince the second half of 2022 in the disinflation process.\n2. Looking ahead, Collins expects supply factors will continue to play a key role in the\neconomy’s evolution. This includes both the potential for continued productivity gains as well\nas some economic headwinds from new supply developments, such as reduced population\ngrowth and an increase in firms’ input costs from tariffs.\nCollins notes that “It will be difficult to determine the net effect of these supply developments.”\nHowever, she expects that the negative supply effects will weigh on the economy this year.\n3. Output has remained on a solid, if slower, trajectory … but the outlook for both economic\nactivity and inflation remains clouded by significant uncertainty, as well as competing risks.\nThe labor market remains at or near full employment. Inflation – though significantly down from its\n2022 peak – is still elevated. And recently announced large and broad-based tariffs could raise inflation\nat least over this year, while slowing the pace of economic activity.\n4. Periods of high uncertainty like we are seeing now can also have negative demand effects, as\nhouseholds and firms become more hesitant to spend.\nIndeed, Collins notes that a “wait-and-see” attitude has become commonplace among stakeholders in\nher Fed District.\n5. Collins sees monetary policy as currently “well positioned to address a wide range of\npotential economic outcomes in this highly uncertain environment,” with competing risks. She\nbelieves that “maintaining the current monetary policy stance seems appropriate for the time\nbeing.”\nGiven the likely evolution of inflation and real activity and the related risks to both, policy could face\nchallenging tradeoffs. Setting appropriate policy will potentially require balancing competing objectives\nand will depend on the economy’s actual and expected distance from the FOMC’s full employment and\nprice stability mandates.\n6. Collins notes that “…policy should help guard against the risk that price-level increases\nrelated to tariffs destabilize inflation expectations.” Further monetary policy normalization will\nimportantly depend on having sufficient confidence that the tariff induced inflation will not\npersist, and on the stability of longer-run inflation expectations.\n“It may still be appropriate to lower the federal funds rate later this year. But renewed price pressures\ncould delay further policy normalization, as confidence is needed that the tariffs are not destabilizing\ninflation expectations. With elevated inflation, the signal would have to be compelling to take\npreemptive actions against the risk that activity weakens by more than expected.”\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 10, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nMy thanks to Professor Vroman for the introduction, and Chair Ludema and Dean Sobanet for\ntheir warm welcome. It is a great pleasure to be back at Georgetown. And the Razin Prize and lecture is,\nof course, near and dear to my heart. Let me especially acknowledge Assaf Razin, the distinguished\ninternational economist, and thank him for being here with us, as we honor the memory of his son Ofair,\nfor whom I served as dissertation advisor before his passing in 1996.\nLet me also congratulate Tracy Xu on winning the 2025 Razin Prize for the best research paper\nby an advanced graduate student – with congratulations as well to her advisor, Professor Mukoyama.\nTracy’s paper explores the impacts of restrictions on labor mobility in China and the resulting potential\nmismatches between labor supply and demand, with implications for productivity and output. My remarks\ntoday will focus on a very different economy and part of the world, but will also explore the importance\nand impact of supply-side developments.\nI will begin with two important disclaimers. First, I always mention that my remarks are my own and\nmay not reflect the views of colleagues at the Board of Governors, on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, or at other Reserve Banks.\nSecond, I’d like to acknowledge that any discussion of the economy today must take into account\nthe evolving policy landscape. Here, I’ll refer to Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell’s comments last\nFriday,1 observing that the new administration is in the process of implementing substantial policy\nchanges related to trade, immigration, fiscal policy and regulation. It is not the Fed’s role to comment on\npolicies for which we are not responsible. “Rather,” he said, “we make an assessment of their likely\neffects, observe the behavior of the economy, and set monetary policy in a way that best achieves our\ndual-mandate goals” from Congress.\nEconomic Conditions\nWith that in mind, let me turn to the economy. First, the big picture: output appears to be still on a\nsolid, if slower, trajectory; and a broad set of indicators suggests that the labor market remains at or near\nfull employment. However, inflation – though significantly down from its 2022 peak – has remained\nelevated. And recently announced tariffs, which are large and broad-based, are likely to raise inflation this\n1 Chair Jerome H. Powell (2025), “Economic Outlook,” speech at the Society for Advancing Business\nEditing and Writing Annual Conference, Arlington, Virginia, April 4.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250404a.htm\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 10, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nyear, while slowing growth. It is an understatement to say that the outlook for both economic activity and\ninflation is clouded by significant uncertainty, as well as competing risks – as I’ll discuss shortly.\nUnderstanding how the economy has evolved is critical for assessing its likely trajectory. While\nboth the demand side and the supply side have played important roles in the aftermath of the pandemic,\nin my view, supply-side factors are often underappreciated. And so, my remarks today will highlight key\nsupply-side dimensions – first, their role in how we got to where we are, then their likely impact going\nforward, and finally the implications for appropriate monetary policy. I’ll refer to several charts along the\nway to help illustrate my main points.\nFigure 1 sets the stage for my discussion. On the left, it shows the evolution of the\nunemployment rate – a good indicator of overall labor market conditions. The right panel shows the Fed’s\npreferred measure of inflation, calculated using the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price\nindex. The blue line is 12-month total (or “headline”) inflation; the green line is the Fed’s 2 percent target;\nand the red line is “core” inflation, which excludes the volatile – though obviously important – categories\nof food and energy.\nAs the figure highlights, unemployment increased sharply at the onset of the pandemic. But unlike\nin previous downturns, it also dropped quickly, as the economy reopened. Eventually, the unemployment\nrate fell below the level that I would consider consistent with price stability. More recently, it has moved up\nand – as I noted earlier – now appears to be in line with full employment conditions. Regarding prices,\ninflation surged in 2021 as demand outstripped supply. But as demand and supply have come into better\nbalance over time, inflation has declined notably – though it’s not yet back to the Fed’s 2 percent target.\nPositive supply developments were essential to the healthy economic conditions early this year.\nWe can see this by looking at real GDP, where trend growth has been notably faster in recent years than\nit was in the years leading up to the pandemic. The solid line in Figure 2 shows the evolution of real GDP\nsince 2018, including the sharp pandemic drop and the subsequent rebound. It’s interesting to see that at\nthe beginning of 2019, the median estimate of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants was\nfor real GDP growth to average 1.9 percent per year over the long run – this pace is illustrated by the blue\ndashed line.2 However, actual output growth has clearly exceeded that rate.\nSince the economy is arguably at full employment now – and was likely near full employment in\nthe years immediately prior to the pandemic – it stands to reason that GDP is close to its potential and\nwas similarly close to its potential in 2018. If so, trend GDP growth over this period was about 2.4\npercent, as shown by the red dashed line. This is half a percentage point faster per year than the pace\n2 See the March 2019 FOMC Summary of Economic Projections (available at:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20190320SEPcompilation.pdf).\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 10, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nexpected in 2019. Two key factors have contributed to this faster pace: an expansion in labor supply and\na pickup in labor productivity growth. These are themes I’ll turn to now.\nAs Figure 3 shows, an expanding labor supply has resulted in appreciably greater payroll\nemployment gains. As with output growth, I’ll make a reasonable assumption that employment growth is\nclose to trend now and was close to trend right before the pandemic. If so, then from 2018 to 2024, trend\ngrowth averaged about 130,000 jobs per month, as shown by the red dashed line. This is a significantly\nfaster rate of job creation compared with the average pace of about 90,000 jobs per month that prevailed\nfrom 2007 to 2018, shown by the dashed blue line.\nWhile a lot more could be said about the developments behind these labor supply gains, I’ll just\nmention a few key points. Increased immigration was a very important factor, which helped to offset\nslower domestic labor supply growth stemming from the aging of the native population and pandemic-\ninduced early retirements. Higher labor force participation, especially among 25- to 54-year-olds, also\nplayed a key role. It’s worth noting that this rise in prime-age labor force participation was evident across\nracial and ethnic groups and was especially pronounced among women.3\nThe second factor supporting faster trend economic growth has been a step-up in labor\nproductivity growth. The solid line in Figure 4 shows one measure of labor productivity: output per hour\nworked in the nonfinancial corporate sector. Before the pandemic, this measure grew an average of about\n1.2 percent per year, as shown by the blue dashed line.\nIn fact, concerns about anemic productivity growth were widespread from the mid-2000s onward.4\nBut as the red dashed line shows, trend growth in output per hour in the nonfinancial corporate sector\nappears to have risen notably, possibly above 2 percent, since the end of 2019.5\nThe figure also highlights the large swings in productivity early in the pandemic recovery. The\ninitial productivity surge largely reflects the much greater contraction in output experienced by customer-\nfacing industries (which typically have lower pay and productivity). In this respect, the surge mostly\n3 For additional details on these labor supply developments, see among others, Garcia-Jimeno, Camilo,\nand Luojia Hu (2024), “Female Labor Force Participation in the Post-pandemic Era,” Chicago Fed\nInsights, July; Foote, Christopher L., (2024) “Quantifying the Recent Immigration Surge: Evidence from\nWork-permit Applications,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Research Department Working Papers No.\n24-15; and Edelberg, Wendy, and Tara Watson (2024), “New Immigration Estimates Help Make Sense of\nthe Pace of Employment,” Brookings Institution, March 7.\n4 See, for example, The Rise and Fall of American Growth, by Robert Gordon.\n5 Measures of output per hour paint somewhat different pictures of the recovery in productivity since the\npandemic across different segments of the economy. However, the trend appears to have been faster in\nthe important nonfinancial corporate sector, which accounts for a large portion of the value added of the\neconomy.\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 10, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ncaptures a temporary shift in the composition of output across industries. This effect was likely\ncompounded by some firms overreacting to the pandemic shutdown, by making excessive layoffs.6 As the\neconomy reopened and workers were rehired, these effects waned. However, as the chart shows, labor\nproductivity has continued to expand at a fairly strong pace.\nAt this point, it is not entirely clear which forces are driving these productivity gains – or how\npersistent they will prove to be. Figure 5 shows two of the factors that likely played a role. The pace of\nnew-business formation, shown in the left panel, has picked up noticeably. This type of business\n“dynamism” has been connected to innovation and productivity gains.7 In addition, as shown in the right\npanel of Figure 5, job turnover – as measured by the quits rate from the Job Openings and Labor\nTurnover Survey (JOLTS) – increased appreciably as we came out of the pandemic. While some of the\nincrease in quits in late 2020 and early 2021 may have resulted from workers leaving the labor force, the\nsharp rise later in 2021 and in 2022 likely reflects improved employer-employee matching.8\nFirms have also increased their use of automation and other labor-saving technologies. Initially,\nthis was driven by a need to sustain production amid severe labor shortages. In earlier conversations with\ncontacts around New England, I heard examples of shifts to new business processes and incorporation of\nmore established technologies. But more recently, I have been hearing about experimentation related to\nartificial intelligence (AI) – and there seems to be increasing optimism about potential production\nenhancements from these technologies. Indeed, more firms are now moving from researching and testing\nto actual implementation, and I will have more to say about this in a moment.\nSo far, I have illustrated the supply improvements using different linear trends. However, I did this\nfor simplicity – there is no reason to assume linearity.9 History has shown that there are periods when\nproductivity growth steps up more quickly – and that could certainly happen again.\n6 For further details on productivity early in the recovery, see, for example, Gordon, Robert J., and\nHassan Sayed (2022), “A New Interpretation of Productivity Growth Dynamics in the Pre-Pandemic and\nPandemic Era U.S. Economy, 1950–2022,” NBER Working Paper 30267.\n7 For further details, see, for example, Decker, Ryan, and John Haltiwanger (2024), “High Tech Business\nEntry in the Pandemic Era,” FEDS Notes, April 19; Decker, Ryan, John Haltiwanger, Ron Jarmin, and\nJavier Miranda (2014), “The Role of Entrepreneurship in US Job Creation and Economic Dynamism,”\nJournal of Economic Perspectives 28(3): 2–24.\n8 By early 2024 quits rate had returned to their pre-pandemic range, possibly suggesting that job\nreallocation might play a smaller role in productivity growth going forward.\n9 Indeed, some of the supply-side improvements have likely occurred more recently. In particular, work\npermit applications surged in 2023 and 2024 as shown in Foote, Chris (2024), “Quantifying the Recent\nImmigration Surge: Evidence from Work-permit Applications,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Working\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 10, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThe supply improvements, especially those related to productivity, also appear to have supported\neconomic activity through other channels. In particular, they likely contributed – at least prior to the recent\nfinancial market turbulence – to positive market sentiment, as reflected in high stock prices and tight\ncredit spreads by historical standards.\nThese developments, in turn, resulted in financial conditions that did not exert undue restraint on\nthe economy – despite monetary policy that has been restrictive since 2023. These generally\naccommodative financial conditions – along with lingering support for households from pandemic-era\nfiscal policies and firms’ healthy balance sheets – helped to maintain private spending in the face of\nhigher interest rates. With only modest restraint from monetary policy given these tailwinds, together with\nthe supply-side improvements I have discussed, GDP growth has been healthy amid declining inflation.\nTurning to inflation developments, disinflation was particularly pronounced in 2023, then slowed\nsomewhat in 2024. This is highlighted in the left panel of Figure 6, which shows the 12-month percentage\nchanges in total and core PCE prices. Recent work by Boston Fed researchers breaks out the\ncontributions of supply and demand factors to inflation and illustrates the importance of supply\ndevelopments during this period.10\nThe right panel of Figure 6 plots 12-month core PCE inflation and the 12-month percent change\nin the supply-driven component of inflation, as estimated by my staff. The figure shows that during 2022,\nnegative supply effects – such as supply-chain bottlenecks – likely contributed more than 3 percentage\npoints to a core PCE inflation rate that was running above 5 percent. But in 2023, the easing of these\nbottlenecks and the improvements in productivity played an important role in the inflation decline.\nIn 2024, the supply-chain constraints had largely waned, and supply and demand were in much\nbetter balance. The limited disinflation during this period was likely due to the lingering effects of large\npandemic-related shocks still working their way through the economy.11\nPaper 24-15. Moreover, labor productivity gains have been more pronounced recently, as illustrated in\nFigure 4.\n10 The analysis uses disaggregated data on PCE prices and quantities to decompose inflation readings\ninto supply and demand factors, as well as a remaining “idiosyncratic” component. This statistical\napproach is based on the notion that when demand increases, prices rise because people want to\nconsume more – but when supply contracts, prices rise because firms cannot produce as much.\nSee Leiva-León, Danilo, Viacheslav Sheremirov, Jenny Tang, and Egon Zakrajšek (2025), “Inflation\nFactors”; Leiva-León, Danilo, Viacheslav Sheremirov, Jenny Tang, and Egon Zakrajšek (2025), “Parsing\nOut the Sources of Inflation,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Current Policy Perspectives 25-5.\n11 Shelter inflation, which tends to adjust slowly to new rental market conditions, is a prime example.\nRents of tenants renewing existing leases have taken a long time to catch up to the higher ‘market rent’\nlevels paid by tenants who have moved. This dynamic contributed importantly to persistently elevated\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 10, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nSummarizing – and Looking Ahead\nThe developments that I have described so far have resulted in an economy that has been at or\nnear full employment. And the stability of the unemployment rate in recent months suggests that the\neconomy has been growing near trend. But inflation has remained somewhat above the Federal\nReserve’s 2 percent target. In this context, if inflation expectations remain well-anchored, a policy stance\nthat continues to exert some (modest) restraint on demand should preserve healthy labor market\nconditions, while ultimately helping to facilitate a return of inflation to target. But as I emphasized at the\noutset, the announcement of broad-based new tariffs will push up inflation, while slowing growth.\nFurthermore, high continuing uncertainty – especially about trade and other policy developments – is\nsignificantly clouding the outlook.\nLooking ahead, I believe that supply factors will continue to play a key role in the evolution of\neconomic activity and inflation. Starting with real activity, I see the potential for both positive and negative\nsupply effects.\nOn the negative side, one factor that will slow the pace of economic activity is the restraint on\nsupply from slower population growth tied to reduced immigration.12 Higher tariffs will also act as a\nnegative supply shock, as domestic firms that rely on imported intermediate goods will see an increase in\ncosts.13 The likely result will be lower output, and reduced hiring and capital expenditures. It is premature\nto assess any potential offsetting implications from onshoring.\nOn the positive side, as I mentioned earlier, many companies remain optimistic about the\npotential productivity gains from automation and increased use of AI-based technologies. While it is too\nearly to quantify the potential benefits of these technologies, some early signs are worth highlighting. For\ninstance, the growing focus on automation is evident from the notable recent rise in the number of AI-\nrelated mentions in publicly listed companies’ earnings calls. The left panel of Figure 7 shows overall\nreferences to automation as a share of total words in these earnings calls. The right panel highlights a\nshelter inflation readings. Recently, however, we have seen a significant moderation in housing inflation,\nwhich suggests that this catch-up process may have run its course. Of course, while shelter inflation has\nfallen, shelter prices themselves remain high.\n12 This negative labor supply effect could take some time to materialize as there is currently still a\nsubstantial backlog of work permit applications from immigrants already in the country. For more details,\nsee, for example, Edelberg, Wendy, and Eileen Powell (2025), “Work Permit Applications Suggest Prior\nImmigration Is Still Pushing Up Labor Supply – for Now,” Brookings Institution, March 13.\n13 See Barbiero, Omar, and Hillary Stein (2025), “The Impact of Tariffs on Inflation,” Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston Current Policy Perspectives 25-2. The work highlights the importance of this intermediate\nimported goods channel in some sectors such as pharmaceuticals, hospital services, food services, and\nmotor vehicles.\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 10, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nfew industries where mentions are particularly elevated – starting with information (the blue line),\nprofessional, scientific and technical services, and most recently, retail (the red line).\nIndustries with more frequent mentions of AI investments and adoption also appear to have\nexperienced somewhat higher growth in real output per hour over the 2022–2024 period. This is\nillustrated in Figure 8, which depicts the correlation between mentions of AI on the horizontal axis and\nproductivity gains on the vertical axis, by industry. The industries I just highlighted are the three dots at\nthe top right of this chart.\nIn addition to productivity enhancements, there could be further supply improvements from other\ndevelopments. These could include changes in corporate tax policy and deregulation that raise the supply\nof capital and potentially lower costs for some firms.\nIt is challenging to determine the net effect of these supply developments, especially because at\nthis point, we still do not know all the details of government policy changes and their impacts. Some of the\nmore positive developments may be realized over time. However, I expect that in the near term, the\nnegative supply effects I have discussed will weigh on the economy.\nIn addition, demand developments could mirror the timing of these supply-side effects. In\nparticular, financial market support to households and firms should wane in the near term, especially if the\nrecent tightening of financial conditions, from lower stock prices and wider credit spreads, continues.14\nFurthermore, and importantly, periods of high uncertainty like we are seeing now can also have negative\ndemand effects, as households and firms become more hesitant to spend. Indeed, a “wait-and-see”\nattitude is now prevalent among stakeholders in the New England region.\nQuantifying this effect is difficult, although it is clear that current levels of economic- and trade-\npolicy uncertainty, as shown in Figure 9, are very elevated by historical standards.15 In this chart, the left\npanel shows a measure of overall policy uncertainty, while the right panel shows a measure focused on\ntrade policy uncertainty, which has reached an all-time high. And while lower taxes for businesses and\nhouseholds could boost demand, this effect is likely to play out over a longer horizon.\n14 In this context, it is also worth noting that firms’ cash holdings have returned to more normal levels, and\nmany businesses will need to refinance existing debt at higher interest rates.\n15 These data are based on work by Scott Baker, Nick Bloom, and Steven J. Davis that quantifies\nnewspaper coverage of policy-related economic uncertainty along several dimensions. The most recent\ndata are for March 2025. For more details, see, https://www.policyuncertainty.com/index.html.\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 10, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThe Outlook\nThinking about supply and demand developments together, I see the potential for demand to slow\nmore than supply. This would result in GDP growing below an already slowing trend in 2025, and the\nunemployment rate rising somewhat. And we should expect reduced GDP growth early this year from the\nimport surge to get ahead of tariffs, which should start unwinding and boost GDP over the next few\nmonths. Over the medium term, as demand and supply improve, there could be more scope for faster\ngrowth. But more adverse scenarios for real activity cannot be ruled out.\nTurning to price developments, core PCE inflation should increase this year, before gradually\nreverting to the Fed’s 2 percent target over the medium term. I see this high inflation as mostly tied to the\nexpected impact of tariffs, given announced increases that are larger and more broad-based than\nanticipated.\nWhile we do not know exactly how the tariffs will play out, a scenario with an effective tariff rate\nsomewhat above 10 percent would raise the core PCE price level by a cumulative 0.7 to 1.2 percentage\npoints with most of the effect likely occurring this year. If correct, this would result in core PCE inflation\npossibly running well above 3 percent this year.16 This estimate is based on analysis by my staff that\nincorporates tariff effects on both directly consumed imported goods, and imports used in domestic\nproduction. These imported intermediates account for 44 percent of total U.S. imports in final\nconsumption, which are used by a wider range of domestic producers than many realize.17\nThere is, of course, considerable uncertainty around these estimates. The administration’s\npolicies are still evolving. The ultimate impact of the tariffs will also depend crucially on the degree to\nwhich firms pass increased costs on to consumers – and the extent to which our trading partners\nretaliate.\n16 However, I’ll note that a survey of small and medium-sized businesses by Fed staff at the end of 2024\nsuggested that pass-through of tariffs into prices of goods and services may take some time –\nrespondents indicated up to two years – and may not be completed by the end of this year. The survey\nwas conducted before the new administration took office and before the announcement of tariff details.\nSee Andrade, Philippe, Alexander Dietrich, John Leer, Raphael Schoenle, Jenny Tang, and Egon\nZakrajšek (2025), “Small and Medium-sized Businesses' Expectations Concerning Tariffs, Costs, and\nPrices” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Current Policy Perspectives 25-7. Available at:\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/publications/current-policy-perspectives/2025/smb-expectations-concerning-\ntariffs-costs-prices.\n17 For instance, final goods account for most of the imports for garments, and about a third of the imports\nfor new motor vehicles. But imported intermediates account for about 90 percent of imports for hospitals\nand nursing home services.\n8\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 10, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nRecent inflation data have already been somewhat elevated despite some moderation shown in\nthis morning’s March CPI numbers. Figure 10 highlights some evidence suggesting that recent PCE price\nincreases have been greater in goods categories that are more likely to be impacted by tariffs. The figure\nshows the change in one-month inflation rates from January to February for different PCE goods and\nservices categories on the y-axis, with the categories ranked by their direct tariff exposure on the x-axis.\nThe figure highlights that PCE inflation increased more in February in those categories with greater direct\ntariff exposure.18\nMonetary Policy\nAgainst this backdrop, I see monetary policy as well positioned to address a wide range of\npotential economic outcomes in this highly uncertain environment. The current federal funds rate should\ncontinue to exert some restraint on the interest-sensitive components of demand, such as residential and\nbusiness investment. It should also have a stronger effect on some households now that the labor market\nand households’ balance sheets have normalized. And the 1 percentage point easing of the policy rate\nnear the end of last year should avoid undue restraint, helping to preserve labor market conditions that\nare still healthy overall.\nBut in the near term at least, policy also will have to manage risks to the outlook, which I see as\nmoving further to the upside with respect to inflation, and to the downside with respect to economic\nactivity. In particular, policy should help guard against the risk that price-level increases related to tariffs\nunmoor longer-term inflation expectations.\nOne important feature of the pandemic inflation episode was that longer-run inflation expectations\nremained well anchored, which contrasts with the 1970s experience, as shown in Figure 11. Stable\ninflation expectations supported the disinflation we have seen to date amid healthy labor market\nconditions. The stability of longer-run inflation expectations will be an important determinant of monetary\npolicy going forward. While most long-run inflation expectations measures remain well behaved, the\nrecent increase in the Michigan Survey measure (the red line) is an exception and bears careful watching.\nMaintaining the current monetary policy stance seems appropriate for the time being, as we learn\nmore about the scope of the changes in government policy and their impact on the economy. Given the\nlikely evolution of inflation and real activity and the related risks to both, policy could face challenging\ntradeoffs. Setting appropriate policy will potentially require balancing competing objectives and will\n18 The figure shows the direct impact of the tariffs, and not potential additional indirect effects from\nimported intermediate inputs because the direct effect is likely to show through first.\n9\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 10, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ndepend on the economy’s actual and expected distance from the FOMC full employment and price\nstability mandates. It might still be appropriate to lower the federal funds rate later this year. But renewed\nprice pressures could delay further policy normalization, as confidence is needed that the tariffs are not\ndestabilizing inflation expectations. With elevated inflation, the signal would have to be compelling to take\npreemptive actions against the risk that activity weakens by more than expected.\nI caution that my outlook could change considerably as events unfold over the coming weeks and\nmonths. Monetary policy will need to remain nimble as we continue to focus on achieving both the price\nstability and employment dimensions of the Fed’s dual-mandate goals from Congress.\nConcluding Observations\nWith that, let me conclude with a few observations. Being here for the Razin Lecture of course\nbrings back memories of advising Ofair on his dissertation, and more generally of my time on\nGeorgetown’s faculty, from 1992 to 2007, including work with Fed economists.\nThe Federal Reserve Board, where I meet with colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee eight times a year, is not far from here, but being part of the Fed System has expanded my\nunderstanding of the central bank’s roles and the breadth of its activities. With the eyes of a relative\nnewcomer, I have been impressed by the expertise, dedication, nonpartisanship, and public service\norientation of the Fed’s people. They are truly engaged by the opportunity to help Americans benefit from\na vibrant economy that works for everyone.\nOne strength of the Fed’s long-standing structure of 12 Reserve Banks is its on-the-ground\npresence – not just in Washington, and on Wall Street, but in rural areas, in large and small cities, and\nacross the country. And our senior policymakers are appointed to their roles in different ways, which\nmakes the Fed representative of the country and accountable, while also providing the room to make\nsometimes-hard choices in the long-term public interest.\nYou’re familiar with the interest-rate decisions we make, and hopefully with some of the extensive\neconomic research that informs them. We augment that research and analysis with active engagement\nacross our regions, listening to all types of stakeholders. That deepens our understanding of economic\nconditions, to better pursue our mandates from Congress for price stability and maximum employment.\nThe Fed’s work also includes supervising some of the nation’s banks for safety and soundness,\nwhich is crucial to ensure a stable, secure financial system we can all rely on. And our community\ndevelopment activities include research and convening that help illuminate challenges and opportunities\nfor economic resurgence in areas that might be struggling.\n10\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 10, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThe Fed also has a key role in ensuring that the nation’s currency is available to meet the public\nneeds. We operate electronic systems that clear and transfer trillions of dollars of transactions every day,\nsafely and securely. And we innovate to increase efficiency – including developing new infrastructure, like\nthe FedNow instant payments system19 we built to help make real-time payments available to all banks\nand all consumers over time.\nIn sum, I appreciate the opportunity to say a bit about how the Federal Reserve fits into our\ncountry’s framework of economic policymaking and financial stability. My Boston Fed colleagues and I are\ngrateful for the opportunity to serve the public, and embrace the challenge of supporting a prosperous\neconomy.\nThank you again for hosting me. Congratulations again to Tracy Xu, and really to all of you at\nGeorgetown for your impactful work. And thank you for joining me in honoring Ofair Razin today.\n19 Federal Reserve Board - FedNow® Service\n11",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\n2023 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum\nsponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the\nUniversity of Chicago Booth School of Business\nFebruary 24, 2023\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n1. Inflation remains too high. I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, then\nholding there for some, perhaps extended, time. My views will continue to be based on a holistic\nassessment of available information. And while aware of the risks and uncertainties, I remain optimistic\nthere is a path to restoring price stability without a significant downturn.\n2. The root of the inflation surprise was an imbalance between demand and supply. During 2021-22,\nrealized demand exceeded supply, and forecasters were overly optimistic about supply recovering to meet\nthe increase in demand as the economy reopened. The interaction of supply chain bottlenecks and\nconstraints to labor supply compounded the forecasting misses. Supply chains were under strain due to\ncontinued bouts of COVID variants; and later, Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n3. My view is that, in 2021 – in the aftermath of the deep pandemic downturn, in the face of significant\ncontinued uncertainty, and with inflation expectations in a reasonable range – supporting the economy\nversus pre-empting an inflation surge that few were forecasting seemed a reasoned decision.\n4. Policy lessons from this still-evolving episode include that capacity constraints can lead to a less\nfavorable trade-off between inflation and unemployment – and this potentially has implications for the\nfuture conduct of monetary policy, as we at the Fed fulfill our dual mandate. Furthermore, I’ll observe that\nadditional wide-ranging indicators can be especially helpful for evaluating policy options in unusual\ncontexts.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIt is a pleasure to be part of the 2023 Forum. I’ll begin by noting that, of course, I speak\nonly for myself, not for colleagues at the Board of Governors or other Reserve Banks. After\nsome brief remarks about current monetary policy, I’ll turn to the important topic of this panel.\nInflation remains too high, and recent data – including several strong labor market\nindicators, as well as faster than expected retail sales and producer price inflation – all reinforce\nmy view that we have more work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target. While\noptimistic there is a path to restoring price stability without a significant downturn, I am also well\naware of the many risks and uncertainties, including the risk of a self-fulfilling loss of business\nand consumer confidence.\nPolicy actions to date continue to demonstrate the committee’s resolve – and it is helpful\nto see further declines in longer term inflation expectations, consistent with the credibility of our\ncommitment. I anticipate further rate increases to reach a sufficiently restrictive level, and then\nholding there for some, perhaps extended, time. My outlook and policy decisions will continue\nto be based on a holistic assessment of available information and rooted in pursuit of the Fed’s\nCongressional mandate for price stability and maximum employment.\nFew forecasters inside or outside the Fed anticipated the inflation surge that began in\nthe first half of 2021, as the economy reopened from the pandemic. Indeed, for months, many –\nincluding the Fed – miscast how high, broad, and recalcitrant inflation would prove to be. Fed\nactions to remove accommodation began in late 2021, with winding down asset purchases. As\nthis shifted to an asset run-off (from our balance sheet) that is still underway, the FOMC began\nraising rates in March 2022. Since then, our unusually aggressive actions increased the federal\nfunds rate by four and a half percentage points in just nine months. These actions, along with\nthe ones I expect will be taken going forward, should bring inflation back down to target in a\nreasonable amount of time.\nWhile I’ll say a bit more about recent policy, my remarks focus on the topic of this panel\n– why were the inflation forecast misses so large and persistent? Examining the nature of the\nerrors is important and will help us improve policy going forward. The following are key aspects\nof my current perspective, recognizing that this complex episode is still unfolding.\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThe Miscast Inflation Forecast\nInflation has several determinants, but unsurprisingly, the root of the inflation surprise\nwas an imbalance between demand and supply. Over the course of 2021 and 2022, realized\ndemand exceeded expectations while the opposite was true for supply, causing significant price\npressures and much higher-than-expected inflation. I’ll highlight a few important factors.\nThe first relates to the behavior of consumption and gross domestic product (GDP),\nrelative to pre-pandemic trends. Output fell suddenly and sharply in the pandemic, prompting\nstrongly accommodative monetary and fiscal policy actions (from the central bank and the\nfederal government, respectively).\nAs shown in Figure 1, the rebound in demand was also quick, and especially so for\nconsumption. Perhaps more focus on consumption rather than GDP would have helped\nforecasters better assess the implications of demand for consumer price inflation dynamics.1\nBy early 2021, both GDP and consumption were above trend. But although notable at\nroughly 3 percent, even the consumption gap was not that large by historical standards. By\nitself, such a gap cannot account for most of the inflation surge.\nUnanticipated supply shortfalls that lowered capacity relative to pre-pandemic trends\nclearly had to play an important role in the supply-demand imbalance and in miscasting inflation.\nMonetary policy, of course, cannot remedy supply disruptions. But an understanding of supply\nconditions is central to assessing the economic context, developing the outlook, and\ndetermining appropriate policy. And the FOMC does need to respond to supply-driven\ninflationary pressures that have the potential to un-anchor longer-run inflation expectations.2\nThe errors in assessing the speed of the supply recovery were, for most policymakers\nand observers, large and persistent. There were certainly efforts then, which continue today, to\nbetter understand constraints on global supply chains and their impact on inflation. The New\n1 The consumption basket includes domestic and imported goods and services so that both domestic and\ninternational developments will impact consumer price inflation dynamics. However, much of the\nspending in the early stages of the recovery was on imported goods, likely somewhat mitigating the initial\neffects on domestic prices.\n2 See “Inflation levels and (in)attention,” by Anat Bracha and Jenny Tang, Federal Reserve Bank of\nBoston Working Paper 22-4 (2022), for details on how the relationship between inflation news and\ninflation expectations becomes stronger when inflation rates are high.\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nYork Fed’s Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (Figure 2) is an example.3 Still, it is difficult to\nassess the extent and duration of supply challenges in real time – especially if they depend on\npandemic developments and unexpected shocks such as Russia’s war in Ukraine.\nAnother factor to consider is that the consumption recovery after the initial phase of the\npandemic was disproportionately concentrated in goods, rather than on service sector spending\nthat required face-to-face interactions. This pattern by itself was bound to create supply\npressures, which were in turn amplified by pandemic-related constraints. This dynamic is\nreflected in the chart (Figure 3) showing the large increase in goods consumption and the surge\nin goods price inflation.\nPerhaps equally notable is the fact that, despite the large drop in services consumption,\nthere was little decline in services price inflation (Figure 4). Here, the contrast with the\nexperience from the Great Recession – when the mild slowdown in consumption was\naccompanied by a noticeable deceleration in inflation – is instructive, and again suggests a key\nrole for supply constraints this time.\nSurprises on the inflation front continued in late 2021 and into 2022. The expectation\nwas that, as the economy reopened, demand would shift back from goods to services, and\ngoods inflation would subside without a significant rise in service-sector inflation. Supply – and\nmost notably labor supply, since services tend to be labor intensive – would increase to meet\ndemand.\nReality was a bit different. Services consumption rose somewhat, without a material\ndecline in goods consumption. This meant little relief to supply chains, which were also under\nsignificant strain due to continued global bouts of COVID variants and, later, Russia’s war in\nUkraine – thus keeping pressure on inflation.\nMost importantly, the expected pickup in labor supply to meet the increased services\ndemand has been taking much longer to materialize than expected, creating a demand-supply\ngap in the labor market that fueled wage and price inflation.\n3 See https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/01/a-new-barometer-of-global-supply-chain-\npressures/. More broadly, there was an expansion of types of information considered by policymakers,\nincluding an effort to better understand consumer behavior as the economy re-opened by using high-\nfrequency data on mobility and foot traffic, transportation, dining, and hotel occupancy, among others.\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThere are several ways to think about the labor market imbalance. One is illustrated in\nthis chart (Figure 5), which compares the GDP recovery to the employment recovery, again\nusing pre-pandemic trends as benchmarks. Although fast by historical standards, the\nemployment recovery was noticeably slower than the GDP recovery.4 Only near the end of\n2022 did the cyclical position of employment become more in line with GDP.\nThe fact that employment took more time to recover than aggregate demand reflected a\nslower than expected recovery in labor supply, which caused fierce competition among firms for\navailable workers. Given these unusual patterns, the unemployment rate has clearly not been a\nsufficient statistic for gauging labor market conditions.\nJust before the pandemic, inflation was seemingly stuck below the 2 percent target, with\nan unemployment rate at similarly low levels. Perhaps more weight should have been placed\non indicators such as quits and vacancies – but their possible superiority as measures of labor\nmarket tightness relative to the unemployment rate was not clear from past experience.\nAgain, the pandemic was uncharted territory for forecasters and policymakers alike, and\nthere was little reason to expect an accurate real-time read on how much, for example, fear of\nCovid and remote education arrangements would affect labor supply decisions, especially given\nall the uncertainty associated with the pandemic’s evolution.5\nIn sum, an important reason for underpredicting inflation was that forecasters were\noverly optimistic about supply recovering to meet the increase in demand as the economy\nreopened. The fact that both supply chain bottlenecks and constraints to labor supply were\noperating at the same time compounded the forecasting errors.\nMonetary Policy in Real Time\nMy comments so far have highlighted the importance of supply constraints in generating\nhigh, unexpected inflation during the pandemic recovery. I’ve noted that there is little the Fed\n4 On this point, see also “A new interpretation of productivity growth dynamics in the pre-pandemic and\npandemic era U.S. economy, 1950-2022” by Robert J. Gordon and Hassan Sayed, NBER working paper\n30267 (2022).\n5 Incidentally, I will note here that it was also difficult to predict that the pandemic would lead to increased\ndemand for residential space, stemming from remote work, which in turn resulted in higher house prices\nand rents.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ncan do to alleviate supply challenges, but that policy should lean against supply-driven inflation\nthat risks un-anchoring longer-run inflation expectations. In particular, a temporary but\npersistent dislocation can increase such a risk.\nIt is also clear from my previous comments and charts that demand played a role in the\ninflation rise as well.6 One question, then, is whether monetary policy should have tightened\nearlier to reduce the risk of un-anchoring inflation expectations and to offset the demand\nincrease.\nSome may say that policy was too accommodative in the first place. In my view, such a\nstatement ignores the real time concerns created by the pandemic; the associated risk\nmanagement required; and the difficulty of inferring, in real time, how quickly adverse supply\nshocks would unwind.\nWhile not involved in policy decisions until becoming Boston Fed President in July 2022,\nI was a keen policy observer. I agree with Chair Powell and other colleagues who have stated\nthat, with the benefit of hindsight, policy could have been tightened sooner. But to me in 2021,\nin the aftermath of the deep pandemic downturn, in the face of significant continued uncertainty,\nand with inflation expectations in a reasonable range, supporting the economy versus pre-\nempting an inflation surge that few were forecasting seemed a reasoned decision. I’ll note that\nmy view was not predicated on the 2020 revisions to the Fed’s policy framework.\nWould earlier rate increases have significantly helped reduce inflation pressures? That\ndepends on how early and how quickly the Fed would have moved. In my view, given the\nsignificant uncertainty that continued to surround the pandemic, earlier action by the Fed may\nhave been less aggressive, taking longer to reach a restrictive range.\nWhere Are We Now?\nWhile the misses in inflation were large, key aspects of prior forecasts are playing out,\nalbeit with a lag. With improvements on the supply side – both in terms of supply chains and, to\n6 For a decomposition of inflation into demand- and supply-driven components, see “How much do supply\nand demand drive inflation?” by Adam H. Shapiro, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Economic\nLetter (June 21, 2022) and “Are the Demand and Supply Channels of Inflation Persistent? Evidence from\na Novel Decomposition of PCE Inflation” by Viacheslav Sheremirov, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nCurrent Policy Perspectives (2022).\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 1:30 PM on Friday, February 24, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nsome degree, labor supply – we are now seeing initial signs of deceleration in goods-price and\nwage inflation. These improvements took longer than expected to materialize but do appear to\nbe providing some relief to inflation.\nIn addition, despite the risk of longer-run inflation expectations becoming un-anchored,\nthey have remained in check throughout this period. And now that policy is in restrictive\nterritory, the process of realigning demand with supply is underway.\nSome Policy Lessons\nThere are several important policy issues to be studied from this still-evolving episode. I\noffer a partial list and reiterate that these are my views alone.\nThe belief that inflation dynamics during the pandemic recovery would remain similar to\nthe 1996-2019 period was too optimistic. Thus, forecasters likely underestimated implications of\nexcessively strong labor markets for wages and prices. And especially when unemployment is\nlow, it is clear that labor market tightness is best assessed with a broad range of indicators.\nReliance on a small trade-off between inflation and unemployment – that is, on a linear\nand flat Phillips curve even at low unemployment rates – implied more willingness to risk\nprobing down on the unemployment rate than may have been warranted. Recent experience\nsuggests that capacity constraints can lead to a nonlinear Phillips curve with a higher slope at\nlow unemployment rate levels. This less favorable trade-off between inflation and\nunemployment has implications for how best to probe going forward, as we at the Fed fulfill our\ndual mandate.\nUltimately, the nature of the pandemic represented unchartered waters for policymakers,\nand as I have argued, supply factors played an important role. Indeed, there may be a\nsomewhat stronger case than previously thought for taking out insurance against adverse\ninflation outcomes, with policy tightening, when there is the risk of supply constraints being\nbinding. Moreover, we have learned that additional, wide ranging, indicators may be helpful for\nevaluating if there is a need for preemptive policy in these contexts.\nIn sum, I believe a collective dose of humility and openness is appropriate, as we focus\non all we can learn from studying this episode. I am pleased to see that work well underway,\nincluding at the Fed and through discussions such as this panel.\n6",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nAt the 39th Annual NABE Economic Policy Conference\nMarch 30, 2023\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nKey Takeaways\n1. Financial stability: The banking system is strong and resilient, with well-capitalized\ninstitutions and ample liquidity. Recent difficulties, and the decisive actions taken in\nresponse, demonstrate commitment to use all our tools to ensure the financial system\nremains safe and sound, and to take action as needed. The lessons learned from the\nreview underway will be welcome, and instructive.\n2. Monetary policy and the macroeconomic outlook: Recent data show that inflation is still\ntoo high, continuing to take a toll on households and firms. I anticipate that some additional\npolicy tightening will be needed as we follow through on our commitment to price stability.\nHowever, while recognizing the risks and uncertainties to the outlook, I remain optimistic\nthere is a path to bringing inflation down without a significant downturn, because of the\nresilience I see in the economy.\n3. Financial infrastructure and payments services: The Fed provides essential financial\ninfrastructure the economy depends on – and innovates to meet evolving needs and\npreferences. In today’s world, people want quick and easy ways to make payments\ninstantly, with immediate access to those funds. To help financial institutions offer instant\npayment services to their customers around the clock, we will launch the FedNowSM\nService in July.\n4. Community economic development and opportunity: While the Fed’s activities are\nbroad, they all relate to supporting a vibrant and inclusive economy, consistent with our\nmandates – stable prices and maximum employment. That’s why, for example, we have for\ndecades studied the gaps and disparities behind the aggregates. It is also why the Boston\nFed is helping spark collaboration among the private, public, nonprofit, and philanthropic\nsectors, to find local solutions to complex economic problems in urban and rural areas.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nGood afternoon. It is truly a pleasure to be with you today. I thank NABE for the\ninvitation, and Elaine Buckberg for moderating the discussion.\nMy thanks to all of you, for being here, and for the work you do – using the tools\nand insights from economics to support your organizations, and our economy.\nBy way of introduction, I am honored to serve as an economic policymaker at the\nFederal Reserve. It is a privilege, a responsibility, and an opportunity – and I am\ncommitted to an inclusive approach to service in the public interest.\nBefore turning to questions, I will share some perspectives from my first nine\nmonths as a Fed president and Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participant. I’ll\ncover some obvious topics (financial stability, monetary policy, and the macroeconomy).\nI’ll also touch very briefly on some things about the Fed that get less attention (including\npayments infrastructure and supporting economic resurgence). When you think about\nthe economy – as those in this room do, all the time – recognizing the breadth of the\nFed’s work is important, because it all connects to our mandate and mission, and to our\noverarching goal of a vibrant, inclusive economy with opportunities for all.\nFirst, I’ll give my standard disclaimer: These perspectives are my own. I am not\nspeaking for any other Federal Reserve policymakers.\nMonetary Policy, and the Macroeconomic Outlook\nInflation remains too high, and recent indicators reinforce my view that there is\nmore work to do, to bring inflation down to the 2 percent target associated with price\nstability. I’ll say more about why this is so important, in a moment.\nOur banking system is strong and resilient, with well-capitalized institutions and\nample liquidity. The banking industry plays an important role in the economy – banks of\nall sizes are important for meeting saving and credit needs across communities.\nHowever, recent bank failures underscore how difficulties in just a few institutions have\nthe potential to undermine confidence in the entire banking system.\nThe Federal Reserve, in concert with the Treasury and FDIC, took decisive\nactions to strengthen the public’s confidence in the U.S. banking system and to protect\nthe U.S. economy. I note that while these actions assisted depositors of the failed\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nbanks, shareholders and certain unsecured debt holders were not protected, and the\nbanks’ senior management were removed. Vice Chair Barr has a comprehensive review\nunderway to determine what went wrong and whether changes are needed. We will\ntake what is learned to heart and strengthen practices accordingly – consistent with our\nmission to ensure a safe, sound, and stable banking system supporting a healthy\neconomy for all.1\nThe Federal Reserve continues to monitor financial conditions closely, and is\nprepared to use all tools at its disposal in keeping the banking system safe and sound.\nI will now turn to monetary policy, mindful of course that challenges to financial\nstability – and credit conditions generally – have implications for the macroeconomy and\nby extension, for policy.\nIn March of last year, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began\nraising interest rates to bring inflation down. But despite progress, inflation remains too\nhigh, and there is more work to do to restore price stability.\nWhy is the inflation fight so important? The starting place is the Fed’s dual\nmandate from Congress, for price stability and maximum employment – representing\nstrong and stable economic conditions that benefit everyone.\nHigh inflation creates hardship for all, particularly those at the lower end of the\nincome distribution who can least afford price increases – especially for essentials such\n1 See the Joint Statement describing “actions enabling the FDIC to complete its resolution of Silicon\nValley Bank…in a manner that fully protects all depositors,” emphasizing “No losses associated with the\nresolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer”, and continuing “We are also announcing\na similar systemic risk exception for Signature Bank … which was closed today by its state chartering\nauthority. All depositors of this institution will be made whole. As with the resolution of Silicon Valley\nBank, no losses will be borne by the taxpayer. Shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders will not\nbe protected. Senior management has also been removed. Any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund to\nsupport uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law.\nFinally, the Federal Reserve Board on Sunday announced it will make available additional funding to\neligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their\ndepositors.” (https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312b.htm). Also\nnote the announcements that Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr is leading a review of the\nsupervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank, in light of its failure\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230313a.htm), and of coordinated\ncentral bank action to enhance the provision of U.S. dollar liquidity\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230319a.htm).\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nas food, housing, and transportation. Inflation also complicates investment and planning\ndecisions for firms throughout the economy.\nI lead the Fed’s First District, which covers most of New England, and as I meet\nwith constituents, many highlight the challenges they face from inflation. In Vermont\nearlier this month, I heard from small business owners ending projects due to cost\nincreases, parents having to take on second jobs given rising prices on necessities, and\npeople unable to accept attractive jobs because living costs are rising too fast where the\njob is located.\nImportantly, the two dimensions of the Fed’s mandate – price stability and\nmaximum employment – are intertwined. Low, predictable inflation is an important\nprecondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time. Price stability is\nessential for a well-functioning economy and labor market.\nInflation reflects a gap between demand and supply, resulting in pressures that\nfuel wage and price increases. In raising interest rates, the Fed intends to slow demand,\ncool a still-hot labor market, and bring demand and supply back into sustainable\nalignment.\nSince March, the FOMC raised rates from near zero to the range of 4.75 to 5\npercent. After initial, expeditious moves, recent increments have been small and\ndeliberate – which in my view is appropriate as we approach a level that is sufficiently\nrestrictive.\nThe recent data show signs of more underlying strength in the economy than\nmany anticipated. The unemployment rate remains at historically low levels, job growth\nremains robust, and spending indicators through February were stronger than expected.\nThis strength might reflect the fact that policy did not enter fully restrictive territory until\nthe second half of 2022, and it may be too soon to see its full effects on real activity.\nBut special factors may also have limited the impact of policy actions thus far,\nrelative to historic norms. On the household side, a sizable amount of “excess” savings\naccumulated during the pandemic remains – although this is less evident at the lower\nend of the income distribution, where some signs of stress are emerging. On the firm\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nside, balance sheets also remain quite strong overall, limiting the need for external\nfinance.\nSustained household and business spending, and limited pickup in labor supply,\nhelp explain why the labor market remains robust. But there are some emerging signs\nof slowing labor demand. In particular, a large portion of the recent strength in payrolls\ncomes from sectors that were hit especially hard early in the pandemic – such as leisure\nand accommodation, and health care – and faced significant hiring challenges in the\nrecovery. As this “catching up” process ends, I expect more moderation in hiring, which\nshould help to relieve wage pressures.2 Here, it is important to note that workers do not\nbenefit from nominal wage gains that are eroded by too-high inflation – what matters for\nworkers are gains in real wages.\nWhile we may be seeing some initial signs of wage moderation, more will be\nneeded for a sustained improvement in price inflation. In determining whether inflation is\nmoving toward target in a reasonable amount of time, it is informative to look separately\nat three key components.\n First, core goods price inflation has slowed, but a full passthrough of supply chain\nimprovements and lower input costs to goods prices will take more time.\n Second, shelter inflation remains quite high. Slowing growth in new rents (with\nactual declines in some areas for rents and house prices) should feed through\ninto lower shelter inflation in the coming quarters.\n But, third, services inflation excluding shelter, which tends to be closely tied to\nlabor costs, remains particularly elevated and will require wage pressures to\nease more.\n2 The recent slowdown in job quits is another potential sign of slowing labor demand. In addition, cross-\nstate data suggest that wage inflation tends to be more strongly correlated with quits than vacancies,\nimplying that the slowdown in quits may help to ease wage pressures despite vacancies remaining\nelevated. Wage inflation, however, also continues to be highly correlated with unemployment, suggesting\nthat at least some rise in unemployment rate will be needed to bring about a more significant decline in\nwage growth.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIn all, the challenge ahead lies in determining the level and path of the federal\nfunds rate to bring inflation back to target in a reasonable amount of time, without undue\nlabor market disruptions.\nAs I noted earlier, recent financial sector stress has added to this challenge by\nincreasing the uncertainty around appropriate monetary policy. While the banking\nsystem remains strong and resilient, recent developments will likely lead banks to take a\nsomewhat more conservative outlook and tighten lending standards, thus contributing to\nslowing the economy and reducing inflationary pressures. These developments may\npartially offset the need for additional rate increases.\nWhile recognizing the heightened uncertainty, I believe staying the course with a\none-quarter-percent increase in the policy rate at last week’s FOMC meeting was\nappropriate. Similarly, given current information, I see the median federal funds rate\npath for 2023 in last week’s Summary of Economic Projections from Fed policymakers\n(the SEP)3 as reasonably balancing the risk of monetary policy not being restrictive\nenough to bring inflation down, and the risk that activity slows by more than needed to\naddress elevated price pressures.\nSimilar to the SEP median, I currently anticipate some modest additional policy\ntightening, and then holding through the end of this year. Of course, I’ll be carefully\nwatching a range of indicators including data on inflation, spending, labor markets, and\nfinancial conditions.\nOverall, I continue to be what I call a “realistic optimist.” I am well aware of the\nmany risks and uncertainties facing our economy – including the risk of a self-fulfilling\nloss in business and consumer confidence. However, I’ve also mentioned reasons to\nbe optimistic the economy may prove more resilient to tight financial conditions than in\nthe past – including business and household fundamentals that remain relatively strong.\nSo, I am still optimistic there is a path to bringing down inflation without a significant\neconomic downturn.\n3 https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20230322.pdf\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nA Range of Activities in Support of a Vibrant Economy\nAs I mentioned at the outset, I want to touch briefly on some things the Fed does,\nthat get less attention. In my view, understanding the breadth of the Fed’s work is\nimportant because I see the Fed’s mission as fostering a vibrant, resilient, inclusive\neconomy; and we do that in a wider range of ways than most people realize – from\nmonetary policy, to economic research, financial stability efforts, community\ndevelopment activities, and initiatives related to payments, technology, and finance. I\nwill be happy to elaborate during the discussion, but for now I’ll just mention two\ninitiatives that show the breadth and depth of the Boston Fed’s commitment to a strong,\ninclusive economy with opportunities for all.\nFirst, the infrastructure for making and receiving payments is a foundation of\neveryone’s economic lives and our financial system. In today’s world, people\nincreasingly want quick and easy ways to make payments and immediate access to\nthose funds.\nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve System, the Boston Fed has been leading the\nbuild of a new, real-time payments service, referred to as the FedNowSM Service.\nLaunching in July, the infrastructure will provide access to instant payments for\nparticipating financial institutions and their customers.\nFedNow will offer real economic benefits to the American public, who will be able\nto send and receive instant payments safely and efficiently through participating\ninstitutions – giving greater flexibility to manage money at any time of the day or night,\n365 days a year. We encourage financial institutions across the country join in the\nservice, so their customers can broadly enjoy the benefits of instant payments.4\nSecond, for decades we have studied gaps and disparities in economic\noutcomes. This relates directly to our mandates from Congress, which include\nmaximum employment. Because unemployment rates that are persistently higher by\n4 Learn more at FedNowSM Explorer – Instant Payments Learning & Resources.\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, March 30, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nrace, or by place – as they have been for a long time – reflect underutilization of our\ncountry’s labor resources, adversely affecting productivity and prosperity.\nOne effort proving important in this regard is the Boston Fed’s Working Places\nprogram, which touches 30 urban and rural areas across New England. Research\nshows that the “secret sauce” in economic resurgence seems to be cross-sector\ncollaborative leadership from local people, working together to identify issues and\nsolutions. The Fed’s role is to provide a framework for convening and for increasing\ncollaboration among the private sector, philanthropy, local organizations, state\ngovernment, and residents. The program supports efforts by local leaders to help their\nareas address challenges such as workforce development and affordable housing – and\nthe results are promising.5\nI’ll conclude with a final observation. As I travel and hear about peoples’\nexperiences, I’m struck by the opportunities and strengths in our economy, as well as\nthe challenges. Hearing from a wide range of voices rounds out the economic data,\ndeepens our understanding, and helps us all make progress. My Fed colleagues and I\nwill continue to prioritize this type of engagement, which is essential to our work.\nWith that, I’ll be happy to discuss some questions, with Elaine.\n5 In a January speech, I discussed the Working Places framework and local efforts to find economic\nresurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing challenges. https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-\nevents/speeches/2023/the-national-and-regional-economy-navigating-near-term-changes-and-long-term-\nchallenges.aspx\n7",

U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, October 14, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n“Assessing the Balance of Risks\nin the Economy”\nRemarks to the Greater Boston\nChamber of Commerce\nSusan M. Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nOctober 14, 2025\nBoston, Massachusetts\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 3:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, October 14, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nKey Takeaways\n1. Economic growth remains solid, despite headwinds from tariffs and uncertainty. But job gains have\ndeclined notably — though without a substantial rise in unemployment. Inflation, which had been heading\nback to the FOMC’s 2% target, has picked up recently and is likely to remain elevated in the near term,\nlargely due to tariffs.\n2. The slowdown in hiring this year likely reflects reductions in both labor supply – largely linked to\nimmigration restrictions – and labor demand, a confluence of factors that is difficult to disentangle. This\nraises the risk that labor demand may fall short of labor supply, which could eventually lead to a more\nsubstantial rise in the unemployment rate.\n3. Anemic hiring amid solid growth likely reflects firms’ reluctance to hire in a highly uncertain environment,\nand robust labor productivity growth is allowing firms to meet demand. A productivity-enhancing mindset\nis ubiquitous in my discussions with CEOs of large and small businesses across New England — including\ninvestments in AI as well as in more traditional technologies.\n4. Though significantly down from its peak, inflation has risen in recent months largely due to tariffs. I\nexpect the economy to experience some more negative effects from tariffs over the remainder of this year\nand into early 2026, as pass-through to consumer prices continues, reducing household purchasing power\nand spending.\n5. The upside risk to inflation cannot be discounted after more than four years of above-target price growth.\nHowever, a softer labor market, the potential for continued strong productivity gains, and generally stable\ninflation expectations reduce the risk of inflationary pressures.\n6. My baseline outlook for the economy is relatively benign, with continued growth, a relatively modest\nincrease in the unemployment rate and inflation remaining elevated this year and into next as tariffs are\npassed through, before resuming its decline. But I do not rule out alterative scenarios featuring higher and\nmore persistent inflation, more adverse labor market developments – or both.\n7. With inflation risks somewhat more contained, but greater downside risks to employment, it seems\nprudent to normalize policy a bit further this year to support the labor market. Even with some additional\neasing, monetary policy would remain mildly restrictive, which is appropriate to ensure inflation resumes its\ndecline once tariff effects fade. But policy is not on a preset path, and going forward, policy decisions will\ncontinue to be guided by the evolution of the data and their implication for the outlook.\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 3:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, October 14, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThank you, and a warm welcome to all of you. My first speech as Boston Fed president was\nto the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, and it is a great pleasure to be with all of you\nagain today.\nIn those remarks three years ago, I stressed my commitment, as a monetary policymaker, to\nachieving both price stability and maximum employment – the Federal Reserve’s core\nmandates from Congress. I also emphasized the criticality of rooting my decisions in data and\nanalytics. I discussed the value of complementing quantitative data with extensive outreach, to\ngather insights from stakeholders in different sectors and places across New England, and to\nsee “up close” our regional economy – including the opportunities and the challenges. And I\nnoted the breadth of our work here at the Boston Fed, focused on helping to foster a vibrant\neconomy and financial system that works for everyone – not just for some people.\nMany things have changed since I first spoke with you in the fall of 2022. The economy is in\na very different place now, with different challenges for monetary policy. But what I said then\nholds just as true today. Empirical rigor is always important for formulating an economic outlook,\nassessing the risks, and determining appropriate policy. This is perhaps especially true in times\nof change and scrutiny. Diligently explaining how we, as policymakers, are analyzing and\ninterpreting available data is one of the many ways the Fed is, and should be, open and\naccountable. And accountability must go hand in hand with the independence that history has\nso clearly shown is essential for central banks to do their jobs well and serve the public –\nbecause the independence to make difficult policy decisions, when needed, leads to better\neconomic outcomes for all.\nI’ll devote much of my remarks today to sharing my assessment of national economic\nconditions, my outlook, and my views on monetary policy – using some charts along the way to\nhighlight particularly important recent trends. I’ll also mention some of what I’ve learned in my\nongoing regional outreach, and the many ways the Boston Fed works to support our District’s\neconomy. But first, my usual disclaimer: these comments reflect my own views. I am not\nspeaking for colleagues at the Fed’s Board of Governors or other Reserve Banks.\nEconomic Activity\nThree years ago – coming out of the pandemic era – inflation was much too high, and the\nlabor market was unsustainably tight, reflecting demand that was outpacing supply. Since then,\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 3:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, October 14, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nwe at the Fed have made significant progress in achieving our dual mandate goals, as\nrestrictive monetary policy has helped to bring demand and supply into better balance. But still\nabove-target inflation has been rising recently, and while the labor market remains relatively\nhealthy, further weakening would be unwelcome.\nThis is a challenging context for monetary policymakers because rising inflation would call\nfor a tighter policy stance, while a softening labor market would call for a less restrictive one.\nPolicy actions must balance both sides of the Fed’s dual mandate, while addressing the\nevolving balance of risks. And this task is currently complicated by the reduced availability of\neconomic data, due to the government shutdown.\nEconomic activity has proved more resilient, so far this year, than many – including me –\nexpected. Figure 1 shows two indicators of real GDP growth. The blue line shows the more\ntypical year-over-year measure, which is still just above 2 percent, and close to many estimates\nof trend (or “potential”) U.S. output growth. But this masks considerable short-term variation in\ngrowth, as is evident from the red line – the two-quarter (annualized) measure. It highlights that,\nwhile economic activity has slowed relative to 2024, some of the step-down early this year has\nbeen reversed.1\nAvailable data suggest that spending has remained robust in the third quarter. In particular,\nconsumption growth moved up this summer,2 while indicators of business investment continue\nto be favorable – especially in equipment-related categories. In fact, recent data have led\nforecasters to raise their predictions for third-quarter GDP growth.3\nDemand has remained steady overall, despite headwinds from tariffs and the high degree of\nuncertainty in the economic environment that so many contacts report. One reason for this\nresilience is that generally healthy financial positions of firms and households are supporting\ntheir spending, though there are potential signs of strain for some smaller firms and lower-\nincome households.\n1 Moreover, other broad indicators of economic activity, such as gross domestic income (GDI) and gross\noutput in the non-farm corporate sector have slowed by less than GDP.\n2 Consumption growth was about 2.75 percent on a 12-month basis in August.\n3 For example, the Blue Chip Consensus forecast increased from 1.3 percent in September to 2.5 percent\nlast week.\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 3:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, October 14, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nAnd while I continue to hear from contacts around New England4 about economic\nuncertainty weighing on investment decisions, many firms seem unwilling to postpone\ninvestments related to automation and AI. Receptive credit markets and still-favorable financial\npositions, especially for larger firms, give many companies the capacity to make these\nexpenditures.\nThe Labor Market\nAlthough economic growth remains solid, job gains have declined notably, as shown in the\nleft panel of Figure 2. However, at least so far, the slowing pace of hiring has not led to a\nsubstantial rise in layoffs. Initial claims for unemployment – the blue line in the right panel of the\nfigure – remain fairly low. And the unemployment rate – the red line in the right panel – has only\nedged up over the past 12 months through August. Based on available information, the\nunemployment rate should also have remained low in September.\nThis marked reduction in employment growth reflects a combination of slower growth in both\nlabor supply and labor demand that is difficult to disentangle. On the supply side, the decrease\nin immigration has clearly slowed labor-force growth – but it is unclear by how much. The inflow\nof immigrants has fallen sharply. However, it is hard to gauge the outflow of immigrants who\nwere already in the country.5\nReduced labor supply from immigration has important implications for how we think about\ntrend, or “break-even,” employment growth – that is, the pace of monthly job gains needed to\nkeep up with increases in the labor force and prevent a rise in the unemployment rate. Before\nthe pandemic, this trend was estimated to be around 80,000 new hires per month, with about\nhalf coming from immigration. Using those numbers as a rough benchmark suggests that, if\nimmigration does not contribute to labor force growth going forward, then the pace of hiring\nneeded to keep the unemployment rate steady could be around 40,000 jobs per month.\n4 The Fed’s First District covers the six New England states, with the exception of Fairfield County in\nConnecticut.\n5 There remains a backlog of applications for work permits from migrants already here, though some\npreviously approved permits have been revoked.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 3:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, October 14, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nAn important question is whether the lower recent hiring pace is still sufficient to keep up\nwith current trend-employment growth and maintain a relatively stable unemployment rate.\nUnfortunately, the answer is clouded by the uncertainties I just highlighted regarding the impact\nof reduced immigration on the labor force, and by the delayed employment report from the\nfederal government, given the shutdown. Furthermore, recent job gains have been concentrated\nin just a few industries. This broad-based slowdown in hiring raises the risk that labor demand\nmay fall short of supply, which could eventually lead to a more substantial increase in the\nunemployment rate than we have seen so far this year.\nHefty productivity gains have enabled many firms to meet still-solid demand for their\nproducts without substantially increasing their head counts. As shown in Figure 3, measured\noutput per hour worked in the non-financial corporate sector is running well above its average\npre-pandemic pace.6 This productivity-enhancing, cost-saving mindset is ubiquitous in my\nrecent conversations with CEOs of large and small businesses throughout New England. It also\nappears that firms in some sectors are maintaining their output, with little or no hiring, by having\nemployees work longer hours.7\nI see these patterns as related to the high degree of uncertainty in the current economic\nenvironment, where concerns about tariffs and the prospects for automation and (increasingly)\nAI are making firms hesitant to hire. However, as the uncertainty fades and firms adjust to the\nnew tariff environment, I would expect the pace of hiring to increase. The labor market\nimplications of new technologies, including AI, will likely take some time to unfold.\nTariffs and Prices\nStill, I do expect the economy to experience some more negative impacts from tariffs over\nthe remainder of this year and into early 2026. Tariffs on imported goods act as an adverse\n6 In this context it is worth noting that if the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) recent preliminary downward\n(benchmark) revision to job growth from April 2024 to March 2025 is sustained, then measured labor\nproductivity during this period will likely be revised to show even larger gains.\n7 While average weekly hours have been stable at the aggregate level recently, there are notable sectoral\ndifferences. For example, the average workweek declined in the health-care sector, where hiring has\nbeen robust. But it has increased in other sectors, including information, financial services, and retail\ntrade, where hiring has been sluggish.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 3:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, October 14, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nsupply shock, raising production costs and ultimately making goods and services more\nexpensive. Historically, price increases from an adverse supply shock have been accompanied\nby lower household consumption, reduced capital outlays, and a rise in layoffs. While we have\nseen some initial price hikes for goods affected by tariffs, the broader economy has remained\nrelatively robust, as I have already discussed. But as prices in tariff-exposed sectors continue to\nrise over the next few months, I expect the effects on the real economy to become more\npronounced.\nThat brings me to inflation. Figure 4 shows the behavior of the three main components of\ncore personal consumption expenditure (PCE), a disaggregation I find informative. As you may\nknow, core inflation excludes the important but highly volatile food and energy sectors and tends\nto give a more accurate view of underlying inflation pressures. (Note that in each panel, the blue\nline shows price growth over 12 months, while the red line shows the timelier, though noisier,\nthree-month measure.)\nThe left panel shows core goods inflation, which has risen in recent months due mainly to\ntariffs. The middle and right panels highlight that the disinflation process has largely continued in\nother categories. Core housing inflation, in Panel B, continues its slow, uneven decline. And\ncore non-housing services inflation, in Panel C, has returned to a range consistent with the\nFederal Open Market Committee’s 2 percent target, though it has recently increased\nsomewhat.8\nSome of the tariffs have already passed through to consumer prices. As shown by the\nupward sloping line in Figure 5, which is based on analysis by Boston Fed economists, prices in\nPCE categories that are more exposed to tariffs have risen notably faster than their historical\ntrends. 9 However, the somewhat loose relationship to date suggests there is room for additional\npass-through of tariff-related costs.\n8 While core non-housing services inflation is above its pre-pandemic range (2012 through 2019), this\nperiod also coincides with inflation below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective. Thus, the dashed line in Panel\nC of Figure 5 shows the mean for 2001–2007, a period when 12-month core PCE inflation averaged\nalmost exactly 2 percent.\n9 See Barbiero and Stein (2025), The Impact of Tariffs on Inflation - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 3:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, October 14, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nI see a few reasons to expect further price pressures from tariffs going forward. First,\nchanges in tariff policies have been quite staggered, with some levies only recently going into\neffect, and others not scheduled to start until later this year.\nSecond, while firms may be willing to absorb some of the tariff costs in the short run, there\nare likely limits to their ability to offset these costs through productivity gains and other cost-\ncutting measures and to their willingness to accept lower profit margins. Ultimately, they are\nlikely to try to pass more of the higher costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices.\nSurveys also suggest that many firms anticipate additional passthrough,10 and this is very\nconsistent with what I have heard in recent discussions with leaders of large and small firms.\nHigher prices, in turn, will further reduce households’ purchasing power. This should slow\nthe pace of consumption growth, as over time fewer households will be able to draw on their\nsavings to help sustain their spending.11 A slowdown in household spending should also weigh\non business revenues and keep hiring and capital spending relatively subdued as a result.\nI expect that the limited hiring and slower economic growth will result in a relatively modest\nincrease in the unemployment rate over the remainder of this year and early next – before\nactivity resumes a more trend-like pace as uncertainty declines and tariffs work their way\nthrough the system. But with still-favorable financial conditions, both households and firms\nshould ultimately be able to withstand the tariff shock with only a limited slowdown in near-term\neconomic activity.\nMy Outlook, Risks, and the Policy Implications\nOverall, my baseline economic outlook is relatively benign. I see continued growth in\nactivity, little further rise in the unemployment rate, and inflation remaining elevated this year\nand into early 2026 as tariffs are passed through more fully, before resuming its decline. But\n10 For example, see, Who Will Pay for Tariffs? Businesses’ Expectations about Costs and Prices - Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston\n11 Consumption is also likely to slow because many households “front-loaded” durable goods purchases\nahead of tariffs.\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 3:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, October 14, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nwhile that is my baseline view, I do not rule out scenarios featuring higher and more persistent\ninflation, more adverse labor market developments, or both.\nThe upside risk to inflation cannot be discounted after more than four years of price growth\nabove the FOMC’s 2 percent target. The Committee’s credibility in following through on its price\nstability mandate is a critical asset – and an erosion in credibility would make achieving price\nstability even more challenging. Another period of rising inflation could destabilize inflation\nexpectations and lead to higher expected price increases going forward.\nAt the moment, most measures of both short- and longer-term inflation expectations remain\nrelatively stable, as shown in Figure 6. Furthermore, a softer labor market with strong\nproductivity growth reduces the risk of inflationary pressures from wage growth. But all of this\nwarrants careful attention, and a lack of comprehensive price data (given the government\nshutdown) will complicate assessing the inflation environment.\nWhile I see inflation risks as somewhat more contained than I previously thought, downside\nrisks to the labor market have likely risen. As noted earlier, the labor market has cooled to a\ncurious balance with little hiring or firing and still low unemployment. But further softening would\ngenerate unwelcome slack, leaving the economy more vulnerable to adverse shocks and\npossibly triggering more unfavorable dynamics.\nMoreover, while larger firms have generally been able to increase productivity and weather\nthe uncertain economic environment so far, it is less clear that this has been the case for their\nsmaller counterparts. Indeed, productivity gains for non-financial, non-corporate businesses,\nwhich account for roughly 16 percent of GDP and employment , appear to have been more\nlimited. Some of these smaller firms may be under more duress, which could weigh on\nemployment and economic growth going forward.\nAs I noted at the outset, determining appropriate monetary policy in the current uncertain\nenvironment with competing risks is challenging. However, with inflation risks somewhat more\ncontained, but greater downside risks to employment, it seems prudent to normalize policy a bit\nfurther this year to support the labor market. Importantly, even with some additional easing,\nmonetary policy would remain mildly restrictive, which is appropriate for ensuring that inflation\nresumes its decline once tariff effects filter through the economy.\nBut policy is not on a pre-set path, and I can envision scenarios where appropriate policy\ncalls for holding rates steady later this year and into next, as we assess effects of the recent\n8\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 3:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, October 14, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\npolicy actions and get more information. Going forward, my policy decisions will continue to be\nguided by my best assessment of all available data, their implications for the outlook, and the\nevolving risks.\nOn the Regional Economy and Final Thoughts\nI’ll turn briefly now to something else we consider essential to responsible policymaking. My\nfinal slide highlights the Boston Fed’s engagement across our region and to the breadth of our\nefforts.\nAs I mentioned at the outset, it’s vital to complement quantitative data analysis with outreach\nto people on the front lines of the economy, in all kinds of places: rural, urban, suburban;\nthriving, or struggling. So, I spend time with a wide range of stakeholders in the economy, in\nGreater Boston and across all six states of New England. I learn about their economic\nchallenges and opportunities, and their expectations for the future – including business\nconditions, costs and prices, job prospects, access to credit and financial services, and more.\nThis underlines the wisdom of the U.S. central bank’s framing more than 112 years ago as a\nfederated system – with components spread throughout the country, as well as in the nation’s\ncapital and the “financial capital” of New York. I, like my fellow reserve bank presidents, bring\nthose insights, and my team’s rigorous analysis, to the policymaking table in Washington. The\nfederated U.S. monetary policymaking structure befits our expansive, varied country filled with\nsuch a range of people, industries, and places.\nI’ll share just a tiny bit of what I’ve heard about in this region that we all care about and want\nto see thrive, now and for years to come.\nIn terms of challenges, I’ve already mentioned difficulties related to heightened uncertainty.\nIt won’t surprise you that the list includes housing supply and affordability, as well as scarcity of\nservices like childcare that inhibit people from participating in the labor market and economy.\nI’ve also heard of increased difficulties to maintaining the region’s cutting-edge technology,\nscience, and healthcare “ecosystem.” While many of those challenges are the purview of fiscal\npolicymakers, our commitment, at the Boston Fed, to a vibrant economy that works for all leads\nus to contribute to progress as objective researchers and, at times, as “conveners.”\n9\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 3:45 P.M. U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, October 14, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nI’ve also heard about and seen many creative, cross-sector initiatives that are enhancing\neconomic vibrancy. For instance, Cape Cod Community College and partners have helped\ncreate the largest aircraft-mechanical technology training program in the country – a win-win for\nall. Civic and community partners in Springfield, Massachusetts have supported resident\nentrepreneurs in opening childcare businesses, helping to meet a desperate need. And I’ve\nseen countless examples of business innovation building on the legacy strengths of New\nEngland – whether Maine lobstermen farming kelp in the off season; or constant innovation at\nVelcro, built upon Manchester, New Hampshire’s rich history of fabric production.\nI could give many more examples of challenges and of opportunities. So often the business\ncommunity and bankers are playing key roles in these economy-building initiatives, partnering\nwith labor and nonprofits and local governments. Greater Boston is special, and so is its\nbusiness community. Thank you for all that you are doing to support economic vibrancy. I look\nforward to continued engagement, collaboration, and innovation.\nAnd now I look forward to Kim’s questions. Thank you!\n10",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nOctober 11, 2023\nWellesley, Massachusetts\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023\nKey Takeaways\n1. Collins highlighted three main forms of uncertainty that monetary policymakers confront, all present in the\npandemic era. The first relates to data and measurement – how accurately statistics describe the variables they\nintend to measure. The second relates to relationships between key economic variables that influence policy\ndecisions – examples include the links between a tight labor market and inflation dynamics. The third is related to\nunforeseen events, such as pandemics, natural disasters, or geopolitical developments.\n2. For policymaking, the appropriate response to uncertainty depends on its type as well as the context.\nUncertainty can call for policy to move unusually rapidly – or to take a more wait-and-see approach. In the current\npolicy cycle, this has contributed to different policy phases, starting with a period of holding rates low when pandemic-\nrelated risks were still high, followed by a period of aggressive moves, and then the current more gradual, patient\napproach to policy.\n3. Some special factors have impacted the pandemic recovery that make it difficult to compare to previous\nbusiness cycles, adding to the uncertainty. Despite many expecting a slowdown this year, demand has remained\nremarkably resilient to date. Household balance sheets have been solid, partially due to savings accumulated during\nthe pandemic, and corporate cash holdings have been elevated due in part to locking in financing at previously low\nrates. Factors like these have likely made the economy less interest sensitive than during past tightening cycles, to\ndate.\n4. With progress on inflation and continued elevated uncertainty, the FOMC appropriately shifted to a new,\nmore gradual and “patient” policymaking phase. Though inflation levels are still too high, taking the time to\nholistically assess incoming information is warranted. It reflects the fact that we are likely close to the peak of this\ntightening cycle, with the risk of inflation remaining persistently high more closely balanced with the risk of slowing\nactivity more than needed to achieve price stability. Still, Collins expects we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels\nuntil we see evidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent.\n5. Collins remains realistic, but optimistic, about restoring price stability without a significant economic\ndownturn. Overall, she continues to be realistic about the economic uncertainties and risks, but optimistic that price\nstability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity and only a modest increase in the unemployment rate –\nan outcome consistent with both parts of the Fed’s dual mandate.\n6. One key policy lesson, Collins suggests with the benefit of hindsight, relates to risks from supply\nshocks. The pandemic represented uncharted territory for policymakers; and risk assessments, however difficult to\nmake, had to be made. But Collins observes that the risk of widespread, binding supply constraints may suggest a\nstronger case than previously realized for insuring against too-high inflation by removing policy accommodation more\nquickly.\n7. Collins also offered some takeaways to students about learning and careers. She recommended a mindset\nof lifelong learning and seeking out thoughtful, capable people with diverse perspectives. In working environments,\nshe also underlined the importance of gathering information broadly – quantitative and qualitative – and intentionally\nhearing from a wide range of stakeholders, including voices that have not traditionally been “in the room.”\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThank you for inviting me to be with you today. It is such a pleasure to be on the\nWellesley campus with students, faculty, and community members.\nBefore my remarks, there are a few people I would like to acknowledge. First,\nthe late Marshall Goldman, whose legacy of insightful inquiry is rightly commemorated\nwith this annual lecture. Second, the Wellesley economics department and your chair,\nCourtney Coile, for the invitation to deliver this year’s Goldman lecture. Over the years,\nmembers of Wellesley’s economics faculty have had many substantive connections with\nme and also with the Federal Reserve System, and I want to express my appreciation\nfor your commitment to excellence, your intellectual curiosity, and your dedication to\nyour students. I really must commend Wellesley as a whole, and certainly the\neconomics department, for sending into the world thoughtful, prepared, and very able\nwomen who have made an impact in so many fields – not least, in economics and\nfinance.\nLast but certainly not least, I want to acknowledge your president, Paula\nJohnson, and thank her for her leadership and, on a personal level, her friendship.\nPaula and I got to know each other as undergraduates – a few miles from here, and a\nfew years ago – and it has been so wonderful to see her many distinguished\ncontributions to society in the years since then, during her remarkable career in\nmedicine, public health, and higher education.\nBrief Context\nAllow me to preview what I’d like to cover today. As you know, I’ve come to\nWellesley to speak about my role, and the Fed’s responsibilities, in making policy – in\nparticular, amidst uncertainty, and with a focus on the different phases of monetary\npolicy during the pandemic.\nI’ll start with a bit of context, to level set about the Fed’s policymaking and other\nroles. Then I’ll turn to monetary policy and explore the important matter of uncertainty in\npolicymaking through the lens of the recent pandemic and ongoing economic recovery.\nI’ll discuss the evolution of the economy over this period and the corresponding phases\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nof policy – bringing the essential element of time and changing conditions into the\nanalysis. I’ll conclude with some very brief connections to thinking about careers in\neconomics and policymaking.\nOf course, I offer my standard disclaimer – these comments are my own, and\nmay not reflect the views of any other Federal Reserve policy maker.\nSo first let me set the stage with a bit of context, in particular for the students who\nare learning about macroeconomics and the role of the central bank. Created by\nCongress nearly 110 years ago, and refined over time, the Fed’s duties support the\nfunctioning of the U.S. economy, in the public interest. We do a variety of things,\nstarting with monetary policy. For me and my colleagues at the Boston Fed, the\noverarching vision is a vibrant economy that works for all. I see our mission as serving\nthe public in New England and the nation by promoting a strong, resilient, and inclusive\neconomy and financial system.\nBeyond monetary policy, we have other duties – which I won’t have time to\ndiscuss today. They include1:\n supporting the safety and soundness of the nation’s financial institutions, by\nsupervising some of the country’s banks and serving as a “lender of last resort”\nto the financial system;\n mitigating financial stability risks;\n supporting safe and reliable payment and settlement systems – back-end\ninfrastructure and services to the banking system and the U.S. Treasury (ranging\nfrom currency and coin circulation to various electronic channels); and\n promoting community economic development in a variety of ways.\nMost of my remarks today will be about our monetary policymaking, but I’d like to\ntake a moment, with many economics students and professors in the audience, to\nhighlight the variety of research we do – which is wide-ranging, because the economy is\n1 Learn more in “The Fed Explained: What the Central Bank Does,” a publication of the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System.\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nso multifaceted. Our economists and their research assistants and analysts do\nfascinating, data-driven, nonpartisan, policy-relevant work, and I’ll mention just two (of\nmany!) recent examples. Some of our researchers have studied the attention – or\ninattention – that consumers give to inflation, demonstrating that the absolute level of\ninflation is important. When inflation is low and stable, consumers don’t really think\nabout it; but when inflation is higher, consumers are much more aware of it, and\npossibly more likely to change their behavior.2 Another recent study looked at the\npotential causes of racial wealth gaps and found that inheritances and other types of\nwealth transfers from one generation to the next play only a small part – the main\ncontributors to the gap, the authors find, are differences in lifetime earnings and pension\nassets. Therefore, policies that successfully increase human capital can potentially help\nreduce this gap.3, 4\nMonetary Policy\nLet’s turn to monetary policy, and the core of my talk today. It’s important to note\nthat at the Fed we are entrusted with monetary, and not fiscal, policy. This involves\nactions that ultimately affect the cost of borrowing for businesses and households.\nThe Fed spends a lot of time analyzing economic conditions – using data, doing\nresearch, and listening to stakeholders locally and nationally. Having prepared in great\ndepth, I join the other 11 regional Reserve Bank presidents and the seven members of\nthe Board of Governors in Washington eight times a year to discuss appropriate\nmonetary policy. After taking in substantive staff analysis, and multiple go-arounds by\ncommittee participants, there is a vote on policy actions by the current voting members,\nsome of whom rotate year-to-year. The committee’s decision and summary of\nappropriate policy is released in a statement, and then the Chair holds a press\n2 See Bracha and Tang (2022).\n3 See Sabelhaus and Thompson (2022).\n4 Additionally, the Boston Fed, in collaboration with a coalition of community partners, is launching a\nmultiyear research initiative to explore wealth disparities across Massachusetts. Our findings intend to\ninform policy and will hopefully be used by public, private, and non-profit organizations to develop\nstrategies that promote equity in wealth, a key foundation for greater economic opportunity.\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nconference to explain the committee’s decisions, which are then implemented in the\nmarket.\nThe Federal Reserve is charged, by Congress, with a “dual mandate” of price\nstability and maximum employment. We currently define price stability as 2 percent\ninflation – a low level, where consumers and businesses do not see eroding purchasing\npower as a pressing concern.5 Maximum employment, the other pillar of the dual\nmandate, is less specifically defined, but refers to the broad and inclusive goal of job\nopportunities for all Americans. It's important to note that while often characterized as\ncompeting, history has shown that price stability is essential for a well-functioning\neconomy, and an important precondition for maximum employment that is sustainable\nover time.\nFigure 1’s left panel shows the evolution of the inflation rate since the 1960s,\nwith grey bars indicating recessions.6 While there are many inflation measures, I focus\nhere on the 12-month change in the price of personal consumption expenditures (or\nPCE), excluding the important but volatile food and energy components – also known\nas “core” inflation7 and generally a good predictor of overall inflation’s path.\nAs the figure shows, achieving price stability hasn’t always been an easy task\nover this period. An inflationary buildup started in the mid-1960s and persisted until the\ndisinflation achieved under Fed Chairman Paul Volcker in the early 1980s. This was\nfollowed by an extended period of inflation moderation, with inflation typically near or\nbelow 2 percent since the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession, lasting until the\nrecent pandemic-related inflation flare-up.\n5 While this argument holds even more strongly for a zero-inflation rate, one reason to target a positive\nbut low inflation rate is that it can be difficult for firms to cut wages. A positive inflation rate helps to\nachieve real wage declines that facilitate adjustment when the economy faces a contractionary shock,\nthus alleviating the downward nominal wage rigidity constraint. For additional context see Bewley (1999).\n6 See U.S. Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions, produced by the National Bureau of Economic\nResearch.\n7 While this measure can be a better indicator of underlying inflation trends, the Fed’s inflation target is\nexpressed in terms of total PCE inflation. Salwati and Wessel (2021) is a helpful summary of different\ninflation measures.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nFigure 1’s right panel shows the unemployment rate along with inflation, further\nillustrating the challenges monetary policymakers face in trying to stabilize economic\nactivity at a level consistent with both aspects of the Fed’s dual mandate.8\nBy raising or lowering interest rates, monetary policy affects aggregate demand\nin the economy – and Figure 2 shows how the stance of policy has evolved over time.\nPolicy tightening – an increase in the Fed’s policy rate, the federal funds rate – raises\nthe cost of borrowing for firms and households, with the effect of slowing demand for\ncapital, labor, goods, and services, which in turn relieves price pressures, tempering\ninflation. Conversely, lowering the federal funds rate, or easing policy, reduces the cost\nof borrowing, thus supporting an expansion of aggregate demand and employment.\nThis tends to increase price pressures, raising inflation.9\nIt is important to note that many of the deviations of inflation and unemployment\nfrom levels consistent with price stability and full employment have resulted from\nunanticipated events requiring the Fed to react. The COVID-19 pandemic is a prime\nexample – a shock originating outside of the economic system and resulting in a\nsubstantial disruption to the economy, requiring a response from the Fed in pursuit of its\ndual mandate.\nSo, I will now offer some reflections on conducting monetary policy during a time\nof heightened uncertainty stemming from the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19\npandemic. I will note that, while a keen observer of monetary policy for many years, I\nwas not involved in policy decisions until joining the Boston Fed in July of 2022.\nA key takeaway for me is that the elevated uncertainty, and the risk management\nconsiderations associated with that uncertainty, played an important role in policy\nsetting since the pandemic began, and appropriately so. I see the most salient types of\n8 Fed actions typically are not intended to cause a recession, possibly with the exception of the Volker\ndisinflation. The Fed’s limited ability at times to stabilize the economy could be due to events that are\nbeyond the control of monetary policy. For further reflections on these topics see Blinder (2023).\n9 The Fed can also affect interest rates through instruments other than its policy rate, such as by buying\nor selling government-backed securities. These so-called large-scale asset purchases have occurred at\ntimes when the federal funds rate hit the zero-lower-bound. The Fed also provides information about\nfuture policy (so-called forward guidance) with its meeting statement and quarterly Summary of Economic\nProjections.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nuncertainty as having shifted, with somewhat different policy implications, as the\nsituation evolved – and will explore that with you today.\nOf course, with the benefit of hindsight, some may argue that different policy\ndecisions would have been preferable. However, I think it is too soon to judge how well\nthe Fed has managed the challenges of stabilizing the economy during this very\ncomplex period. We will have much to learn from the in-depth analysis that this period\nwarrants. And much will depend on whether inflation returns to target in a reasonable\namount of time with only modest effects on employment.\nI will highlight that I remain a “realistic optimist,” based on my assessment of\ncurrently available information. The ongoing resilience I see in the economy, and the\nprogress on inflation so far, lead me to believe there is a pathway to achieving this\ndesirable outcome. In fact, that path seems to have widened recently – although\nconsiderable risks remain.\nUncertainty and Monetary Policy\nFormer Fed chairman Alan Greenspan once noted that uncertainty is not just a\n“pervasive feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of\nthat landscape.”10 So, I’ll next highlight three main forms of uncertainty that monetary\npolicymakers must confront.11\nThe first is uncertainty related to data and measurement. This refers to how\naccurately available statistical data describe the variables they intend to measure, and\nto the fact that some variables are not directly observable. Two examples are maximum\nsustainable employment, and the underlying “neutral” interest rate, above which policy\nbecomes restrictive (or below which policy becomes accommodative). Both are\nimportant economic concepts that are certainly affected by uncertainty.\n10 See Greenspan (2004).\n11 Accessible and thoughtful discussions about the different forms of uncertainty and how they affect the\nconduct of monetary policy can be found in, for example, Bernanke (2004) and Mendes et al (2017).\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThe second form is uncertainty related to the relationships between key\neconomic variables that influence policy decisions. Examples of this type, in the current\ncontext, include the links between a tight labor market and inflation dynamics, and the\nsize and timing of the effects of monetary policy – the proverbial “long and variable lags”\nwith which policy exerts its effects on the economy.\nThe third form is uncertainty related to unforeseen events, such as pandemics,\nnatural disasters, or geopolitical developments. While statistical methods can use past\nexperiences to help quantify the first two types of uncertainty, these types of shocks\nresist prediction.\nFor policymaking, the appropriate response to increased uncertainty depends on\nits type as well as the context.12 In many situations, uncertainty calls for a gradual and\ncautious approach to policy. This can arise in periods of increased uncertainty about\nthe data, or the effects of policy actions on the economy. Allowing time for the “signal”\nto emerge from the “noise” in the data, or to fully assess the economy’s response to\npast policy actions, can help – leading to more informed policy decisions, and balancing\nthe risks of doing too much versus not doing enough.\nHowever, in some circumstances, uncertainty calls for policy to move\naggressively. Examples often involve contexts where doing nothing or moving too\nslowly exacerbates the economic circumstances that policymakers are trying to\naddress. For instance, too-small or too-slow actions to make monetary policy more\naccommodative at the outset of a major crisis could lead to severe labor market\ndisplacements that persistently lower employment, with significant pain for many. On\nthe flip side, when there are risks of higher inflation expectations becoming entrenched,\na gradual inflation-fighting approach may limit policymakers’ ability to restore price\nstability without a significant downturn.13\n12 See Brainard (1967).\n13 For further discussions on this topic see, for example, Ball (1999), Friedman (1968 and 1977) and\nPhelps (1967).\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was uncharted territory along all these dimensions of\nuncertainty, due to the size and speed of the economic disruptions it induced. Figure 3\nplots the severity of the pandemic in terms of hospitalizations and deaths. This\nunforeseen public health event quickly moved the world to an economic situation unlike\nany in the post-World War II period, with policymakers trying to decipher whether the\nusual rules governing the behavior of the economy still applied. The pandemic also\naffected segments of the economy very unevenly, and in non-standard ways relative to\nprevious economic crises, making it more difficult to interpret incoming data and assess\nthe effects of monetary policy on the economy. And as time passed and the economy\nevolved, so did the nature of the pandemic-induced uncertainty.\nThe nuances in how uncertainty influences policy decisions contributed to distinct\nphases of monetary policy, which I will now discuss in more detail.\nBackground: The economy before early 2020\nTo set the stage, I suspect it is helpful to highlight some key features of the pre-\npandemic economy.\nOverall, in early 2020 the economy was doing quite well, as can be seen earlier\nin Figure 1B. Despite an unemployment rate that had fallen to near 50-year lows, core\ninflation remained below the Fed’s 2 percent target.14 Absent clear indications of\ninflationary pressures, the Fed was not actively restricting economic growth.\nImportantly, this monetary policy strategy of letting the labor market “run hot” with\ninflation still below target was successfully drawing more people into the labor market,\nbenefiting groups that traditionally endured higher than average unemployment rates,\nand fostering a broader-based and more inclusive notion of maximum employment.\n14 Wage inflation was rising some but still relatively subdued. It is possible that, given more time, wage\nand price pressures would have picked up. Still, these pressures were potentially limited because output\ngrowth was moderate and relatively stable.\n8\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nCOVID-19 [March 2020 to November 2020]\nIn March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, and almost overnight much of\nthe U.S. (and global) economy shut down. Economic activity plummeted, and by April\n2020, the unemployment rate had spiked to 14.7 percent – an extraordinary jump in\nspeed and magnitude.\nIn addition to enormous public health uncertainty, the COVID-19 shock created\nunprecedented uncertainty about the extent and length of the economic shutdown. It\nwas unclear how consumers and firms would react to social distancing requirements,\nand limits on mobility. Concerns also emerged about an extended period of depressed\neconomic activity, and with that, the possibility of falling prices potentially resulting in a\ndeflationary spiral. And there were worries about very high unemployment leaving a\nmore permanent labor market imprint, despite the hope that many of the layoffs would\nbe temporary.\nThe pandemic also laid bare and exacerbated labor market inequalities, as\nlower-paid, customer-facing occupations were affected the most by the shutdowns while\nmany of the higher-paying occupations could be performed remotely. The left panel of\nFigure 4 shows the disparities in unemployment by race, and the right panel by\neducational attainment. Separately, closures of schools and daycares forced some\nindividuals – especially women – who could not work from home to drop out of the labor\nforce at least temporarily.\nSo the situation involved considerable uncertainty about the possible extent of\nthe economic damage brought on by the pandemic, and the potential for significant\nnegative feedback loops. This called for large and decisive monetary and fiscal policy\nactions to avoid a worst-case scenario.15 The Fed cut its policy rate to essentially zero,\n15 A description of the fiscal and monetary policy measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\ncan be found, for example, in Romer (2021), and Milstein and Wessel (2021). See also Alicia Parlapiano,\nDeborah B. Solomon, Madeleine Ngo, and Stacy Cowley, “Where $5 Trillion in Pandemic Stimulus Money\nWent,” New York Times, March 11, 2022.\n.\n9\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nand provided forward guidance on the future path of interest rates, indicating that rates\nwould remain near zero until the achievement of certain economic conditions.16 The\nFed also launched an array of programs to support the flow of credit to businesses,\nhouseholds, and state and local governments.17 The Fed gathered additional sources\nof information18 as well, in an effort to reduce uncertainty and better understand the\nextremely unusual economic developments.\nElected officials provided extraordinary fiscal assistance to the economy, and its\neffects are still reverberating. The extent of the support to households, for example, is\ncaptured in the large rise of disposable income above pre-pandemic trends, as shown in\nFigure 5 – something that had never occurred to such an extent in previous downturns.\nThe timeliness and magnitude of these fiscal and monetary policy measures\nultimately succeeded in preventing the most-feared economic risks from materializing.\nThe unemployment rate dropped rapidly, and inflation did not decline much from its low,\npre-pandemic level. Of course, containing the virus and the swift development of\nvaccines were crucial to avoiding a broader crisis.\nThe reopening of the economy and the inflation surprise [Dec. 2020 to Nov. 2021]\nAfter the acute phase of the pandemic, there was a noticeable rebound in GDP\nand its largest component – personal consumption expenditures – in the second half of\n2020. This is shown in Figure 6, where both series are plotted relative to an estimate of\nlong-run trend.\n16 Initially, the guidance in the FOMC statement affirmed that rates would stay near zero until\npolicymakers were “confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve\nits maximum employment and price stability goals.” In September 2020, guidance was strengthened to\nindicate that rates would stay low until “labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the\nCommittee’s assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to\nmoderately exceed 2 percent for some time.”\n17 In addition, the Fed resumed purchases of Treasuries and government guaranteed mortgage-backed\nsecurities, first to restore market functioning and later to support the economy with low interest rates\nacross the maturity spectrum.\n18 For an overview of these sources see Cajner et al (2022).\n10\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nHowever, despite this progress, there were worries heading into 2021 that\neconomic activity could stall. The real-world effectiveness of vaccines, which first\nbecame available in December 2020, was still uncertain. Another wave of the virus was\nunderway. And so consumers’ willingness to resume normal activities was quite\nunclear.\nAmidst this backdrop of continued high uncertainty, monetary policy remained\nhighly accommodative, even as inflation started to pick up in the spring of 2021, as\nshown in the lighter line in Figure 7. At the time, the rise in inflation was believed to be\nmainly tied to supply chain constraints that would resolve quickly. Expectations of\nfuture price increases remained low19, reinforcing the idea that inflation could rise\ntemporarily without leaving a persistent imprint on the economy. And although the\nunemployment rate had improved considerably, it was still around 6 percent in the first\nhalf of 2021, above levels considered consistent with full employment. This state of\naffairs did not suggest an immediate need to remove monetary policy accommodation\nand tighten financial conditions.\nIn such a context of heightened uncertainty, it is crucial to assess the costs\nassociated with each risk to the economic outlook and devise the best strategy to\nachieve the Fed’s dual mandate goals. And in the early stages of the pandemic\nrecovery, given the still uncertain public health situation, risks of demand setbacks\noutweighed the risks of inflation.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, one could argue for removing policy\naccommodation sooner.20 But to me at the time, given the continued significant\n19 After dropping sharply with the start of the pandemic, market-based inflation expectations rose through\nmuch of 2020 and into 2021, but by mid-2021 had risen enough to only equal their long-run average.\nShort-term survey-based expectations measures, while up a bit in early 2021, did not rise sharply until\nMay and longer-term survey-based measures edged higher but remained in a fairly narrow range.\n20 Chair Powell commented at the March 2022 FOMC press conference: \"…if we knew now that these\nsupply blockages [and] the inflation resulting from them, in collision with … very strong demand, if we\nknew that that was what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes, it would have been appropriate to\nmove earlier.\"\n11\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nuncertainty, it seemed prudent for the Fed to support the economy versus pre-empting\nan inflation surge that few were forecasting.21\nUltimately, the economy evolved quite differently than anticipated. In particular,\ndemand exceeded expectations, while supply fell short, resulting in a large demand-\nsupply gap that fueled inflation. By early 2021, GDP and consumption were already\nabove trend (see Figure 6) and subsequent waves of the virus did little to slow demand,\nwhich was unusually tilted toward consumption of goods, and away from services.\nHowever, supply-chain constraints persisted as highlighted by the New York Fed\nGlobal Supply Chain Pressure Index in Figure 8. While efforts were underway to\nunderstand the supply bottlenecks, including development of new indicators like the\nNew York Fed index, it proved very difficult to assess the extent and duration of supply\nchallenges emanating from an atypical pandemic shock in real time. Russia’s war in\nUkraine in early 2022 was yet another unanticipated event, adding to supply-chain\npressures and firms’ costs.\nImportantly, there was also the expectation that, as the economy reopened more\nfully, spending would shift from goods (which people could consume while sheltering at\nhome) back to services, and ease price pressures for goods. And given the expectation\nthat supply in the service sector could sufficiently meet demand, service-sector inflation\nwas not expected to rise significantly.\nAgain, reality was different. Households had accumulated substantial savings\nduring the early stages of the pandemic, thanks to the fiscal support and limited\nopportunities to spend. So services consumption rose, but without a material decline in\ngoods consumption. Thus, there was little relief from supply chain bottlenecks. And,\nmost crucially, labor supply did not rise as anticipated to meet service sector demand.22\n21 See Collins (2023).\n22 The labor force participation rate collapsed when businesses shut down early in the pandemic. As firms\nreopened, the participation rate retraced some of its initial decline, but many workers stayed on the\nsidelines due to several factors, including fears of contracting COVID-19, childcare problems and extra\nsavings built up during the pandemic. Participation was also held down by lower immigration (Peri and\nZaiour 2022). Participation began to recover more robustly in the fall of 2021, the same time that the\n12\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThis led to a noticeable pickup in labor costs and services inflation. Given that services\nare a significant portion of the consumption basket, inflation became very broad based.\nMonetary policy tightening [December 2021 to May 2023]\nWith broad-based wage and price pressures by late 2021, it was increasingly\nclear that elevated inflation would be more persistent than initially thought.\nPolicymakers therefore began the process of removing monetary accommodation in\nhopes of slowing economic activity and bringing demand into better balance with\nsupply.23\nIn March 2022, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.\nFinancial conditions had already started to tighten — especially in the mortgage market\n— owing in part to the Fed’s statements about its policy direction, or forward guidance.\nAfter March, policy rate increases were swift, with a 50 basis points hike in May,\nand then 75 basis points at the four subsequent meetings, followed by another 50 basis\npoints increase (see Figure 7). By the end of 2022, the FOMC had raised rates\ncumulatively by 425 basis points—a very rapid pace, relative to the other tightening\ncycles that have occurred since the Volcker disinflation 40 years ago.\nPolicymakers judged that high, unexpectedly persistent inflation, combined with a\ntight labor market, required rapid policy rate adjustments to fulfill the Fed’s mandate.\nRates were increased an additional 25 basis points at each of the next three meetings,\nto over 5 percent in May of this year.\nI will note that high inflation takes a toll on all of us. In my travels around New\nEngland, I’ve heard repeatedly about the challenges households face from rapid price\nshare of foreign-born workers in the working-age population began to increase. As of August 2023,\nparticipation had increased by about one percentage point relative to August 2021, despite the\nlongstanding downward trend in participation caused by population aging (Cooper et al. 2021).\n23 In its December 2021 statement, the FOMC announced it was slowing the pace of long-term asset\npurchases and signaled that the end of such purchases was near. The Summary of Economic Projections\nthat accompanied this statement also showed an upward shift in policymakers’ expectations for the path\nof the federal funds rate over the next year. The process of reducing asset holdings (so-called\nquantitative tightening) commenced in March 2022.\n13\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nincreases, particularly those with lower incomes struggling to make ends meet. Inflation\nis challenging as well for businesses forced to grapple with higher costs and more\ncomplex planning and investment decisions. So this battle against inflation was and is\nimportant, in the public interest.\nUncertainty also played an important role in policy setting as the Fed sought to\ncombat high inflation. By late 2021 and early 2022, the source of uncertainty had\nshifted from implications of the public health situation to uncertainty about key economic\nrelationships – most notably the inflation process. In particular, persistently high levels\nof inflation led to concerns about a possible rise in longer-term inflation expectations,\nwhich had it occurred would likely have made it more difficult for policymakers to restore\nprice stability. This type of uncertainty also argued for aggressive rate increases.\nThe focus on bringing inflation down and containing longer-run inflation\nexpectations in turn created additional uncertainty about the economy’s ability to\nwithstand a rapid tightening of financial conditions. The banking stresses caused by the\ncollapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in early March 2023 added to this\nconcern, as many expected the banking turmoil to restrict consumer and business credit\nbeyond the typical impact of policy tightening.24\nDespite many forecasters expecting a slowdown this year, demand has remained\nremarkably resilient to date. Indeed, since the beginning of the tightening cycle, the\neconomy has remained in a relatively strong position. Household balance sheets have\nbeen solid, partially due to savings accumulated during the early stages of the\npandemic, and corporate cash holdings have been elevated, due in part to firms’ ability\nto lock in financing at low rates early in the pandemic. These factors have likely made\nthe economy less interest sensitive than during past tightening cycles.\nMore recently, however, there is evidence that firms’ cash holdings are declining,\nand households’ stocks of accumulated excess savings are diminishing. Therefore, the\n24 To address the banking stress, the Fed in conjunction with the Treasury Department enacted the Bank\nTerm Funding Program (BTFP), which helped relieve banking strains and likely limited additional credit\ncontraction.\n14\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nneed for credit is rising. These developments will eventually make demand more\nresponsive to high interest rates.\nThe most recent policy phase, and looking ahead\nWith interest rates firmly in a range that will restrict the economy, we are starting\nto see promising signs of policy having the desired effects.\nIn particular, the darker line in Figure 9 shows that total PCE inflation (which\nincludes the volatile food and energy prices) is down considerably from its peak. Core\nPCE inflation has also moderated some, but has some way to go to return to 2 percent,\nand it is too soon to tell whether recent progress will be sustained.\nDisaggregating core PCE inflation into its three main components, as shown in\nFigure 10, provides valuable insight into the different drivers of inflation. Inflation for\ngoods (the dark blue line) has decreased noticeably with the improvement in supply\nconditions. And as lower market rents are starting to pass through, housing or shelter\ninflation (the lighter blue line) is moderating as well. But core inflation for non-housing\nservices (orange line) remains elevated, and this accounts for over half of core\nconsumption. Bringing this component down will likely require labor market conditions\nto cool more, since labor represents a large share of costs in the services sector.\nWhile the unemployment rate remains near historic lows, there is some evidence\nof demand becoming better aligned with supply in the labor market. Despite the\nSeptember jump in employment, growth in payrolls this year has slowed relative to last\nyear though it is still significantly above trend (see Figure 11). The previously very high\nvoluntary quit rate has fallen to pre-pandemic levels. Lower, though still high, job\nvacancies are also consistent with a gradually cooling labor market. We are also seeing\npromising developments in terms of labor supply as labor force participation has\nincreased, especially for prime-age workers (those aged 25 to 54), as also shown in\nFigure 11.\nIn this context, the FOMC shifted to a new, more gradual, policymaking phase\nthis summer – holding rates constant in June and again September, after a 25 basis\npoint hike in July.\n15\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIn my view, this transition to a more patient, approach – taking the time to\nholistically assess incoming information – was warranted for a number of reasons. In\nparticular, it reflects the fact that we are likely close to, and possibly at, the peak of this\ntightening cycle, with the risk of inflation remaining persistently high more closely\nbalanced with the risk of slowing activity more than needed to achieve price stability.\nOnce again, appropriate policy in this phase is importantly influenced by\nuncertainty and related risk assessments. With inflation expectations well anchored, the\nuncertainty now relates more to difficulty assessing the ultimate impact of our policy\nactions to date25 and to extracting signal from data that are noisier than usual.26 In\nreviewing incoming economic data, I avoid focusing on individual data points, looking\ninstead for trends that show both sustained reductions in inflation, and progress on the\nunderlying goal of realigning supply and demand.\nPatience will give us time to better separate “signal” from “noise” in the data and\nto balance risks, as the effects of tighter policy continue to work through the economy.\nI expect we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time – until we see\nevidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent. And while we are likely\nnear, and could be at, the peak for policy rates, further tightening could be warranted\ndepending on incoming information.\nOverall, I continue to be realistic about the economic uncertainties and risks, but\noptimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity and\nonly a modest increase in the unemployment rate – an outcome consistent with both\nparts of the Fed’s dual mandate.\n25 Estimates of the peak effect of monetary policy on activity and inflation vary considerably in terms of\ntiming and magnitude. For a review see, for example, Havranek and Rusnak (2013).\n26 For instance, monthly inflation readings have been more volatile than usual since the beginning of the\npandemic. Consumers’ spending patterns have also changed, creating issues with seasonal adjustment,\nand with inferring the underlying strength of demand.\n16\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nSome closing policy thoughts\nLooking ahead, there will be many important policy-relevant issues to be studied\nfrom the still-evolving business cycle induced by the pandemic. That said, I hope I have\nconveyed the important role for uncertainty considerations in setting monetary policy.\nThere are different types of uncertainty. And depending on type as well as\ncontext, uncertainty can call for policy to move unusually rapidly – or to take a more\nwait-and-see approach. In the current policy tightening cycle, this has contributed to\ndifferent policy phases, with a period of aggressive moves followed by the current more\ngradual approach to policy.\nThe pandemic represented uncharted territory for policymakers, and risk\nassessments, however difficult to make, had to be made. One lesson I’ll offer, with the\nbenefit of hindsight, relates to risks from supply shocks. In particular, the risk of\nwidespread, binding supply constraints may suggest a stronger case than previously\nrealized for insuring against too-high inflation by removing policy accommodation more\nquickly. More generally, I look forward to the extensive research and debate to come,\nas we endeavor to draw additional lessons, deepen understanding and improve policy.\nStill, despite the evolving uncertainties about the economy and appropriate\npolicy, I hope that you, like me, are encouraged by the economy’s resilience and the\nprogress on inflation to date.\nConcluding Observations\nI’ve shared a lot with you today, including about the need for reflection, learning,\nand humility for policymakers, especially in extraordinary times. The backdrop has\nbeen uncertainty – that will remain and be elevated at times. In this context, I’ll end by\noffering some concluding thoughts from my own career journey, which I hope you may\nfind helpful.\nFirst, lifelong learning is essential - for individuals and for institutions. I see this\nas more than an activity – it is a mindset. In an uncertain, evolving world, drawing\nlessons from past experiences will help us do better and improve outcomes.\n17\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nDeveloping new skills and expanding knowledge positions us for future opportunities. I\nhope you also agree that it is great fun. For me, learning is one of life’s joys.\nSecond, seeking out thoughtful, capable people with diverse perspectives –\nincluding those you may disagree with – is a valuable practice, for policymaking, for\nwork, and in life. Listen well so that you can learn. Hopefully, you’ll also develop strong\npartners and collaborators who can assist and support you in navigating uncertain\ncontexts. And I encourage you to share your own perspectives – smart, capable\nWellesley women have a lot to contribute!\nA third, related, point is the importance of gathering information broadly. This\ndeepens understandings and can help moderate uncertainty. By information, I mean\nboth quantitative data, which is core to empirical economics, and qualitative information,\nsuch as from case studies and narratives. I’m excited to see technology leading to new\ndata sets we can parse for insights. I also see intentionally hearing from a wide range\nof stakeholders as complementary to the collection and analysis of statistical data –\nincluding hearing from voices that have not traditionally been in the room.\nThat brings me to where we started: economics. It is a field that opens doors –\nthough there is important work, for those of us in this field, to ensure that economics\nitself is open and inclusive. For me, the discipline that intrigued me as a teen has been\na great foundation for a decades-long (still unfolding!) varied and fascinating\nprofessional career. Time and again, I’ve valued the structured approach economics\nbrings to analyzing complex contexts and to drawing inference from data sets. Its\nframeworks are extremely useful for making decisions under uncertainty. And so, I\ncongratulate, and hope to encourage and even inspire, those of you who are studying,\nand teaching economics.\nThank you for having me here to discuss this period of extraordinary uncertainty\nand challenge ushered in by the COVID-19 pandemic, and its implications for current\nand future monetary policy. Of course, uncertainty is everywhere and a fact of life.\nLearning, data, frameworks and flexibility can help us address it and can also enrich our\nlives professionally and personally.\nIt has been a pleasure to share my views, and I wish each of you the very best.\n18\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:30 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, October 11, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nReferences\nBall, Laurence. 1999. “Aggregate Demand and Long-Run Unemployment.” Brookings\nPapers on Economic Activity No. 2: 189–251.\nBernanke, Ben S. 2004. “Gradualism.” Speech delivered at an economics luncheon co-\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (Seattle Branch) and the\nUniversity of Washington.

    "text": "General Discussion:\nThe “Big C”: Identifying and\nMitigating Contagion\nChair: Susan M. Collins\nMr. Feldstein: I thought this was a helpful paper: interesting analysis\nand interesting data. I would like to comment primarily on the dis-\ncussion of the eurozone, but first make a remark about what you said\nabout mitigating portfolio risk, by increasing private portfolio invest-\nment abroad. I do not understand how, when problems arise, countries\ncould cause these private foreign investments to be liquidated for the\nbenefit of the country. Private investors, it seems to me, would be very\nhappy under those circumstances to keep their money away.\nBut let me turn to the eurozone, where I think your analysis shows\nthat the creation of the euro not only resulted in the traditional prob-\nlems inherent in imposing a single monetary policy, and single ex-\nchange rate, on a group of heterogeneous countries; but also resulted\nin an additional problem: namely, increased contagion within Europe.\nThe degree of contagion that would have been less, had we stayed with\nthe European Union, rather than moved to a common euro currency.\nYou call for deposit insurance to stabilize the banks, but you say cau-\ntiously that doing so would require support from an entity other than\nthe sovereign state. I think that is a euphemism for Germany, and I\nwonder if you would comment on what you would propose if Ger-\nmany were to decide not to be that entity. You speak of improving\ninvestor assessments of risk and say that the key should be a policy to\n97\n\n98 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nincrease long-term growth. You then speak of monetary policy as a way\nof achieving that, although I do not think you really mean that mon-\netary policy would to be able to increase long-term growth.\nMy own sense is that one wants to be able to reduce the debt-to-GDP\nratio; and while it would be nice to do so by getting the denominator\nto grow more rapidly, the simpler way, in some sense, is to reduce the\nsize of the debt in order to deal with the fiscal problem itself.\nFinally, what I think is missing here is the problem of current ac-\ncount deficits. I think you either may not have discussed it, or did\nnot discuss it enough. I think it is the key problem that the periph-\neral eurozone countries cannot resolve by themselves because they\nlack a currency that they can devalue. And so, I continue to believe\nthat the most helpful way to deal with that problem in the eurozone\nwould be a significant decline of the euro: perhaps from 1.25 today,\nback to parity with the dollar. That would allow for reduced imports\ninto the peripheral countries and increased exports (not within the\neurozone, but vis-à-vis the rest of the world). And that combination\nwould mean stronger GDP, making it easier for them to deal with\ntheir fiscal situation as well.\nMr. Shirakawa: I have one comment on trade as a channel of con-\ntagion. As Franklin Allen mentioned, Japan’s GDP contracted most\nsharply after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The size of the trade\nsector, as a share of GDP, is not so large in Japan. Based on my expe-\nrience in Japan, what is more important is the composition of trade,\nparticularly the composition of exports. In our case, the shares of\ntrade accounted for by automobile sales and sales of other consumer\ngoods are large; and purchasers of these items are particularly depen-\ndent on financing. As a result, the collapse of Lehman Brothers had a\nparticularly sharp impact on the Japanese economy. Thus, when you\ntalk about trade as a channel for contagion, I think you should place\nmore emphasis on financing.\nMr. Blinder: I just wanted to ask you Kristin whether there really is\nmuch difference between international contagion and domestic con-\ntagion. Franklin spoke of this, to some extent. If you look at your list,\naside from items that are tautological to some degree—for example,\n\nGeneral Discussion 99\nthat trade goes across boundaries—there is not much that is relevant\nto international boundaries. You will recall that, some years ago, there\nwas considerable discussion about countries’ needing to hold huge\namounts of reserves, like China does; about floating a country’s ex-\nchange rate versus fixing it. The list that you have set out would have\nbeen the same list, I believe, if there were only one country on Earth.\nMr. Carstens: I have found this paper and the comments that have\nbeen made about it very interesting. I would raise three sets of is-\nsues. First, looking at Chart 2 in the paper, we see a clear upward\ntrend in the correlations, in a way that hints at a high probability of\ncontagion. I would say this: that I think one of the factors that have\nincreased the tendency toward contagion is the existence of global\nimbalances. I believe these imbalances increase overall risks in each\neconomy, coming on top of the intrinsic problems in advanced econ-\nomies and also in emerging economies. Now, if such imbalances were\nto be identified clearly as factors that increase contagion—as I suspect\nthey do—then that could pave the way for approaches aimed at di-\nminishing these vulnerabilities, through international policy coordi-\nnation. So my question would be, what scope is there for employing\ninternational policy coordination to reduce contagion?\nSecondly, it is difficult not to talk about the role of derivatives.\nDoes the rise of derivative markets increase the risk of contagion?\nAnd thirdly, I would raise an issue that one faces as a practitio-\nner, one who watches the markets continuously and suffers the con-\nsequences of problems in the markets. I think the type of reaction\nthat we have been seeing, over the past year or year and a half, is a\nkind of reaction that I had not seen before, somewhat akin to the\nway American aviation authorities reacted to the attacks on Sept. 11,\n2001. There was a risk of a catastrophic event, and a response that\ninvolved requiring all planes in the U.S. to be grounded. Likewise in\nthe markets now, we see that the possibility of a huge, catastrophic\nevent—in this case taking place in Europe—has led many investors\nto decide that, no matter how strong a given economy is, they must\nmove wholesale to the safest possible asset, and only after the dust\nsettles, possibly start to engage again. The possibility of a really ad-\nverse tail event in an advanced economy has increased, and that has\n\n100 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nmade investors far more sensitive and jittery. If you look at a graph\nshowing the volatility of investment flows to emerging markets, you\ncan see the volatility has increased dramatically. I do not see exactly\nwhere this issue could be positioned among the four characteristics\nyou describe in your paper that relate to contagion; perhaps it could\nbecome a fifth one.\nMr. Panetta: I have two comments on your results for the euro-\nzone. First, the paper finds that in the last two decades, cross market\ncorrelations in the eurozone increased substantially, and you inter-\npret this as evidence of rising contagion. However, you do not test\nwhether this finding is simply due to greater exposure to a common\neurozone shock. You test for global shock, but not eurozone-specific\nshocks and the obvious kind, of course would be a greater exposure\nto a common monetary policy shock in eurozone markets.\nSecond, I was somewhat surprised by the finding that the channels\nthrough which contagion occurs in the eurozone are no different\nfrom the channels through which it occurs in other countries. My\nsense is that the paper does not provide sufficient evidence to support\nthis finding. For example, given the peculiarities of the eurozone,\none might want to examine in greater detail the monetary union\nperiod, considering additional channels for contagion, such as banks\nand private-sector exposures to sovereign debt, which in the context\nof the eurozone, unlike in other countries, is likely to be a powerful\nchannel for contagion. Thank you.\nMr. Fischer: One of the things we were very bad at, at the Interna-\ntional Monetary Fund during the 1990s, was forecasting contagion.\nSometimes we got it right, following Russia in 1998; sometimes we\nexpected it and it didn’t happen, and so forth. So this is especially\nuseful for those who have to deal with problems of this sort.\nI am trying to work out what you say about giving information\nahead of time. That seems to me a little more complicated than it\nsounds. In the extreme, you could say that all this does is to spread\nout, over the course of time, an impact that would otherwise have\nbeen much bigger on the day that it happened, but the whole thing\nultimately would be the same size. And then, one would go on to\n\nGeneral Discussion 101\nconclude that it would not end up becoming the same size if coun-\ntries are then able to take mitigating measures in the meantime. But\nwhen I look at the mitigating measures, most of them are long-term\nstructural measures, and I’m not sure what you have in mind there.\nIt would be very important to know.\nThe problem with informing people about things is that frequent-\nly these are events that you didn’t want to happen, and if you say,\n“Country X is going to collapse and we will tell you about it,” then\nCountry X may collapse a lot sooner. So, some of this may be more\ncomplicated than it seems.\nLet me turn to this question. In light of your paper, how should\nwe think about the probability that if Greece goes, another European\ncountry will go?\nMr. Kim: I have two comments. The first is about the issue of\nmitigating contagion related to large trade exposure. You said miti-\ngating contagion is like avoiding disease, and of course it is desirable\nto avoid disease; but at the same time, the steps taken to recover from\ndisease also attract attention and further elaboration. The four areas\nthat you mention as being important for mitigating contagion may\nbe the same as the ones that are needed to recover from contagion.\nParticularly, I am concerned about the issue of large-scale trade ex-\nposure. Of course a country that is exposed to a large magnitude of\ntrade is likely to be easily mitigated from contagion, but at the same\ntime, such countries are the ones that can recover from contagion\nmore quickly. Many countries in Asia had experience with the pro-\ncess of recovery from the crises of the late 1990s. The countries that\nwere open to foreign competition and had trade liberalization poli-\ncies were mitigated from contagion immediately, but they were the\nones that recovered from the crises more quickly than others.\nA second comment relates to your emphasis on the importance of\ndeposit insurance. I agree that deposit insurance is important. How-\never, I noted that you included many emerging economies in your\nsample. If you were discussing the issue of the establishment of a\nglobal safety net, probably that issue could be applicable and more\nrelevant to the case of emerging economies. John Lipsky is sitting\n\n102 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nbeside me, and when he was at the International Monetary Fund,\nhe was the man who introduced the Fund’s Flexible Credit Line,\nPrecautionary Credit Line, Precautionary and Liquidity Line and so\nforth, and many Asian economies now have the Chang Mai Initiative\nMultilateralization as a safety net and other financial arrangements.\nWithout changing the argument for insurance, I would suggest that\nyou can introduce the global financial safety net as one of the tools to\nmitigate contagion and others.\nMr. Kohn: Kristin, two questions about two of the pieces in your\npolicy response table. One is the “Support Investment Abroad” piece:\nMartin Feldstein raised the question of how you would mobilize that\ninvestment abroad, held by private parties in a crisis. My question\nwas, how would you encourage that investment abroad? What poli-\ncies did you have in mind? I hope it is not the policy of keeping an\nartificially depreciated exchange rate in order to get a current account\nsurplus that you had in mind. I assumed it was not. But what policies\ndid you have in mind?\nAnd the second question is on deposit insurance. I am assuming\nthat you mean more than just retail deposit insurance, because bank\nruns today are about wholesale bank runs, and in order to prevent the\ncontagion—if you are going to use that route—you have to insure\neverything: all the creditors, to one degree or another. And yet the\npolicy direction is to try to reduce the too-big-to-fail problem, put\ncreditors at risk and perhaps use the central banks to lend to solvent\ninstitutions, in order to draw firewalls around the problem institu-\ntions to prevent contagion. But you seem to downplay that in the\npaper, and I was curious about what you meant by deposit insurance\nand how that would work.\nMs. Collins: I would like to follow up on a point that Martin Feld-\nstein made earlier. Kristin writes in her paper about some of the other\nconditions that might matter, including current account balances,\nthe extent and level of fiscal debt, deficits and so on. She did not talk\nabout that in the presentation and there was relatively little about it\nin the paper. I wonder whether, if one were to take a more nuanced\nview, second- and third-best options might look somewhat more\nappealing than her paper suggests—in particular, some of the more\n\nGeneral Discussion 103\nnuanced types of capital controls—as ways of buying time. I would\nlike to add that to the questions that have been posed.\nMr. Frenkel: I also found the paper very interesting. My comments\nfocus on the concept of contagion as measured by correlations. While\nsuch a measure is natural, the interpretation of the correlations is not\nsimple. High correlation may be desirable or undesirable depending\non the circumstances. As an example, consider the spreads of long-\nterm government bonds among eurozone countries relative to the\nGerman long-term rate. That spread was very low between 2002 and\n2007 indicating that the markets priced the sovereign risk of Greece,\nPortugal, France and other eurozone countries to be very similar to\nthat of Germany. Thereafter, with the burst of the financial crisis,\nthe spreads among the eurozone countries have widen significantly\nindicating that the market perceived the sovereign risk of the various\ncountries to be very different from each other. The question remains\nas to whether the low spread which prevailed during 2002-07 was the\ncorrect measure of the sovereign risk while the spreads that prevailed\nsubsequently represented a distorted aberration of the measure of\nrisk; alternatively, have the spreads that prevailed during the early\nperiod reflected a distorted measure of risk which the financial crisis\nhelped to unmask? During the former period, intercountry corre-\nlations among spreads were low, indicating low contagion (by this\nmeasure) while during the latter period these correlations were high,\nindicating high contagion. Whether high or low contagion is “good”\nor “bad” depends, of course, on whether the low-correlation period\nrepresented a correct or a distorted measure of sovereign risk.\nA possible reason for the excessively low spread among eurozone\nsovereign bonds is the implicit assumption that a country in trouble\nwill not be “allowed” to default and that mechanisms will be put in\nplace to bail it out. Under such circumstances, even risky countries\nwere able to borrow at rates of interest which did not reflect their\ntrue risk. This phenomenon has relevance to the current debate with-\nin Europe on the possibility of an introduction of a Pan-European\nbond. Proponents of such a bond would like to see the intercountry\nspreads become as small as possible, while opponents of such a Pan-\nEuropean bond argue that it will mask the fundamental differences\nin the risk characteristics of the various countries.\n\n104 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nMs. Forbes: I will just take a few of the questions that are easier to\nanswer quickly, not suggesting any order of importance among them.\nFirst, Frank, thank you very much for your thoughtful comments. I\nwant to highlight one point on which you focused, which is the role\nof wake-up calls in causing contagion. This is my final, catch-all,\n“fuzzy” channel of contagion. It’s not as clear to categorize or measure\nas contagion through banks, portfolio investors, or trade. I’m glad\nyou focused on it, as in the paper I struggled with whether to include\nit as a separate channel. Since wake-up calls usually occur through\nportfolio investors and banks, they, therefore, could be merged into\nthe other forms of contagion. But the underlying causes of wake-up\ncalls can also be fundamentally different—with different policy rec-\nommendations—so I agree with you that it is useful to differentiate\nthis channel as a separate form of contagion.\nThis discussion brought back memories of when I worked at the\nTreasury Department with John Taylor from 2001 to 2002. A major\nfocus of our work was that if you reduce the element of surprise in\ncrisis management, you should reduce contagion. This was apparent\nafter 2001 when Argentina defaulted. The default wasn’t a surprise\nand there was virtually no contagion, partially because there wasn’t\nany wake-up call effect. This reinforced that wake-up calls can be a\npowerful channel of contagion. This channel is often overlooked in\nthe academic literature, but it is important to address this channel\nand avoid these surprises if possible. It is ironic to look back at the\ndiscussions about contagion in the mid-2000s after the Argentine\ndefault. There were extensive discussions at several conferences about\nthe “end of contagion,” about why contagion risks were largely over,\nand why widespread contagion was not likely to happen again. Obvi-\nously this discussion was wrong.\nNow, let me respond to a few of the specific questions: Marty Feld-\nstein and a few other people asked about the policy proposal that\nencouraging investment abroad by domestic investors can provide a\nbuffer against contagion. I am not suggesting that you should force\ninvestors to sell foreign investments during a crisis and bring funds\nhome. I am also not suggesting that you should force investors to\ninvest abroad. But there are a number of subtle policies that can\n\nGeneral Discussion 105\nsupport individual decisions to accomplish these goals. For example,\nsome countries limit how much pension funds (or other groups, such\nas sovereign wealth funds) can invest abroad. Therefore, reducing\nthose limits could support more investment abroad. Marty asked\nwhy people who invest abroad would repatriate the funds during a\ncrisis. That’s a great question. Recently during the global financial\ncrisis there are amazing trends in which investors in a number of\ncountries chose to repatriate large amounts of funds. When global\nrisk increases, investors, banks and firms in many countries often\nchose to bring money home. This increase in home bias during cri-\nses is a natural tendency for many investors for a variety of reasons.\nMoreover, it’s not just U.S. investors bringing money home during\ncrises. You also see this pattern in countries such as Chile. In a num-\nber of emerging markets, there was a large repatriation of funds dur-\ning the global financial crisis, which supported their economies. It\nwasn’t forced, it happened naturally. Better understanding these pat-\nterns is an important topic for future research.\nThere were a number of other great questions. Given the time con-\nstraints, I will respond to three more.\nAlan, you mentioned the focus on domestic policies to mitigate\nthe risks from international contagion. You suggested that the policy\nrecommendations look similar to what would be recommended in\na paper on domestic contagion. These results also surprised me. For\nexample, the regression results suggest that if you’re concerned about\ninternational contagion through banks, reducing international bank-\ning exposure is less important than reducing domestic bank leverage.\nI interpret these types of results as highlighting a very important is-\nsue—that if you’re worried about contagion, there’s no better way to\nmitigate risks than to strengthen your domestic economy and reduce\nleverage. Stronger macro fundamentals come through as critically\nimportant again and again. A number of people also mentioned re-\nlated concerns about current account deficits. I don’t focus on this\nspecific macro fundamental in my comments, mainly because there’s\nalready been so much discussion of this vulnerability. I think most\nof us know what macro fundamentals are important. There’s no\nreplacement for addressing debt sustainability issues, strengthening\n\n106 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nbanking systems and reducing reliance on external borrowing (which\nincludes current account balances). There is already an extensive lit-\nerature on these issues—and although I did not highlight some of\nthese macroeconomic fundamentals in my discussion—this should\nnot be interpreted as suggesting they are not important.\nStan, you mentioned the challenges in announcing in advance\nwhat policies might be enacted in order to reduce contagion through\nsurprises and wake-up calls. I completely agree with you. This is one\nadvantage to writing a paper such as this rather than being on the\nfront lines implementing policy. The broad policy recommendations\nare often straightforward, and then it falls to people in this audience\nto work through the implementation challenges. A concrete example\nis debt restructuring. Debt restructuring is an area that frustrates in-\nvestors as there is so much uncertainty about how a restructuring\nwill proceed. They don’t know when a restructuring will occur and\nhow losses will be distributed. Any country’s efforts to restructure (or\npostpone a restructuring) will, therefore, provide new information\nabout how it will be done in other countries in the future. This can\ncause contagion to other countries whose debt might be restructured.\nIf policymakers clarified the procedures for future debt restructuring\nin order to minimize this contagion, you might bring forward the\ncrisis. You’re exactly right. So the ideal solution would be to clarify\nall the different policies so far in advance that no one is yet think-\ning about an imminent restructuring. But it is incredibly difficult to\nforesee all scenarios. I fully agree with the points you raised on these\nchallenges to implementation.\nDon Kohn, you raised questions about how to implement deposit\ninsurance. I also put this recommendation in the same category: very\nimportant, but also extremely difficult to implement. But the em-\npirical analysis in my paper suggests deposit insurance should be pri-\noritized. This is hard stuff. There are imposing challenges in how to\nmake it happen. But, if you are worried about contagion, especially\nthrough banks, and especially in Europe today, this needs to be at the\nvery top of any list of priorities. Six months from now may be too\nlate. Yes, it’s hard; yes there are challenges. Those of you in the room\nknow the issues better than I. But the analysis in the paper suggests\n\nGeneral Discussion 107\nit is worth the hard work to find a way to resolve these issues because\nunified deposit insurance should be at the top of European policy-\nmakers’ priorities right now.\n\n",

    "text": "Commentary: Role Reversal\nin Global Finance\nSusan M. Collins\nIt is a pleasure to discuss Eswar Prasad’s very interesting and\nbroad-reaching paper. One of its strengths is that it weaves together\na large amount of material. In particular, it does an excellent job\nof highlighting some important and dramatic changes in emerging\nversus advanced economy linkages with the global financial market.\nWhile I agree with many of its conclusions, my role as discussant\nis to emphasize some of the areas where we have a different take or\nperhaps disagree.\nLet me start with the paper’s title—role reversal—which frames\nmuch of the approach taken in the first half of the paper, and thus\nmany of the conclusions. As Eswar convincingly demonstrates, this\ncharacterization of what has happened in global financial markets is\ntrue in some very striking ways. However, there are also some ways\nin which I find it misleading, as discussed below.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, as a group the emerging markets—or the\ndeveloping countries as they were then called—were struggling to\ngrow, there was considerable truth in the saying that when the ad-\nvanced countries caught a cold, many developing economies caught\npneumonia. They were mired in external debt, often related to large,\nunsustainable fiscal deficits. They were extremely vulnerable to balance\n391\n\n392 Susan M. Collins\nof payments driven financial crises. In contrast, advanced countries\nincreasingly thought those types of vulnerabilities were behind them.\nThey no longer expected to have any need for balance of payments\nsupport from the IMF, and instead to be a resource for less-developed\neconomies that got into trouble.\nA large literature related developing countries’ vulnerability to\nbalance of payments crises to a variety of structural issues. As the\npaper effectively highlights, these included weak governance insti-\ntutions, underdeveloped domestic financial market, dollarization\nand “original sin.” Their vulnerability also related to mismatch in\nthe currencies of assets and liabilities, sudden stops of cross-border\ncredit flows, limited availability of domestically controlled external\nresources and insufficient financial market regulation.\nFast forward to the more recent period—say 2000-08. As the pa-\nper documents very nicely, this characterization no longer fits the\nemerging markets group. There have been tremendous changes, in\nparticular, in terms of the composition of balance sheets of emerging\nmarkets, with liabilities shifting away from debt and assets shifting\ntoward foreign exchange reserves.\nAnother striking difference is that emerging markets—not the ad-\nvanced economies—have become the drivers of global growth. Again,\nthis is well documented in the paper. (While metrics based on pur-\nchasing power parity (PPP) instead of market exchange rates would\nbe preferred, this would not alter these basic points.) The emerging\nmarkets are trade powerhouses. There have also been striking shifts\nin their net foreign asset position and composition, as already dis-\ncussed. Not only have they proved themselves much less vulnerable\nto financial crises, they are now financing significant portions of the\ndebts of the advanced countries.\nClearly, all of this constitutes strong evidence of role reversal. Over-\nwhelmingly, these changes should be seen as indicative of huge policy\nsuccesses among emerging economics, associated with dramatic im-\nprovements in current living standards and prospects from a signifi-\ncant share of the world’s population.\n\nCommentary 393\nIn contrast, advanced countries are struggling to grow. Many\nconfront major fiscal challenges. Unfortunately, they have learned\nthe hard way that they are, indeed, vulnerable to financial crises. In\npart, their vulnerability is related to instability in their own banking\nsystems—not because of underdevelopment, but because of the ex-\ntremely rapid growth in the size and complexity of financial markets.\nThis growth would have created challenges for prudential regulation,\neven if oversight had not been lax.\nExtensive and growing cross-border linkages have created problems\nof currency mismatch for advanced countries that have been difficult\nto unwind. And post-Lehman, they have also learned they are (still?\nagain?) subject to sudden stops in cross-border capital flows. Again, I\nfully agree that these changes reflect important dimensions in which\nthe role of advanced versus developing countries has “reversed.” In\nthis sense, the term “role reversal” provides a valuable frame for un-\nderstanding developments in global financial markets.\nHowever, in other ways, the role reversal terminology may be mis-\nleading. In particular, it could be taken to suggest that emerging mar-\nkets are increasingly taking over from advanced economies to drive\nglobal financial market integration, as they are increasingly driving\ncross-border trade in goods and services. I do not see emerging mar-\nkets assuming this role in financial markets to date. Further, I see\nlittle indication that “role reversal” in this sense is on the horizon.\nBeginning in the 1960s, advanced economies markets have liberal-\nized their financial borders. They have embraced—indeed becom-\ning stewards of—relatively unfettered cross-border capital flows, al-\nbeit subject to prudential regulations. The emerging markets—and I\nwould argue for good reason—have a much more varied and ambiva-\nlent attitude. I do not think, and the paper does not explicitly argue,\nthat these countries are moving to take over this historically impor-\ntant dimension of the advanced countries’ financial market role.\nThe paper documents that global financial market integra-\ntion has resumed post-crisis and that flows are again on the rise for\nmajor economies. However it does not point out that this process has\ngone much more slowly in the emerging markets than it has for the\n\n394 Susan M. Collins\nindustrial countries. While emerging economies account for half of\nglobal gross domestic product (GDP), (using PPP measures), their\nshare of the global financial market remains substantially smaller\nin terms of growth as well as level. These countries are increasingly\nattractive sites for global capital, so this is, at least in part by design,\nreflecting slower and more nuanced financial liberalization policy. This\nsuggests we are shifting toward a global economy in which one set\nof (emerging) countries dominates growth in real transactions while\nfinancial transactions are dominated by actors from a different set of\n(advanced) countries. Certainly a new and interesting international en-\nvironment—but not one accurately described as role reversal.\nThe paper also provides an extensive and valuable discussion of\nthe many challenges and risks of grappling with global integration.\nHowever, it concludes that capital controls are a poor way to address\nthose challenges. I take a much more nuanced view. In particular, it is\nimportant to separate controls on inflows from controls on outflows,\nrecognizing that these can have very different implications. In partic-\nular, Magud, Reinhart, and Rogoff (2011) provide a comprehensive\nassessment, highlighting that inflows have been helpful in retaining\nmonetary authority as well as in changing the composition (not the\nvolume) of inflows. In some circumstances, the net benefits may be\npositive. I agree with those who argue that some types of capital con-\ntrols are a useful part of the policymakers’ toolkit.\nAlso relevant in the context of this conference on growth is work by\nAizenman, Pinto, and Radziwill (2007), which examines the extent\nto which fixed capital formation has been financed by foreign ver-\nsus domestic saving. Based on analysis of a large sample of countries\nthroughout the 1990s, it concludes that domestic sources accounted\nfor some 90 percent of investment. The domestic share did not de-\ncline in the periods of increasing financial integration, and countries\nwith higher self-financing ratios exhibited faster economic growth.\nIn the context of the growth theme of this conference, this perspec-\ntive raises questions about the costs and benefits from external capi-\ntal. As Ross Levine argues persuasively in his paper for this volume,\nmore need not be better—warranting a much stronger emphasis on\ntype of capital and its allocation, than on the volume of capital.\n\nCommentary 395\nEswar argues the recent crisis was just a brief pause in financial\nintegration. I would cast this a little differently. It seems to me the\nrecent crisis exacerbated some of the differences in perspective on the\nextent to which global integration is important for growth. I don’t\nwant to be misinterpreted. I certainly believe that financial systems\ncan play an extremely positive role in supporting growth. But, as\nnoted above, allocation is at least as, if not more, important than the\ntotal amount. We also have to be broad-minded about appropriate\ntiming for liberalizing capital markets in the context of a broader\nportfolio of associated policies, especially given all the uncertainty\nsurrounding us.\nI would like to suggest a different “frame” for thinking about the\nissues addressed in the second half of the paper than the “role rever-\nsal” frame emphasized here. The frame that kept occurring to me as I\nread the paper relates to a 1985 movie, “Back to the Future.” I hope\nthose of you who remember the movie will forgive my simplified and\nselective summary of the main theme. In “Back to the Future,” the\nmain character is accidentally transported back in time a quarter of a\ncentury and confronted by a world of the past featuring many things\nhe thought had been left behind, including a bully, which I will come\nback to later. His main task is to figure out how to get back to the\nfuture, which of course is the “real” world he has just come from. In\ndoing so, he figures out how to tame the bully, so the future he actu-\nally returns to is, in fact, a much rosier one.\nHere’s the analogy. Think of us as having been accidentally transport-\ned back to a world of about 25 years ago, in which advanced as well\nas emerging market economies were extremely vulnerable to financial\ncrises. The bully in this story, of course, is that part of the financial\nsystem associated with very large and predatory cross-border capital\nflows. Our challenge is how to get back to the future we thought we\nwere living in—one in which we could harness those financial flows in\norder to support growth, and knew how to remove or reduce the vul-\nnerability to financial crisis. From the vantage point of this frame, the\n“simple insurance mechanism” outlined in the second half of the paper\nis really a proposal to try to help us tame that bully.\n\n396 Susan M. Collins\nThe paper motivates its insurance mechanism proposal with a brief\ndiscussion of foreign exchange reserve accumulation as a means of\nself-insurance against financial crises. As it notes, reserve holdings\nhave exploded since 2000—with many emerging economies ac-\ncumulating both before and after the crisis—and some (including\nChina) even continuing to accumulate during the crisis. This puzzling\nbehavior has generated a growing literature, to which the paper pro-\nvides a helpful overview. It emphasizes the costs of this self-insurance\nto individual countries. However, especially for small economies, in\nthe absence of a reliable external alternative, the discussion may un-\nderstate the benefits since large reserve stocks do seem to have helped\ninsulate many emerging economies against an output collapse. The\npaper also mentions that this reserve accumulation behavior creates\na collective action problem by encouraging fiscal profligacy and by\nincreasing the instability of global financial markets. However, these\nare only a subset of the systemic issues involved. For instance, the\npaper gives short shrift to the important challenge of China’s massive\nreserve accumulation, and the associated currency misalignment that\nimposes significant costs on the global economy. As the countries ac-\ncumulating reserves have grown, global assessments of the costs and\nbenefits of this behavior have become more important relative to as-\nsessments from each individual country’s perspective. These complex\nissues warrant considerably more research as well as more attention\nthan they are given here.\nThe paper develops a very interesting proposal to tame the financial\nbully through an ex ante global insurance mechanism. The features of\nthis proposal are clearly described in the paper, and I will not repeat\nthem here. To put my punch line up front, while I see some real strength\nin the proposal, I was not ultimately convinced of its feasibility.\nIn terms of strength, the paper does a good job of spelling out some\nof the key features such a mechanism ought to have. Specifically, the\nproposal is intended to help depoliticize access to liquidity in times\nof need, and reduce the stigma associated with some of the IMF\n\nCommentary 397\nfacilities. Importantly, it stresses the value of shifting from a purely\nindividual calculation by countries to a much more systemic under-\nstanding of the costs and benefits of individual country behavior on\nthe global economy.\nIn terms of feasibility, I would highlight the following three chal-\nlenges. First, how would the insurance premiums be determined and\nby whom? It is not at all clear how to set nonlinear weights to relate a\ncountry’s annual premium to its debt level, or how to set that weight\nrelative to the weight on, say, “excess” foreign exchange reserves, in\nsuch as way that participating countries would agree. Without a “be-\nnevolent dictator” or a well-functioning global governance institu-\ntion, determining important “details” as these seem likely to be sty-\nmied by politics. The proposal really doesn’t address the issue of how\nall of that would get worked out. Second, who would bear the risk?\nThe mechanism is intended for liquidity, not solvency challenges. As\nstated, participating countries would be allowed to borrow for a year\n(or specified period). Those that do not pay back on time would get\nkicked out to the IMF. But that does not pin down who would be\nleft holding the bag. And finally, although addressed briefly, more\nattention needs to be paid to moral hazard. The idea of access to\nunconditional finance raises additional questions about implications\nfor runs on countries that participate.\nIn sum, this is a very interesting paper that is already quite widely\ncited. After documenting some of the dramatic changes in key fi-\nnancial market metrics, it convincingly forecasts that, in the coming\ndecade, advanced economies will remain vulnerable to external crises\nwhile emerging economies will be more exposed to domestic fragil-\nity. This is indeed a striking reversal, and the author offers a valuable\ndiscussion of possible implications—some of which reflect ways in\nwhich the roles are only partially reversed. While his creative global\nliquidity proposal seems unlikely to tame the bully of the financial\nmarkets and help us to get “back to the future,” putting proposals\nlike this on the table do provide a valuable step in that direction.\n\n398 Susan M.

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNovember 17, 2023\nBoston, Massachusetts\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nKey Takeaways\n1. Collins emphasized that the two aspects of the Fed’s dual mandate are complementary.\nWhile there often is a tradeoff between inflation and employment in the short run, history has\nshown that price stability is essential for a well-functioning economy – it is an important\nprecondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time. So, both aspects of the dual\nmandate are interrelated and complementary.\n2. A challenge for the Fed, explored at this conference, is how to operationalize a broad\nconcept of full employment when setting monetary policy.\nFull employment has often been defined by referencing an unemployment rate. But no one\nstatistic can adequately characterize the labor market, since aggregate numbers do not show the\nwide range of experiences across people, sectors, and places.\n3. Collins emphasized the connection between the full employment goal and the Fed’s role\nin fostering a vibrant economy that works for everyone.\nFor some people, communities, and places, there are substantial and persistent gaps in economic\noutcomes – including but not limited to employment. This underutilization of the workforce\nadversely affects national productivity and prosperity.\n4. A better understanding of the behavior of labor force participation is important if the\nFed is to meet both its full-employment and price-stability goals, said Collins.\nThe aggregate unemployment rate becomes an inadequate indicator of full employment when the\nlabor force participation rate is changing. If participation increases in a tight labor market, labor\nsupply expands, and higher levels of economic activity may not generate additional price\npressures requiring tighter monetary policy. And the higher levels of activity and participation can\nbenefit those drawn into the labor market.\n5. It is essential to examine factors that could limit people from participating in the\neconomy, and to support research and collaborations that promote economic progress.\nThe Fed’s mandate and the concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy bring our focus to\nparticipation in the workforce, and the challenges that can prevent people from doing so (for\nexample child care, housing, and infrastructure). Often these impediments are long-run, structural\nfactors that cannot be resolved with monetary policy. However, to assess the productive capacity\nof the economy, the Fed needs to know how such barriers to employment are evolving. And a\nbetter understanding can lead to expanded opportunities for more people.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIt is truly a pleasure to be opening my second Boston Fed economic conference,\nthe Bank’s sixty-seventh. I’m especially pleased to be doing so with Egon Zakrajšek,\nour new Director of Research and chief economic advisor.\nAlong with the entire economic research team, Egon and I are committed to\nmaintaining all that is special about the Boston Fed economic conferences. Over the\nyears, these conferences have engaged a wide range of participants on complex issues\nwith practical policy relevance. These conferences, and the learnings they yield, help\nus at the Boston Fed pursue our vision of a vibrant economy that works for all; and our\nmission to serve the public by supporting a strong, resilient, and inclusive economy.\nThis year, we focus on full employment – one pillar of the Fed’s dual mandate.\nAnd we build on last year’s conference, which addressed the potential effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on the labor market. Of course, our conferences do not always\ncover labor market issues; however, these topics have been especially critical lately.\nWe have much to do over the next day and a half – so, let’s begin. My role today\nis not only to welcome you and kick things off, but also to set the stage by providing a\nbit of my own perspective as a monetary policymaker. Of course, I’ll add my standard\ndisclaimer – the views I express are my own, and I’m not speaking for any other Federal\nReserve policymaker.\nFull Employment in Context\nI’ll begin with some historical context on full employment as a policy\nresponsibility. In the wake of the Great Depression and World War II, Congress\ndeclared – in the Employment Act of 1946 – that the federal government was\nresponsible for fostering “conditions … to promote maximum employment.” However, a\nFederal Reserve mandate for full employment was not formally adopted until the late\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n1970s.1 The Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 added the goal of “maximum\nemployment” to the Fed’s responsibility for price stability — leading to the dual\nmandate. This legislation was part of a broader effort in Congress to reaffirm the role of\ngovernment entities in promoting full employment, which culminated in the Humphrey-\nHawkins Act of 1978.2,3\nOf course, the Fed is not the only central bank that tries to balance price stability\nand full employment. However, our legislative history has made the Fed one of the few\ncentral banks where a full-employment mandate is on an explicit equal footing with a\nprice-stability goal.\nIn this context, I’ll reiterate my perspective on the dual mandate. While there\noften is a tradeoff between inflation and employment in the short run, history has shown\nthat price stability is essential for a well-functioning economy. In particular, it is an\nimportant precondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time. So, in a\nvery real sense, both aspects of the dual mandate are interrelated and complementary.\nFull Employment and a Vibrant Economy\nI want to emphasize the connection between full employment and the Fed’s role\nin fostering a vibrant economy that works for everyone, not just for some people. This is\ncentral to the questions we will explore at this conference.\n1 Earlier legislation had referenced a role of the Federal Reserve, but it was not until 1977 that such a role\nwas codified. See then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke’s 2013 speech “A Century of U.S. Central Banking:\nGoals, Frameworks, Accountability”:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20130710a.htm.\n2 Humphrey-Hawkins stated the government’s responsibility to “use all practicable programs and policies\nto promote full employment, production, and real income, balanced growth, adequate productivity growth,\nproper attention to national priorities, and reasonable price stability.” The act expired in 2000, though the\nFederal Open Market Committee is still mandated to present semi-annual reports to Congress assessing\nthe state of the economy and monetary policy.\n3 For more on the history and evolution of the dual mandate, see Aaron Steelman’s Economic Brief for the\nRichmond Fed: https://www.richmondfed.tv/publications/research/economic_brief/2011/eb_11-12\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nWe know that aggregate data show average economic conditions, and not\nnecessarily the experiences of specific subsets or groups. But we also know that, for\nsome people, communities, and places, there are substantial and persistent gaps in\neconomic outcomes – including but not limited to employment. A truly healthy economy\nneeds the best ideas, energy, and participation from everyone – with ample\nopportunities to work, contribute, and prosper.\nThe Fed’s mandate and our concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy bring our\nfocus to participation in the economy and the workforce, and the challenges that can\nprevent people from doing so. These include real economic issues like child care,\nhousing, and infrastructure such as transportation and broadband.\nThe Boston Fed has a decades long history of studying disparities for groups and\nplaces.4 We believe better understanding these gaps can lead to expanded\n‐\nopportunities for more people – and to those opportunities being more equitably\navailable. This helps bring more people into the workforce, and strengthens economic\ngrowth and competitiveness. We are committed to examining factors that could limit\npeople from participating in the economy, and where possible, to supporting research\nand collaborations that expand prospects for progress.\nThis work relates directly to our mission and mandate. And in that context, it is\nimportant to remember that the Fed’s portfolio of activities is considerably broader than\njust our core monetary policy work. In our supervisory, payments, and community-\noutreach efforts, we promote financial stability and economic inclusion, access to credit\nfor firms and households, and an efficient and reliable payments system. Community\n4 We conduct research, and have hosted conferences, exploring disparities in economic opportunities.\nExamples include the 1990s Boston Fed work on discrimination in mortgage lending (see\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/news/2020/10/landmark-boston-fed-hdma-paper-\nrecapped.aspx), and the Boston Fed’s 2019 research conference, which explored the growing geographic\ndisparities in economic outcomes (see https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-\nevents/news/2019/10/boston-fed-economic-conference-on-reducing-inequality-between-places.aspx and\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/housedivided2019.aspx).\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ndevelopment activities, including our Working Places initiatives5, provide examples of\nhow to encourage local partnerships in New England’s smaller cities and rural areas, to\nincrease economic opportunities and progress. Our roles and responsibilities in the\npublic interest also include rigorous, nonpartisan research on key economic issues,\nalong with convening stakeholders, policymakers, and experts around issues of\nimportance – such as in conferences like this one.\nAssessing and Measuring Full Employment\nTurning now to the relationship between full employment and monetary policy, a\nchallenge for the Federal Reserve is how to operationalize a broad concept of full\nemployment. I’d like to highlight some of the issues we face when translating the broad\ngoal of full employment into specific monetary policy decisions.\nFull employment has often been defined by referencing an unemployment rate.\nSpecifically, the economy has been thought to be at full employment when the\nunemployment rate equals the natural rate of unemployment – the rate of\nunemployment consistent with a normal pace of economic growth in the medium to\nlonger run. The aggregate unemployment rate is a useful summary indicator for broad\noverall labor market conditions.6 But no single statistic can easily characterize a\ncomplex and evolving labor market.\n5 The Boston Fed’s Working Places programs are based on research into resurgent post-manufacturing\ncities, and support the Fed’s full employment mandate. Research suggested smaller-city economic\nresurgence depends on a city’s ability to mobilize its civic infrastructure — leaders, organizations,\nnetworks, and resources — to pursue a shared economic vision. So the programs support cross-sector,\nlocal leadership teams (with public, private, nonprofit, and community members) with shared goals. Team\ngoals and strategies are chosen locally, based on need and opportunity. Winning communities receive\ngrants provided by partners (not the Fed) including states, the private sector, and philanthropy. See\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces/initiatives.aspx.\n6 In particular, the unemployment rate has proven helpful in modelling the short-run tradeoff between real\nactivity and inflation that is summarized by the Phillips Curve. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also\npublishes multiple measures of unemployment that try to capture different dimensions of labor\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nSince aggregate numbers do not show the wide range of experiences across\ngroups of people, sectors, and places, we also review disaggregated labor-market data.\nFor example, one sees persistent disparities in unemployment for different racial and\nethnic groups, and across education levels.\nUnemployment rates that are persistently higher by race, or by place – as they\nhave been for a long time – reflect underutilization of our country’s labor resources, and\nthat adversely affects national productivity and prosperity. Indeed, in the past – even\nwhen the unemployment rate was at what was considered the natural rate – many\npeople, groups, and places were excluded from full labor market participation. That is,\nlabor market conditions at “full employment” have not served as a rising tide that equally\nlifts all boats. That had negative consequences for the affected people, as well as for\noverall economic performance.\nRecent history provides some important insights. First, looking back at labor\nmarket developments during and after the 2007-2009 Great Recession, we can see\nhow an aggregate unemployment rate becomes an inadequate indicator of full\nemployment when the labor force participation rate is changing. After the Great\nRecession, the aggregate participation rate fell dramatically. Some of this decline\nstemmed from long-run structural forces beyond the Fed’s control, such as population\naging. But some of the decline resulted from the large drop in labor demand during the\nrecession, which led to many workers becoming discouraged and dropping out of the\nlabor force. To meet its full-employment mandate, the Fed had to determine how much\nof the participation decline was structural and how much was cyclical and could\npotentially be addressed by accommodative monetary policy.\nMore recently, we’ve seen another example of how labor force participation\nmatters for full employment. Since the acute phase of the pandemic ended, labor\ndemand has been outstripping the supply of available workers. A goal of current\nunderutilization. For more detail, see https://www.bls.gov/opub/btn/archive/the-unemployment-rate-and-\nbeyond-alternative-measures-of-labor-underutilization.pdf.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nmonetary policy is, of course, to restore a better balance in the labor market, with higher\ninterest rates working to slow labor demand in this realignment process.\nBut recently, part of the move toward a better balance has come through an\nincrease in labor supply. The labor force participation rate for prime-aged workers\n(ages 25-54) is higher today than it was just before the pandemic – a development that\nfew expected even a year ago. And some of the larger gains in participation have\noccurred among women and minority groups.\nA better understanding of the behavior of labor force participation is important if\nthe Fed is to meet both its full-employment and price-stability goals.7 If labor supply\nexpands to meet demand in tight labor markets, then higher levels of economic activity\nin such times may not generate additional price pressures requiring tighter monetary\npolicy. And the higher levels of activity and participation can benefit those brought into\nthe labor market, contributing to a vibrant economy that works for all.\nA More Inclusive Perspective on Full Employment\nThis process was at work in the late 2010s, when the aggregate labor force\nparticipation rate stopped falling as labor markets became progressively tighter.\nMembers of some disadvantaged groups were drawn into the labor force as this\noccurred. And the gains to those groups – and to the overall economy – were\nsubstantial.8\nFed Chair Jay Powell highlighted these significant and beneficial effects on\nseveral parts of the population in his August 2020 Jackson Hole speech announcing the\nnew monetary policy framework. He recognized that “the robust job market was\n7 Other factors impacting full employment, not discussed here, are also important, such as the\nrelationship between job vacancies and unemployment.\n8 After bottoming out in 2015, the labor force participation rate of prime age workers rebounded by about\n1.5 percentage points, roughly equivalent to 3 million additional workers. Employment increased by an\neven larger amount – about 4.3 million – given that the unemployment rate was falling over this period.\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ndelivering life-changing gains for many individuals, families, and communities,\nparticularly at the lower end of the income spectrum. In addition, many who had been\nleft behind for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their families and communities, and\nincreasing the productive capacity of our economy.” 9,10\nConsistent with the recognition of the different labor market experiences across\nindividuals and groups, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, noted as part of\nthe 2020 framework review that full employment is a “broad-based and inclusive goal.”\nThe new framework also removed references to the FOMC’s longer-run estimates of the\nunemployment rate in assessing progress toward full employment. These changes de-\nemphasized the use of a natural or long-run rate of unemployment as the key metric for\nassessing full employment.\nIn my view, the revised framework reflects the complexity of assessing full\nemployment in a rapidly evolving economy. And, by moving away from a definition of\nfull employment that is based primarily on aggregate unemployment, the new\nframework encourages Fed policymakers to better understand potential barriers to\nparticipation for some workers during “normal” times.\nIn many cases, these impediments are long-run, structural factors that cannot be\nresolved with monetary policy.11 Government policies designed to reduce skills gaps or\nameliorate child care problems over the long run will be fiscal, not monetary, policies.12\n9 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm.\n10 In 2019 and 2020 the System held several “Fed Listens” meetings to gain a better understanding of the\nlabor market experiences of different groups that were an important part of the monetary-policy\nframework review process. Fed Listens: Perspectives from the Public (federalreserve.gov). The System is\ncontinuing these “Fed Listens” meetings. See https://www.federalreserve.gov/fedlistens.htm.\n11 These barriers often reflect structural impediments such as lack of child care options, lack of\ninformation about job opportunities, or lack of appropriate skills.\n12 Improvements in technology and changes in business practices can also reduce barriers without policy\ninterventions. As an example, the growth of working-from-home is thought to be a key reason why the\nparticipation rates of persons with disabilities have risen so much since the pandemic. Our conference\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nHowever, to assess the long-run productive capacity of the economy, the Fed\nalso needs to know how such barriers to employment are evolving over time. And the\nlabor force participation increases during the late 2010s and after the pandemic indicate\nthat the impediments could be less problematic when labor markets are tight. As a\nresult, understanding these barriers from both the long-run and short-run perspectives is\nessential, if the Fed is to fulfill its dual mandate. And of course, as I noted earlier, this\nalso aligns with our broader portfolio of work, including our role as a nonpartisan\nresource, convener, and partner to support a vibrant economy for our region and the\ncountry.\nOur Conference\nIn that spirit, over the next day-and-a-half we’ll hear from paper authors,\npanelists, and discussants on many of the issues surrounding full employment,\nincluding how best to measure it. Two panels will explore the challenge of assessing\nfull employment in real time, and whether the Fed should probe for full employment late\nin expansions. These topics relate to the types of data that the Fed should use to\nevaluate full employment, as well as to the potential benefits and costs of tight labor\nmarkets.\nWe will also learn more about potential barriers faced by some groups —\nincluding women, racial minorities, and people with criminal histories. Other sessions\nwill review the evidence on programs designed to increase workers’ skills and will\ndiscuss the growth of “gig” work in the economy. Our keynote speaker, Cecilia Rouse,\nwill explore the roles that a strong labor market and supportive government policies may\nhave played in generating the rapid and remarkably equitable recovery from the\npandemic.\nlast year discussed potential long-run changes in labor markets brought on by the pandemic, so we won’t\nfocus as closely on those issues this year.\n8\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, November 17, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nConcluding Observations\nIn closing, I want to express my sincere thanks to our keynote speaker, the paper\nauthors and discussants, and the panelists for their contributions to this conference. I\nknow we will also have excellent comments and questions from the floor and during the\nbreaks, so my thanks to each of you for joining us. I also warmly welcome those tuning\nin to the live stream.\nNow it is my pleasure to turn things over to my colleague Chris Foote, who will\nmoderate our first panel.\n9",

U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, January 19, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n“The National and Regional Economy:\nNavigating Near-term Changes\nand Long-term Challenges”\nSusan M. Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nRemarks at the Conference\n“Housing, Place, and Flexible Work: The Future of the\nNew England Economy”\nJanuary 19, 2023\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors o r the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nKey Takeaways\n1. Restoring price stability remains the imperative for monetary policymakers, and there is more\nwork to do. I anticipate the need for further rate increases, perhaps at a slower pace, depending on\nincoming data, before holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level for some time. More measured rate\nadjustments will better enable us to address the competing risks that monetary policy now faces.\n2. While realistic about the risks and uncertainties, I remain reasonably optimistic that there is a\npathway to reducing inflation without a significant economic downturn. I see ongoing resilience in\nthe economy, evidenced by many firms’ continued hiring plans, and household and business spending that\nis holding up relatively well.\n3. New England’s economy has many strengths to nurture, and some key challenges to address.\nThis is an opportunity to take stock, look ahead, and assess long-term trajectories, opportunities, and\nimperatives – especially related to the availability of both workers and housing.\n4. The Fed’s mandate and mission involve an economy with opportunities for all – but outcomes\npersistently differ in certain places, and for certain people or groups. The region’s economy is\nhealthiest when it’s providing opportunities for all to contribute and prosper, not leaving some people and\nplaces behind. Today’s conference will explore the challenges – and opportunities – presented by the post-\npandemic economy for New Englanders.\n5. Since 2014, the Boston Fed has been leading promising work focused on encouraging local\nefforts to find economic resurgence – in smaller cities where manufacturing once flourished, and rural\nareas facing challenges. We call it the Working Places Challenge – and the model is proving effective.\n6. “Working Places” is based on research that showed a key to resilience, through waves of\neconomic change and challenge, is cross-sector collaboration among local individuals willing to\ntake on shared leadership. The program is structured as a competition for grant money (not from the Fed\nbut from the private sector, philanthropy, and states). Local leaders are building cross-sector vision and\npriorities, and working on them together. It helps communities weave together many small individual\napproaches into one, coherent system – and then improve the system. The Fed hosts, convenes, and\nsupports these efforts.\n7. Working Places helps the Fed encourage economic progress in local economies, grounded in\nour mission of a vibrant and inclusive economy, and our mandate to achieve price stability and\nmaximum employment – for all not just some. It is one example of strategic partnerships the Boston\nFed creates to improve New England’s economy. Like other community development efforts of the Boston\nFed, it complements our monetary policy, research, payments, and supervision work as we seek to fulfill\nour mission and mandate.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. I want to thank our organizers: my\ncolleagues at the Boston Fed’s New England Public Policy Center – part of our Research\ndepartment – as well as our partners at the New England Economic Partnership, and the\nDonahue Institute at the University of Massachusetts.\nThis gathering provides an opportunity to explore key aspects of the future of the New\nEngland economy, especially given the pandemic effects that are still with us, and still evolving.\nIt is important to study the shifts we are seeing – in work, commuting, housing, and economic\nactivity – with an eye to navigating them effectively, and ensuring a vibrant regional economy\nwith opportunities for all.\nIn my remarks, I’ll speak briefly about monetary policy, then touch on what I’ve seen in\nthe New England economy during my first six months in this role, and finally talk about an\napproach we at the Fed have found helps local community efforts to coalesce around\nchallenges, in support of economic resurgence.\nThe National Context: The Macroeconomy and Monetary Policy\nMy comments about monetary policy and the national economy focus on recent\ndevelopments related to the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum sustained employment and price\nstability. Of course, these comments are my own; I’m not speaking for my fellow policymakers.\nWith the inflation rate well above the 2 percent target, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (or FOMC) has been resolute in its goal of restoring price stability – raising interest\nrates aggressively since last March. High inflation takes a toll on households, especially the\nmost vulnerable ones. And it complicates investment and planning decisions for firms. Price\nstability is essential for a well-functioning inclusive economy that works for all, and for healthy\nlabor market conditions that are sustainable over time.\nWe are starting to see some effects of the cumulative policy actions the FOMC has\ntaken so far. Less demand (from higher interest rates), combined with lower input costs (from\neasing supply bottlenecks), are contributing to noticeably slower inflation for goods – with the\nprices for some goods actually declining. These developments, together with decreasing energy\nprices, are at the root of the inflation improvement we saw in the last quarter of 2022. But\nhouseholds consume far more services than goods, and services inflation remains persistently\nhigh.\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nA key piece of this has been sizeable increases in shelter costs. However, monetary\npolicy tightening has slowed new rent growth considerably, which should lead to a moderation in\nshelter inflation starting in the spring of this year. For services outside of shelter, labor tends to\nbe the most important input – so developments in this component of services inflation are\nultimately tied to the behavior of wages.\nBringing labor market conditions into better balance will therefore be critical to achieving\nour inflation target. While labor market activity has shown some signs of moderating, there is\nstill a long way to go. Indeed, high job vacancies and “quit rates” are signs that labor demand\nremains strong. And while the latest average hourly earnings data suggest some softening of\nwage pressures, labor costs continue to grow more rapidly than is consistent with 2 percent\ninflation. (I’ll note that workers do not benefit from nominal wage gains that are eroded by too-\nhigh inflation. What matters for workers are gains in real wages.)\nWhile it is promising to see the effects of higher rates starting to spread from the most\ninterest-sensitive sectors to the broader economy, more is required to ensure a steady path\ntoward our inflation target. As monetary policymakers, restoring price stability remains our\nimperative. Thus, I anticipate the need for further rate increases, likely to just above 5 percent,\nand then holding rates at that level for some time.\nNow that rates are in restrictive territory and we may (based on current indicators) be\nnearing the peak, I believe it is appropriate to have shifted from the initial expeditious pace of\ntightening to a slower pace – though appropriate policy will, of course, depend on a holistic\nreview of available data. More measured rate adjustments in the current phase will better\nenable us to address the competing risks monetary policy now faces – the risk that our actions\nmay be insufficient to restore price stability, versus the risk that our actions may cause\nunnecessary losses in real activity and employment. I am well aware that, as with inflation, the\ncosts of higher unemployment are disproportionately borne by people of color and economically\nvulnerable groups.\nI’ll conclude my comments about monetary policy by noting that I continue to be what I\ncall a “realistic optimist.” The ongoing resilience of our economy – from many firms continuing to\nincrease their payrolls, to business and household spending still holding up relatively well\ndespite an uncertain economic environment – make me reasonably optimistic that there is a\npathway to reducing inflation without a significant economic downturn. But I also recognize risks\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nand uncertainties to that outlook, including the possibility of a more substantial downturn driven\nby a self-fulfilling loss of confidence in the economy.\nThese are among the many considerations for both determining and communicating\nmonetary policy. I’ll shift now from national policy to some of the longer run opportunities and\nchallenges with a focus on New England – the Fed’s First District, which the Boston Fed serves.\nNew England’s Economy… and the Issue of Gaps\nNew England’s economy has many strengths to nurture, and some key challenges to\naddress. The conference today provides an opportunity to take stock, to look ahead, and to\nassess long-term trajectories, opportunities, and imperatives – especially around the availability\nof both workers and housing.\nSome of the greatest strengths of New England can be found in our workforce, and the\ninnovative institutions located here. Our workforce is among the most highly skilled and\neducated in the world.1 The region also hosts many organizations leading in healthcare,\ntechnology (including biotechnology), clean energy, and higher education.2\nThese enviable characteristics suggest New England is favorably positioned for the\nfuture. I see the Fed’s mandate and mission, however, as encompassing an economy with\nopportunities for all – not just those with advanced degrees, and not just the cities and towns\nthat are thriving. When we look across New England, we see places and communities that are\nnot fully participating in the region’s overall prosperity. For example, some small cities, and rural\nareas with dwindling employment, struggle to sustain local schools and services.\nAnd we see some demographic groups – particularly when looking by race and ethnicity\n– with lower levels of income, wealth, and educational achievement than their white and Asian\npeers. For instance, students in New England perform better on math and reading tests than\nmost other states, but there are large gaps by race and income.3,4 And household incomes\ndiffer widely by race.5\nThe region’s economy is healthiest when it is providing opportunities for all to participate,\ncontribute, and prosper, not leaving some people and places behind. As we head into a future of\nslowing population growth and likely continued labor challenges, we need the contributions and\ncapabilities of all communities and places across the region. So this conference is timely and\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nimportant, as we think together about the challenges – and opportunities – presented by the\npost-pandemic economy for people and places.\nWorking Places: Local Successes from a Productive Model\nI’ll turn now to an effort the Boston Fed has been involved with for nearly a decade,\nbegun under the leadership of my predecessor, Eric Rosengren. Since 2014, staff here have\nfocused on encouraging local efforts to find economic resurgence in smaller cities and rural\nareas facing long-term struggles. We call it the Working Places Challenge.\nThese places were once centers of the manufacturing and natural resource economies\nin New England. With the employment decline in those industries, many of these communities\nhave struggled to reimagine and rebuild their economies. They face myriad challenges: aging\nhousing stock and infrastructure, a dwindling tax base, and often high rates of poverty. Of\ncourse, they also have strengths and potential.\n“Working Places” is based on research that showed the key to economic resilience,\nthrough waves of change and challenge, is cross-sector collaboration among local individuals\nwilling to take on shared leadership.6 This collaborative leadership seems to be the “secret\nsauce” in resurgent communities. The Working Places model helps it blossom.\nThe program is structured as a competition for relatively modest grant money (not from\nthe Fed but rather from the private sector, philanthropy, and states). Local leaders – now in 30\ncommunities across 5 states – are building cross-sector vision and priorities, and working on\nthem together. The Fed hosts, convenes, and supports these efforts.\nIt starts with teams choosing a shared goal for improving the economy that benefits low-\nincome people. Many teams focus on improving conditions and capabilities for the local\nworkforce, or for locally owned businesses. If the independent jury (not the Fed!) selects a\ncommunity in the competition, that team receives several hundred thousand dollars over three\nyears (again, not from the Fed), to use in coordinating efforts and creating new interventions.\nI’ll share some examples:\n The team in rural Lamoille County in northern Vermont is newly focused on\nresponding to the need for housing voiced by low- and moderate-income residents\nand the employers in need of workers. The county has low-income areas of poverty\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nalongside higher income and second-home communities associated with skiing. The\nneed for housing is made more acute by the influx of new residents – many working\nelsewhere, remotely – and the growth of the short-term rental market, which\nsqueezes out long-term renters. Locals from a variety of sectors are working together\nto move the needle on housing, by experimenting with novel approaches such as\nextending water and sewer infrastructure to enable new development, and creating a\nlandlord liaison to facilitate rental housing for local residents.\n In East Hartford, Connecticut, people across sectors saw the need to align job\nopportunities for local residents with local employers’ workforce needs. East Hartford\nis a diverse community. Compared to nearby towns and the state as a whole, it has\nhigher poverty rates, more working poor, fewer with college degrees, and more\nfemale-led single-parent households. The Working Places team focused on local-\nresident job training, local recruiting and placement with major employers, and\nsummer jobs for high school students.7 For example, the Professional Skills\nAcademy has now trained three cohorts of local residents for placement with local\nemployers, in cooperation with a local college – including relatively well paid, career-\nladder jobs.\n Lawrence, Massachusetts, once a textile manufacturing powerhouse, has been\none of the lowest-income cities in the Commonwealth for decades, with deteriorating\nservices and high rates of poverty. People in city government, nonprofits, the school\ndepartment, the community college, and local firms decided to focus on raising the\nincome prospects of parents with children in the public schools. They provided job\ntraining and wraparound services for more than 600 parents, assisted 200 families\nwith job placements (with an average wage increase of 25 percent), created new\ntraining pipelines with employers and the local community college, and integrated\nsome long-term interventions into the school system, aimed at improving family well-\nbeing.8\nIn sum, we see progress, and promise. Working Places helps communities weave\ntogether many small individual approaches into one, coherent system – and then improve the\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nsystem. It has been wonderful to see relatively limited awards be followed by substantial private\nand public investment, capitalizing on new cross-sector frameworks and creating new hubs of\neconomic activity. For example, in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, work by the local team was a key\nfactor in now more than $100 million in new investment downtown and in surrounding\nneighborhoods. In Massachusetts, the Executive Office of Economic and Housing Development\ncreated the Urban Agenda grant program, modeled partially on Working Places, which has now\ninvested in collaborative economic growth projects in over 50 communities over 5 years,\nincluding Lawrence – and a national funder9 created a small-city investment fund for follow-on\ninvestment.\nIndependent outside evaluations cite progress such as heightened involvement of\nanchor institutions like educational and health care organizations, and other private employers;\nevaluations also find city government spending more aligned with local priorities.10 And from\n2011 to 2016, poverty dropped and high school graduation rates improved faster and more\ndramatically in our Round 1 winning “working cities” (Lawrence, Fitchburg, Holyoke, Chelsea)\nthan in the state as a whole and other similar cities.\nThere are important lessons from Working Places. Complex issues cannot be solved by\none sector, one organization, or one person. Successful collaboration requires attention to\nprocess, and new voices at the table to expand insight. It requires the flexibility to seize\nopportunities – and to change along the way, including admitting when efforts need to be\nrethought. A neutral, trusted convener can help. The most successful Working Places teams\nhave robust community engagement, local government supporters, and an urgent shared\npurpose.\nWhile still unfolding, it’s a great story that deserves to be told – and hopefully replicated\nas well as studied.\nConcluding Observations\nThe Working Places initiative helps the Fed encourage progress in local economies. It is\ngrounded in our mission of a vibrant and inclusive economy, and our mandate to achieve price\nstability and maximum employment for all, not just some. Like other community development\nefforts of the Boston Fed, it complements our monetary policy, research, payments, and\nsupervision work, as we seek to fulfil our mission and mandate.\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:10 AM on Thursday, January 19, 2003 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIf we are to move toward a more inclusive economy over time, the capacity for low-\nincome places to adapt to economic change, which Working Places supports, is ever more\nimportant. This is particularly true in the context of the kinds of changes in housing and work we\nare discussing at today’s conference.\nI’ll conclude my remarks there. We have important topics to cover today, and some\nterrific experts to share their perspectives. I look forward to hearing from our panelists about\nshifting economic conditions, and invite moderator John Ballantine to begin that session.\nAgain, thank you all for joining us today.\n1 Forty-seven percent of Massachusetts residents 25 and older hold a bachelor’s or advanced degree, the highest among states\n(although bested by Washington, D.C.).

American Community Survey, one-year sample for 2021.\n2 New England “punches above its weight” in higher education, with many standout institutions.

In\nthe wake of COVID-19, the team realized that over 50 percent of adult education participants – largely Black and Latino people – in\nHartford and East Hartford do not have regular access to the Internet, which is hindering learning, the ability to apply for\nemployment, and access to remote jobs. As a result, the team is now gathering data to better understand the need and create new\nstrategies, which is critical to improving employment opportunity for their residents.\n8 Prior to the disruptions created by the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting schools everywhere, the Lawrence school turnaround –\nwhich included the Working Cities team, and also extended beyond it – included progress in math scores in younger grades,\nincreases in English proficiency, and increases in the graduation rate.\n9 The Kresge Foundation\n10 Local systems like the job market and school system are also beginning to deliver better outcomes for residents, though it’s\nimportant to say that Working Places teams are just one part of those efforts.\n7",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nJune 18, 2024\nLawrence, Massachusetts\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nKey Takeaways\n1. Collins is encouraged by recent economic data that suggests demand and supply are\ncoming into better balance. Still, the appropriate approach to monetary policy\ncontinues to require patience. Collins says recent economic information is encouraging,\nafter the string of higher-than-expected inflation readings during the first quarter of 2024. The\ndata suggest an economy with demand and supply coming into better balance, as needed to\nrestore price stability. However, she says, this process may take more time than previously\nthought. It is still uncertain whether inflation is durably on a path back to the 2 percent target.\nThe appropriate monetary policy approach continues to require patience, providing time for a\nmethodical assessment of the evolving constellation of available data.\n2. “Working Places” is an example of how the Fed encourages economic progress on the\nlocal level. Collins says the research-based Working Places initiative is grounded in the\nBoston Fed’s public service mission to build a vibrant and inclusive economy and the Fed’s\nCongressional mandate to achieve price stability and maximum employment. It’s an example\nof a strategic partnership, she says, that aims to improve New England’s economy. This\ncommunity development effort complements the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy, research,\npayments, and supervision work as it seeks to fulfill its mission and mandate.\n3. In Lawrence, Massachusetts, collaborative leadership and a shared vision continue to\nimpact the resurgent city’s future. Lawrence is home to one of the first success stories of\nWorking Places. Collins says the efforts here illustrate how shared leadership and\ncollaboration between sectors can help spark economic progress and resilience through\nwaves of change and challenge.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nGood morning. Es un gran placer estar con ustedes para esta maravillosa\ncelebracion. ¡Felicidades!\nI want to congratulate the Lawrence Partnership on its 10th year and all of\ntoday’s award recipients for their many contributions to the Lawrence community.\nCongratulations to all!\nAnd my thanks to the Lawrence Partnership’s Executive Committee and the\ndedicated team who organized today’s events, notably George Ramirez, Karina\nCalderon, and Genesis Duran.\nSince becoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston1 nearly two\nyears ago, I have made it a priority to get out and around New England to hear about\nlocal economic experience from communities like Lawrence. I am delighted by the\nopportunity to learn more about its history, its many strengths, and some of its\nchallenges. Lawrence – and places like it – are critical to New England’s economy, and\nall of you are critical to helping Lawrence continue to thrive.\nMany of you may not know that the Boston Fed, and several of our key partners,\nare part of Lawrence’s recent history. In 2014, Lawrence was one of the first\ncommunities in Massachusetts to take part in the Boston Fed’s new grant-funded,\ncollaborative leadership competition, the “Working Cities Challenge,” which aimed to\naddress local economic development challenges. Lawrence’s plan, and the people\ninvested in bringing it to life, really stood out as a strong example of what a community\ncan do when local leaders come together around a shared, urgent purpose.\nAt the Boston Fed, we engage residents and leaders across the six New England\nstates to learn about their economic experiences, challenges, and opportunities. We\nalso seek to provide insight into what the Federal Reserve does, and why. These\nconversations are truly valuable, and they complement the statistical data and analysis\nthat I, as a monetary policymaker, consider as I develop my views on the economy.\nThat’s why today, in addition to taking part in this celebration, I am meeting with\n1 See Home - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nbusiness and community leaders to hear about their on-the-ground experiences and to\ngain insight into the local economy here in the Merrimack Valley.\nThe Boston’s Fed’s Broad Portfolio and Mission\nI'll start by saying a bit more about the Fed, and specifically about the broader\nportfolio of work at the Boston Fed, which people often find surprising.\nWe are one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, along with the Federal Reserve\nBoard of Governors in Washington, make up the U.S. central bank. I often say our\nmission is to create a vibrant, inclusive economy that works for everyone, not just for\nsome people. We carry out this mission in support of the two primary objectives – or\nmandates – that Congress has given the Fed: to keep inflation low and stable and to\nensure anyone who wants to work has opportunities to do so.\nIn pursuit of its so-called dual mandate, the Fed sets a target interest rate – the\nfederal funds rate – that influences overall financial conditions. The Fed also undertakes\na range of other activities critical to helping achieve its mission and mandate. They are:\n• Conducting impactful research and analysis on a wide range of economic,\nfinancial, and behavioral topics and policies.\n• Encouraging economic opportunity in communities of all sizes through on-the-\nground initiatives. These bring together the public, private, nonprofit, and\nphilanthropic sectors to develop solutions to economic challenges that impact\nunderserved populations.\n• Ensuring that the country's payments infrastructure meets the public's current\nand future needs. Our work contributes to a secure, reliable, and accessible U.S.\npayments system – from making sure financial institutions have the cash they\nneed, to modernizing how Americans send and receive funds.2\n2 The Federal Reserve launched a new instant payments infrastructure, called the FedNow® Service in\nJuly 2023. Over the coming years, customers of banks and credit unions that sign up for the service\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n• Last and not least, we maintain the safety and soundness of the nation's financial\nsystem by supervising certain financial institutions across New England. With the\nsupport of other federal and state regulators, we make sure these institutions\noperate effectively and provide fair and equitable access to credit, capital, and\nfinancial services.\nSome Broader Economic Context\nHaving covered some basics about the Federal Reserve, I’d like to shift to a brief\ndiscussion of U.S. economic conditions and monetary policy – because it is important to\nconsider this broader economic context as we take stock of the progress at the\ncommunity level. First, a disclaimer: these comments reflect my own views and not\nnecessarily those of other Federal Reserve policymakers.\nAs our economy emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic’s deep recession,\noutput and labor markets recovered rapidly – but inflation surged, sparked by massive\nglobal supply chain disruptions and compounded by strong demand and shifts in\nconsumption patterns. This configuration of economic forces led to demand outstripping\nsupply, putting significant upward pressure on prices and wages.\nWe also saw the very harsh impact of high inflation, which is like a tax that\naffects all of us. The toll was especially severe for lower-income households struggling\nto make ends meet. The surge in inflation also affected firms, complicating their\ninvestment, hiring, and planning decisions – all in all, not an environment that fosters a\nhealthy economy or maximum employment that is sustainable. This is a key reason for\nmy commitment to restoring price stability.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the Fed’s monetary policy-\nmaking body. It has focused on bringing inflation back down to its 2 percent target by\nshould be able to use their financial institution’s interfaces to send instant payments quickly and securely.\nLearn more at https://explore.fednow.org/about.\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nraising the federal funds rate, its primary monetary policy tool. This has pushed up\nborrowing costs, helping to cool the overheated economy and realign demand with\nsupply. The FOMC began raising the funds rate in March 2022 and has kept the target\nrate at its current level of 5¼ to 5½ percent since July 2023.\nWe have made significant progress, and inflation has fallen substantially, though\nit remains stubbornly above the FOMC’s target. And despite higher borrowing costs,\neconomic activity has been remarkably resilient overall. In the labor market, strong\neconomic activity has translated into an aggregate unemployment rate that has\nremained near historic lows, while wages have continued to grow solidly. However, it is\nimportant to recognize that aggregate data mask a wide range of experiences.3 In\nparticular, unemployment rates are notably higher in some communities, and higher\ninterest rates are quite challenging for some households and businesses.\nSo, the FOMC carefully assesses appropriate monetary policy – balancing the\nrisk of not getting inflation sustainably under control because policy was eased\nprematurely against the risk of a larger-than-needed slowdown associated with holding\nthe funds rate high for too long.\nJust last week, the FOMC issued a statement explaining its recent decision to\nhold the funds rate steady.4 Importantly, it also noted that the inflation data received\nrecently showed some modest further progress towards our goals.\nI see recent information as encouraging, after the string of higher-than expected\ninflation readings during the first quarter of 2024. In my view, the data suggest an\neconomy with demand and supply coming into better balance, as required to restore\nprice stability. However, this process may just take more time than previously thought.\nIt is too soon to determine whether inflation is durably on a path back to the 2\npercent target. Uncertainty remains high – and the volatility of monthly data remains\n3 See Full Employment: A Broad-Based, Inclusive Goal - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)\n4 See Federal Reserve Board - Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nelevated, including for inflation.5 We should not overreact to a month or two of\npromising news, just as it was not appropriate to take too much signal from the\ndisappointing data at the beginning of this year.\nAnd so, as I have often said, I remain a realistic optimist – optimistic that we can\nrestore price stability in a reasonable amount of time amid a labor market that remains\nhealthy, while realistic about the risks and uncertainties to that outlook. The appropriate\napproach to monetary policy continues to require patience, providing time for a\nmethodical and holistic assessment of the evolving constellation of available data.\nA Focus on Smaller Cities, As Key to the Bigger Economic Picture\nAs I have mentioned, one of the Fed’s mandates focuses on what economists\ncall “full employment.” To achieve this goal, cities like Lawrence must thrive, and\ntogether we must address barriers to opportunity and participation in the larger\neconomy. For decades, Lawrence and other smaller cities have had unemployment\nrates two to three times higher than the overall rate in Massachusetts. We’ve been\npleased to see that gap decline recently, but there is still much work to do.\nLawrence and other so-called Gateway Cities (where nearly 25 percent of the\nMassachusetts population resides) are central to the economic health and vibrancy of\nNew England. Like Lawrence, many of these communities are home to a young and\ngrowing immigrant population, which is important in a state that has a low birth rate,\nsignificant out-migration, and is located in a region with the nation’s oldest populations.6\nAt the same time, Lawrence has faced major economic challenges, including the loss of\nmanufacturing jobs and disinvestment. Coming back from this is a long process that\nrequires a shared vision for progress.\n5 See Reflections on Phasing Policy Amidst (Pandemic) Uncertainty - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n(bostonfed.org)\n6 Source: U.S. Census Bureau. \"Age and Sex.\" American Community Survey, ACS 1-Year Estimates\nSubject Tables, Table S0101, 2022.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nFifteen years ago, the Boston Fed set out to understand if and how smaller cities\ncan turn their economies around after losing their manufacturing base. Researchers\nstudied 25 similar cities nationwide and found that 10 of those cities did a lot better than\ntheir peers, even if they didn’t make it all the way back to their prior economic strength.7\nWhat made these cities special? A key factor was having strong leaders who\ncollaborate across organizations and sectors on shared priorities over a long period. But\nwhy does this matter?\nWell, turning around an economy is complex and takes a long time. No single\ninstitution or leader can do all that’s needed on their own. Our smaller cities need their\ntalented leaders working together, sharing time and resources to achieve a common\ngoal. As I have already seen today during my visit, Lawrence is good at this – it is one\nof the drivers of the progress you are making here.\nWe hope the Boston Fed has been a valuable partner on this journey, which we\nhave taken with numerous other cities and towns since Lawrence became a so-called\nWorking City a decade ago. The Working Places initiative now includes 30 smaller cities\nand rural communities in five states.8\nLike Lawrence, these places were once centers of the manufacturing and natural\nresource economies in New England. As jobs disappeared in those industries, many of\nthe communities struggled to reimagine and rebuild their economies. For example,\nparticipating communities such as East Hartford, Connecticut, or Lamoille County,\nVermont, face challenges like aging housing stock and infrastructure, a dwindling tax\nbase, and often high rates of poverty.9\nWorking Places distributes relatively limited monetary awards – which are,\nimportantly, made possible by philanthropy, business, and state government. For\ninstance, at its inception, the team in Lawrence received a three-year, $700,000 grant to\n7 See Reinvigorating Springfield's Economy: Lessons from Resurgent Cities - Federal Reserve Bank of\nBoston (bostonfed.org)\n8 See Working Places - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)\n9 See The National and Regional Economy: Navigating Near-term Changes and Long-term Challenges -\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org)\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nfocus on efforts to transform local workforce supports. Since the Boston Fed created\nWorking Places, it’s been wonderful to see many of these grants followed by substantial\nprivate and public investment that has capitalized on new partnerships and created new\nhubs of economic activity.\nIndeed, there are important lessons from Working Places. One is that complex\nissues cannot be solved by one sector, one organization, or one person. Successful\ncollaboration requires attention to process and new voices at the table to expand\ninsight. It requires the flexibility to seize opportunities and change along the way –\nincluding admitting when efforts need to be rethought. A neutral, trusted intermediary\nlike the Boston Fed can help. The most successful Working Places teams have robust\ncommunity engagement, local government supporters, and an urgent shared purpose.\nLawrence is an excellent example of this work.\nThe ‘Working City’ of Lawrence – Looking Back and Looking Ahead\nIn 2014, the Lawrence community responded decisively to the Fed’s invitation to\njoin its newly launched competition. Leaders from all over – city government, nonprofits,\nthe school public department, the community college, and local firms – set out to build\non important work already underway in their city. They decided to focus on workforce\nsupport, specifically helping parents with children in the public schools find jobs with\ngreater income potential. Lawrence became a Working City because an independent\nset of experts saw that it had exceptional vision, talented leadership, and a strong team\nthat was committed to work in new ways to improve the community.\nOver three years, that team provided job training and support services for more\nthan 600 parents. It assisted 200 families with job placements – with an average wage\nincrease of 25 percent. It created new training pipelines with employers and the local\ncommunity college, and it integrated some long-term interventions into the school\nsystem, aimed at improving family well-being.\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThose leaders also became a strong team that continued to thrive and\ncollaborate with the Boston Fed after the three-year grant period ended. They worked\nwith community residents and strengthened networks of trust and collaboration that\nhave been important in the city’s responses to challenges such as the natural gas\nexplosions and pandemic.\nToday, 10 years later, the Lawrence Partnership is composed of local leaders\nspanning the business, banking, nonprofit, government, education, and healthcare\nsectors. It is united by an even broader commitment to build a dynamic local economy\nthat works for everyone in the community by helping businesses grow. Lawrence should\nbe very proud of its energetic and growing immigrant population, its vibrant small\nbusiness community, and the signs of continued growth – including the new business\nand housing construction I have seen on many corners.\nI applaud the continued collaboration and creativity of Lawrence civic and\ncommunity leaders as you address persistent challenges – and some new ones. The\nunemployment rate has been falling, but it’s not nearly as low as the state rate. The high\ncost of housing is a newer challenge for Lawrence, as it is many cities and towns across\nthe country. In my travels around the region, one of the most common issues I hear\nabout is a lack of affordable housing. Indeed, there will always be new challenges and\nsetbacks along the way.\nBut your determination, resilience, and creativity are inspiring. Your progress in\nthe face of significant odds is a promising indicator of what is to come. Thank you to all\nthe leaders and community members that work hard each day. We look forward to\ncontinuing to support and promote your efforts.\nConcluding Observations\nI’d like to thank you again for inviting me to participate in today’s celebration. It is\na pleasure to share a little bit about the work of the Federal Reserve – and why it\nmatters to important regional centers, like Lawrence. And I hope it’s clear that the work\n8\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:40 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 18, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ntaking place in Lawrence, and other communities like it, are absolutely part of our\nBank’s mission to foster a vibrant, inclusive economy.\nNew England’s economy is healthiest when it is providing opportunities for all to\nparticipate, contribute, and prosper, and not leaving some people and places behind. To\nachieve this, we need the contributions and capabilities of all communities and places\nacross the region.\nThe Lawrence Partnership continues to lead by example. You demonstrate the\npower of cross-sector collaboration and a shared vision. You should be proud of what\nyou have already accomplished. And the energy here today highlights your strong\ncommitment to continue the hard work ahead.\nThank you, and I look forward to the rest of the program. ¡Felicidades!\n9",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nSeptember 6, 2023\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nKey Takeaways\n1. Holistic Assessment: Collins reviews a wide range of information to assess the evolving\neconomy. She looks for patterns and trends showing sustained reductions in inflation, and progress\non the underlying goal of bringing demand and supply back into better balance. She notes that price\nstability is essential for a well-functioning economy and an important precondition for maximum\nemployment that is sustainable over time.\n2. Current Indications: Strong demand relative to supply has been a key factor driving higher\ninflation. While we are seeing some signs of moderation, demand continues to outpace supply,\ncreating price pressures. Core inflation shows modest and relatively recent moderation. There are\npromising developments, but given continued strength in demand, Collins’ view is that it is just too\nearly to take the recent improvements as evidence that inflation is on a sustained path back to the 2%\ntarget.\n3. Patience and Data Dependence: This phase of monetary policy calls for patience and holistic\ndata dependence. One reason is the difficulty of extracting signal from noise in the data. Another is\nincreased uncertainty about the timing and ultimate impact on the economy of policy tightening to date\n– including some reasons to expect longer lags than normal due to some unique aspects of the\npandemic recovery.\n4. Staying Resolute: Importantly, patience does not mean indecision, or a change in commitment to\nthe 2 percent target and to achieving price stability in a reasonable amount of time. Collins expects\nwe’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time. And while we may be near, or even at, the\npeak, further tightening could be warranted, depending on incoming data. We are well positioned to\nproceed patiently, carefully, yet deliberately; recognizing the risks while remaining resolute.\n5. Optimistic While Realistic: Continued restrictive monetary policy should temper demand further,\nto bring it into better balance with supply – however, Collins does not believe a significant slowdown is\nrequired. She remains realistic about the risks and uncertainties around the outlook, while optimistic\nthat price stability is achievable with an orderly slowdown and only a modest unemployment rate\nincrease – ideally preserving some of the current favorable labor market dynamics.\n6. Engagement and Collaboration: The Fed’s mandate and concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy\nlead us to study economic issues that prevent people from participating in the economy or workforce,\nas well as the gaps in wealth accumulation and prosperity. Collins will continue to prioritize hearing\nfrom those in a wide range of roles, who make up and shape our region’s economy. The Boston Fed\nwill continue working to support a vibrant, inclusive economy full of opportunity, working\ncollaboratively with organizations across the region to understand and address challenges.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to be with you, at this podium where the New\nEngland Council hosts so many distinguished leaders. I’d like to thank Jim Brett for\ninviting me, early on, to speak with you.\nI have been looking forward to this, because of my great appreciation for the\nCouncil, and its members, working to keep New England’s economy vibrant. As a\nmacroeconomist and former dean of a public policy school, I appreciate your focus on\nthe ways policymakers, and organizations across New England, can collaborate in the\npublic interest.\nI also appreciate the New England Council’s non-partisan nature, and the\nbreadth of industries and sectors you work in. This an extraordinary region, in part\nbecause of that range – and the brainpower, innovation, and character New Englanders\nbring to the table.\nMy thanks as well to Jim, for contributing his insights over many years to an\nadvisory council made up of small- and medium-sized businesses we convene at the\nFed every quarter.\nToday, I’ll start with a bit of context about our work at the Fed. Then, I’ll share\nsome of my current views on the economy and monetary policy. Finally, I’ll comment on\nsome of the challenges and opportunities ahead, and the roles the Boston Fed and\nothers can play. Then, I’ll be happy to take questions. But first, my standard disclaimer:\nThese perspectives are my own; I’m not speaking for any other Federal Reserve\npolicymakers.\nContext: Roles and Responsibilities Entrusted to the Fed\nI like to say our work at the Fed is all about supporting a vibrant, inclusive\neconomy that works for everyone, not just some people. As you know, the strength of\nan economy has many dimensions – so the Fed is involved in a number of activities, all\nin the public interest.\nBut let me underline an important distinction, which is not always well-\nunderstood. The Federal Reserve’s activities are in monetary – not fiscal – policy. At\nthe Fed, we’re entrusted with monetary policymaking – in particular, setting short-term\ninterest rates that ultimately affect the availability of money and credit for businesses\nand households. In this, we are guided by our dual mandate from Congress: stable\nprices and maximum employment. So we spend a lot of time analyzing economic\nconditions – using data, doing research, and listening to stakeholders locally and\nnationally.\nThe economy also needs reliable credit, and payment systems. The Fed is\nentrusted with responsibilities regarding the safety, soundness, and stability of the\nbanking and financial systems; and we serve as a lender of last resort to financial\ninstitutions. We also provide back-end infrastructure to the banking system and the\nU.S. Treasury, ranging from currency and coin circulation, to various ways to transfer\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nfunds electronically. For many years we have been involved in innovating to make\npayments systems more effective and efficient.\nThe Economy, the Outlook, and Monetary Policy\nI’ll turn, now, to sharing some of my current views on the economy, the outlook,\nand monetary policy. Our focus at the Fed remains bringing inflation down to our 2\npercent target.1 Price stability is essential for a well-functioning economy and an\nimportant precondition for maximum employment that is sustainable over time – so\nreducing inflation relates to both parts of our dual mandate from Congress. And I\ncontinue to hear, in travels around New England, about the toll from high inflation on\nhouseholds – especially those with lower incomes, struggling to make ends meet – and\non businesses, often as they grapple with higher costs and more complex planning and\ninvestment decisions.\nI like to give my bottom-line up front, and in my view, this phase of our policy\ncycle requires patience, and holistic data assessment, while we stay the course. I\nexpect we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time. And while we may be\nnear, or even at, the peak for policy rates, further tightening could be warranted,\ndepending on the incoming data. Patience will give us time to better separate “signal”\nfrom “noise” as we assess available data; and to balance risks, as the effects of tighter\npolicy continue to work through the economy.\nLet me briefly explain my rationale. Since I see holistic data assessment as\nparticularly important in the current context, I’ve shared a handout with some charts\nshowing just a few of the many data series I review, as part of the wide range of\ninformation I use to assess the evolving economy.\nCurrent Economic Conditions\nIn reviewing economic data, I look for patterns and trends that show both\nsustained reductions in inflation, and progress on the underlying goal of bringing\ndemand and supply back into better balance. I’ll start there, because strong demand\nrelative to supply has been a key factor driving higher inflation. While we are seeing\nsome signs of moderation, demand continues to outpace supply, creating price\npressures.\nThe black line in Figure 1 shows how the level of real GDP (or the production of\ngoods and services adjusted for inflation) has evolved relative to trend, shown by the\n1 “The FOMC judges that low and stable inflation at the rate of 2 percent per year, as measured by the annual\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent with achievement of both\nparts of the dual mandate.” https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary‐policy‐what‐are‐its‐goals‐\nhow‐does‐it‐work.htm\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ndotted line. The trend is an estimate of sustainable output for the economy over time.2\nA key takeaway is that GDP remains above trend — a sign of demand continuing to\noutstrip supply. Many forecasters expect continued above-trend growth this quarter.\nGDP growth has been supported, importantly, by resilient household consumption\nexpenditures – shown by the light blue line – which is the largest component of\naggregate demand.\nWhat about inflation, in this context of demand still outpacing supply? There are\nmany inflation indicators to watch, of course. Focusing on the Fed’s preferred\nmeasure,3 Figure 2, Panel A shows that on a year-over-year basis, total inflation (the\ndark blue line) has come down significantly from its peak but remains somewhat\nelevated. However, core inflation (the light blue line) shows considerably less progress,\nalthough with some improvement in recent months. While the core measure excludes\nthe important but volatile food and energy components, it tends to better predict future\ninflation.\nI’m showing these two panels side by side so you can see how the monthly\ninflation data – including core inflation, shown in Figure 2, Panel B – tend to be more\nvariable than measures on a year-over-year basis. This variability has increased since\nthe pandemic, a point I’ll return to in a moment, and is one reason for being patient in\nassessing the data.\nFigure 3 Panels A, B, and C show the three main components of core inflation.\nSince the components behave quite differently, looking at them separately helps to\nbetter assess price pressures. These charts include 3- , 6-, and 12- month annualized\nchanges. The shorter horizons highlight recent developments – but are typically more\nvariable, or “noisier.” Looking at multiple time horizons can help paint a fuller picture of\nhow inflation is evolving.\nPanel A shows that the moderation in core inflation has come mainly from a\nsignificant decline in the core goods sector, where the resolution of supply chain\nbottlenecks has helped to better align demand with supply. Panel B shows that shelter\ninflation, though still high, has slowed recently as well: the 3-month change is below the\n6-month. As moderation in new market rents continues to pass through, this decline will\nlikely continue. However, as shown in Panel C, core services price inflation, excluding\nshelter, has slowed only modestly so far. This component accounts for about 55\npercent of core inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE).\n2 This trend assumes real GDP growth of 1.8% per year. The shaded bar in the chart represents the pandemic\nrecession.\n3 The Personal Consumption Expenditures or PCE index.\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nSo, there are promising developments, but given the continued strength in\ndemand, my view is that it is just too early to take the recent improvements as evidence\nthat inflation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent.\nI’ll next turn briefly to the labor market. There too, demand continues to outstrip\nsupply overall – a very familiar refrain in much of New England and across the country,\nfor some time now – but we are seeing evidence of improved alignment. Panel A of\nFigure 4 shows that payroll employment continues to grow above trend, but has been\nslowing. Lower voluntary quits and lower, though still high, job vacancies (not shown)\nare also consistent with a cooling but resilient labor market.\nOn the labor supply side, we’ve seen some recent increases in labor force\nparticipation, especially for prime-age workers (those aged 25-54) as shown in Panel B.\nIt is encouraging that more people are entering the labor force, which is the reason why\nthe unemployment rate ticked up to 3.8 percent in August — notably, a level that is still\nvery low by historical standards.\nI also review disaggregated labor market data, recognizing that aggregate\nnumbers do not show the wide range of experiences across groups of people, sectors,\nand places. For example, Figure 5 shows the persistent disparities in unemployment –\nfor different racial and ethnic groups in panel A, and for people with different education\nlevels in panel B. I’ll have more to say about such disparities, in a moment.\nOverall, then, rebalancing demand and supply in the labor market has some way\nto go. In particular, Figure 6 shows wage inflation, measured here by the Employment\nCost Index or ECI on a quarterly and yearly basis. Wage growth remains elevated in\nthe current high inflation environment. Recognizing that workers benefit from increases\nin their real wages, or purchasing power, I look forward to returning to an environment\nwith wage growth consistent with the 2 percent inflation target.4\nContinued restrictive monetary policy should temper demand further to bring it\ninto better balance with supply – however, importantly, I do not believe a significant\nslowdown is required. I have described myself for some time as a “realistic optimist” –\nrealistic about the risks and uncertainties around a baseline outlook, while optimistic\nbecause the resilience I see leads me to believe price stability is achievable with an\norderly slowdown and only a modest unemployment rate increase – ideally preserving\nsome of the favorable labor supply dynamics.\nMonetary Policy Lags and My Outlook\nI’ll shift now to a brief assessment of the impact of monetary policy actions to\ndate, and my outlook.\n4 Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has noted, “To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing. But for wage growth to\nbe sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.” (see\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20221130a.htm).\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nAs Figure 7 shows, starting in March 2022, we raised the federal funds rate\ntarget by five and a quarter percentage points in just 18 months, the fastest policy rate\nincrease in 40 years. While the effects of higher interest rates were almost immediately\nevident in the housing sector, they have been slower to show through to broader\nindicators of activity, such as GDP and labor market statistics.\nTypically, monetary policy actions are estimated to meaningfully affect broader\nmeasures of economic activity with a lag of four to six quarters.5 But there is\nconsiderable variation around this estimate, and special factors in the pandemic\nrecovery are likely making these lags longer than usual.\nIn particular, policy tightening has occurred amidst sound business and\nhousehold fundamentals, compared to previous hiking cycles – likely implying a longer\ntime for tighter credit conditions to work through the economy. For example, many firms\nhad refinanced when interest rates were very low, somewhat insulating their investment\nplans from higher rates. And households that accumulated excess savings during the\npandemic have needed to borrow less than usual so far, to finance expenditures.\nSo monetary policy may take longer than normal to affect the broader economy.\nBut given that policy is clearly in restrictive territory, I do expect to see slowing growth\nby the end of this year and throughout 2024. And there are already some signs\nconsistent with this outlook. Firms’ cash levels are returning to pre-pandemic trends,\nand households’ excess savings are declining.6 Demand should slow as spending\nbecomes more interest sensitive.\nThe goal is an orderly slowdown that better aligns demand with supply, which is\nessential to ensure that inflation is on a sustainable trajectory back to target.\nImplications for Monetary Policy in an Uncertain Environment\nI’ll conclude my discussion of the economy by highlighting some considerations\nthat underpin my outlook. The economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic and\nrecovery have been, and continue to be, highly unusual, with implications for monetary\npolicy. This complex topic is likely to be a long-term focus for analysis and research.\nI’ve flagged two key dimensions: First, we’re in a period where it is difficult to\nextract the signal from the noise in the data. As I noted, some data, such as monthly\n5 These lags appear in various estimates of the effects of monetary policy, for instance those surveyed by Ramey\n(Ramey, V.A., 2016; \"Macroeconomic Shocks and Their Propagation,\" in: J. B. Taylor & Harald Uhlig [ed.],\nHandbook of Macroeconomics, edition 1, volume 2, chapter 2, pages 71‐162, Elsevier). A more recent study\nconfirming significant lags in the effects is Romer and Romer (Christina D. Romer & David H. Romer, 2023; \"Does\nMonetary Policy Matter? The Narrative Approach after 35 Years,\" NBER Working Papers 31170, National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, Inc.).\n6 Some households, including those at the lower end of the income distribution, have likely already depleted any\nexcess savings.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nPCE inflation, are unusually volatile.7 Second, there is increased uncertainty about the\ntiming and ultimate impact on the economy from policy tightening to date. Reasons\ninclude the unusually sound initial business and household fundamentals, and the\nunusually rapid initial pace of tightening.\nThe risk of inflation staying higher for longer must now be weighed against the\nrisk that an overly restrictive stance of monetary policy will lead to a greater slowdown in\nactivity than is needed to restore price stability. This context calls for a patient and\ncareful, but deliberate, approach to policy, allowing time to assess the effects of policy\nactions to date, and then acting appropriately. Importantly, patience does not mean\nindecision, or a change in the commitment to the 2 percent target, but rather time to\nensure that the economy is on a clear trajectory to achieve price stability.\nOverall, we are well positioned to proceed cautiously in this uncertain economic\nenvironment, recognizing the risks while remaining resolute and data-dependent, with\nthe flexibility to adjust as conditions warrant.\nA Vibrant, Inclusive Economy\nI started with comments about the strengths of New England. I’d like to close by\nalluding to some of the challenges I hear about, too – and some of the things\norganizations like yours, and mine, are doing about them.\nThe privilege and responsibility of policymaking make engagement with\nstakeholders essential. So I will continue to prioritize taking cross-sector visits to each\nNew England state, and hearing from those in a wide range of roles, who make up and\nshape our region’s economy (see Figure 8).\nAgain, our domain at the Fed is monetary, not fiscal, policy. But our mandate\nand our concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy bring our focus to the challenges that\nprevent people from participating in the economy or the workforce – real economic\nissues like childcare, housing, climate, and infrastructure, such as transportation and\nbroadband. And like many of you, we worry about the gaps in wealth accumulation and\nprosperity by group and place.8\n7 Month‐to‐month consumer spending patterns have also been somewhat unusual and continue to evolve,\ncomplicating seasonal adjustment.\n8 The Boston Fed has a decades‐long history of studying wealth disparities for groups and places. We believe\nbetter understanding these gaps can expand opportunities, making them more equitably available, help bring\nmore people into the workforce, and strengthen economic growth and competitiveness. A healthy economy\nneeds the best ideas, energy, and participation from everyone – with the opportunity to work hard, contribute,\nand prosper. In this context, the Boston Fed ‐ working with community partners ‐ recently launched a multi‐year\nresearch initiative to explore wealth disparities in Greater Boston and across Massachusetts. Initial priorities for\nthis work include measuring family wealth and exploring wealth differences between racial‐ethnic groups and\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThese are very real challenges. But I remain optimistic about what we all,\ntogether, can accomplish when we care, collaborate, study, and act. Here are a few\nexamples.\nMany parts of New England that were once centers for manufacturing or natural\nresources have faced long-term challenges. Our Working Places initiative, started in\n2014 under my predecessor Eric Rosengren, is based on research showing that an\nessential element of place-based economic resurgence is local, cross-sector\ncollaboration. Now in 30 communities across 5 states, teams of local leaders choose a\nshared goal for improving the economy that benefits low-income people, and then\ndevelop and implement strategies. The Fed hosts, convenes, and supports these\nefforts – but not financially. The real work is in local ingenuity and commitment.9\nLack of affordable childcare is a very real economic issue across New England\nand nationally. Childcare gives options to parents who want or need to participate in the\nworkforce. As an outgrowth of our Working Places effort, a team in Fitchburg has\nimplemented a bilingual childcare entrepreneur training program to help support\nindividuals in opening up their own small businesses in childcare. It has 80 graduates\nand just started its fifth cohort.10\nClimate change is on many business and government leaders’ minds, and the\nFed’s responsibilities make it important and prudent for us to study the issues. For\nexample, our recent research examines potential costs related to climate change for\nMassachusetts cities and towns – and ultimately taxpayers. We find that per capita\nlocal spending could grow significantly in the decades ahead, with hotter and stormier\nweather increasing the cost of public works, government administration, operation of\nschools, and other public services.11\nLast but not least, I mentioned earlier the Fed’s work on payments. It wasn’t that\nlong ago that paper checks had to be flown around the country to settle at the bank they\nwere drawn on – a slow, costly necessity. The Boston Fed and others helped pioneer\ndigital check imaging, and expanded automated clearing – and more recently, creation\nof an entirely new instant-payments infrastructure to help banks of all sizes meet\nacross geographies. We want to better understand why certain disparities persist, and hope the findings will be\nused by a broad group of public, private, and nonprofit organizations to develop solutions.\n9 Learn more about Working Places at https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx\n10 Learn more at https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces/news/2022/tackling‐the‐child‐care‐crisis‐lele‐\nteammates‐see‐child‐care‐training‐need‐fill‐it.aspx. And similarly, the Waterbury, Connecticut Working Places\nteam has provided training for residents looking to open licensed, home‐based childcare facilities, opening 15 new\nfacilities so far. The vision and effort is local, but organizations like ours can help spark or support the progress.\n11 See the summary by Larry Bean and the study by Bo Zhao: https://www.bostonfed.org/news‐and‐\nevents/news/2023/01/price‐tag‐on‐climate‐change‐bo‐zhao‐report‐boston‐fed‐massachusetts.aspx\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, September 6, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ncustomer needs. In July, we launched the FedNow instant payments service – and the\nnational program leader is the Boston Fed’s C.O.O., Ken Montgomery.12\nConcluding Observations\nAcross New England, I hear that people from all sectors want to collaborate and\nwork together to solve problems like these. Efforts large and small, in combination, can\nmake a real difference.\nWe will continue, at the Boston Fed, working to serve the public interest and\nsupport a vibrant, inclusive economy full of opportunity. It is a privilege and a\nresponsibility, and we look forward to collaborating with many of you, to help the region\nthrive.\nThank you for having me join you today.\n12 See the announcement at https://www.frbservices.org/news/press‐releases/072023‐fednow‐live‐\nannouncement\n8",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nJuly 15, 2025\nWashington, D.C.\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, July 15, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nMany thanks, Emily, for the kind introduction. It is a pleasure to be here with all of\nyou, and with those who are joining online. I am really delighted to participate in the 2025\nNABE Seminar on Economic Measurement.1\nThis is a topic I have cared deeply about for a long time. Early on, opportunities to\nuse data to illuminate important ideas helped spur my interest in economics – and data\nanalysis was one of the most fun parts of my economics education. I continue to enjoy\nlearning about new approaches and methods for using different types of data to measure\neconomic activity. And I see programs dedicated to economic measurement, like this one,\nas very important.\nA mindset focused on data and rigorous empirical analysis has been invaluable\nthroughout my professional career. It has played a role in my research, my teaching, and\nmy data-based approach to decision-making in administrative and leadership positions.\nMost recently, the use of economic data has been critically important in my role as\nPresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, where I participate on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) – the monetary policymaking body of our nation’s central bank.\nThe Federal Reserve is highly data-intensive and data-focused, and I truly appreciate being\npart of an organization rooted in reliance on data, facts, and empirical analysis, without\npre-conceived biases.\nIn my remarks today, I’ll first briefly mention the importance of timely, reliable data\nof various types for monetary policymaking. I’ll then spend most of my time discussing\nsome of the ways I use economic data in practice. My goal is to give you a “look under the\nhood” at how data and analytics underpin my willingness to make statements like “the\neconomy is in a good place overall,” or “wage growth is not a significant source of\ninflationary pressure.”\nBut first, my standard disclaimer. These remarks are my own, and may not reflect\nthe views of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or other Reserve\nBanks.\n1 https://nabe.com/ems2025\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, July 15, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nA Broad Array of Timely, Reliable Data is Essential for Monetary Policymaking\nHigh quality, timely data are essential for developing an accurate assessment of\ncurrent economic conditions and a well-informed economic outlook.2 Having and studying\nthis information puts the FOMC in the best position to conduct monetary policy that fulfills\nour dual mandate from Congress. Furthermore, accurate data help Committee members\nexplain monetary policy decisions with clarity and credibility.\nWhile the Fed’s mandate focuses explicitly on maximum employment and stable\nprices, the economy is highly interconnected, so assessing the labor market and inflation\nrequires a broad understanding of economic conditions. In addition, the FOMC sets policy\nbased on where the economy is heading, not just on its current state, for at least two\nreasons. First, monetary policy (think changes in the federal funds rate) works with a lag –\nmeaning actions taken today will influence the economy over the medium run. Second, our\nmandate is not for “point-in-time” outcomes. Rather, the FOMC seeks to maintain price\nstability and maximum employment over time, sustaining conditions for a vibrant economy\nthat enables households, firms, and communities to thrive long term.\nAs a result, monetary policymakers sift through a very broad array of data to gain\ninsight into the many factors and economic relationships that determine the evolution of\neconomic activity. We use statistical and anecdotal information that spans domestic,\ninternational, and financial developments.\nThe data we rely on are produced by a variety of sources. I’ll highlight the important\nnetwork of U.S. statistical agencies, including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bureau\nof Labor Statistics, and the Census Bureau. The Federal Reserve also produces key data\nseries. In particular, the Board of Governors provides a significant amount of financial data,\nespecially on financial flows in the economy. It is important to recognize the sophistication\nbehind all these data, and the continuing efforts of agencies and bureaus to improve them\nwith limited resources.\nData from official agencies are supplemented by a vast array of complementary\ninformation from surveys, and other data produced by public and private sources. Also, the\nqualitative information we gain from speaking with regional business, labor, and\ncommunity contacts provides invaluable perspectives about both current conditions and\nthe outlook, as well as long-term opportunities and challenges.\n2 High quality data are foundational for a well-functioning economy more broadly, not just for\npolicymakers. Importantly, they help households and firms to make well-informed decisions.\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, July 15, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nCasting a wide net with data is particularly helpful when the economic landscape\nchanges in ways that make its evolution more difficult to predict.3 Indeed, the economy\ncontinues to evolve, for example, from changes in global supply, tariff increases, and the\nadoption of AI. As a result, policymakers need to make effective use of information that can\nprovide insight into this new environment. I’ll note that technology, such as web-scraping\nand natural language processing, is playing a key role in the growing availability and\nanalysis of such data.4\nI’ll end this segment by stressing that all data we use have strengths as well as\nlimitations. So, we rely on internal and external experts, who understand that the details\nmatter when it comes to how data are constructed. This helps us separate “the signal from\nthe noise” inherent in any individual piece of data. Combined with a holistic approach that\nweaves together complementary types of information, this increases our confidence in the\nassessment of current economic conditions and the outlook.\nUsing Information, in Practice, to Assess Economic Conditions\nIn the rest of my remarks, I’ll provide some examples of how the constellation of\ninformation comes into play for me, in practice, as an economist and policymaker. I’ll start\nwith data’s role in my assessment of current economic conditions and then turn to data’s\nrole in my outlook and the implications for policy. 5\nI like to share my bottom line up front. In my view, the economy continues to be in a\ngood place overall, close to the Congressionally mandated objectives of price stability and\nfull employment. However, going forward, I expect to see some upward pressures on\ninflation, as well as some downward pressures on employment and economic growth.\nThese assessments come from examining an extensive range of data types from a variety of\nsources. The figures I’ll refer to highlight a few of these.\n3 For example, policymakers relied on a variety of non-traditional data to gauge rapidly changing\neconomic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This included high frequency credit card spending\ndata, and mobility statistics across various locations.\n4 The ability to field surveys of consumers and firms with increased frequency and broader reach – such\nas related to price expectations, hiring intentions, and even technology adoption – may prove particularly\nvaluable.\n5 For a recent summary of my views on economic conditions, the outlook and the implications for policy,\nsee Perspectives on the Economy from Susan M. Collins - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, July 15, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nWhile most of my examples focus on quantitative indicators, I want to emphasize\nthat the qualitative information I gather from on-going discussions with a wide range of\nstakeholders throughout New England (the Boston Fed’s District) are also very important\nfor my understanding of how the economy is evolving, given what people and organizations\ntell me they are experiencing, and expect going forward.6 You can see some examples of a\nfew of these outreach discussions, in my first slide.\nSo, what data are behind my assessment that the economy is in a good place\noverall? Beginning with price stability, the blue line in Figure 1 shows the behavior of (total\nor “headline”) inflation, based on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price\nindex — the Fed’s preferred measure of the general price level. The red line is “core”\ninflation, which excludes the volatile, though obviously important, categories of food and\nenergy and is helpful for assessing underlying inflation trends. Clearly there has been\nsignificant progress, albeit slow and uneven, toward the Fed’s 2 percent target for headline\nPCE inflation — the green line.\nFigure 2 breaks down core PCE inflation into its three main components – core\ngoods inflation, shelter (or housing) inflation, and core services inflation (excluding\nhousing). Because the sources of inflationary pressures may differ to some extent across\nsectors, I have found this decomposition very informative for understanding underlying\ninflationary trends. The panels show both 12-month measures (in blue) and the noisier,\nthough timelier, 3-month measures (in red).\nCore goods inflation, in panel A, was the first component to decline as supply\nchains normalized after the pandemic disruptions. But it has picked up some, recently, and\nis currently running above the rates that prevailed before the pandemic. Some of these\nrecent movements in goods inflation are likely tariff-related, a topic I will return to later.\nCore services inflation, including both housing and non-housing components, has\ndeclined more slowly. But as shown in panels B and C, services inflation has continued to\nmoderate, especially on a 12-month basis, despite continued unevenness. This\nmoderation reflects a more balanced labor market, with demand for workers no longer\noutstripping supply, as occurred coming out of the pandemic.7\n6 For some examples of what I learn, see the summaries from my recent trips through New England’s six\nstates: In the Region - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, July 15, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nFigure 3 shows the recent evolution of the unemployment rate. After bottoming out\nat 3.5 percent in early 2023 – when labor market conditions were especially tight –\nunemployment has increased some, but remained just above 4 percent for the past year,\nstill low by historical standards.\nThis normalization of the unemployment rate has been accompanied by a\nmoderation in wage inflation, as illustrated in Figure 4, which depicts measures of wage\ninflation from two different sources. The blue line shows an official measure of labor\ncompensation, the Employment Cost Index or ECI. The red line shows a relatively new\nmeasure of wage growth based on job postings from Indeed. This is one of many examples\nwhere I find it illuminating to consider multiple indicators of an economic variable to gain a\nfuller picture.\nThe ECI is a comprehensive measure that includes all employee compensation. It is\nwell suited for assessing wage pressures because it is not affected by changes in labor\nforce composition. The Indeed data are less comprehensive, but useful since they capture\nwages earned by people seeking new jobs. Because wages of existing employees tend to\nlag those of new hires, the Indeed data provide a more timely and forward-looking\nassessment of wage pressures in the labor market.\nBroadly speaking, both wage measures suggest that the labor market is no longer a\nsignificant source of price pressures (inflation). However, the ECI remains a bit above pre-\npandemic levels. This may reflect some residual catching up of existing workers’ wages to\nthe wages of new hires, which grew much faster during the pandemic recovery. One of the\nthings I consider when formulating my inflation outlook is whether there is evidence of new\nprice pressures – or if elevated inflation primarily reflects past shocks that are still working\ntheir way through the economy. In my view, parsing out the effects of new versus past\nshocks has been especially relevant for assessing wage pressures, as well as pressures in\nthe housing rental market.\nMy judgement that the labor market is no longer a significant source of price\npressures is also importantly influenced by the recent evolution of labor productivity –\nsince productivity is key to lasting, non-inflationary wage gains. Here, I take a somewhat\nlonger-term perspective by considering 8-quarter annualized changes in an economy-wide\nmeasure of output per hour, shown in the left panel of Figure 5. I could say much more\n7 Indeed, labor is an important input in the non-housing services sector while rents partly depend on the\nstrength of employment conditions. A hot labor market tends to increase both components of services\ninflation.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, July 15, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nabout productivity trends both during the pandemic and since. But in the interest of time,\nI’ll simply note that recent productivity growth has exceeded its pre-pandemic rate.\nImportantly, the right-hand panel of Figure 5 shows that, when adjusted for\nproductivity, the pace of ECI growth has been running around 2 percent recently, which is\nconsistent with the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target. Therefore, even though some indicators\nshow wages still rising somewhat faster than before the pandemic, given recent\nproductivity developments, I do not see wage growth as placing additional pressure on\ninflation. 8\nA host of other data corroborate that the labor market is now more in balance –\ngenerally healthy, though with some signs of labor demand moderating. Here, I will\nhighlight analysis by my staff using information provided by innovative natural language\nmethods. Specifically, this work exploits data on the required years of experience from\nonline job postings, over time.\nFigure 6 shows the results of this exercise. The right-hand panel provides the range\nof years of needed experience for jobs requiring at least a bachelor’s degree, while the\nrange for jobs requiring less education is shown on the left. In each panel, the blue lines\nplot the midpoint of the range, while the red dashed lines show the minimum and\nmaximum values over time.\nThis figure highlights a recent rise in the required years of experience, especially for\njobs needing more education. This evidence of tightening job requirements is consistent\nwith firms becoming somewhat more cautious and selective in their hiring.9\nSo far, the moderation in labor demand has not placed significant upward pressure\non the unemployment rate. This likely reflects, in part, slower growth in labor supply from\nreduced immigration. While it is challenging for official economic statistics to fully capture\nimmigration flows in real time, alternative data sources can provide helpful insight. For\nexample, my staff monitors the pipeline of work-permit approvals, to help gauge the\n8Work by my staff shows that labor remains relatively inexpensive, given recent productivity gains and\nprice developments. See Garga, Vaishali, Giovanni Olivei, and Chistina Wang, 2024, “Productivity\nImprovements and Markup Normalization Can Support Further Wage Gains without Inflationary\nPressures,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Current Policy Perspectives 24-5; and Andrade, Philippe,\nFalk Bräuning, José L. Fillat, and Gustavo Joaquim, 2024, “Is Post-pandemic Wage Growth Fueling\nInflation?” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Current Policy Perspectives 24-1.\n9 It is also consistent with other labor market trends such as the recent increase in unemployment\nduration for young college graduates.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, July 15, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nnumber of immigrants entering the labor force. Tracking these data will likely remain useful\nas immigration continues to slow.10\nWith moderating inflation and a still-healthy labor market, households’ purchasing\npower remains relatively strong. This is reflected in GDP and consumption growth that are\nstill solid, as illustrated in Figure 7.\nI hope that this discussion has illuminated the data-driven nature of my conclusion\nthat overall, current economic conditions remain relatively strong and resilient.\nUsing Information in Practice – for my Outlook, and Making Monetary Policy\nI’ll now turn from current economic conditions to the outlook, which is clouded by\nsignificant uncertainty. Indeed, it seems likely that the economy will move away, at least\ntemporarily, from the favorable conditions I have just described. Tariff policy is the main\ndriver, with higher broad-based tariffs than last year likely leading to a rise in inflation,\nhigher unemployment, and slower GDP growth.11\nHowever, the quantitative effects of higher tariffs are much more uncertain than\ntheir qualitative impact. The ultimate size of the levies and the particular goods affected\nwill, of course, be an important determinant – but those underlying details remain unclear.\nMy staff has developed a new methodology that quantifies how price increases at\nthe U.S. border transmit to domestic consumer prices. This methodology not only\naccounts for the effect of tariffs on directly consumed imported goods, but also for the\neffect of tariffs on imported intermediate goods used in domestic production. These\nintermediate goods eventually contribute to the import content of many goods and\nservices – not just for goods such as motor vehicles, but also for things like hospital\nservices, which are not typically top of mind when discussing tariffs.12\n10 See, for example, Foote, Christopher, 2024, “Quantifying the Recent Immigration Surge: Evidence from\nWork-permit Applications,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Research Department Working Papers No.\n24-15.\n11 I do not discuss here the potential effects of other policy changes (such as fiscal, immigration, or\nregulatory policy) or geopolitical developments.\n12 Leveraging a vast amount of official statistics, including input-output data from the National Income and\nProduct Accounts (NIPA), this analysis highlights that imported intermediates account for a significant\nshare of the overall import content of final consumer goods and services. In particular, they account for\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, July 15, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nFigure 8 reports both direct and intermediate imports by country of origin, as a\nshare of personal consumption expenditures, excluding food and energy. While this\ninformation is crucial to understanding the effect of tariffs on prices, their ultimate impact\nwill also depend on the degree to which firms pass their increased costs on to consumers.\nBusiness surveys, along with analysis of firms’ earnings calls and daily tracking of price\ndata at large retailers, are being used to better understand firms’ pricing intentions and\nactions.13\nFigure 9 provides one example. It is based on special questions added to the\nInstitute for Supply Management’s (ISM’s) spring semi-annual report,14 which asked firms\nhow they intend to adjust their prices in response to tariffs. The answers suggest that most\nplan to pass along some – even if not necessarily all – of the tariff costs.\nThe possibility that firms will absorb at least part of the levies by reducing their profit\nmargins depends also on the state of their balance sheets. Here, financial data provide\nimportant insight. Broadly speaking, firms’ financial positions remain healthy, with elevated\nprofit margins – suggesting that overall, firms are in a reasonably good place to bear some\nof the increased costs from tariffs.\nDetermining how much demand may slow from tariffs is also important, and here\nhouseholds’ financial conditions are particularly relevant. In this regard, I’ll note that\nhouseholds’ balance sheets also remain healthy overall, as evidenced by household net\nworth, which as a percentage of disposable income remains high by historical standards.\nThis suggests that a typical household has the resources to at least partly offset a tariff-\ninduced loss in purchasing power. Of course, the aggregate data often mask substantial\ndifferences across firms and households.\nIn all, financial data point to the possibility that the impact of tariffs may be\nlessened somewhat by an ability for firms to decrease profit margins and for consumers to\nroughly half or more of U.S. imports from many countries, including large trading partners like Mexico and\nCanada. For more details, see, Barbiero, Omar and Hillary Stein, 2025, “The Impact of Tariffs on\nInflation,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Current Policy Perspectives 25-2.\n13 See, for example, Cavallo, Alberto, Paola Llamas, and Franco Vazquez, 2025, “Tracking the Short-Run\nPrice Impact of U.S. Tariffs.”\n14 The survey underlying the report was conducted in April and May. For more details see:\nhttps://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/reports/semi-annual-economic-\nforecast/2025/spring/\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:45 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, July 15, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ncontinue spending, despite higher prices. As a result, the adverse impact of tariffs on labor\nmarket conditions and economic growth may be more limited.\nClearly, uncertainty remains elevated. Pulling together the many types of data and\nanalyses my staff and I examine, my expectation is that tariffs will boost inflation over the\nsecond half of this year. While the extent of the increase remains uncertain, it seems likely\nthat core PCE inflation will be in the vicinity of 3 percent by year’s end, before resuming its\ndecline. Concerning the labor market side of our mandate, tariffs should slow demand and\nhiring, though not necessarily by a large amount.\nOf course, there are risks to this baseline outlook, and I do not rule out scenarios\nwith larger or more persistent effects from tariffs and ongoing economic uncertainty, as\nwell as scenarios in which the effects are more muted. Calibrating appropriate policy in\nthis context is challenging. However, continued overall solid economic conditions enable\nthe Fed to take the time to carefully assess the wide range of incoming data. Thus, in my\nview, an “actively patient” approach to monetary policy remains appropriate at this time.\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, thank you for the opportunity to share my perspective, and some\nexamples from my own experience. In has been a pleasure being with you to discuss why\nhigh-quality data are so important for effective policymaking; and how I (and other\npolicymakers) use many types of data to assess economic and financial conditions, the\noutlook, and implications for appropriate monetary policy.\nLet me end by conveying my very best wishes to each of you, as you continue to\nfocus on economic measurement through seminars such as this one, and in your careers.\nThank you, and now I look forward to the conversation with Emily.\n8",

    "text": "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nRemarks to the Economic Club\nof New York:\n“The Importanc e of a Patient,\nMethodical, and Holistic Approach\nto Monetary Policy”\nSusan M. Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nApril 11, 2024\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nKey Takeaways\n1. Collins expects inflation to return to 2% while the job market stays strong.\nCollins is committed to returning inflation to the Fed’s 2 percent target and expects this process to\nunfold over time, with the labor market remaining healthy. She notes that risks to the economy are\ntwo-sided (risks from cutting rates prematurely, as well as from waiting too long).\n2. Collins continues to expect it will be appropriate to begin easing policy later this year,\nbut more time is needed to gather information instilling greater confidence that progress\nwill continue.\nPolicy decisions must be based on holistic data assessment, and the risks and uncertainties\nremain elevated. It may take longer to discern whether the economy is sustainably on a path back\nto 2 percent inflation, and thus less easing of policy this year than previously thought may be\nwarranted. Monetary policy is currently well positioned for the requisite patient, methodical\napproach, and to manage the risks.\n3. Supply improvements have so far played a key role in rebalancing the post-pandemic\neconomy.\nImproved supply chains, increased productivity, and growth in labor supply have resulted in\nbetter-than-anticipated outcomes in 2023. But we cannot count on these improvements to\ncontinue at the same pace, and demand growth will need to moderate to achieve further progress\non inflation.\n4. The lower risk that conditions are overly tight supports taking a more patient approach\nto deciding when to ease.\nEconomic activity has remained robust despite high interest rates. While this resilience is good\nnews, it raises questions about the restrictiveness of the policy stance and broader financial\nconditions. In this context and with less sign of labor market fragility, Collins believes there are\nnow fewer concerns about policy remaining too restrictive in the near-term.\n5. Recent data haven’t changed the outlook, but suggest patience rather than urgency.\nData highlight the likelihood that disinflation will continue to be uneven. We should not be\nsurprised by some higher inflation readings after the low numbers in the second half of 2023.\nWhile expecting all indicators to be well aligned is too high a bar, further signs of progress\ntowards the 2 percent inflation target will be necessary.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIt is a pleasure to be at the Economic Club of New York – and to be back in the\ncity where I grew up. I want to thank my Federal Reserve colleague – your board chair,\nJohn Williams – for the suggestion to join you. My thanks as well to club president\nBarbara Van Allen and her team, and to Abby Joseph Cohen for moderating the\ndiscussion after my remarks.\nI want to commend the Club for providing an important forum to present views\nand analysis and discuss complex matters – in a setting that is nonpolitical and\nnonpartisan. Thoughtful engagement is essential – thank you for nurturing it.\nIt is important for policymakers to rigorously study data, for empirical insights –\nand to engage widely, explain what we are doing and why, and share perspectives.\nThis is a key reason I am here today and, also, why I reach out to stakeholders across\nthe economy, learning more about their economic conditions, challenges, and\nopportunities.\nToday I’d like to share my perspectives on the U.S. economy and monetary\npolicy, as we at the Fed work to achieve our mandates from Congress and, as I like to\nsay, support a vibrant economy that works for all. Of course, my comments reflect my\nown views, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nIn my remarks today, I’ll start with an overview, briefly discuss some supply- and\ndemand-side aspects of the economy, and end with comments about my outlook and\nmonetary policy.\nOverview\nBy way of overview, my read of the economic data supports my continued stance\nas a “realistic optimist.” By this, I mean I expect to see further evidence that inflation is\ndurably, if unevenly, returning toward 2 percent, and that the economy is coming into\nbetter balance, with demand and supply more closely aligned amid a healthy labor\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nmarket. As a result, I do expect it will be appropriate to begin lowering the federal funds\nrate later this year.\nHowever, in addition to that optimism, I am also realistic – about risks and\nuncertainties, which remain elevated. Recent data suggest it may take more time than I\nhad previously thought to gain greater confidence in inflation’s downward trajectory,\nbefore beginning to ease policy. A patient, methodical, and holistic approach is required.\nI see the current stance of policy as well positioned to balance the risks, which are two-\nsided – meaning, there is risk of easing too quickly, interrupting inflation’s return to\ntarget; and, on the other hand, risk of staying restrictive too long, causing a more-than-\nnecessary slowdown.\nA striking feature of 2023 was that inflation declined significantly, as many\nexpected – but instead of the widely forecast growth slowdown, the economy expanded\nrobustly.1 Along with the decline in inflation, we saw continued, well-anchored long-run\ninflation expectations, and a decrease in short-run inflation expectations to levels\nconsistent with the 2 percent target. Furthermore, when inflation is high, price changes\nacross sectors tend to become quite similar. In another welcome development, sectoral\nprice changes showed much less synchronicity in 2023 than they had in 2021 and\n2022.2\nStrong economic activity combined with moderate inflation points to the key role\nof supply improvements in helping to rebalance the post-pandemic economy. Such\nimprovements are very good news – but as I’ll discuss, the extent to which they will\n1 GDP growth in 2023, at 3.1 percent on a Q4-over-Q4 basis, was considerably stronger than most\nforecasters expected at the end of 2022. In addition, the Q4-over-Q4 core PCE inflation reading at 3.2\npercent was roughly 2 percentage points lower than at the end of 2022.\n2 For more details about sectoral price-change synchronicity, see Claudio Borio, Marco Lombardi, James\nYetman, and Egon Zakrajšek, 2023, “The Two-Regime View of Inflation,” BIS Papers No. 133,\nhttps://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap133.pdf.\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ncontinue is unclear. This adds to the list of uncertainties that are relevant in assessing\nthe data and evaluating the outlook.3\nIn addition to increased supply, demand has remained robust – despite higher\ninterest rates. Without ongoing supply improvements, we risk demand continuing to\noutpace supply and exacerbating pressure on prices. This implies that demand will\nneed to moderate for the Fed to achieve its price-stability goal. So, while resilient\nactivity is good news, it also raises questions about the extent to which the stance of\nmonetary policy is actually restraining demand.\nSupply Developments\nRegarding supply, some of the improvements last year were expected. Most\nnotably, we saw the unwinding of the pandemic supply-chain bottlenecks, which\ncontributed to a significant decline in core goods inflation – now back within its pre-\npandemic range. Improvements in labor productivity and labor supply were more\nsurprising.\nThe recent acceleration in labor productivity is still evolving. It could partly reflect\nfirms’ need to find efficiencies, given labor shortages and rising costs.4 Improved labor\nproductivity could also partly reflect gains from labor market reallocation earlier in the\nrecovery, when strong labor demand let many workers change jobs, likely improving\nemployment matches overall.\n3 For more on managing uncertainties in policymaking, see Susan M. Collins, 2023, “Reflections on\nPhasing Policy Amidst (Pandemic) Uncertainty,” 2023 Goldman Lecture in Economics at Wellesley\nCollege, October 11, https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/speeches/2023/reflections-on-phasing-\npolicy-amidst-pandemic-uncertainty.aspx.\n4 From 2019:Q4 to 2023:Q4, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate\nof about 1.6 percent, on average, roughly the pace of growth prevailing before the pandemic and going\nback to 2006. This improvement has occurred despite challenges to firms from severe supply-chain\ndisruptions and high job turnover rates. Moreover, by 2023:Q4, labor productivity accelerated to 2.6\npercent on a year-over-year basis, possibly reflecting some catch-up, and likely also ongoing changes in\nhow firms do business.\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nHigher labor force participation among prime-age workers was another welcome\nsurprise. It recovered notably – especially for women, despite continued challenges with\nthe supply of childcare.5\nI will also note that, so far, the robust labor market has allowed for remarkably\ninclusive outcomes by historical standards, with employment gains spread across racial\nand ethnic groups. This represents important progress towards a more broad-based\nnotion of “full employment.”6\nIn addition, increased immigration has expanded the labor supply – by more than\npreviously thought.7 With a larger population, the pace of monthly payroll growth\nconsistent with a stable unemployment rate is likely much faster than before the\npandemic.8\nWhile I certainly hope to see further improvements in aggregate supply, there is\nconsiderable uncertainty around whether these changes will continue at a pace or scale\nthat supports the rebalancing needed to achieve price stability.9 But to be clear, while\n5 As of March 2024, the 12-month average prime-age participation rate for men was essentially the same\nas before the pandemic (in February 2020), while the rate for prime-age women had surpassed its pre-\npandemic level by a noticeable margin.\n6 See the presentation by Cecilia Rouse at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s 67th Economic\nConference in November 2023, available at https://youtu.be/inRU_TPE3z4. Conference materials can be\nfound at https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/events/economic-research-conference-\nseries/rethinking-full-employment.\n7 Higher immigration could help reconcile the large difference in job creation as measured in the\nestablishment and household surveys. Indeed, the household survey may be slow to capture changes in\nmigration from abroad – a sampling challenge that is less acute in the establishment survey. For more on\nthis topic, see Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson, 2024, “New Immigration Estimates Help Make Sense\nof the Pace of Employment,” Hamilton Project at Brookings Institution,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-immigration-estimates-help-make-sense-of-the-pace-of-\nemployment/.\n8 The upward revision to population growth also allays some concerns that the establishment survey\nmight be portraying an overly optimistic picture of the labor market and, by extension, of economic\nactivity.\n9 There are a number of reasons for this uncertainty. We may already have seen most of the benefits\nfrom resolution of global supply-chain bottlenecks. (It is possible that the tragic accident that led to the\ncollapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and the partial closure of the Port of Baltimore may impact\nregional and national supply chains, but it is too soon to tell what that may imply for future price\ndevelopments.) It is unclear whether the recent growth of labor productivity can be sustained.\nImmigration flows are difficult to predict. And we cannot count on additional increases in native-born labor\nsupply, though there could be scope for some older workers to remain in or reenter the workforce.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nthe economy’s productive capacity may not expand as quickly as it did in 2023, it should\nstill grow at a solid pace this year and next.10\nRobust Demand\nTurning to demand, the evidence also points to it staying elevated, despite real\ninterest rates that are high by the standards of the last two decades. In particular,\nconsumption growth has remained robust, buoyed by household balance sheets that\nhave remained strong.11 And faster population growth likely contributed to increased\nspending, as well.\nIt is worth noting that firms have likely been able to maintain relatively high profit\nmargins, not just due to productivity gains but also to robust demand. In turn, this\nprofitability has enabled firms to draw on internal funds to expand their productive\ncapacity – and hire more workers – rather than relying on the now more expensive\nsources of external finance – partly limiting the effects of higher credit costs.\nResilient demand could explain the increase in inflation so far this year. In\nparticular, there are signs that household expenditures may be shifting away from\ngoods and toward services, where price pressures are still high. Shelter inflation also\nremains elevated, with the moderation in market rents limited by continued strength in\nthe labor market.\nThe Stance of Monetary Policy\nLet me now turn to monetary policy. The intent is to help slow demand in a\nmanner consistent with inflation sustainably returning to 2 percent, amid healthy labor\n10 I hear from contacts in the First District that businesses continue to explore ways to find untapped\ntalent and seek efficiencies. And while forecasts of future immigration are highly uncertain, it is\nreasonable to expect somewhat faster-than-normal labor supply growth will continue in the near term.\n11 Moreover, household net worth is still high by historical standards.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nmarket conditions. But given the continued economic strength, the extent to which\nmonetary policy has been tempering growth is unclear – as is the extent to which it will\ndo so going forward.\nIn fact, the current level of interest rates may provide less restraint than\nexpected. Strong balance sheets have likely reduced the interest rate sensitivity of\nhouseholds and firms. In addition, the current low household saving rate may indicate\nthat the return needed to incentivize saving may have increased. And for firms, the\nreturn to capital spending may be rising, due to the supply of additional workers and\nproductivity improvements.\nThese considerations – together with equity market gains, continued narrow\ncorporate bond risk spreads, and the growing availability of credit from nonbank\ninstitutions – suggest that current financial conditions may be only modestly restrictive.\nBut to be clear, moderately restrictive policy is consistent with demand ultimately\nslowing, and inflation returning to target. Furthermore, the supply improvements I\nmentioned imply that the extent of slowing required to rebalance the economy is less\nthan one might have thought, given the strength in activity.\nThis assessment of the monetary policy stance implies that the risks are two\nsided. On the one hand, there is the risk of inflation not continuing on a downward\ntrajectory back to 2 percent – highlighting the importance of not easing prematurely. At\nthe same time, the possibility of the economy slowing notably should not be discounted.\nWe may not yet have seen the full effects of the FOMC’s past policy actions, given the\nconsiderable uncertainty about the lags with which monetary policy affects the\neconomy.12 Furthermore, higher interest rates could make the economy more\nvulnerable to the effects of adverse economic or geopolitical shocks, should they occur.\n12 Some estimates put the maximum impact of monetary policy on economic activity in the range of four to\nsix quarters after a change in the policy stance – and I’ll note that the federal funds rate has been near\n5½ percent for about three quarters. Furthermore, those estimates were calibrated from more gradual\ntightening cycles. So, while it is not my baseline outlook, the economy could still slow abruptly, with\npolicy having stayed too restrictive in hindsight.\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nHowever, in my view, the risks of monetary policy being too tight have receded.\nEarlier this year, I was concerned about policy restrictiveness, given an apparent rise in\nlabor market fragility. At that time, data indicated that hiring was becoming concentrated\nin just a few, less-cyclical sectors. But recent payroll gains (and revisions to earlier data)\nhave been more diffused across sectors. Indicators – including an unemployment rate\nthat remains below 4 percent and quit rates that are back to their pre-pandemic range –\npoint to a labor market that, while coming into better balance, is still robust. A lower risk\nof overly tight conditions supports taking a more patient approach in deciding when to\nease policy.\nOutlook and Policy Implications\nLooking ahead, I remain realistically optimistic that we can achieve our dual\nmandate goals. At the same time, the slowdown in economic activity necessary for\nachieving price stability remains more in the forecast than in the actual data. But there\nmay be some early signs pointing towards a slowing of demand. For example, liquid\nsavings from pandemic-era stimulus programs dwindled in 2023, especially for lower-\nincome and younger households. There is evidence of rising credit card utilization rates\nand delinquencies. And growth in business investment slowed in the second half of last\nyear.\nHowever, the potential impact and timing of these indications of slowing are\nuncertain. In a sign of still robust demand, payroll growth over the last quarter averaged\n276,000 jobs per month, a pace that is likely faster than needed to keep up with\npopulation growth, even accounting for increased immigration. And core inflation has\nmoved up relative to the low readings in the second half of last year.\nThe implications of these recent data for the evolution of inflation remain to be\nseen. For instance, we should not necessarily have been surprised by some higher\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ninflation readings early this year, after the low numbers in the second half of 2023.13\nOverall, the recent data have not materially changed my outlook, but they do highlight\nuncertainties related to timing, and the need for patience – recognizing that disinflation\nmay continue to be uneven. This also implies that less easing of policy this year than\npreviously thought may be warranted.\nTo gain greater confidence that progress remains on track, I’ll continue to monitor\na wide range of quantitative and qualitative data. Expecting all indicators to be well\naligned is too high a bar, but let me highlight five of the things I’ll be watching or looking\nfor:\n First, the evolution of the components of inflation. We do not have individual\ntargets for the components, but the composition is informative, and dynamics\ndiffer. In particular, housing as well as non-shelter services price inflation, is\ntaking longer to return to pre-pandemic trends. I’m looking to see additional\nprogress there.\n Second, further evidence of low synchronicity of price changes across\nsectors. This is a typical feature of low-inflation environments, and it has been\nencouraging to see this indicator return to its pre-pandemic range.\n Third, evidence that wages continue to evolve in a way that is consistent with\nprice stability. In fact, given past price increases and ongoing productivity\ndevelopments, there is room for wages to grow at a relatively sustained pace\nwithout necessarily generating additional inflationary pressures.14\n13 Moreover, the volatility of monthly inflation numbers, while declining, remains above pre-pandemic\nlevels, and readings can be more difficult to interpret at the beginning of the year, an issue that may be\ncompounded by changes to household and firm behavior since the pandemic.\n14 For more on wage dynamics and how they relate to prices and productivity, see Philippe Andrade, Falk\nBräuning, José L. Fillat, and Gustavo Joaquim, 2024, “Is Post-pandemic Wage Growth Fueling Inflation?”\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston Current Policy Perspectives, 2024-1,\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/publications/current-policy-perspectives/2024/is-post-pandemic-wage-growth-\nfueling-inflation.aspx.\n8\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, April 11, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n Fourth, seeing short- and long-term inflation expectations remaining at levels\nconsistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent target.\n And fifth, continued signs of labor demand moderating in an orderly way, to a\nhealthy, sustainable balance with supply.\nConcluding Observations\nIn sum, recent developments continue to highlight the importance of a patient\nand methodical approach, as we holistically assess available information. Incoming data\nhave eased my concerns about an imminent need to reassess the stance of monetary\npolicy. It may just take more time than previously thought for activity to moderate, and to\nsee further progress in inflation returning durably to our target. Less concern about labor\nmarket fragilities, combined with the possibility that policy is only modestly restrictive,\nalso reduces the urgency to ease. Ultimately, though, policy is not on a preset path, and\nit remains well positioned to manage upside and downside risks.\nThank you, and I look forward to the conversation with Abby and to your\nquestions.\n9",

    "text": "General Discussion:\nMethods of Accommodation at\nthe Interest-Rate Lower Bound\nChair: Susan M. Collins\nMr. Shirakawa: Since Japan was mentioned several times I feel in-\nclined to respond. The Bank of Japan adopted interest rate guidance,\nalso a balance-sheet policy, and the so-called “lending for funding.”\nSo, we have experienced all these things in the past. First of all, the\nguidance on future interest rates was effective, in the sense that it\ncould reduce interest rate levels. Given this, the additional impact\ncoming from asset purchases was rather limited. In theory, the reduc-\ntion of interest rates could be duplicated by the interest rate guid-\nance. The effectiveness of this interest rate guidance on economic\nactivity was the highest in the latter part of the period it was adopted.\nEven after the economy recovered, the Bank of Japan still maintained\nlow interest rates and the guidance was effective. In the first part of\nthe period, it was not effective, because market participants antici-\npated that future interest rates would be low anyway. The efficacy of\nthe lowered interest rates was tested in the latter part of the period.\nI have two questions: First, what are your views on the relationship\nbetween asset purchases, on one hand, and interest rate guidance, on\nthe other. Although I have just said that the effect of asset purchases\ncould be replicated by interest rate guidance, the Bank of Japan and\nthe Federal Reserve have adopted two different policies. My hypoth-\nesis relates to the diversity of views among policy board members.\n303\n\n304 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nCentral banks cannot make ironclad commitments to future policy,\ngiven the diverse views among board members about future interest\nrates. In that light, there is a case for asset purchases.\nA second question concerns the efficacy of lower interest rates dur-\ning a period of balance sheet adjustment. The decrease in interest\nrates may be effective, but it comes with a cost. It may mitigate the\nimpact of the balance-sheet adjustment, but at the same time, it may\nprolong the length of time over which the adjustment is made. In\ntotal, the degree of efficacy during this period is not that clear. Also,\nagents are faced with intertemporal budget constraints, so lower in-\nterest rates may bring demand forward from the future to the present.\nBut as low interest rates persist for an extended period, the effect—\nthe bringing of demand forward, from the future to the present—di-\nminishes over time. Thirdly, it could have some side effect of keeping\ninefficient firms alive. I do not know if this argument is valid or not\nin this country, but if society is faced with some inflexibility, then this\nside effect could become serious.\nMr. Feldstein: I wanted to comment on the nominal GDP target\nidea, which was an idea that I liked a lot a long time ago, back in\n1983. In the Economic Report of the President, before we had a dual\nmandate for the Federal Reserve, or before there was any rule, I sug-\ngested a nominal GDP target. But of course now we do have a dual\nmandate. A lot of effort has gone into creating credibility for a low-\ninflation target. So, if the Federal Reserve were to follow your advice\nand adopt a nominal GDP path to target, and if that led to a sig-\nnificant increase in inflation relative to the 2 percent threshold, what\nwould you have the Federal Reserve say by way of explanation? How\nwould they reconcile that with the existing dual mandate?\nMr. English: I have a comment on the effect of targeted asset pur-\nchases, a comment that is more or less an advertisement for a paper by\nmy colleagues Min Wei and Canlin Li at the Federal Reserve Board.\nThey used a no-arbitrage term structure model, to which they added\nTreasury and mortgage-backed security (MBS) supply factors, to look\nat the effects of Treasury and MBS supply on the Treasury yield curve.\nThey estimate the model using pre-crisis data, from 1994 to 2007.\nMovements in supply factors are unrelated to the policy of the Federal\n\nGeneral Discussion 305\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC), or expected FOMC behavior, and\nthis period was one when the market functioning was fine. Nonethe-\nless, they find pretty significant effects of supply factors on the Treasury\nyield curve, and they can then use their model to look at the effects that\nthe model would expect to get from large-scale asset purchase programs\nor the maturity extension program, and so on.\nThey find effects that are quite similar to those that come out of\nevent studies like Gagnon et al.\nWith regard to pass-through to private yields, I agree that the evi-\ndence there is somewhat less, but I think that’s hard to measure, be-\ncause corporate markets are less liquid. Separating the signal from\nnoise is, therefore, harder. But I do wonder if the effects are much less\nthan one-for-one—if so, and if you buy the result that our purchases\nhave pushed down Treasury yields, then risk spreads should have wid-\nened out quite a lot and should be high right now. But I think the\nspreads now seem more or less where one might think they should be\nin the given the cyclical situation.\nMs. Swonk: Mine is more a question about the political economy,\nwhere I believe you are underestimating the effects. My concern is on\nthe credibility of forward guidance in a political situation such as the\none we have right now. There are individuals in Washington, includ-\ning presidential candidates, advocating change in the leadership of the\nFederal Reserve in order to change the behavior of the Federal Reserve.\nThere are also members of Congress proposing policies to try to change\nthe behavior of the Federal Reserve. This raises questions about the\ncredibility of any guidance today, given the uncertainty about what\nchanges in law may lay ahead down the road? Secondly, on the political\neconomy, in terms of being able to target more, and perhaps to have a\nbigger bang for your dollar in terms of specific parts of the economy,\nthe Federal Reserve is very limited at this moment in what it can buy. If\nit were to make more targeted purchases, what would the reaction be,\nin terms of the Federal Reserve’s independence from Congress going\nforward. Those are issues I worry about quite a bit.\nMr. Kohn: I want to focus on expectations and credibility. I think\nwhat’s held the central banks back from adopting nominal GDP\n\n306 Chair: Susan M. Collins\ntargets, or price level targets, is concern that their success depends on\na pretty sophisticated set of expectations, and changing expectations.\nSo, in order to get real interest rates down by adopting this target\nyou have to have higher inflation expectations in the short run—the\nshort-to-intermediate run—but then come back to target over the\nlong run. This is a pretty difficult thing to convey and to be credible\nabout, and central banks are worried that if they push up inflation\nexpectations in the short run, it could be expensive to restore cred-\nibility over the longer run. In your models, it essentially happens\nautomatically, because people know what’s coming; everyone is for-\nward-looking. But my fear is that in real life, that’s not the case, and\nI would like to hear your comments on this important issue.\nMr. Hatzius: I wanted to pick up on the question by Marty Feld-\nstein about the dual mandate. I think that links to something that is\nalso in the paper about nominal GDP targets. The chart shows that\nif you extrapolate the historical trend in nominal GDP from 1990\nthrough the third quarter of 2008, then you get a shortfall, as of mid-\n2012, of something like 15 percent. That is obviously a very, very\nlarge number. I guess my suggestion would be that, if you were to go\nfor something like that, to not use the historical trend but to basically\npick a point at which you think the output gap would be roughly\nzero; and then extrapolate forward, with the sum of your estimate\nof potential real GDP growth and your inflation target. That would\ngive you something like 4.5 percent for the long-run trend in nomi-\nnal GDP growth. If you do that, and pick the Congressional Budget\nOffice estimate of the last zero output gap in the fourth quarter of\n2007, you a get a shortfall at the moment of just over 10 percent. If\nyou use instead, for example, the estimate from the Organisation for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development of the last zero output\ngap quarter, which was actually the third quarter of 2008, you get a\nshortfall of about 8 percent. So, those are still big numbers, but not\nas gapingly large as 15 percent. I also think that that kind of reason-\ning is more consistent perhaps with the dual mandate than Marty\nsuggested.\nMr. Bean: A couple of points. I’m a bit doubtful that most of the\ncases of forward guidance that we actually observe are attempts to\n\nGeneral Discussion 307\nbuild in the historical dependence that you would want in policy\nrules. I think they are more in the nature of guidance of how the\ncentral bank is thinking. If you do want to put in place a real com-\nmitment to the historical dependence in the policy reaction function\nthat you advocate, you need to think a bit more about the neces-\nsary commitment mechanism, instead of implicitly just appealing to\nreputation. As Adam drew to our attention, if you take a look at the\nBank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, we have quite a bit\nof turnover. Adam has about four hours left on the committee, so he\nis not in a position to commit his successor to anything. The compo-\nsition of our Monetary Policy Committee this time next year will be\nsuch that at least half of the current members may well have changed\ncompared to where we were at our last meeting, so committing to\nanything further than about a year ahead is probably not feasible.\nYou need Monetary Policy Committee membership to be pretty\nconstant to be able to commit over any substantial time horizon. So\nI wonder if you have any views on how you are going to achieve the\ncommitment that you need.\nThe second comment is in relation to nominal GDP. Marty took\nus back to 1983. As it happens, I actually wrote part of my doctoral\nthesis on nominal GDP targeting, and 1983 happens also to be when\nthat particular piece was published in The Economic Journal! So I am\nsort of gratified that it is perhaps coming back into fashion. How-\never, I’m a bit wary of how you are actually proposing to apply this,\nas I understand the sort of path for the level of nominal GDP you’d\nbe announcing would be just a continuation of the precrisis trend.\nIn an environment where monetary policy has limited traction, you\nwill, therefore, be likely to be quite a long way from your target for\na sustained period. I think that is actually quite a difficult position\nfor a central bank to be in. The public expects to see the central bank\nachieve its target within a reasonable timeframe. With you being a\nlong way away from that path for a long time, questions would natu-\nrally arise about the ability and desire of the central bank to achieve\nits goals.\nMr. Ryding: Adam posed a terrific question, which is why is it\nthat we have seemingly limited traction from unconventional\n\n308 Chair: Susan M. Collins\npolicies on the economy. I’d like to offer a couple of thoughts, one\nof course may be that the problems that we have are not tractable by\nmonetary means. I’ll put that one aside because we have interesting\npapers coming up in that area in the labor market and focus on call it\ncounter-productive side effects of the policy. I’d just like to illustrate\nit with two examples. First is the commodity price effect from large-\nscale asset purchases (LSAPs). We’ve talked about correlation. Since\n2008 there has been extremely high correlation between the equity\nmarket and commodity prices. If LSAPs have boosted equity prices,\ngiven the high correlation, it seems reasonable to take the position\nthat it boosted commodity prices. And last year that had a big impact\non short-run inflation figures, which squeezed real income. When\nthe economy slowed in the first part of last year, it wasn’t because\nnominal consumer spending slowed; it was because inflation surged.\nThe other point is about the lowering of long-term interest rates in\nthe hopes of stimulating interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy.\nIn that area, there are major sections of the economy that are hurt\nnow because of these long-term rates. For example, if you are retiring\nit is very difficult at this point to convert your savings to an annuity\nthat’s going to pay you. If you are a state or local government, or if\nyou are a company pension fund now, the discounted present value\nof your future liabilities at these rates are so much higher, you have to\ndivert current spending in order to meet that pension gap. I wonder\nif we are not thinking enough about some of these countervailing\ninfluences from these polices, and I would be interested in the panel’s\nthoughts on this.\nMr. Lindsey: First I completely agree with Marty’s perception of\nnominal GDP, written in 1983, and only partly because I was work-\ning for him then. But I have another reason to express caution. I\nwould think if we would look back at the last two decades, one of\nthe failures of nominal GDP targeting turned out to have been that\na lot of the stuff that is in the price component does not include as-\nset prices. Therefore, no more than price level targeting would have\ngiven us the right behavior. I don’t think nominal GDP targeting\nwould have, either. We would have still had the bubbles.\n\nGeneral Discussion 309\nSecond, I was very much struck by Adam Posen’s comments on\npolitical taboos and on this group’s profession of not being aggressive\nenough. I don’t think it’s political, in the sense of policy. I think it’s\npolitical in the sense of political economy. In free societies, such as\nBritain and America, individuals and institutions don’t do unusual\nthings, because if you do, and you do break custom, and you just\nhappen to be wrong, you are betting the farm. It’s a normal, pru-\ndential kind of political behavior. I do think finally that, for our pro-\nfession, all of us, I think, have been in a position over the last two\ndecades to realize that modesty—in what we express, and what we\nthink we can do—is probably becoming.\nMs. Jochnick: Thanks Professor Woodford for a very impressive\npaper. There is much food for thought in the paper. I cannot com-\nment on everything in it, but since the Riksbank was mentioned\nhere, and you have elaborated on it, I would like to give a view on\nhow we have seen the forecasts we have been giving since 2007. The\ndecision to publish the forecast on the repo rate came from a discus-\nsion with the market on what kind of assumptions for the repo rate\nthe Riksbank was using in its own forecast for the economy, for GDP\nand inflation. As an open and transparent central bank, we thought it\nwould be better to be transparent also on the repo rate path that we\nhave in our own forecast.\nIn our view, I would like to say that the repo rate path has served us\nwell. It has performed an important educational function. It’s been\neasy for us to discuss with the market, and I think we have been very\nclear that it explains the executive board’s view at the time of the\ndecision of the repo rate, given the information that we have avail-\nable. We have told the market that this is not a promise but a view\nthat we have at this point of time. As a communication instrument,\nI would like to say it’s been an advantage for us to publish the repo\nrate path. It’s complicated to follow up and evaluate to what extent\nmarket expectations have been influenced by our repo rate paths. It\nis problematic to measure policy expectations through forward rates\ndue to variations in risk premia. When we compare with surveys of\npolicy expectations we can see that market expectations are closer to\nour repo rate path than to the market forward rate.\n\n310 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nI would also like to mention that in the turmoil of 2009, we com-\nbined the forward guidance with quantitative measures, and we were\nat the time able to lower expectations of the future repo rate. I think\nthere are pros and cons. From our perspective it has been a quite\ngood experience. It’s been an advantage to be able to communicate\nthe repo rate path.\nMr. Frenkel: My comment refers to Charlie Bean’s question on\nwhether central bank governors (or monetary committee) can com-\nmit to a policy that pertains to a period beyond their own term in\noffice. Implicit in this question was the implication that policy guid-\nance that refers to a longer horizon is less credible. It is clearly true\nthat currently serving policymakers cannot commit future policy-\nmakers to specific policy measures. However, such guidance can still\nbe useful as it indicates to the market the degree of conviction that\ncurrent policymakers have about their own policy stance. For ex-\nample, when the Fed extended the period to which it believed that\ninterest rates will be held low from 2013 to 2014, that extension\nstrengthened the message of conviction about 2013 (even though a\ncomposition of the Federal Open Market Committee during 2014\nmight be different).\nMr. Levy: There is this presumption that more monetary accom-\nmodation will stimulate growth. In fact, as Adam Posen said, it’s\nseems clear in the market place that forward guidance has brought\ndown rates. As Adam points out, there have been positive effects on\nthe financial channels, but we have to ask the following question.\nHere we are…banks are sitting on a trillion and a half dollars of\nexcess reserves, bond yields are exceedingly low, and the economy\nis weaker than we would like. Chairman Bernanke talked about the\nheadwinds, and if we looked at each of the headwinds he mentioned,\nnone of them have to do with monetary policy and, in fact, none of\nthem would benefit by lower rates or more high-powered money. So\nwe have to ask the question, would more stimulus actually lift the\neconomy and even if it would, is it appropriate? My view is there has\nbeen a shift in the aggregate demand curve due to nonmonetary fac-\ntors, and we could break those down into policy factors: as Chairman\nBernanke mentioned, fiscal policy; and some uncertainty about fiscal\n\nGeneral Discussion 311\npolicy; and some nonmonetary factors like the need for households\nto deleverage. So, in each of those cases, what is the appropriate role\nfor monetary policy? Would more accommodation work, and even if\nit would work, is it appropriate?\nMr. Woodford: First, very quickly, I should respond to Governor\nShirakawa and his comments on the Bank of Japan. I’m certainly\naware of the fact that the Bank of Japan did also use interest rate\nguidance and, in fact, there is a discussion of that in the paper. I did\nnot have time to mention it here. I cite several papers by Bank of\nJapan scholars, and other Japanese scholars, on the assessment of that\nexperience. I think most of that work, including some previous work\nby Governor Shirakawa, has stressed—as he was just saying—that in-\nterest rate guidance seemed to be effective in that period. I agree with\nthat, and I think that is basically consistent with the message of the\npaper, although Japan mainly came up in the context of the question\nof the desirability of pure quantity targets.\nI also should also say something in response to the Deputy Gov-\nernor of Riksbank. My comments about the Risksbank where not\nintended to suggest that publishing the repo rate path was a mistake.\nI think that it was an improvement in transparency. In the context\nof the kinds of projections that you were already publishing on other\nvariables, while leaving mysterious what the interest rate assumption\nwas, I think it was definitely an increase in transparency to be more\nexplicit about that. What I’m really suggesting is that you should\nthink about going further down the path of being as transparent as\npossible, by saying more about the decision process that would in fact\ndetermine future decisions, instead of simply giving the projections.\nAt least that’s what I was suggesting as a dimension along which there\ncould be improvement. I was not really suggesting that things would\nbe better if you somehow didn’t release the repo rate projection.\nOf the other issues, one that has come up repeatedly is the ques-\ntion of whether this proposal—to commit to a nominal GDP tar-\nget—would run into a problem because it would result in higher\ninflation for a while, in a way that would be very damaging to the\ncentral bank’s credibility. Don Kohn certainly mentioned this and\nseveral people were raising versions of that same concern. I take that\n\n312 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nvery seriously: of course it’s true that it is easy in theoretical models,\nwhere you simply assume perfect credibility, to work out what the\nideal equilibrium would be. But I think we do have to worry about\nthis issue of credibility. I think, however, that there are big advantages\nto announcing a target path; that is, indicating what you are going\nto do further down the road, indicating at exactly what point it’s go-\ning to be deemed appropriate to tighten policy as you approach the\nnominal GDP path. That way, if—in a transitional period—there\nwere somewhat higher inflation, people would understand that that’s\ncompletely consistent with believing in your commitment to contain\ninflation. And, therefore, they shouldn’t have any higher expectations\nabout longer-run inflation, simply because of what they are seeing\ntransitionally.\nI would be more worried about policies that swell the balance sheet\ndramatically without saying very explicitly how one is supposed to\nunwind the policy, without saying what exactly this leads to, in terms\nof a future policy regime. I would think that creates more of an is-\nsue of possible doubts about whether there is a commitment to keep\ninflation under control. In contrast, I think commitment to a par-\nticular target path, one that is clearly consistent with a moderate,\nlong-run inflation target, is a way of addressing that problem.",

    "text": "General Discussion:\nModeling Inflation\nAfter the Crisis\nChair: Susan M. Collins\nMr. Berner: Just following up on Frank Smet’s comments, I won-\nder if Jim and Mark have considered the possibility of a regime shift.\nAs we approach price stability and monetary policy turned away\nfrom what some have described as opportunistic disinflation and be-\ncame more symmetric around the inflation target, did they take that\ninto account in thinking about the response in the Phillips curve and\ninflation expectations?\nMr. Weber: This question is also for Frank. I suppose this is about\nhourly wages, Frank. What we’ve seen, for example, in Germany is\nthat there has been a whole new deal between the unions and the em-\nployers in the last crisis. The Backus-Driffill kind of evidence showed\nif you have wages negotiated at an industry level, this results in the\nworst outcome you can have in a country.\nGermany has moved wage negotiations now more to the firm level.\nWhat has happened in the crisis is that there has been a huge re-\nduction in hours worked, so while hourly wages stayed roughly the\nsame, the overall wage bill has reduced. In good times, employees\nused working-time accounts to build up overtime accounts. In bad\ntimes, they ran them down first and only then reduced working time.\n235\n\n236 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nTo sum up, there is a lot of evidence of rigidity in hourly wages, but\noverall there has been much more wage flexible than hourly wages\nalone suggest, even in the euro area.\nMr. Levy: Just a simple point regarding 2004: At the time, there\nwas spreading concern about deflation particularly—even earlier\nthan that when the Federal Reserve mentioned it as a possibility—\nnominal GDP growth was accelerating well above potential growth,\nand the dollar was falling. That seems to be the missing link.\nIt seems wage and price-setting behavior is certainly affected by\nnominal spending in the economy. When you have nominal spend-\ning in the economy accelerating and above productive capacity that\nmay well be your missing link. In fact, that is one of the crucial vari-\nables to be looking at now. Nominal spending, which had been grow-\ning quite rapidly through the first quarter of this year, has since decel-\nerated. I would say that is a crucial variable to be looking at.\nMr. Geanakoplos: This is a very naive question, but when people\ntalk casually about inflation in the next 10 years, the government\ndebt, the fact there are so many homeowners underwater, and the\nincentives for the government to cause an inflation to rescue us from\nour problems seem to loom large. I’m wondering whether there was\nsome kind of analysis you did by looking at other countries in simi-\nlar situations in the past or America in the past that enabled you to\nrule that out in your equations or whether you think it will show up\nin output and therefore you’ll get it eventually anyway? I just didn’t\nunderstand how that kind of thinking played into the regressions.\nMs. Reaser: Jim and Mark, I read your paper and then read Larry\nChristiano’s paper over the past week. I was struck by the very differ-\nent images of the inflation picture: your paper, of course, emphasiz-\ning the role of the unemployment gap and the recession in reducing\ninflation and then Larry’s paper indicating lower inflation in periods\nof stock market booms. I wondered if you might comment on that\nvery different image. I can certainly see the impact of productivity\ncausing positive shocks in lowering inflation during stock market\nbooms, but I’d be interested in your comments.\n\nGeneral Discussion 237\nMr. Christiano: It seems to me in thinking about the inflation\noutlook at this particular time that there is an important potential\nnonlinearity. I don’t know how to solve this problem. My guess is, if\ntwo people know how to do it, it is you. The nonlinearity is some-\nthing we see in our models, which is when the interest rate hits zero,\na shock that might not have a big effect normally on inflation could\nhave a huge negative impact on inflation.\nA lot of people are talking about this zero-bound stuff and the fear\nof deflation. I don’t know how you get that into your forecast. One\nof the problems is, of course, we don’t have any history, at least in the\npostwar period, with this kind of thing. Maybe the Great Depression\ngives you information about this. But now we are getting into some\npretty unusual time series stuff.\nThe other information we have about it is the models that fit the\ndata well have in them this nonlinearity and this scary thing that a\nsmall shock at a time like now could really produce a big deflation.\nBut I don’t know how exactly you would integrate that, although a\nlot of people are worried about that.\nMr. Blinder: Just a short question about the interesting u-gap spec-\nification that was used. The word NAIRU (non-accelerating inflation\nrate of unemployment) has been used a lot. But, as you look at what\nis in the equation, isn’t it more of a hysteresis specification? Because\nit says that, if the unemployment rate should happen to be x for 12\nconsecutive quarters, then x becomes the NAIRU?\nMr. Fischer: I am not sure if the paper answers this question, but\nthe title of the conference is “Macroeconomic Challenges: The Decade\nAhead.” I’ve been trying to figure out what the paper says about wheth-\ner we are in a new moderation, whether we are in a new moderate mod-\neration, whether we are going to be lower than ever, or whether the fact\nthere is a model that seems to work for recessions pretty well says that\nnothing much has actually changed in inflation dynamics.\nMr. Orphanides: I read this paper as a very nice way to resurrect\nold-fashioned, unstable acceleration in Phillips curves by pointing\nout that if you replace those fixed coefficient lags with something\nthat reflects the evolution of inflation expectations better—and this\n\n238 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nis the trend time-varying component that we have—you can get a\nmore stable-looking sort of Phillips curve than before. I read this as\nhighlighting the importance of thinking hard about inflation expec-\ntations and how well-anchored we are for predicting inflation and for\nthinking about the policy implications.\nThere is one element of the paper that did not complement the\ndiscussion that I wanted to highlight because it worried me a little\nbit. There is a section in which there is some evidence suggesting\nthat perhaps shorter-run expectations, as reflected in surveys, are less\nimportant. That is not proven in the paper. In thinking about infla-\ntion for 2011, for example, inflation expectations are important. The\nweakness in the paper in uncovering this has to do with the fact, as it\nis stated, that the equations are trying to predict the core PCE (per-\nsonal consumption expenditures) inflation, but the surveys that are\nbeing used to do this are not about core PCE inflation, as is measured\nright now. They are about other concepts of inflation that do not line\nup with the inflation the paper is really measuring.\nAs the paper does point out—but unfortunately it is a consider-\nable weakness for this point—it does not do real-time analysis very\nwell. Under the control of Charlie Plosser and Jim Bullard, I would\nlike to point out this is a major weakness that I don’t think should\nbe considered acceptable in econometrics these days because at the\nPhiladelphia Fed and at the St. Louis Fed they have put consider-\nable resources in having all of the necessary real-time data that one\ncan use to do this experience right—very accessible and very easy to\nuse. Indeed, you could use the real-time available data to find out\nwhether shorter inflation expectations in the surveys are important.\nSome evidence that they are unaware of suggests that indeed they are.\nFinal comment. On the 2004 episode, you do again run into this\nrevision issue. In 2003 and 2004 were two years in which the first\npublished core PCE data, and a matter of fact, data published a year\nor even two years later were much, much lower than the data you are\nusing that are published seven or eight years after the fact.\nYour comment about the FOMC sub-projections or other com-\nmentary at the time showing inflation projections and expecta-\n\nGeneral Discussion 239\ntions being very low—those were very good forecasts off the first-\nannounced core PCE numbers that were subsequently published in\n2004 and 2005. Those do not line up with the data you are using\nright now. The plea here is, under the control of Charlie Plosser and\nJim Bullard, do this a little bit better.\nMr. Sinai: This is a question about deflation risk in the context\nof your model and, if possible, a missing variable. You forecast, at\nleast on today’s data, that core inflation grew 1½ percent year over\nyear. So, if you subtract a half-point from that, which you have\nhere, that would be 1 percent at the second quarter of next year,\nand there is a large margin of error.\nIn your model, I don’t see a unit labor cost for productivity vari-\nable, and we have had some cyclically different behavior of unit labor\ncosts and productivity growth in the last three post-recession epi-\nsodes. So, if that ended up, if you are willing to admit that into your\nframework, and you found stronger productivity growth or falling\nunit labor costs, or very low unit labor costs, what might that do to\nthat 1 percent? Or, to put it another way, what would that do an as-\nsessment of deflation risk next year? Would you have an observation\nyou could make on that?\nMr. Watson: Let me start, and then Jim can finish. Let me take a\nsecond to give you my take on the paper, which I hope will answer at\nleast some of the questions. Jim and I have written several papers on\ntrying to forecast inflation and discovered it’s very hard. So we’ve sort\nof successfully failed to do it regularly.\nThe interesting thing about this particular exercise is Chart 2.\nChart 2 says what we all know—during recessions, inflation falls.\nThe question, then, was first asking is that thing we all know—dur-\ning recessions inflation falls—does it fall in a way that is systematic\nand reasonably stable?\nThe answer seems to be yes. This picture is stunning in that re-\nspect. Frank’s work from his picture he brought from Europe is also\nstunning, and Jean Boivin at the Bank of Canada sent us something\njust as we were getting on the plane, showing for Canada a picture\nthat looks very much like this. So, our sense that during recessions,\n\n240 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nwhen there is a lot of slack, inflation falls seems to be right, and that\nis consistent with what I thought I knew.\nSo then the question is, Can we capitalize that, and can we think\nabout forecasting inflation during recessions? So, we know inflation\nfalls during recessions. Is there enough stability here to forecast infla-\ntion during recessions? And that is an interesting question because\nsometimes we are in recession. Ten years from now we may well be\nin a recession again, to answer Stan’s question, and hence that will be\nan interesting question.\nThat bit of the exercise turned out to be a bit more challenging than\njust looking at what we’ve been calling spider plots, summaries of all\nthese recessions, because then you have to worry very much about\ninstabilities in the inflation process, anchoring of expectations, and\nchanges of pass-through of shocks to expectations. We were pleased\nthat a relatively simple model—part of which we had constructed\nearlier in which we had time variation in the amount of anchoring\n—allowed us to forecast inflation reasonably accurately during reces-\nsions. I say “reasonably accurately”—more accurately than not being\nable to forecast it at all. That was my take on this.\nAs Jim says, “The fit seemed to be reasonably good.” Interestingly,\nwhat this says during the current episode in spite of the fact there\nis much more anchoring now than we’ve seen in the past—over the\nnext year this kind of model predicts a decrease in inflation of about\n50 basis points instead of an increase. That is a striking result.\nThere are some things that are different about this. Trend inflation\nis lower. There are perhaps some nonlinearities here that we tried to\nexamine, but the problem with examining nonlinearities in places\nwhere you haven’t been is you can’t say much about it in looking at\ndata. You can probably say things about it in looking at models. But,\nif models haven’t been forced to look at data around those points as\nwell, I am not sure I would trust the model. There is more uncer-\ntainty in this particular episode than in typical episodes because we\nare in this region of the data we haven’t seen before. Those were my\nkey points. I think I am going to stop and turn it over to Jim. Maybe\nhe has some more to say.\n\nGeneral Discussion 241\nMr. Stock: Let me say one very quick thing on the remark that\nFrank was talking about in terms of downward wage rigidity. Sure,\nthere are a lot of indications there is downward wage rigidity for\nspecific individuals and specific jobs. Probably a more relevant thing\nin terms of thinking about price indexes is thinking about overall\nemployment costs facing firms. Given the amount of turnover and\nthe ability to replace at lower wages, there is probably a lot more\ndownward flexibility in wage bills.\nLet me turn to the broader topics and address some of the com-\nments from the floor. In terms of the methodology, the history of\nthis literature, and I use the word “tortured,” and it really is, where\npeople throw in one variable like productivity or exchange rates or oil\nprices or this version of them. It works great until they publish it and\nit doesn’t work. Maybe the trick is to never publish your work. Our\ngoal is really to step back from this and say, “Look, is there a basic\noverall fact here?”\nAnd there is. There is a basic overall fact. So, then we propose this\nparticular way where we think about this in a different way, using\nthis unemployment gap measure. It is a funny thing because, as Alan\npoints out, it builds in some hysteresis in a way that maybe usual\nNAIRUs don’t. Maybe that is a good thing. Maybe it’s not a good\nthing. I don’t know.\nFor the trend term, there are a lot of discussions of expectations and\nexpectations anchoring it. There is no question as we think about what\nthe real challenges going forward for the next couple of years—the\nquestion is, How much we are going to be able to rely on the anchored\nexpectations? We have an expectations mechanism built in, but it is a\nreduced-form mechanism, so it doesn’t involve some exogenous de-\ntermination that overall market participants are going to anchor their\nexpectations at 2 percent. If we forced that trend term to be 2 percent,\nwe would have reversion back to that trend after this period.\nIf that is what the Fuhrer-Olivei simulations find, and that if you\njust insist expectations are 2 percent—and that’s what we saw in\nFrank’s—it will go back to 2 percent in all of these models, both\n\n242 Chair: Susan M. Collins\ndata-based models and theory models. That is in some sense a model\nthat can’t be resolved by empirical evidence.\nOne comment related to that: The empirical evidence underlying\nthe new Keynesian Phillips curve, which is really the framework in\nwhich we all think about the expectations as mattering, is also ques-\ntionable. There is a serious study by Kleibergen and Mavroeidis pub-\nlished in the Journal of Business and Economic Statistics in 2009 where\nthey take a careful look at how well-identified those parameters are\nand whether the models are rejected. There is a lot of faith involved\nin those models.\nLet me make a final comment. Because the whole morning has been\nhaving academics chiding policymakers, it is delightful to have policy-\nmakers chiding academics about their econometric details. There is a\nnice paper on 2004 real time by Roberto Billi in the third quarter 2009\nKansas City Fed’s Economic Review. As you go back to read the FOMC\nminutes, you are correct there is a big data revision, so the inflation\nthey are looking at the time maybe doesn’t line up with the citations\nwe had in the Dokko and others’ paper. But there were also quite a bit\nof unexpected increases in inflation. One of the reasons they attributed\nit to, as was pointed out by Mickey Levy, was the increase in exchange\nrates. The problem is that when you actually run those regressions and\nyou look at oil pass-throughs and exchange rate pass-throughs and\ncommodity pass-throughs into core, it doesn’t quite seem to add up to\nthe level of increases in inflation and core that was observed either in\nreal time or looking at the final revised data.\nMs. Collins: This morning we have certainly identified and dis-\ncussed a number of the macroeconomic challenges that face us now\nand the decade going forward. While we have not by any stretch of\nthe imagination resolved the policy debates that emanate from them,\nit is striking each of the papers has highlighted some really important\nand provocative empirical regularities that are starting to emerge and\nthat do come out of the data and that will occupy our discussion,\ncontinued research and better understanding of these issues in the\nmonths to come.",

Thank you, Chris, for the kind introduction. I appreciate your leadership, and the\nCenter’s commitment to understanding and addressing America’s housing challenges.\nIt is a pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and the roughly 1,000 who\nare joining online. I want to thank the Joint Center for Housing Studies1 and the seven other Federal\nReserve Banks2 who have joined us in co-hosting this event. My thanks as well to all the speakers today\n– including my colleague Eric Belsky, Director of the Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Consumer and\nCommunity Affairs, and a former head of the Joint Center.\nToday the Joint Center will present its 2025 report on the state of the nation’s housing, followed by an\nexpert panel discussing the report. We’ll then hear from Eric Belsky, as well as a panel of Federal\nReserve Bank leaders involved in community development from across the country.\nMy comments will touch on issues related to housing data, housing affordability, the importance of\nhousing in the economy, and the Federal Reserve’s engagement in housing issues – especially with the\nregional-economy perspective.\nBut first, as always, I will note that my remarks are my own and may not reflect the views of\ncolleagues at the Board of Governors, on the Federal Open Market Committee, or at other Reserve\nBanks.\nHousing and the Economy\nI am so pleased to have such multidisciplinary speakers – and audience members – for today’s\nconversations about the truly complex, multidimensional housing challenges affecting so much of our\ncountry (including rural, urban, and suburban areas), and people across the income spectrum. Here in the\nroom, and online, are housing practitioners, researchers, and policymakers. I’ll also note that, from the\nFederal Reserve System, we have experts from economic research, community development, and other\nfunctions participating.\nI realize some may be wondering about the Federal Reserve’s interest and involvement in housing\nissues. Certainly, the Fed’s focus and purview is monetary policy, not fiscal policy, and not the intricacies\nof state and local policies affecting housing. But housing is deeply tied to the overarching role of the\n1 Learn about the center at https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/\n2 The Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, and\nSan Francisco.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 24, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nFederal Reserve – supporting a strong, stable, and healthy economy and financial system, for the benefit\nof the public we at the Fed are here to serve.3\nWhile the flow of new housing – that is, residential investment – represents only about 4 percent of\nannual U.S. GDP on average, it can have outsized effects on business cycles. During the mid-2000s\nboom, housing drove over 17 percent of GDP growth; in the subsequent collapse and recession,\nresidential investment accounted for 40 percent of the contraction in output. Housing also affects\nhousehold consumption through wealth effects, affects financial markets through mortgage securities,\nand affects local government finances through property taxes and fees.\nMost importantly for monetary policy, the housing market is very sensitive to interest rate changes,\nmaking it an important policy transmission channel.4 When the Federal Reserve adjusts interest rates,\nhousing typically responds first – and tends to spread the effects of monetary policy throughout the\neconomy.\nSome of these effects have been evident in the current monetary policy cycle. In the housing market,\nhigher interest rates have slowed new residential investment. Less housing activity in turn has contributed\nto the more moderate overall demand we are currently experiencing. The modestly restrictive stance of\nmonetary policy, while necessary, limits in the near term the expansion of housing supply needed to\nalleviate some of the pressures in the housing market. But ultimately, the goal of monetary policy is to\nrestore price stability while maintaining healthy labor market conditions. Price stability is essential to foster\nsustained growth, a strong labor market and an economy that works for all – including the stable,\npredictable economic conditions that benefit the housing market over the medium to longer run.\nBeyond cyclical considerations, there are many longstanding issues and “pain points” in the sector\nthat we will hear about today. In particular, as the State of the Nation's Housing 2025 report\ndemonstrates, rapid price and rent increases over the past five years have created enormous pressure on\nhousehold budgets, and placed homeownership beyond reach for many Americans. But this affordability\ncrisis extends far beyond individual hardship. It constrains labor mobility, limits the ability of businesses to\nhire, affects where businesses choose to expand operations, and reduces the wealth-building potential\n3 We also have important responsibilities in ensuring fair lending and community reinvestment by the\ninstitutions we supervise as one of the federal bank regulatory agencies.\n4 For more perspective on housing and transmission of monetary policy, see the speech by Patrick\nHarker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia: Understanding Monetary Policy Through\nthe Housing Channel; and “Housing Markets and Monetary Policy” by Andaloussi, Biljanovska, and\nDeStefani, in the IMF’s Finance & Development Magazine (December 2024):\nhttps://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2024/12/housing-markets-and-monetary-policy-mehdi-\nandaloussi.\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 24, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nthat homeownership has historically provided to many American families. These are just some of the\nreasons why it’s so important to have the regular in-depth look at housing this report provides.\nThe National Housing Landscape, and the Importance of Data\nAs a lifelong proponent of empirical analysis and a self-described “data-geek,” I would like to spend a\nmoment on the importance of data for understanding the challenges around housing.\nThe State of the Nation’s Housing 2025 report distills extensive data sources into a comprehensive\npicture of the U.S. housing market, providing insights into current trends and emerging challenges.\nProducing a report of this depth and clarity requires not just analytic expertise, but a robust foundation of\ndata. That foundation comes, in large part, from the national-level statistical data infrastructure.\nIn particular, the Bureau of the Census provides essential surveys – the American Housing Survey,\nthe American Community Survey, and the Housing Vacancy Survey – that give us a representative view\nof the landscape. Additional federal data add to this picture: the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment assessments of homelessness, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ construction costs data,\namong others.\nThis public data infrastructure is also crucial for understanding the rental housing market, where\nprivate data is often fragmented or incomplete. Unlike the for-sale market – where centralized databases\nfrom real estate professionals and mortgage servicers provide comprehensive information – rental\nhousing spans millions of landlords and property managers, many of whom are not asked to report data\nto any single system. That’s why federal government supported surveys remain the only comprehensive\nlens into rental conditions, especially for low- and moderate-income households.\nThe data illuminated by the report have sharpened the picture of a housing landscape marked by\ngrowing affordability challenges. Some of the data included in this year’s report are particularly striking:\n• Home prices have surged 60 percent nationwide since 2019, pushing the median price for a\nsingle-family home to a record $412,500 in 2024. This means a price-to-income ratio well above\n3.0, the level traditionally seen as “affordable.”\n• Monthly mortgage payments on a median-priced home have reached $2,750, requiring an annual\nincome of over $126,000 to qualify as a borrower under standard lending ratios.\n• And on the rental side, half of all renter households (over 22 million) were cost-burdened in 2023,\nmeaning they spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing and utilities – this compares\nto just over 20 million in 2019. And in 2023, 12.1 million households spent more than half of their\nincome on rent.\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 24, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nAs much as I, like many of you, love data, we know that these figures are not just data points. They\nreflect economic realities – often painful – for many families, and real strain on people, communities, and\nplaces.\nSpotlighting Local and Regional Housing Dynamics\nWhile housing markets are tight across the country, the aggregate data mask significant unevenness.\nHousing challenges vary dramatically across the U.S. For example, we may see affordability challenges\nand supply constraints in cities, infrastructure shortages in rural areas, and zoning disputes in suburbs5 --\nor a mix of these challenges, in a given area. So clearly the national housing crisis requires local as well\nas national understanding and solutions.6\nThe Reserve Banks gather and contribute regional insight and analysis on – among other topics –\nhome prices, rent dynamics, and construction activity, helping to deepen insights into how national\neconomic forces play out locally. A number of our Fed economists do analytical work on housing, and its\nrole in the economy and financial system.\nIn my role as the president of a regional Reserve Bank, I routinely connect with business and\ncommunity leaders and a wide range of stakeholders in the economy, across the six New England states.\nThis gives me important insight into the barriers, tradeoffs, and economic realities households and firms\nface each day, including local housing conditions. All this is important for responsible policymaking in the\npublic interest.\nI’ve learned firsthand how supply constraints, construction costs, zoning, access to credit,\ninfrastructure, and affordability all play out in distinct ways to affect local housing markets and the people\nin them. For example, community leaders in Vermont recently noted that more than 20 sources of capital\nwere needed to fund a housing development project that responded to community needs. That large\nnumber may sound surprising, but it was the only way to make that particular project feasible. Meanwhile,\nI recently learned about a community hospital in New Hampshire struggling to retain a new doctor they\nhad hired because he was unable to find housing for his family. Such housing-related anecdotes are\npervasive as I ask people about the challenges and opportunities in their local economy.\n5 For examples, see Rental Affordability and COVID-19 in Rural New England - Federal Reserve Bank of\nBoston and Local Zoning Laws and the Supply of Multifamily Housing in Greater Boston - Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston\n6 For examples, see New England’s Housing Markets: Supply and Demand Factors Affecting Housing\nPrices across the Region - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and House Prices and Rents in the 21st\nCentury - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 24, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIndeed, across New England, the housing affordability crisis has expanded beyond high-growth urban\ncenters like Boston and now affects suburban and rural communities in very challenging ways.\nSupporting Progress in Our Communities\nThe Federal Reserve aims to support economic vibrancy across the wide range of communities in our\nregions – again, our vision is a vibrant economy for all – particularly by advancing data-driven insights\nand analysis. One way we do this is by helping participants in the economy access and apply data\neffectively.7 Like the Joint Center, we see this as an important contribution to help inform decision-\nmaking. Fed experts continue to develop housing-relevant data and analytic techniques, often in\ncollaboration with academic and policy researchers.\nFed researchers have also tackled data gaps in overlooked housing markets. Take, for example,\nland-lease manufactured housing communities – what many people call mobile home parks. These\ncommunities provide affordable homeownership for modest-income households. But, while residents own\ntheir homes, someone else owns the land underneath them, creating vulnerabilities. Work by the\nPhiladelphia Fed to identify such communities enabled the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency to\nsupport conversions to resident ownership of the land beneath their homes, increasing residential\nsecurity.\nIndeed, data and analytics are important ways the Federal Reserve can contribute to the\nconversation about housing markets. The Reserve Banks can also assist as non-partisan, constructive\nsources of convening, helping leaders connect, collaborate, and innovate. We know that local, cross-\nsector engagement and collaboration is key to progress.8\nTake, for example, a recent undertaking in Vermont’s White River Valley.9 As part of a Boston Fed\ncommunity development initiative called Working Communities,10 local leaders are now helping residents\nbenefit from new state legislation that makes it easier to build accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, which\n7 For example, economists in the Federal Reserve System were among the first to use credit-bureau data\nto better understand the housing market.\n8 See Community Development - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n9 See https://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces/communities-challenge/vermont.aspx\n10 Grounded in research, the Boston Fed’s Working Communities and Working Cities initiatives boost\nlocal collaborative leadership to enhance economic vibrancy in smaller industrial and rural areas. This\nVermont team chose to focus on housing related strategies to expand economic opportunity. See\nSupporting Growth in Smaller Industrial Cities and Rural Communities - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, June 24, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nare additional dwellings that share a lot with a primary home.11 Many residents were unsure how to take\nadvantage of the new policy. The local Working Communities participants stepped in to help guide\nhomeowners through the process – expanding housing supply, and ultimately helping families build\nwealth.12\nThese are just a few examples of the work that Reserve Banks can assist with and encourage at the\nlocal and regional level, in light of housing challenges – which persist nationally, and deeply affect local\neconomies. Later in the program you’ll hear about a Federal Reserve System-wide effort to elevate the\nhousing work happening across many Reserve Banks.\nConcluding Observations\nI’ll conclude by highlighting that individuals, families, and communities are profoundly affected by\nchallenges with access to housing they can afford. It is clear that no single institution or sector can solve\nthe many challenges we’ll hear about today. And recognizing that the current crisis developed over many\ndecades, this will take time and persistence.\nThese issues are both urgent and important. Addressing them will require continued creative thinking\nand collaboration across the public and private sectors, as well as among practitioners, researchers, and\ncommunity leaders. It will take all of us.\nThank you all for bringing your expertise and commitment to this critical, difficult constellation of\nissues. Now, I look forward to hearing from Daniel McCue of the Harvard Joint Center on Housing Studies\n– and to an informative, engaging set of discussions, as we continue this essential work.\n11 On ADUs, see New England has a housing shortage.

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nOctober 12, 2023\nBoston, Massachusetts\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023\nKey Takeaways\n1. Collins knows inflation is still taking a toll across New England, but inflation is moderating.\nIn her travels around New England, Collins has spoken with residents and business owners who are\ncontinuing to struggle with higher prices. But she sees the Fed making progress in its efforts to lower\ninflation, as some signs are emerging that demand and supply are realigning.\n2. Despite some favorable indicators, Collins says it’s too soon to be confident that inflation is on a\nsustained trajectory back to the Fed’s 2 percent target.\nCollins says much of the recent moderation in the core inflation measure is due to declines in core goods\ninflation, which can be traced to improvements in supply chain conditions. But she adds that firms’\nincentives to pass on these costs savings may be short-lived unless demand slows. Meanwhile, core\nservices inflation remains elevated.\n3. The recovery from the pandemic has been unusual, and Collins says that in this highly uncertain\nenvironment, policymaking requires patience.\nCollins says that policymakers need time to draw conclusions about the data and allow special factors that\nhave been supporting near term activity to play out. She adds it’s unlikely we’ve yet seen the full effects of\nthe Fed’s actions to date, so patience is critical as policymakers weigh the risk of inflation remaining\npersistently high against the risk of activity slowing more than expected.\n4. Recent increases in long-term interest rates reinforce Collins’ view that we’re very near or\nperhaps at the peak of the current tightening cycle.\nCollins noted the 10-year Treasury yield has moved up since mid-September, and that increase has been\naccompanied by higher corporate bond yields and mortgage rates. Collins says the rise in these rates\nimplies some tightening of financial conditions, which if persistent could reduce the need for further\nmonetary policy tightening. It also reinforces her view that we are very near or perhaps at the peak of this\ntightening cycle.\n5. Collins’ travels around New England have given her insight into its strengths and challenges and\nshown her again how important community banks are to regional economic health.\nShared concerns include childcare, housing, and infrastructure. At the same time, the region benefits from\nits collective brainpower, a diverse and skilled workforce, and relatively high job opportunity. Collins says\nthe region’s banking industry plays an essential role everywhere, serving communities of all sizes and\nproviding households and businesses with the funding they need for economic health and growth.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nGood afternoon. I’m delighted to join you today, for the 22nd Annual Regional &\nCommunity Bankers Conference. I’d like to thank the team here at the Boston Fed – including\nthe Supervision, Regulation & Credit group, and our New England Public Policy Center – for\ntheir contributions to this year’s conference.\nAnd I’d like to thank all of you for attending. It’s wonderful to have banking-sector\nmembers from all parts of New England here today. In my visits to each New England state, to\nlearn from a range of stakeholders, I hear from workers, entrepreneurs, small businesses, local\nemployers, bankers, community development experts, civic leaders, and many others. It’s clear\nfrom those conversations that regional and community banks are a crucial, valued element of\nthe financial and economic infrastructure of the region.\nAnd we appreciate your constructive engagement with us at the Boston Fed. It takes all\nof us to support a safe and sound banking system, which is so essential to a vibrant and\ninclusive economy.\nIn our time today, I’ll provide some remarks before sitting down for a discussion with my\ncolleague Mike Ravid from the Fed’s regional and community supervisory team. For the most\npart, I’ll share my views about the economic outlook and monetary policy. I will also provide\nsome perspectives on banking, and talk briefly about the Fed’s work across the region and in\npayments innovation.\nBefore I begin, let me note, as always, that my remarks today are my own views. I’m not\nspeaking for any of my colleagues at other Federal Reserve Banks or at the Board of\nGovernors.\nThe Economic Outlook & Monetary Policy\nI’ll start with the economy, and highlight the impact of some of the recent data on my\nviews about the outlook and appropriate monetary policy – recognizing that some readings have\nbeen a bit surprising, such as the stronger than expected September payroll employment. The\nConsumer Price Index or CPI report for September was released this morning, and I’ll describe\nrecent trends in inflation a bit later in my remarks.\nAs you know, the Fed has a dual mandate from Congress, for price stability and\nmaximum sustained employment – and our current focus remains on bringing inflation down to\nour 2 percent target in a reasonable amount of time. Price stability is essential for a well-\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nfunctioning economy, and is an important precondition for maximum employment that is\nsustainable over time. So, reducing inflation relates to both parts of our mandate.\nHigh inflation takes a toll on everyone. As I travel around New England, I continue to\nhear about the challenges people face related to too-high inflation. Households with lower\nincomes are struggling to make ends meet and businesses are grappling with the higher costs\nand added complexity that elevated inflation brings, for planning and investment decisions.\nSo the battle with inflation is important, and in the public interest. As a result, the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised rates rapidly, relative to prior monetary policy\ntightening cycles, before shifting to a more gradual approach this summer. We have made\nsome progress on inflation, as I’ll discuss, but it is still too high. And given the persistent\nstrength in economic activity, it is too soon to determine whether the slowdown in price growth\nwill continue.\nOverall, I continue to believe that the current phase of policy requires patience, allowing\nus time to review available information holistically, to separate the signal from the noise in the\ndata, and to balance competing risks.\nOutlook\nA few weeks ago, the FOMC released its Summary of Economic projections or SEP,\nreflecting the outlook of participants (the Fed Governors and Reserve Bank presidents).1 The\nmedian SEP forecast is for inflation to near our target by 2025-26, as still-hot labor market\nconditions normalize. Further, the median forecast sees the appropriate monetary policy to\nachieve such an outcome involving an additional 25 basis points increase in the federal funds\nrate this year, and then holding rates in restrictive territory for an extended period.\nThis outlook in the SEP remains similar to my own. I believe we may be at, or very near,\nthe peak for this cycle, although I would not take further tightening off the table yet. And looking\nbeyond the “how high” discussion to focus on the “how long” part of this tightening cycle, I will\nsay I expect rates may have to stay higher for longer than previous SEP forecasts had\nsuggested.\nLet me add that I continue to be a “realistic optimist,” and I think that perspective is\nimportant to emphasize. I’m realistic about the uncertainties and risks to my baseline outlook.\n1 Summary of Economic Projections, September 20, 2023 (federalreserve.gov)\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nBut I am optimistic that price stability can be restored with an orderly slowdown in activity, and\nonly a modest increase in the unemployment rate to cool the mismatch in labor demand and\nsupply.\nProgress Realigning Demand and Supply\nAs you know, recent reports on real economic activity have been strong, and overall\ndemand remains resilient. Payroll growth jumped in September, with upward revisions to job\ngains for July and August. And although the average pace of job gains has slowed this year\nrelative to 2022, it remains well above trend.\nSince demand outstripping supply in the labor markets has been a key factor driving\nwage pressures, and hence price pressures, some further rebalancing will be required for the\ndeceleration we have seen in inflation to be sustained. With rates in restrictive territory, I do\nexpect that payroll growth and economic activity more generally will slow in the coming months.\nThere is already some evidence of demand and supply realigning in the labor market,\neven though it remains strong overall, with unemployment still near historic lows. On the\ndemand side, the previously very high voluntary quit rate has fallen to pre-pandemic levels. Job\nvacancies have also been trending down overall, and are a good bit below their peak – though\nthey remain elevated, and posted a surprising increase in August.\nWe are also seeing promising developments in terms of labor supply. Labor force\nparticipation has increased, especially for prime-age workers (those aged 25 to 54), and since\nthe second half of 2022, there has been a noticeable pickup in employment of foreign-born\nworkers, helping to alleviate labor shortages in some areas.\nAnd importantly, despite the tight labor market, average hourly earnings growth\ncontinued to slow through September — especially on a 3-month annualized basis. This is\nconsistent with increased supply helping to alleviate some of the wage pressures. These\ndevelopments are promising, but to be sure demand and supply are coming into better\nalignment, we will need to see the recent labor market trends continue and broaden, including a\nmoderation of hiring to a near-trend pace. This would be evidence of the sustained cooling in\nthe labor markets needed to bring inflation to 2 percent in a reasonable amount of time.\nIn addition, strong job growth and the overall tight labor market continue to support\nconsumption, which was quite solid in July and August. High frequency data suggest spending\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nmay have slowed in September, but we will have to see whether this is borne out in the official\nretail sales release next week.\nIndeed, household expenditures have remained remarkably resilient to date, even in the\nface of tighter financial conditions. This continued strength is also likely due in part to healthy\nhousehold balance sheets from savings accumulated during the pandemic. These stockpiles\nare diminishing, but recent data revisions suggest the possibility of somewhat higher remaining\nexcess saving than previously thought – which could support household spending a bit longer,\ngoing forward. Still, we are seeing some signs of consumers becoming more financially\nconstrained as credit usage is rising and delinquency rates are increasing. So faced with high\ninterest rates, it is unlikely that consumption will remain as resilient going forward.\nInflation\nTurning to inflation, I will focus on the core measure, which excludes the important but\nvolatile food and energy components, since it is typically a better gauge of underlying trends\nthan total inflation. Core inflation, whether measured by the CPI or the PCE price index, has\nmoderated but a key question is whether the recent progress will be sustained. Today’s CPI\nrelease is a reminder that restoring price stability will take time.\nDisaggregating the key components of this measure provides valuable insight into the\ndrivers of recent movements. Much of the positive news comes from declines in core goods\nprice inflation, helped by the improvement in supply conditions. But firms’ incentives to pass the\ncosts savings from supply chain improvements through to prices may be short-lived, unless\ndemand slows.\nHousing or shelter inflation is moderating overall, but the September pickup in CPI\nshelter inflation – driven in part by the volatile “lodging away from home” category – highlights\nthat progress may prove uneven. In particular, we will have to see whether the recent pickup in\nhouse price growth will put further pressure on new rents, slowing the deceleration in measured\ninflation in this sector.\nThat brings me to core services excluding housing, which accounts for a significant\nportion of the consumption basket. Inflation for this component remains elevated and overall\nprogress has been limited. Bringing core non-housing services inflation down will likely require\nlabor market conditions to cool more, as labor accounts for a large share of costs in this sector.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nOverall, it is too soon to be confident that inflation is on a sustainable trajectory back to\nthe 2 percent target we associate with price stability. I’ll also note that it is important not to read\ntoo much into individual data points, or even from a few months of information. The monthly\ninflation data, for example, have always been noisy. But the variability of core inflation has\nincreased since the pandemic. Extracting underlying patterns from noisy incoming data will take\nsome time.\nPandemic Uncertainties\nI’ll say that the mixed signals we are getting from the recent data highlight the need to\nfocus on trends and take a holistic approach to interpreting incoming information and\ndetermining the implications for appropriate policy. Here I will highlight that the economic\ncircumstances surrounding the pandemic and recovery have been, and continue to be, highly\nunusual.\nYesterday I spoke at length at Wellesley College about the role of uncertainty in\npolicymaking, notably after an episode like the pandemic.2 While the nature of the uncertainty\nhas evolved, there is currently a high degree of uncertainty about economic indicators, including\naround underlying inflation conditions and employment growth.\nAs a result, this phase of policy requires considerable patience. Policymakers need time\nto draw correct conclusions from the incoming data and to allow some special factors that have\nbeen supporting near-term activity – and perhaps limiting the impact of higher interest rates on\nthe economy – to play out. This includes households’ excess savings that I mentioned earlier,\nas well as firms’ elevated cash holdings and debt previously refinanced at low rates. As\nconsumers’ savings and firms’ cash holdings decline further, and more corporate debt needs to\nbe refinanced, tight credit conditions should act to restrain activity. We will need to continue\nmonitoring these trends carefully.\nSince it is likely that we have yet to see the full effects of our past policy actions,\npatience is also needed in order to best weigh the risk of inflation remaining persistently high\nagainst the risk of activity slowing more than expected. I recognize that higher short-term rates\nmay place additional pressure on some banks' balance sheets and reduce bank credit provision\n2 Reflections on Phasing Policy Amidst (Pandemic) Uncertainty – 2023 Goldman Lecture at Wellesley\nCollege.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nmore than anticipated. I’ll also note that, before the FOMC meeting at the end of this month, we\nwill receive additional, important data on inflation and real activity that will help me, and the\ncommittee, in making an informed policy decision.\nLonger-Term Rates\nFinally, as we consider appropriate policy, it is important to take movements in long-term\ninterest rates into account. Since mid-September, the 10-year Treasury yield has moved up\nnoticeably, though it retreated a bit this week. However, on net, this yield is now somewhat\nhigher, as are corporate bond yields and mortgage rates. Several factors may be driving these\noverall gains in long-term yields, and it will be important to see whether the increase is\nsustained, especially given the rate volatility in recent days.\nImportantly, the rise in long-term yields implies some tightening of financial conditions. If\nit persists, it likely reduces the need for further monetary policy tightening in the near term. This\nreinforces my view that we are very near, and perhaps at, the peak federal funds rates for this\ntightening cycle.\nIn sum, I believe the current phase of the monetary policy requires patience and a\nholistic assessment of available data, while we stay the course to restore price stability. I\nexpect we’ll need to hold rates at restrictive levels for some time – until we see evidence that\ninflation is on a sustained path back to 2 percent.\nPatience will give us time to carefully separate signal from noise as we assess the\nincoming data. It will also allow us to balance risks, as the effects of tighter policy continue to\nwork through the economy.\nNew England’s Economy and Banking Sector\nI’ll now turn from the national economy to the regional economy, building from my\ncolleague Jeff Thompson’s remarks earlier today. In my travels around New England, I’ve\nlearned about unique challenges and economic strengths, as well as common threads that exist\nacross much of the region. The challenges I hear about that prevent people from participating\nin the economy or the workforce include real economic issues like childcare, housing, and\ninfrastructure such as transportation and broadband. In addition, pockets of the region face\npersistent social and economic challenges. Those gaps for people and places are essential to\nrecognize, and can be hidden by overall aggregates that are quite favorable.\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nI also hear about and see New England’s many economic strengths. Among them: the\nregion’s collective brainpower, a diverse and skilled workforce, and an ecosystem of innovation.\nNew England is home to world-class institutions and organizations in many fields. Additionally,\nwe are fortunate that job opportunities have historically been plentiful in this region – though\nwith some variation by area.\nAnother strength is the region’s unique regional and community banking industry. Your\nbanks serve households and businesses in communities large and small. Of course, banks\nface challenges apart from those linked to the current interest rate environment. Evolving\ncustomer preferences require increasing investment in technology, and you’re seeing increased\nmargin pressure related to competition for deposits and competition from new market entrants.\nI want to recognize the critical role that banks of all sizes play in creating vibrant,\ninclusive economies. Community banks have remained resilient as they continue to leverage\nthe close working relationships they have within smaller cities, towns, and rural areas.\nCommunity banks provide critical sources of funding for small businesses. This was\ndemonstrated, for example, when the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program was\nimplemented, and community banks played a major role in ensuring those funds reached\nbusinesses.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has noted that a robust and dynamic banking system, along\nwith effective and efficient regulation and supervision, helps ensure that banks of all sizes can\nmeet the needs of households and businesses in every community, in good times and bad. I\nfully agree that we must preserve and build on these strengths, and that diversity.\nThe Federal Reserve and the New England Region\nAs I conclude, I’ll say just a bit about the Fed’s activities. I like to say that our\noverarching mission at the Boston Fed is supporting a vibrant, inclusive economy that works for\neveryone. As you know, an economy’s strength has many dimensions, so the Fed has a broad\nportfolio of activities and engagements, all in the public interest. It includes monetary\npolicymaking, economic research and analysis, bank supervision, financial stability work, and\nserving as lender of last resort for banks. We’re also involved in community and economic\ndevelopment activities and initiatives and infrastructure related to payments, technology, and\nfinance. All of it supports our mission and our mandate.\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nI’ll briefly mention some of our work to expand opportunities throughout New England so\nthat everyone can participate in the economy. Since 2014, we have focused on encouraging\nlocal efforts to bring economic revitalization to smaller cities and rural areas that have faced\nlong-term struggles. We call this initiative “Working Places.” Our approach is based on\nresearch that shows that an essential element of place-based economic resilience is\ncollaboration among local individuals from different sectors who are willing to share leadership.\nIn nine years, Working Places has expanded to 30 communities in five New England states.\nThe Fed’s work helps local, collaborative networks emerge and flourish. Communities\nparticipating in Working Places report solving problems, making changes that create\nopportunities and jobs, and enlisting new voices and partners to shape progress. Local teams\ndevelop goals and strategies in areas including workforce development, poverty reduction,\naffordable housing, and removing barriers to entrepreneurship. Local, tangible efforts like these\nare adding up to real strength in our region.\nAdditionally, I’d like to mention the Fed’s work in payments innovation. Since its\nfounding, the Federal Reserve has played a role in ensuring the country’s payments\ninfrastructure can effectively meet the public’s needs. We demonstrate this commitment\nthrough continuous improvements to our financial services, and by taking accountability for safe,\naccessible, and efficient payments. As everyone in this room knows, the U.S. payments system\n– the way consumers, workers, and employers make and receive payments – has evolved\nmightily over time. Not that long ago, the Fed was helping move checks around the country.\nBut we worked with the banking industry to digitize check clearing, and create other automated\nchannels. In July, the Fed launched the FedNow® Service, a new payments “rail” to make\ninstant payments secure and convenient. FedNow enables instant payments to be processed\nat any time of day, on any day of the year, for a broad array of transactions. The FedNow\nService is core payments infrastructure available to all depository institutions.\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I’ll note that since its inception 110 years ago, and by design, the U.S.\ncentral bank has deep and varied interactions with banks and bankers. These range from\npreserving safety and soundness, to managing and improving payments infrastructure, to\npromoting access to credit that facilitates economic progress. I look forward to continuing to\n8\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, October 12, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nwork together to support the people and places of New England – and the nation – with a\nvibrant, inclusive economy and financial system.\nWith that, thank you for the opportunity to be with you today. I look forward to sitting\ndown with Mike for some questions.\n9",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nFebruary 7, 2024\nHeld at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nKey Takeaways\n1. The U.S. economy overall performed remarkably well in 2023. Inflation slowed notably last\nyear, while the job market remained quite favorable. These very encouraging trends have\nreinforced Collins’ optimism that we are on a path to price stability with a healthy job market.\n2. However, Collins says she will need to see more evidence that the disinflationary process will\ncontinue before beginning to carefully adjust the monetary policy stance. Recent developments in\nthe economic data highlight that progress toward achieving the Fed’s mandated goals could be\nuneven, and more time is needed to discern whether some of the promising economic trends we\nsaw in 2023 will both broaden and persist, going forward.\n3. In Collins’ view, the threat of inflation settling persistently above the Committee’s 2 percent\ntarget has receded, and risks to the economy overall are moving into better balance. Still, a\nsustained, durable return to 2 percent inflation will likely require demand growing at a more\nmoderate pace this year. Collins sees the current stance of monetary policy as consistent with\nachieving this outcome.\n4. Collins says policy should reflect the commitment to restoring price stability while also aiming\nto preserve the more-equitable outcomes seen in this recovery. In the current environment,\nappropriate policy requires an assessment of the incoming data that is holistic and increasingly\nfocused on implications for the economic outlook. While not on a preset path, she believes it will\nlikely become appropriate to begin easing policy restraint later this year.\n5. Collins also notes that overall, the strength of an economy has many dimensions. In this\nregard, the Federal Reserve is involved in a breadth of activities, all in the public interest – to\nsupport a vibrant economy that works for all: monetary policymaking, economic research, bank\nsupervision, infrastructure and services for the financial system, and supporting collaborations\nthat expand prospects for progress in communities.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIt is my great pleasure to welcome the Boston Economic Club back to the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston. I had a chance to greet you last February, for the\nevent featuring Neel Kashkari and Roger Lowenstein, and I’m really delighted to be with\nyou today. We appreciate that the Club chooses to hold its meetings here at the Bank\neach month – and certainly want the Boston Fed to be a key place for those who study\nthe economy to gather.\nOur focus here at the Boston Fed is on policies and services that support a\nvibrant economy that provides opportunities for everyone. And we share the Club’s\ninterest in a frank exchange of views, rigorous use of data, and focus on important\ntopics with the potential for impact.\nI should mention, as always, that my remarks represent my own views, not\nnecessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\nThe Promise and Potential of New England\nAt the Boston Fed, our district includes just about all of New England, and I take\nseriously my commitment to all six states, visiting each one at least annually.\nExchanging perspective with a wide range of stakeholders in the economy is vital to\npolicymaking – and is meaningful, inspiring, and really enjoyable.\nAlthough I lived in New England at an earlier stage of my career, I have been\nable to return with “fresh eyes” and note some of what makes it wonderful. Without\nquestion the talent and brainpower in so many fields – certainly economics and finance\namong them – make this region very special.\nToday we’re gathered in Boston. Extraordinary problem solving has occurred\nhere, creating better living standards and entire industries – in medicine, technology,\nand financial products, to name a few. We have amazing talent and institutions here.\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nI mention this because we live in a world of challenges, and Greater Boston and\nNew England face many – including housing supply and expense; transportation\ninfrastructure; access to dependent care, and the potential for climate shifts to affect\nassets or expenses.1\nBut we have an immense capacity for innovation and problem solving, as we’ve\nshown. I look forward to what we can accomplish in New England to support a vibrant\neconomy that works for all. I am optimistic about what we can accomplish when we\ncare, collaborate, study, and act.\nThe Boston’s Fed’s Portfolio and Mission\nI’d like to highlight some of the ways the Boston Fed reflects that spirit of\ninnovation and problem-solving. As you know, the strength of an economy has many\ndimensions – so the Federal Reserve, our nation’s Central Bank, is involved in a\nnumber of activities, all in the public interest. Most people know us for monetary policy,\nand the research that underpins it. We’re also supervisors of some of the nation’s\nfinancial institutions, and provide back-end infrastructure and services for the financial\nsystem. And we examine factors that could limit people from participating in the\neconomy, and support research and collaborations that expand prospects for progress\nin communities.\nI’ll mention just two examples of Boston Fed innovation.\nFirst, many parts of New England that were once centers for manufacturing or\nnatural resources have faced long-term challenges. Our Working Places initiative,2\n1 See, for example, the following work by Boston Fed staff:\n▪ The Effects of Weather on Massachusetts Municipal Expenditures: Implications of Climate Change\nfor Local Governments in New England (bostonfed.org)\n▪ Early Child Care for Working Parents (bostonfed.org); Podcast Season 2: A Private Crisis - Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston\n▪ Housing and rent prices with Paul Willen - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nstarted under my predecessor Eric Rosengren, is based on research showing that an\nessential element of place-based economic resurgence is local, cross-sector\ncollaboration. Now in 30 communities across 5 states, teams of local leaders choose a\nshared goal for improving the economy that benefits low-income people – for example,\ncreatively supporting workforce development, affordable housing, or childcare supply; or\nremoving barriers to entrepreneurship. They develop and implement strategies. The\nFed hosts, convenes, and supports these efforts – but not financially. The real work is\nin local ingenuity and commitment.\nSecond, I mentioned the Fed’s work on payments. It wasn’t so long ago that\npaper checks had to be physically flown around the country to settle at the bank they\nwere drawn on – a slow, costly necessity. The Boston Fed and others helped pioneer\ndigital check imaging, and expanded automated clearing of electronic payments – and\nmore recently, creation of an entirely new interbank system for instant payments, the\nFedNow Service.3\nWhen fully available, instant payments will provide substantial benefits for\nconsumers and businesses, including rapid access to funds, or just-in-time payments to\nmanage cash flows in bank accounts. The FedNow Service can help workers in the gig\neconomy get access to their wages on completing their shifts; help consumers pay a bill\non its due date, avoiding a late fee; and help small businesses get instant proceeds to\nhelp cash flow.\nWhile I’m always happy to talk more about all we do, today, I’ll focus the rest of\nmy remarks on the economy, monetary policy and my outlook, and then will look\nforward to taking questions.\n2 I discussed this work in more detail in this talk: “The National and Regional Economy: Navigating Near-\nterm Changes and Long-term Challenges” (bostonfed.org). And one can learn more about the Bank’s\nwork to support growth in smaller cities and rural areas at https://www.bostonfed.org/community-\ndevelopment/supporting-growth-in-smaller-industrial-cities.aspx\n3 Learn more about the FedNow® Service at https://explore.fednow.org/about\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThe National Economy and Fed Policy\nEconomic outcomes last year surpassed most observers’ expectations, including\nmy own. Growth and the labor market remained quite strong, while inflation slowed\nnotably.\nAs some of you know, I have described myself as a “realistic optimist” for well\nover a year now. These very encouraging trends have reinforced my optimism that we\nare on a path to price stability, with inflation durably at 2 percent, and a healthy labor\nmarket. However, the “realistic” part is important as well – uncertainty remains\nelevated, and there are risks to my outlook – although those risks are coming into better\nbalance.\nLast Friday’s data release showing a surprisingly strong labor market is a case in\npoint – and in this case, good news. Still, it helps illustrate the logic in methodically\nwaiting for more evidence that the economy is sustainably on that desired path, before\nbeginning a policy adjustment.\nThese are the issues I’d like to discuss with you today. To do so, I’ll start by\nhighlighting key aspects of recent economic performance, then discuss my outlook, and\nthe implications for policy.\nRecent Economic Performance\nAs I mentioned, the U.S. economy overall performed remarkably well in 2023.\nGDP growth, at 3.1 percent, defied widespread pessimistic forecasts made at the end of\n2022. The unemployment rate remained historically low – below 4 percent – with strong\noverall employment gains and healthy wage increases.\nThese positive developments were accompanied by greater progress on inflation\nthan most anticipated. Headline and core inflation, where the latter excludes volatile\nfood and energy prices, were both around 2 percent over the last 6 months of 2023.\nThey had been above 3 percent and 4 percent, respectively, in the second half of 2022.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nBy the way, obviously food and energy are vital, but we focus on core inflation because\nit has been shown to be a strong predictor of future inflation trends.\nNormally, strong economic activity tends to raise inflationary pressures. The fact\nthat this did not occur indicates significant, favorable supply-side developments, which\ntend to be disinflationary. In particular, last year’s improvements in the economy’s\nproductive capacity were driven by further resolution of supply chain bottlenecks; a\nrebound in labor supply, in part driven by immigration; and increased labor productivity\nin some sectors.\nImportantly, these positive economic developments have continued to be\nunusually equitable, a point highlighted by Cecilia Rouse, former chair of the Council of\nEconomic Advisers and now president of the Brookings Institution, at our economic\nconference last fall, which some of you attended.4 The rise in labor force participation\namong working-age individuals was widespread across racial and other demographic\ngroups. I have heard from contacts in New England that some employers have\nincreased efforts to train workers and are exploring ways to find untapped talent. This\nshould continue expanding opportunities for people who typically face greater\nchallenges finding employment.\nIn this strong labor market, with unemployment rates near historic lows, many\nworkers have also moved into better jobs. Aggregate wage growth was around 5\npercent in 2022 and 4 percent last year, and wage gains have been especially favorable\nand sustained for lower-paying occupations. While such developments cannot be taken\n4 Dr. Rouse’s presentation can be found at https://youtu.be/inRU_TPE3z4. All the conference materials\nand videos can be found at https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/events/economic-research-\nconference-series/rethinking-full-employment.aspx. The conference provided analysis of factors that likely\nprevent some people from participating fully in the labor market, even when the overall economy is\nthriving. Conference presenters explored past and current thinking on measuring full employment, paying\nparticular attention to the role of long-term labor market trends as well as to more recent changes in labor\nmarket structure. Participants also discussed recent research on how monetary policy can be conducted\nto achieve full employment and price stability at the same time.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nfor granted, they represent tangible progress toward achieving a more broad-based and\ninclusive notion of full employment.5\nThe Outlook\nGiven the positive economic news, what can we expect going forward? And\nwhat can monetary policy do to achieve price stability at the 2 percent target, while\nmaintaining a healthy labor market?\nAn open question is how much longer supply-side progress will continue. While\nwe may see some more labor force growth, the prospects for additional labor supply\nimprovements seem somewhat limited. And although there may be some further effects\non consumer prices from the past resolution of supply chain bottlenecks, most of that is\nlikely behind us. Also, productivity is always difficult to forecast. Many businesses,\nespecially in the services sector, have learned to operate effectively with fewer workers\n– but there is likely a limit to how far this process can go.\nSo, while we may still get some positive supply-side news, a durable return to 2\npercent inflation will likely require demand growing at a more moderate pace this year. I\nexpect this slowdown will happen, but the timing is difficult to predict, and the road may\nwell be bumpy.\nTo be clear, the current stance of monetary policy is consistent with achieving\nthis outcome. However, the balance sheets of both households and businesses are\nstronger today than in prior periods when the Fed needed to restrain demand to achieve\nprice stability. I will not be surprised if demand remains fairly robust in the early part of\n2024. Consumer spending could remain elevated in the near term, given income from\n5 As I pointed out in remarks at the Bank’s 67th Economic Conference (my remarks entitled “Full\nEmployment: A Broad-Based, Inclusive Goal”), no one statistic can adequately characterize the labor\nmarket because aggregate numbers can mask the wide range of experiences across people, sectors, and\nplaces. Uneven labor market outcomes call for a full and focused exploration, motivated by the duty to\npursue the Fed’s maximum employment mandate from Congress. For some people, communities, and\nplaces, there are substantial and persistent gaps in economic outcomes – including but not limited to\nemployment. This underutilization of the workforce adversely affects national productivity and prosperity.\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nthe strong labor market and the wealth some households have accumulated in the\naftermath of the pandemic. And many companies still have ample internal sources to\nfinance their expenditures, although increased credit costs are starting to affect capital\ninvestment decisions. Further, the unexpected strength in recent GDP and labor market\ndata exemplifies the on-going resilience of demand, and highlights that the anticipated\nslowdown in activity may take some time.\nHowever, I do see some signs consistent with an expected demand moderation.\nDelinquencies on credit card and auto loans have risen briskly and are around pre-\npandemic levels. And some consumers are becoming more reliant on revolving debt to\nfinance their expenditures. Orders for capital goods excluding aircraft are slowing,\nsuggesting that businesses are becoming increasingly sensitive to higher financing\ncosts.\nAnd despite the recent hiring strength, there are indications of the labor market\nnormalizing at healthy levels. In particular, job turnover rates have declined noticeably\nsince the first half of 2023, and job openings are down, especially in more cyclical\nsectors.\nOverall, these developments imply that the risks related to inflation and economic\nactivity are coming into better balance. In addition to the points I’ve discussed, many\nmeasures of inflation expectations have returned to pre-pandemic levels. This all\nsuggests to me that the risk of inflation running persistently above the Committee’s\ntarget, while still there, has receded.\nPolicy Implications\nIn this context, I think that policy needs to reflect a steadfast commitment to\nrestoring price stability – following through on the progress we have made – while also\naiming to preserve the more-equitable economic outcomes seen in this recovery. And I\nremain cognizant of the geopolitical and other risks around my baseline outlook.\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThis brings me to what I plan to focus on going forward, as I monitor economic\ndevelopments and consider appropriate policy. I certainly believe policy should remain\ndata dependent and that it is not appropriate to specify a pre-set path. Given the\nprogress to date and the more balanced risk environment, my holistic assessment of\navailable data will focus on gaining additional confidence in the baseline forecast of\nsustained low inflation with a healthy labor market.\nIt is important to recognize that the path the economy takes toward the Fed’s\nmandated goals may continue to be bumpy and uneven, and we should not overreact to\nindividual data points. To my thinking, that reflects the realities of a unique and\nchallenging pandemic and the economic recovery from it. Expecting all indicators to be\nwell aligned is too high a bar, but seeing sustained, broadening signs of progress\nshould provide the necessary confidence I would need to begin a methodical\nadjustment to our policy stance.\nTo this end, here are a few of the (many!) developments I will be watching\nclosely: I continue to look at the components of inflation – not because the composition\nmatters for achieving our target, but because different components behave differently.\nHousing as well as non-shelter service price inflation are taking longer to return to their\npre-pandemic trends, and I hope to see additional progress there.\nI want to see evidence of wages evolving in a way that is ultimately consistent\nwith price stability. Here I’ll note interesting work by Boston Fed economists, which\nsuggests that, given the increases in prices and labor productivity to date, there is room\nfor wages to catch up and continue increasing at a healthy pace for some time without\nnecessarily spurring inflationary pressures.6\nIt is also important that short- as well as long-term inflation expectations remain\nwell anchored. And given the centrality of labor market developments to the outlook, I\nwill continue to look for signs of labor demand moderating in an orderly way, to a\nhealthy, sustainable balance with supply.\n6 See Is Post-pandemic Wage Growth Fueling Inflation? - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n8\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:30 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 7, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nSo, while heartened by the progress to date, I will need to see more evidence\nbefore considering adjusting the policy stance. Indeed, I fully support last week’s\nFOMC policy statement. It unambiguously reaffirms the Committee’s resolve to achieve\nand maintain our inflation target. For the moment, policy remains well positioned, as we\ncarefully assess the evolving data and outlook.\nThat said, as we gain more confidence in the economy achieving the\nCommittee’s goals, and consistent with the last set of projections from FOMC\nparticipants, I believe it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy restraint\nlater this year. A methodical, forward-looking strategy that eases policy gradually will\nprovide the flexibility to manage risks, while promoting stable prices and maximum\nemployment.\nThank you for being here today, and best wishes for 2024. Now I’m happy to\ntake some questions.\n9",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nFebruary 6, 2024\n* Organized by the Federal Reserve Board and the\nFederal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland,\nPhiladelphia, San Francisco, and St. Louis\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, February 6, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIt is a pleasure to take part in this conference, for a few reasons. First, the topic\nof persistent labor market disparities is important and timely. Second, the papers being\npresented are interesting and well done. I’ll say more about them in a moment. And to\necho Raphael Bostic yesterday, I am thrilled that the Boston Fed has joined five other\nregional Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors on this work. We really do go\nfarther when we go together.\nI am delighted to have the opportunity to provide opening remarks to today’s\nsessions. I want to start by underlining the importance of rigorously exploring\npersistently uneven labor market outcomes. Appropriately, the conference organizers\nhave rooted this effort in the Fed’s mandate from Congress, typically summarized as\nmaximum employment and price stability – the oft-cited “dual mandate.”\nOf course, the widely followed overall unemployment rate is the standard\nmeasure for the state of the U.S. labor market. But underneath that single statistic are\nwide-ranging differences across geographies, and demographic groups. No one\nstatistic can adequately characterize the labor market because aggregate numbers can\nmask the wide range of experiences across people, sectors, and places. Uneven labor\nmarket outcomes call for a full and focused exploration, motivated by our duty to pursue\nthe Fed’s maximum employment mandate.\nFor some people, communities, and places, there are substantial and persistent\ngaps in economic outcomes – including but not limited to employment. This\nunderutilization of the workforce adversely affects national productivity and prosperity.\nI often describe our work at the Boston Fed as pursuing and supporting a vibrant\neconomy that works for everyone, not just for some people. That, along with the Fed’s\nmandate, compels us to understand the challenges contributing to higher\nunemployment and underemployment present in some areas and among some\ndemographic groups – and long-run barriers to full participation in the labor market.\nThe Federal Reserve needs to parse the labor market for another reason: to\ngauge the cyclical position of the economy, thereby allowing monetary policymakers to\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, February 6, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nappropriately calibrate the stance of policy; and to better understand and thus achieve\nthe full-employment portion of the dual mandate.\nRegarding the labor market’s cyclical position, consider that during and after the\nGreat Recession of 2007-9, aggregate labor market participation fell significantly. To\ngauge the short-run state of the labor market, the interest-rate-setting Federal Open\nMarket Committee needed to understand how much of this decline was cyclical, and\nhow much was structural. Undoubtedly, many people dropped out of the labor force due\nto the cyclical situation – a poor job market. But structural factors, most notably the\naging of the population, also played a role. Disentangling the relative contribution and\npersistence of cyclical and structural factors was key to formulating and implementing\nan appropriate policy response.\nUnderstanding the behavior of labor force participation is important, because\nwhen participation changes, the unemployment rate becomes an inadequate indicator\nof full employment. If participation increases in a tight labor market, labor supply\nexpands – and higher levels of economic activity may not generate additional price\npressures, requiring tighter monetary policy. And higher levels of activity and\nparticipation can benefit those drawn into the labor market.\nWe know that many structural factors impact participation. Examples include the\nlong-running decline in job opportunities for less-educated workers, which has\nparticularly affected prime-age men; and the high cost and limited availability of\nchildcare, which tends to reduce participation among women with children. As I travel\naround my district – New England – and speak to a wide variety of stakeholders, I hear\nabout issues that impede participation in the workforce, which is a challenge not only for\nindividuals but also for employers. In this way, issues like childcare can really affect the\neconomy.\nOf course, monetary policy is not the right tool to address these types of\nstructural labor market frictions. However, Fed economists can, and do, conduct\nrigorous research on structural issues, and we convene conferences like this to discuss\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, February 6, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nour own work and that of others. These kinds of intellectual exchanges reflect, as I\nnoted earlier, the Federal Reserve’s mandate to promote full employment.\nLast fall, the annual Boston Fed economic conference focused on the question of\nhow best to define and promote full employment – “maximum sustained employment.” I\nrecommend the papers and sessions to you.1 Presenters paid particular attention to\nbarriers preventing many individuals from fully participating in the labor market.\nConference participants analyzed gaps in employment along racial and gender lines;\ndiscussed the effectiveness of job-training programs; learned about new ways of\nmeasuring the gig economy; and analyzed the barriers to employment faced by\nindividuals who had contact with the criminal justice system.\nLike that conference, today’s discussion brings together rigorous, thoughtful,\ncreative researchers to explore policy-relevant issues, in service to the public good.\nConvenings like these demonstrate the power of inquiry and collaboration.\nToday’s session turns to dimensions of a particularly important facet of this work\n– the experiences of women and men in the workforce, and the economic and cultural\nfactors affecting individual decisions about workforce engagement.\nI want to thank today’s speakers for the research they’ve conducted, and will\nshare with us, on how some incentives and barriers drive differing labor force\nparticipation decisions and experiences for men and women.\nEach of the papers illuminates one or more ways gender differences in\nemployment and participation can arise. Let me mention a highlight or two:\n The Xu paper highlights how weak labor markets during economic downturns\ncan actually increase participation for some workers. For example, a woman\nmay enter the labor force in response to her spouse being laid off.\n1 Conference material and session videos are available at https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-\nevents/events/economic-research-conference-series/rethinking-full-employment.aspx\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 2:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, February 6, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n The Buzard et al. paper considers how stereotypes about parental availability\ncan worsen gender inequality in the labor market. Because mothers are called\nmuch more frequently than fathers when issues arise for their child at school,\nwomen face an implicit barrier to labor force participation.\n The Bengali et al. paper considers the factors behind declining participation by\nprime-age men. While changing demographics explain little of this decline,\nincreased caregiving by men plays some role. However, the authors find the\nlargest contributor to the rise in male nonparticipation is skills mismatch. The\nauthors further document that these factors, and the rise in nonparticipation\ngenerally, are more pronounced for prime-age Black men.\n The Goerge et al. paper uses random variation generated in the administration of\nchildcare subsidies to test whether such subsidies raise maternal employment\nand earnings. The results indicate that childcare subsidies have a positive and\nstatistically significant effect on maternal employment. The authors also find that\ndifferences in total earnings induced by the policies, while not statistically\nsignificant, were in the same positive direction and about the same size as the\nemployment effects.\nThat is just a preview of the great research we will hear about today. My thanks\nto all the organizers, contributors, and attendees.\nNow I’ll turn the floor to Richard Reeves, founder and president of the American\nInstitute for Boys and Men, and a longtime thought leader at Brookings.\nThank you.\n3",

    "text": "Remarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nReflections on Uncertainty and Patience\nin Monetary Policymaking\nRemarks at the Sloan School of Management\nat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nSusan M. Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nMay 8, 2024\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nKey Takeaways\n1. Collins remains optimistic that inflation can be brought back to 2 percent in a\nreasonable amount of time and with a labor market that remains healthy. But she is\nrealistic about the risks and uncertainties around that outlook. Uncertainty remains high in\nterms of the timing and full impact of monetary policy.\n2. Stronger-than-anticipated inflation and economic activity suggest that achieving the\nFed’s dual mandate goals may take longer than previously thought, and progress may\nbe uneven. Monetary policymaking in the current context requires patience and methodical\nassessment of the available constellation of information.\n3. There was noticeable progress last year towards price stability, driven largely by\nfavorable supply developments (including labor productivity). But such rapid supply\nimprovements may not continue, making demand moderation important. Collins expects\nthat slower growth will be needed to achieve a better balance with supply and ensure the\neconomy remains on a path towards price stability.\n4. The current policy stance, which Collins views as being moderately restrictive, is\nappropriate for balancing the current two-sided risks (of easing too soon or holding too\nlong). Given the restrictive stance, Collins expects economic activity will eventually slow as\nneeded for inflation to durably return to target. And she believes policy is well positioned to\nrespond to incoming data, as the FOMC assesses the evolving outlook and risks.\n5. Collins believes that the economy’s rebalancing also depends on demand and supply in\nthe labor market coming into better alignment. Focusing on the relationship between\nwages and prices, she notes that labor productivity trends have been favorable and should\nultimately be reflected in higher compensation for workers. In this context, she believes there\nis scope for wages to catch up to past price and productivity increases over time without\ngenerating additional inflationary pressures.\n6. In assessing whether conditions are consistent with a potential easing of interest rates,\nCollins highlighted four areas of particular focus. She will be looking for short- and longer-\nterm inflation expectations remaining well anchored. And for further sustained disinflation –\nespecially in the components that remain most elevated. She’ll look for evidence that wages\ncontinue to evolve in a way that is consistent with price stability. And for ongoing indications\nthat labor markets are moderating in an orderly way that better aligns labor supply and\ndemand.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today. My sincere thanks to Professor Kristin\nForbes for inviting me, and to her colleagues at the Sloan School for hosting, including\nEdward Golding of the Golub Center for Finance and Policy.\nAs a former educator, I always enjoy being with students on campus. And this\nvisit is particularly special since I earned my Ph.D. here at MIT. My time in the\neconomics department was excellent preparation for a varied career – it involved lots of\nwork; lots of learning; genuine investment from remarkable faculty; and many wonderful,\nlong-lasting relationships.\nToday I’d like to share my perspectives on the U.S. economy and monetary\npolicy, as the Fed works to achieve its dual mandate from Congress in support of a\nvibrant economy. These comments reflect my own views, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC), the Fed’s interest rate setting committee.\nI’ll begin with a quick overview of the Federal Reserve and its varied roles in the\neconomy and financial system; then discuss the economy’s performance during the\npost-pandemic recovery, and monetary policy’s role in restoring price stability. Let me\npreview my core policy perspective: I’m committed to bringing inflation sustainably back\nto our 2 percent target. While realistic about the risks and uncertainties, I remain\noptimistic that this can be accomplished in a reasonable amount of time and with a labor\nmarket that remains healthy. But there is significant uncertainty around that outlook, and\nthe recent data lead me to believe this will take more time than previously thought.\nThere is no pre-set path for policy – it requires decisions based on a methodical, holistic\nassessment of wide-ranging information.\nThe Boston’s Fed’s Portfolio and Mission\nCongress established the Fed as the U.S. central bank more than 110 years ago.\nOur responsibilities all involve the strength and stability of the economy and the financial\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nsystem, in the public interest. Economies have many dimensions, so the Fed’s work has\na broad range. I like to say the Boston Fed’s mission is supporting a vibrant, inclusive\neconomy that works for everyone, not just for some people.\nThere are 12 Federal Reserve Districts – and the Boston Fed’s district (the First\nDistrict) includes most of New England. We actively engage with stakeholders across\nthe six states – to learn about economic experiences, challenges, and opportunities;\nand to provide transparency about what the Fed does, and why.\nThe Fed is best known for monetary policymaking, and the analysis and research\nthat underpins it. We also supervise some of the nation’s financial institutions, and\nprovide back-end infrastructure and services for payments and the financial system.\nAnd we examine factors that could limit people from participating in the economy –\nmotivated by our full-employment mandate – and support research and collaborations\nthat expand prospects for community economic development.\nSince I’m at MIT, I’ll mention that the Federal Reserve – particularly the Boston\nFed – has helped encourage innovation in financial technologies and payments\nsystems, which we all rely on. We played key roles in the emergence of automated\nclearing, check imaging, and digitized procurement and payment tools for the U.S.\nTreasury. More recently, we worked – with MIT researchers – to explore the potential\nfor a central bank digital currency, deepening our understanding and preparation in\ncase Congress asks for one. And we recently built and launched FedNow, an instant-\npayments rail that enables all financial institutions to provide their customers with real-\ntime payments.1\nI’ll turn now to the economy, my outlook, and monetary policy, referencing a few\ncharts along the way.\n1 For example, FedNow enables individuals to instantly receive their paychecks and use them the same\nday, and small businesses to more efficiently manage cash flows without processing delays. Over the\ncoming years, customers of banks and credit unions that sign up for the service should be able to use\ntheir financial institution’s interfaces to send payments instantly and securely.

The left panel shows inflation,\nusing the Fed’s preferred PCE measure.2 The blue line is total 12-month inflation, while\nthe red line is core inflation, which excludes the volatile though obviously important\ncategories of food and energy. The green line shows the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation\ntarget. The panel on the right depicts the unemployment rate, which typically recovers\ngradually after rising during recessions. The post-pandemic recovery has been highly\nunusual. After spiking, unemployment fell quickly and has now been below 4 percent\nsince December 2021.\nThe chart further shows that, while significantly down from its peak, inflation\nremains above target. High inflation is like a tax that affects all of us. In my travels\naround New England, people share many examples of its challenges. Its toll is\nespecially large for lower-income households, struggling to make ends meet. High\ninflation also affects firms, complicating their budgeting and pricing decisions. A high\ninflation environment is not consistent with maximum sustainable employment, which\nhighlights the complementary nature of the Fed’s dual mandate, over the medium and\nlonger term – and the reason my commitment to fight inflation is resolute.\nThe FOMC has been focused on bringing inflation back down to the 2 percent\ntarget, by raising the federal funds rate to slow demand and help realign it with supply in\nboth product and labor markets. After the FOMC began tightening in March 2022, rate\nhikes were unusually rapid – 525 basis points over just 16 months – moving the\nmonetary policy stance from highly accommodative to restrictive. We have kept the\nfunds rate at its current level of 5¼ to 5½ percent since July 2023, and are patiently\nassessing how long it will be appropriate to maintain this target range.\n2 The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-\nexpenditures-price-index)\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nBefore saying more about my outlook and implications for monetary policy, I’d\nlike to discuss some dimensions of this very unusual cycle. An underlying theme is that\nuncertainty – both in the data and in key economic relationships – remains elevated,\nreinforcing the need for patience.3\nThe Pandemic Shock, Rebound and Inflation Surge\nAs I already mentioned, the rebound in economic activity following the pandemic\nshock was surprisingly strong and rapid, relative to past recoveries, as depicted in\nFigure 2. Real output (GDP) is on the left, and payroll employment is on the right. For\neach chart, the blue line shows the pandemic drop and recovery, while the red line\nshows the average evolution of these measures over the previous three recessions.\nThe figure highlights the degree of disruption to economic output and\nemployment from the pandemic-related shutdowns, and the comparatively quick\nrecovery.4 Much of this rapid rebound can be attributed to the unique nature of the\npandemic-driven downturn, including highly accommodative monetary policy and an\nunprecedented degree of fiscal support.\nHowever, the fast bounce-back came at a cost. Inflation surged, sparked by\ndemand outstripping supply. Pandemic-related global production challenges, limited\nlabor availability, transportation bottlenecks, and Russia’s war in Ukraine, all worked to\nconstrain supply — a situation that was compounded by a shift in consumption patterns\n3 For more on managing uncertainties in policymaking, see my talk for the 2023 Goldman Lecture in\nEconomics at Wellesley College, “Reflections on Phasing Policy Amidst (Pandemic) Uncertainty”,\navailable at https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/speeches/2023/reflections-on-phasing-policy-\namidst-pandemic-uncertainty.aspx.\n4 These positive labor market developments have been associated with an unusually equitable recovery.\nDespite deep initial employment losses, recovery to pre-pandemic employment levels did not take longer\nfor minority groups. Wage growth has also been relatively favorable for lower-paying occupations,\nbenefitting less-advantaged groups. These points were highlighted in the Boston Fed’s 2023 Economic\nConference and discussed in my recent speeches. Conference materials can be found at\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/events/economic-research-conference-series/rethinking-full-\nemployment.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\naway from services towards goods. In this context, an essential part of restoring price\nstability entails realignment through a combination of supply improvements and demand\nmoderation.\nThe surge in inflation was widespread, as is highlighted in Figure 3, which splits\ncore PCE inflation into its three main components. I find this decomposition informative,\nnot because the FOMC has sector-specific inflation targets, but because each\ncomponent has very different dynamics and determinants. The blue lines show inflation\nover a 12-month horizon, comparable to Figure 1, while the red lines show a three-\nmonth horizon, reflecting more recent data, but also more volatility (or “noise”).\nThe charts show that the run-up in core goods inflation (the left panel) was\nparticularly fast, due to households’ pandemic-related shift from spending on services\n(such as entertainment and travel) to goods (such as food at home, appliances, and\nelectronics).\nHousing inflation, and core services inflation excluding housing (the middle and\nright panels), also rose noticeably, but with a bit of a delay. The rise in housing inflation\nwas driven by a surge in rents during the pandemic recovery, in part due to shortages in\nhousing supply. And rapidly increasing labor costs contributed to the rise in inflation for\nother core services — a big, diverse sector in which wages tend to comprise a large\nshare of firms’ expenses.\nEvolving Progress toward Goals\nWhile total core PCE inflation peaked in February 2022, sustained easing of price\npressures began later in 2022, and was particularly notable in 2023, with core PCE\ninflation falling roughly 2 percentage points. This was the result of supply and demand\nmoving into better alignment. Much of the economy’s surprising performance last year,\nespecially in the second half, can be attributed to positive supply developments,\nincluding labor productivity.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIn particular, supply improvements fostered significant disinflation in the core\ngoods sector. Similarly, housing inflation moved down – with rent growth for new leases\nreturning to near pre-pandemic levels, as additional supply of rental units came online.\nAnd inflation in other core services moderated as labor supply challenges and cost\npressures improved.5\nTwo additional developments in 2023 signaled progress. The first relates to\ninflation expectations being “anchored,” or in line with readings historically associated\nwith 2 percent inflation. Because expectations are a key determinant of current\nbehavior, they influence actual inflation and its evolution, and are high on my “watch-\nlist.” Figure 4 shows a variety of expectations indicators. Longer-term expectations (the\nright panel) have remained well anchored throughout the downturn and recovery,\nconsistent with credibility in the Fed’s commitment to 2 percent inflation. However,\nshort-term inflation expectations (the left panel), which jumped in 2021, decreased to\nlevels consistent with the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target by the end of 2023.\nSecond, price changes across narrowly defined industries were much less\ncorrelated in late 2023 than they had been in 2021 and 2022. This reduced\n“synchronicity” is consistent with large price gains being less common across sectors,\nand is a characteristic of low-inflation regimes.6\nWhile some decline in inflation had been widely anticipated, output growth was\nstronger than expected at the end of 2023 — increasing 3.1 percent over the previous\n5 Labor supply improvements included both increased labor force participation of prime-age workers\n(especially women, despite dependent care challenges), and a rise in immigration. As of April 2024, the\n12-month average prime-age participation rate for men was essentially the same as before the pandemic\n(in February 2020), while the rate for prime-age women had surpassed its pre-pandemic level by a\nnoticeable margin. For more on immigration, see Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson, \"New immigration\nestimates help make sense of the pace of employment,\" March 7, 2024,\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-immigration-estimates-help-make-sense-of-the-pace-of-\nemployment/.\n6 For more details about sectoral price-change synchronicity, see Claudio Borio, Marco Lombardi, James\nYetman, and Egon Zakrajšek, 2023, “The Two-Regime View of Inflation,” BIS Papers No. 133,\nhttps://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap133.pdf.\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nyear. Given this robust growth, the realized decline in inflation was remarkable, and of\ncourse welcome.\nIt is now May 2024, and while economic activity has remained relatively robust,\nand the labor market healthy with signs of coming into better balance, we have not,\nunfortunately, seen further disinflationary progress. Figure 3 shows that, over shorter\nhorizons, inflation has picked up in both core goods and core services excluding\nhousing, and is moving sideways for housing. But unevenness in the disinflation\nprocess is to be expected – I am not surprised to see some less welcome news after\nsuch a string of positive inflation developments.\nGoing forward, we cannot necessarily count on continued supply side progress to\nreduce inflation amid strong economic activity. In particular, the core goods sector is\nunlikely to contribute much more to the disinflation process, though it is possible that\nsome previous improvements are not yet fully reflected in prices. While new-tenant rent\ngrowth has generally returned to pre-pandemic levels, rents of existing tenants are still\ncatching up, and continuing to put pressure on housing inflation. And additional labor\nsupply and productivity gains are highly uncertain.7\nTherefore, progress on inflation will very likely require lower growth in demand,\nparticularly to facilitate further slowing of core non-housing services inflation.\nThe Adjustment Process Going Forward\nAgainst this backdrop, a key question is how to think about the realignment of\nsupply and demand, going forward. While there are many dimensions to consider, I\nwant to focus on the relationship between wages and prices, which is especially\nimportant for core services excluding housing. In particular, let’s explore a common\nconcern that rapid wage growth may be fueling price pressures, preventing disinflation.\n7 We may already have seen most of the benefits from the resolution of global supply-chain bottlenecks. It\nis also unclear whether the recent growth of labor productivity can be sustained. Moreover, immigration\nflows are difficult to predict, and we cannot count on additional increases in native-born labor supply,\nthough there could be scope for some older workers to remain in or reenter the workforce.\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nFigure 5 shows the recent evolution of both wage growth (the blue line),\nmeasured by the ECI8 and PCE price inflation (the red line).9 Recent wage growth is\nabove its pre-pandemic range, and the current gap between wage growth and price\ngrowth is relatively large.\nHowever, the chart also shows that inflation grew much faster than wages earlier\nin the recovery – so that wages are, in part, catching up to past price increases.\nMoreover, real wages (or wages adjusted for inflation) should track growth in worker\nproductivity over the medium to longer run. But the real wage growth observed over the\ncourse of this recovery has yet to match measured productivity gains.10\nFigure 6 illustrates this point by showing the gap between real wages and\nproductivity.11 Real wages (the blue line) fell during the pandemic and initial recovery,\nbefore retracing most of the decline. By contrast, labor productivity increased notably at\nthe start of the pandemic, as production initially shifted from lower-productivity services\nto higher-productivity goods. It then decreased some during the unusual economic\nreopening and recovery, but has picked up again more recently.\nThe main takeaway from the evolution of wages, prices, and productivity is that\nlabor remains less expensive than it was before the pandemic. Importantly, this\nconclusion also holds when we consider wage and price indicators measured from the\nperspective of employers. Labor now accounts for a lower share of businesses’ costs\n8 Employment Cost Index (https://www.bls.gov/eci/home.htm).\n9 Of course, there are other possible measures of employee wages and of inflation. The ECI and PCE\nmeasures provide a helpful employee-level perspective, and these are used in Figure 6 and to construct\nreal wages in Figure 7. A similar relationship would hold from an employer-level perspective using\nindicators that track labor costs and sales prices for firms.\n10 On wage dynamics and how they relate to prices and productivity, see Philippe Andrade, Falk\nBräuning, José L. Fillat, and Gustavo Joaquim, 2024, “Is Post-pandemic Wage Growth Fueling Inflation?”\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston Current Policy Perspectives, 2024-1,\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/publications/current-policy-perspectives/2024/is-post-pandemic-wage-growth-\nfueling-inflation.aspx.\n11 Real wages are measured as the ratio between the ECI and the PCE price index. Labor productivity is\nmeasured as output per hour for the whole economy.\n8\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\noverall, which is reflected also in a declining portion of output going to compensate\nworkers. The labor share is now roughly 2 percentage points below its 2019 average for\nthe total economy. This pattern also holds for most industries.\nOverall, firms appear well positioned to potentially absorb some faster wage\ngrowth without placing additional pressures on prices. I say potentially, because given\nrobust demand, firms may still try to pass higher wages fully through to prices, and such\ndynamics may have been at play in the first quarter of this year. That said, continued\nproductivity gains could allow further solid but non-inflationary wage growth.\nInterestingly, other highly industrialized countries have not seen similar favorable\nlabor productivity developments, as shown in Figure 7. Reasons for this difference are\nunclear, and warrant study. While productivity gaps were evident before the pandemic,\none possible explanation is that differences in the labor market reallocation process\nacross countries following the pandemic shock may have resulted in better matches\nbetween employers and employees in the United States.\nWhatever the reason, it seems likely that recent U.S. productivity gains largely\nrepresent a level adjustment rather than a persistent increase in productivity growth.\nStill, my employer contacts around New England continue to mention ongoing\ntechnological investments and process optimization efforts. This suggests there could\nbe more to come in this improvement in productivity.\nStill, productivity’s future path is highly uncertain. A slowdown in activity will be\nneeded to ensure that demand is better aligned with supply for inflation to return durably\nto the Fed’s 2 percent target.\nMonetary Policy’s Role\nIn this context, the role of monetary policy is to restrain demand, to help facilitate\nthe realignment process. The recent upward surprises to activity and inflation suggest\nthe likely need to keep policy at its current level until we have greater confidence that\ninflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent. As emphasized in last week’s FOMC\n9\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nstatement, the committee’s decisions will remain data dependent, carefully assessing\nthe constellation of available information.\nPolicy needs to not only reflect a steadfast commitment to restoring price\nstability, but also aim to preserve a healthy labor market (the other facet of our dual\nmandate). There are risks from easing too soon, and from holding for too long, which\nwould lead to unnecessary economic disruption. The current policy stance, which I view\nas being moderately restrictive, may be appropriate for balancing risks that are two-\nsided.\nI do expect that demand will eventually slow as needed to better align with supply\n— but the timing and magnitude of moderation remain uncertain. It is possible that\npolicy became restrictive more recently than thought, and we have not yet seen its full\nimpact, especially if the economy becomes more interest-sensitive over time, as firms\nrefinance their existing low-cost debt and households exhaust their excess savings\naccumulated earlier in the pandemic.\nThe current situation requires methodical perseverance, recognizing that\nprogress will take time and continue to be uneven. Expecting all indicators to be well\naligned is too high a bar to start normalizing policy. Here are four of the many things I’ll\nbe watching for:\n• Short- and longer-term inflation expectations remaining well anchored.\n• Further sustained disinflation – especially in the components that remain\nmost elevated.\n• Evidence that wages continue to evolve in a way that is consistent with\nprice stability.\n• Ongoing indications that labor markets are moderating in an orderly way\nthat better aligns labor supply and demand.\nOverall, policy remains well positioned to respond to incoming information, as we\nassess the evolving outlook and risks. And the unusual nature of this cycle, the\n10\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 11:45 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 8, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ncontinued high degree of uncertainty, and still-elevated inflation, all highlight the\nimportance of patience, analysis, and a bit of humility.\nConcluding Observations\nI’ll end by saying again what a pleasure it is to be here at MIT. I’ll bring up Figure\n8 and say to the students, the Sloan School mission statement includes the phrase “to\ndevelop principled, innovative leaders who improve the world.” I encourage you to take\neach aspect of this to heart, knowing that you have much to offer our world.\nExtraordinary things happen when we care, study issues, collaborate with purpose, and\nact. The slide shows some of the people I meet, as we try to do just that.\nMy best wishes to each of you. And now I look forward to the conversation with\nProfessor Forbes, and your questions.\n11",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nApril 5, 2024\nOrganized by the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and New York\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time,\nFriday, April 5, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nGood morning. It is a great pleasure to welcome you to today’s Conference on\nthe Financial Stability Implications of Stablecoins, a gathering co-hosted by the Federal\nReserve Banks of Boston and New York. This event brings together researchers,\nregulators, and industry practitioners to better understand a rapidly evolving financial\ntechnology, including its costs and its benefits to the financial system and the economy.\nAs always, I’ll first mention that my comments today do not necessarily reflect the\nviews of my colleagues in Washington at the Board of Governors or at other Federal\nReserve Banks.\nHere at the Boston Fed, working with the Fed’s Board of Governors, we have led\n– and are currently leading – quite a few technological innovations on behalf of the\nFederal Reserve System, including innovations related to payments. I like to say that\nthe Fed’s overarching mission is to foster conditions supporting a vibrant and inclusive\neconomy that works for everyone. And, today, I very much look forward to hearing\nabout how developments in the stablecoin industry impact this important goal.\nAs many of you know, stablecoins are crypto assets that seek to maintain a\nstable value – usually one dollar – through several mechanisms. Currently, the largest\ntype of stablecoin, typically called fiat-backed stablecoins, maintain their one-dollar\n“peg” by investing the cash they receive from stablecoin holders primarily into traditional\nfinancial assets, such as U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper.\nOne can think of stablecoins as a form of private money. Therefore, they should\nbe of interest, if not concern, to central banks, because, in all advanced economies,\ncentral banks are the “ultimate source of credibility in money,” as Chair Powell noted in\nremarks last year.1 However, stablecoin issuers are not prudentially regulated or\nsupervised. This highlights the importance of policymakers and market participants\nunderstanding and considering key features of stablecoins – including their rapid\n1 Jerome Powell, June 2023.

Together, this research provides useful insights into how stablecoins interact with\nthe traditional financial system and the real economy.\n• The Liu et al. paper describes the collapse of TerraUSD in 2022, which at the\ntime was the third largest stablecoin.2 One interesting finding is that less\nsophisticated investors experienced larger losses than their more\nsophisticated counterparts – raising material questions about investor fairness\nand protection.\n• Anadu et al. investigate the similarities and differences between stablecoins\nand money market funds.3 Their paper documents that, during periods of\ncrypto market stress, investors tend to redeem stablecoins they perceive as\nrisky and purchase those they view as less risky. These runs exhibit flight-to-\nsafety dynamics that are remarkably similar to those observed in the money\nmarket fund industry.4\n• Ma et al. study the arbitrage mechanism through which stablecoins can be\nredeemed for currency, noting that the operation resembles that of an\nExchange-Traded Fund, and its “authorized participants.”5 The paper\nillustrates the value of delving into such intricacies by showing that the\ntechnical details can have important implications for financial stability.\n2 Liu, Jiageng, Igor Makarov, and Antoinette Schoar, 2023.

Ford School of Public Policy\nSusan M. Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nNovember 20, 2024\nAnn Arbor, Michigan\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, November 20, 2024\nKey Takeaways\n1. Collins sees the economy “in a good place overall, with inflation heading back to the 2\npercent target amid a healthy labor market.” The primary job for monetary policy in this context\nis sustaining these favorable conditions going forward.\n“I expect additional adjustments will likely be appropriate over time, to move the policy rate gradually\nfrom its current restrictive stance back into a more neutral range. However, policy is not on a pre-set\npath.”\n2. Overall, Collins sees the inflation picture as encouraging – especially with inflation\nexpectations well-anchored – and she cautions against overreacting to any one data release.\n“The volatility in inflation highlights the need to assess the data holistically, to separate the signal from\nthe noise, and not overreact to any one monthly reading.” Anchored inflation expectations make\nreturning to 2 percent inflation “feasible without the economy staying below capacity for a time, as\nwould be the case if expectations had risen and needed to be re-anchored.” The stability of long-run\nexpectations speaks to the credibility of the Fed in fighting inflation.\n3. Separating core inflation into three components illustrates that “most of the remaining\nelevation comes from shelter.” While shelter inflation has come down some, progress has been\nslow and uneven.\nThe key question is whether elevated housing inflation reflects the effects of ongoing price pressures\nfrom new leases, or simply the catch-up of existing leases to current market rents. The good news is\nthat the data show little evidence of price pressures from current market rents.\n4. A normalizing labor market and solid labor productivity growth have been important\ncontributors to the disinflation process.\nOther advanced economies have not experienced similar favorable productivity gains. Given the labor\nproductivity and price developments to date, Collins sees little scope for wages to disrupt the ongoing\ndisinflation progress, even if wages continue to grow at a somewhat faster pace than before the\npandemic.\n5. Collins believes “some additional easing of policy is needed, as policy currently remains at\nleast somewhat restrictive.”\nThe intent is not to ease too quickly or too much, hindering the disinflation progress to date. At the\nsame time, easing too slowly or too little could unnecessarily weaken the labor market. She added that\nat this stage, any further slowing in hiring would be undesirable. Policy is well-positioned to deal with\ntwo-sided risks and achieve the Fed’s dual mandate goals in a reasonable amount of time.\n6. Collins emphasized how the Fed’s design, structure, and breadth of portfolio make the\ncentral bank “representative of the country, appropriately accountable, and also independent\nenough to make hard choices in the longer-term public interest.”\nShe described the Fed’s work in research, supervision, financial stability, payments transactions and\ninfrastructure, liquidity, and support for economic development as reflecting data-driven analysis. She\nalso discussed how the Fed acts as a convener and catalyst for collaboration across sectors.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThank you, Dean Watkins-Hayes – Celeste – for such a warm welcome, or I\nshould say, welcome back. Michigan’s Ford School is truly a special place, and it has\nbeen wonderful to be back on campus, here in Weill Hall, spending time with students,\nfaculty and staff, including some dear friends, as well as many new faces. I have\nenjoyed learning about the exciting new developments and initiatives underway – and\nam thrilled, but not at all surprised, to see the Ford School continuing to thrive. So,\nthank you for hosting me – it is a pleasure to be here with you.\nToday, I’d like to share my perspectives on the U.S. economy and monetary\npolicy, focusing more on where we are than how we got here, and offering some\nthoughts looking ahead. I also know that the Federal Reserve is a bit of a mystery to\nmany people. So, I’ll take the opportunity, at the end of my remarks, to talk briefly about\nthe Fed itself, and, focusing on the Boston Fed, will give some examples of the breadth\nof work we do in support of our mission and our mandate from Congress. Then, I look\nforward to your questions.\nThe National Economy – Some Context\nI’ll begin with my perspective on the national economy – but first, my standard\ndisclaimer. My comments reflect my own views, not necessarily those of my\npolicymaker colleagues on the Fed’s Board of Governors, or at other Reserve Banks.\nI like to provide a bit of context before diving into a topic, use a few charts to\nillustrate key points, and give my “bottom-line up front.” For context: Congress has given\nthe Fed a mandate to maintain price stability and maximum employment. The FOMC (or\nFederal Open Market Committee, which is the Fed’s monetary policymaking body)\ndefines price stability as 2 percent inflation. Maximum employment is less specifically\ndefined, but I think of it as a broad, inclusive goal of job opportunities for all Americans\nin a context of price stability.\nFigure 1 provides some history. The left-hand panel shows the Fed’s preferred\nmeasure of inflation calculated using the personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nprice index. The blue line is 12-month total (headline) inflation, the green line is the 2\npercent target, and the red line is “core” inflation, which excludes the volatile though\nobviously important categories of food and energy. The right-hand panel shows the\nevolution of the unemployment rate – a good indicator of overall labor market\nconditions, though, of course, I and my team follow a wide range of indicators to gauge\nthe state of the labor market.\nWhen I began my role as Boston Fed President and FOMC member in July\n2022, the U.S. economy was coming out from the worst of the pandemic.\nUnemployment was way down from its COVID-19 shutdown peak. In fact, the chart\nshows that unemployment fell very rapidly, instead of the more gradual decline that\nhistorically has followed recessions (shown in the figure by the gray shaded bars). This\nis one of many ways in which the recent cycle has been unusual. At the time, firms were\nstruggling to find workers – which was one factor fueling upward pressure on wages\nand prices. Supply bottlenecks were still extensive, exacerbated by Russia’s war in\nUkraine. Demand outstripping supply had caused a surge in inflation, and higher prices\nwere already very challenging for firms, and for households (especially those with low\nand moderate incomes).\nGetting inflation back under control was the clear policy priority for the Fed, and\nthe FOMC responded by rapidly raising the federal funds rate (the FOMC’s main policy\ntool), to the range of 5¼ to 5½ percent by July 2023. This shift from a very\naccommodative policy stance to a quite restrictive one helped realign demand and\nsupply, relieving wage and price pressures and thus reducing inflation.\nSo where are we today? As Figure 1 shows, inflation has come down\nsignificantly – though core inflation is still somewhat elevated. The unemployment rate\nis higher than it was a year ago, but it remains low by historical standards. And as I’ll\ndiscuss shortly, economic growth remains robust.\nMy bottom line is that I see an economy that is in a good place overall, with\ninflation heading back to the 2 percent target amid a healthy labor market. The primary\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\njob for monetary policy in this context is sustaining these favorable conditions over time,\nfocusing on both sides of our dual mandate. Past experience teaches that this is the\nenvironment which enables the benefits from a vibrant economy to be shared widely.\nGiven the significant progress towards our goals, it was appropriate for the FOMC to\nbegin recalibrating policy, easing rates in September, and again when we met earlier\nthis month.\nBefore saying more about my outlook, the balance of risks, and implications for\npolicy, I’ll go into some additional detail on economic conditions, starting with inflation.\nInflation\nThe left chart in Figure 2 shows core PCE inflation at the 3- and 12-month\nhorizons. The progress on inflation since 2022 is apparent, with the most recent values\nfor the three-month gauge close to 2 percent. The figure also makes it clear that\nprogress has been uneven. The favorable readings in the second half of 2023 were\nfollowed by an increase in inflation early this year. As the right panel shows, monthly\ninflation volatility remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. This volatility\nhighlights the need to assess the data holistically, to separate the signal from the noise,\nand to not overreact to any one monthly reading. Overall, I see the inflation picture as\nencouraging. However, we should not be surprised if measured progress on a 12-month\nbasis slows a bit in the near term, as the low readings at the end of last year drop out of\nthe 12-month computation window. This will likely continue until we are past the higher\nnumbers from early this year.\nSeparating core inflation into three components, as shown in Figure 3, illustrates\nthat most of the remaining elevation comes from housing. Core goods inflation, in the\nleft-hand panel, has been back down in its pre-pandemic range for many months. The\n3-month annualized measure of services inflation excluding housing, in the right-hand\npanel, has also returned to its pre-pandemic range. If that continues, the 12-month\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nmeasure will decline over time. However, while housing price inflation has come down\nsome, progress has been slow and uneven.\nHere, the good news, as shown in Figure 4, is that the data show little evidence\nof new price pressures from market rents, an important driver of shelter inflation. All\nthree measures of the change in rents associated with new leases are back down from\ntheir 2021-22 surge. Shelter inflation is high because rents for existing tenants are still\ncatching up to this past surge. While this catch-up process may continue to be slow and\nuneven, it does not raise concerns for me about the durability of inflation’s trajectory\nback to 2 percent – as long as new tenant rent inflation remains subdued and overall\ninflation expectations stay well-anchored.\nAs Figure 5 highlights, the situation regarding inflation expectations is favorable.\nShort-run expectations are near their pre-pandemic range (as shown in the left panel).\nMore importantly, long-run expectations (in the right panel) have stayed well-anchored\nthroughout the inflationary episode. This makes returning to 2 percent inflation feasible\nwithout the economy staying below capacity for a time, as would be the case if\nexpectations had risen and needed to be re-anchored. The stability of long-run\nexpectations during this period further speaks to the credibility of the Fed in fighting\ninflation.1\nThe Labor Market and Supply Developments\nWhat about the labor market? The three panels in Figure 6 show just a few of\nthe many indicators I follow – the unemployment rate remaining near 4 percent, low\nunemployment claims, and declines in both job openings and quit rates. These\nindicators are also near levels seen around 2018, when labor market conditions were\n1 This credibility is also rooted in the Federal Reserve’s independence from other branches of\ngovernment. For further discussion of the importance of central bank independence in delivering low and\nstable inflation and anchored inflation expectations see, for example, the recent speech by Governor\nKugler on central bank independence and the conduct of monetary policy - Federal Reserve Board.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\narguably consistent with full employment. In other words, the labor market has\nnormalized from unsustainably tight conditions a year or two ago and is consistent with\ninflation durably returning to the 2 percent target. This healthy picture of the labor\nmarket is also reflected in conversations with employers across the Boston Fed district,\nwhich encompasses most of New England. However, I’ll note that payroll growth has\nslowed over the past year, and job creation has become more concentrated in a few\nsectors.\nThe combination of disinflation with a labor market near full employment is taking\nplace amid robust output growth, as shown in Figure 7. The blue line depicts the\nevolution of real GDP, which has been growing considerably faster than estimates of\ntrend output growth from 2015 to 2019 – the dashed blue line.2 An economy near full\nemployment entails GDP near trend – and, as suggested by the dashed red line, in the\ncurrent context this implies a notably higher trend growth rate since the pandemic.\nStrong growth with no meaningful signs of new price pressures highlights the\nimportant role favorable supply developments have played so far in the recovery. One\nof these developments has been an expansion of labor supply, which came, in part,\nfrom a larger than expected increase in labor force participation. Interestingly, as Figure\n8 shows, this rise has occurred across gender (as shown on the left) and racial/ethnic\ngroups (as shown on the right). Although not shown, increased immigration was also a\nmajor contributor to this expansion in labor supply. There is work underway – and to be\ndone – to better understand these developments, their implications and the extent to\nwhich they are likely to persist.\nAnother positive supply development has been a notable rise in labor\nproductivity. Figure 9 shows one such measure – real output per hour for the\nnonfinancial corporate sector. The initial surge in labor productivity reflected the sharp\ndrop in employment early in the pandemic, which was followed by severe labor\n2 Trend output growth from 2015-19 is assumed to be 1.9 percent based on the median longer-run\nprojection for GDP growth from the December 2019 FOMC Projection materials.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nshortages that were partially reversed when firms were able to replenish their\nworkforces. Still, even after the catch-up in employment, productivity remains on a\nhigher trend than it was before the pandemic. Notably, other advanced economies have\nnot experienced the same favorable productivity developments.\nA number of reasons have been cited to potentially explain the strength in U.S.\nlabor productivity. First, some firms learned to do more with fewer workers by investing\nin labor-saving technologies and restructuring aspects of production. Figure 10\nhighlights some sectors where this seems likely to have occurred. For professional and\nbusiness services, productivity gains do not seem to be slowing much. But it is possible\nthat some of these level improvements are now behind us, so that productivity may\nrevert to previous trends. This could be the case in sectors such as healthcare and\nleisure and hospitality, shown on the right.\nHowever, other developments could prove more persistent. In particular, there\nhas been a surge in new business formation since 2020, as shown in Figure 11. This is\na promising development that is in stark contrast to what has been described as the\n“broad-based slowdown in U.S. business dynamism from 1970 to 2020.” Indeed, the\nentry and dynamics of new firms has been shown to be a “significant driver of job\ncreation, innovation and productivity growth.”3 Finally, A.I. could be behind some of\nthese improvements. In my view, however, the overall impact of A.I. at this point is still\nlikely to be small but could increase meaningfully going forward.4\nImportantly, given the labor productivity improvements to date, I see little scope\nfor wages to disrupt the ongoing disinflation progress. Indeed, analysis by my staff\nshows that labor remains relatively inexpensive, given recent productivity gains and\n3 See “The Recent Rise in US Labor Productivity” by Luke Pardue, published by the Aspen Economic\nStrategy Group of the Aspen Institute (Labor Productivity In Brief)\n4 For a discussion of the potential impact of A.I. on the economy see the proceedings from the recent\nAtlanta Fed Conference on Technology Enabled Disruption, available at\nhttps://www.atlantafed.org/news/conferences-and-events/conferences/2024/10/01/technology-enabled-\ndisruption/agenda.\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nprice developments. Therefore, even though wages are growing faster than they were\nbefore the pandemic, this is not placing additional pressures on inflation.5\nWith many workers still grappling with the effects of high prices, preserving the\ncurrent favorable conditions also means maintaining an environment in which they can\ncontinue to see increases in the purchasing power of their wages and improvements in\ntheir economic well-being. This is one reason why restoring and sustaining price\nstability is so important.\nMonetary Policy and the Balance of Risks\nAgainst this backdrop, it was appropriate to begin recalibrating monetary policy\nthis fall. I expect additional adjustments will likely be appropriate over time, to move the\npolicy rate gradually from its current restrictive stance back into a more neutral range.\nHowever, policy is not on a pre-set path. The FOMC will need to make decisions\nmeeting-by-meeting, based on the data available at the time and their implications for\nthe economic outlook and the evolving balance of risks. I will close this section of my\nremarks by saying a bit more about my thinking here.\nFigure 12 shows the path of the federal funds rate, with the left side giving\nhistorical context. The panel on the right focuses on the recent period, in which the\nFOMC increased the rate rapidly, from essentially zero in 2022 to 5½ percent in July\n2023, then held the rate at that level for 16 months before cutting by 50 basis points in\nSeptember, and another 25 earlier this month.\nRestrictive monetary policy has clearly been one factor helping to rein in inflation.\nCombined with the supply improvements I have already mentioned, it has played a role\n5 For recent analyses on this topic, see Is Post-pandemic Wage Growth Fueling Inflation? - Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org), and Productivity Improvements and Markup Normalization Can\nSupport Further Wage Gains without Inflationary Pressures - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n(bostonfed.org).\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nin rebalancing demand with supply, reducing pressure on wages and prices. However,\nas I have also discussed, the overall effects from restrictive policy on the labor market\nand real economic activity have been relatively modest so far.\nOne reason for this has to do with factors unique to the pandemic recovery that\nstrengthened the financial positions of households and firms. The left panel of Figure\n13 shows how pandemic-era household support programs, combined with limited\nspending opportunities when much of the economy was shut down, led to the\naccumulation of significant amounts of extra savings, as shown by the red line. In\naddition, many firms were able to lock in longer-term debt at very favorable rates. As\nshown in the right-hand panel, corporate cash holdings increased notably. These\ndevelopments likely provided some cushion from the full effects of high interest rates.\nBut Figure 13 also makes clear that these special buffers have waned. Most of\nthe excess household savings are now depleted. And though still elevated, corporate\ncash holdings have fallen notably.\nGiven these developments, monetary policy needs to adjust in order to achieve\nour dual mandate goals. While the final destination is uncertain, I believe some\nadditional policy easing is needed, as policy currently remains at least somewhat\nrestrictive. The intent is not to ease too quickly or too much, hindering the disinflation\nprogress to date. At the same time, easing too slowly or too little could unnecessarily\nweaken the labor market.\nImportantly, there are risks to achieving both our inflation and our employment\ngoals. On the inflation side, demand has been surprisingly resilient, and we could see\nmore consumption growth than anticipated, putting upward pressure on prices. Indeed,\nhousehold net worth remains quite elevated, and equity prices have generally moved\nhigher recently. Households may also be more inclined to access the equity in their\nhomes as interest rates decline.\nOn the other hand, as I have mentioned, job growth is moderating, with recent\ngains concentrated in just a few sectors. At this stage, any further slowing in hiring\n8\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nwould be undesirable. In addition, an economy growing near trend may be more\nvulnerable to adverse shocks – and geopolitical risks remain elevated.\nAll told, I see the risks to my quite favorable baseline outlook as roughly in\nbalance. Inflation is returning sustainably, if unevenly, to 2 percent, and to date, labor\nmarket conditions are healthy overall. Policy is well-positioned to deal with two-sided\nrisks and achieve our dual mandate goals in a reasonable amount of time. The policy\nadjustments made so far enable the FOMC to be careful and deliberate going forward,\ntaking the time to holistically assess implications of the available data for the outlook\nand the associated balance of risks.\nThe Federal Reserve: Serving the Public in a Variety of Ways\nAs noted at the outset, I would like to round out my discussion of the economy\nand monetary policy with some perspectives on the Fed itself – focusing on the Boston\nReserve Bank.\nI know that the Federal Reserve – and central banking more generally – can\nseem a bit mysterious. In fact, my colleagues and I are eager for the American public to\nknow about and have confidence in the work we do. So, I’ll say a bit about our structure,\ngrounding, roles, and the breadth of work in our portfolio.\nThe Federal Reserve’s design is unique, emphasizing the wide range of\nstakeholders and regions in our economy, and the range of perspectives needed to\nsupport it. As you see in Figure 14, our federated structure has 12 regional Reserve\nbanks, representing every part of the country, and the Board of Governors in\nWashington. And our senior policymakers are appointed to their roles6 in different ways.\n6 The seven Governors are nominated by the President of the United States subject to the advice and\nconsent of the Senate. One governor is additionally nominated to be chair, one to be vice chair, and one\nto be vice chair for bank supervision. The 12 presidents of the regional Reserve Banks are selected by\nthe non-banker members of the boards of directors of each Reserve Bank, with the approval of the Board\nof Governors. The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, sets U.S. monetary policy. The 12 voting\n9\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nAll of this makes the Fed representative of the country, appropriately accountable, and\nalso independent enough to make hard choices in the longer-term public interest.\nCongress created the Federal Reserve and gave us the mandates to guide our\nmonetary policy responsibilities, as I noted earlier. One of the things my colleagues and\nI find inspiring about our Congressional mandates, and more broadly our role in serving\nthe public, is the fact that our mission and mandate are for the public – for all the\nAmerican public. At the Boston Fed, our vision is “A vibrant economy that works for all.”7\nTo do all of this, we have a variety of roles and responsibilities. I’ve discussed\nmonetary policy, where our contributions are rooted in extensive, and very rigorous,\nresearch and analysis. Our researchers also do important work on various aspects of\nthe economy. I have already mentioned our analysis concluding that, given recent\nproductivity Improvements, there is room for further wage gains without inflationary\npressures. A second example is our research on aspects of the housing challenges so\nprevalent in New England, and across the nation.8 A third is reflected in the topic of our\n68th Economic Conference, held just last week, on the future of finance. The conference\nlooked at the implications of technological innovation for small businesses, financial\ninclusion, financial stability and more; and considering both the promise and the\nchallenges.9\nIn addition to rigorous work with quantitative data, we also put a strong emphasis\non understanding how different people and places experience the economy. Pursuing\nmembers include the seven members of the Board of Governors; the president of the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York; and four of the remaining 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms on\na rotating basis. The remaining seven Reserve Bank presidents attend FOMC meetings and participate in\nFOMC deliberations.

Pursuing the mandate for maximum\nemployment requires us to understand not just national aggregates (such as aggregate\nunemployment, and national job openings), but also the different outcomes for various\npeople and places.\nWhile I always immerse myself in economic data, I complement this with\nconversations across the economy’s stakeholders, and some examples of these\ninteractions are shown on Figure 15. It is very valuable to hear how people are\nexperiencing the economy, so I meet with business owners, entrepreneurs and\ninnovators, workers, advocates, bankers, educators, and a host of others. We meet in\nrural New England, suburbs, downtowns, former mill towns – in areas where former\nengines of the local economy have declined or gone away, as well as areas that are\nthriving.\nThe Fed has other roles in its portfolio, reflecting the importance banks and the\nfinancial system have to the economy’s health and the public good. We supervise some\nof the region’s financial institutions for safety and soundness.10 In addition, our team\nresearches and analyzes financial stability pressures, and it extends credit to depository\ninstitutions to promote the smooth functioning of the payment system and help relieve\nliquidity strains in the banking system.\nThe Fed also supports the infrastructure for the payments transactions we all\nmake and receive, and that firms and financial institutions rely on to be secure, reliable,\nand resilient. The Federal Reserve developed, and operates, payments systems: for the\nautomated clearing house (the “ACH” – think direct deposit of a paycheck, for example),\nwire transfers, cash distribution through banks, check processing, and now real-time\n10 In the U.S., bank supervision is shared among several agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board,\nwhich delegates some of the on-the-ground supervisory activity to Reserve Bank staff.\n11\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 4:00 P.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, November 20, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\npayments with FedNow.11 The number and value of transactions handled each day by\nthese payment systems is huge.\nThe Boston Fed has a history of innovation at the intersection of payments,\ntechnology, and finance, most recently by taking a leading role in developing FedNow,\nthe new real-time payments system, launched in July 2023. It’s the first new payments\nplatform built by the Fed in nearly 50 years, bringing the immediacy we all now expect in\nour lives to payments. Individuals and businesses whose financial institutions adopt the\nservice can send and receive instant payments any time, with immediate funds\navailability.12\nFinally, I’ll mention the Fed’s support for community economic development.

    "text": "General Discussion:\nMonetary Policy and\nStock Market Booms\nChair: Susan M. Collins\nMr. DeGregorio: I like the paper. It is very original. But the assump-\ntion about the increase in asset prices is somewhat unrealistic because,\naccording to what Larry said, in this model, everything is in the minds\nof consumers. But, at the end, nothing happens. Therefore, optimal\npolicy is to try to make it so that effectively nothing happens. You have\nto follow a monetary policy rule just by looking at asset prices and do\nfiscal policy along those lines. But monetary policy is set in a world\nwith much uncertainty. In the 200 years of analyzing stock prices, a lot\nof things have happened. So, the issue is not to think all stock market\nbooms are unfounded and just in the minds of consumers.\nMr. Kohn: My comment follows on the previous one. Larry, I\nwondered what would happen when you confronted the model with\na situation in which the stock market boom was partly a reaction to\na real phenomenon. So, I was thinking about the late 1990s as you\nwere talking, and you had a situation there in which you had a stock\nmarket boom. But you also had a technologically driven increase in\nthe rate of growth of productivity.\nOne, under those circumstances, the authorities figuring out what\nis real and what isn’t is practically impossible. Two, it seems to me a\nrise in interest rates is not likely to cut off the boom because investors\n165\n\n166 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nhave a real reason to think profits will be higher later, but they can still\nget carried away with their expectations when the expectations change.\nIn 1999, we raised rates and nothing happened. The stock market\nkept picking up speed as we raised rates in 1999. If there is a subse-\nquent crash, it will happen in your model from a lower inflation rate.\nSo, we will have a recession started from a lower inflation rate, which\nmust have implications for the ability to deal with that recession and\nthe possibility of nonlinearities around deflation and what not.\nMr. Blinder: First, I wanted to align myself with the very nice\npresentation by John Geanakoplos, which had a lot of truth in it,\nincluding probably the parts he didn’t explain.\nSecond, just a technical question for Larry. In this class of model,\nwhy doesn’t a future boom get people deciding to work later when\nproductivity is going to be higher—as you see in a lot of these mod-\nels? If they believe that, you don’t get a boom at all in terms of em-\nployment. I didn’t quite catch that.\nThe main point I want to call your attention to is something you\nmay know about. Many, many years ago, I think in the early 1970s,\nFranco Modigliani and Richard Cohn wrote a paper about why in-\nflation is bad for the stock market—which turns the causation the\nother way around, from low inflation to a good stock market. Their\nargument had to do with money illusion and improper discounting,\nwhich is not allowed in your class of rational model, but I might sug-\ngest it as an alternative.\nMr. Fraga: This is a quick question for John. I see the facts of a\nboom being described by lower margin requirements and haircuts.\nYou didn’t have time to cover this in your presentation, so maybe you\ncould tell us why you think these numbers go down so much. I have\nsome macro reasons, but I don’t have time for that either.\nMr. Shirakawa: I see Japan is cited very often, so I feel obliged to\nsay something. Let me offer my observation. I was working for the\nmonetary policy department in the late 1980s as a middle staffer in the\nmonetary policy department. Although Larry’s model is very simple,\nit seems his model captures the psychology of the Japanese people, the\n\nGeneral Discussion 167\neconomic situation, and the problems the Japanese policymakers faced\nat that time. As you said, we were experiencing a stock market boom.\nWe were experiencing a real estate boom. Also, credit was increasing at\na rapid pace as the investment boom was occurring.\nAll these data point to the need for monetary tightening, except\none critical data—that is, the inflation rate. Actually, the inflation\nrate number was a bit negative or almost zero. So, when the Bank of\nJapan tried to raise the short-term rate, we were faced with the stan-\ndard argument against early hikes of the interest rates. But, in retro-\nspect, the expectations that the very low interest rate would continue\ninto the future helped foster the environment in which credit and\nleverage was increasing. That is why I think your model best captures\nthe situation at that time.\nThis episode raises a question about the relevancy of inflation tar-\ngeting. A possible shortcoming with inflation targeting could be\nsolved by adopting the flexible inflation targeting. But, people tend\nto look at the economy through the lens of inflation. This could have\nsome bias. So central bankers are faced with how to solve this kind of\npsychology of framing, so to speak.\nMr. Musalem: I’d like to echo the remarks made earlier. Out of the\n18 stock market booms in the last 200 years, surely some were real—\nmeaning, prompted by real productivity gains. So, the model seems a\nlittle one-sided, even though I really enjoyed it.\nThe question I wanted to ask is, Bringing that to today, today we\nhave credit growth which is low; we have an equity market which is\nperforming badly; and some people have expectations of a negative\nsupply shock because of labor mismatching and higher non-accel-\nerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). What would the\nmodel suggest for monetary policy today, given the diametrically op-\nposed conditions hold?\nMr. Carstens: About the leverage cycle comments and what to\ndo about them: There is a recommendation that might just back-\nfire, which is the idea of stopping foreclosures and writing down\nprincipal. This policy suggestion for sure would generate major\nmoral hazard. Even though we have here Mike Mussa and I\n\n168 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nremember the optimal amount of moral hazard, it just might make\nthings worse. This is a policy recommendation that needs to be\nweighted very carefully. It is very hard to apply it across the board.\nMr. O’Brien: A couple of questions for John. Do we have a good\npositive theory of what the right leverage should be in the economy\nso we can actually guide policy? What about the practicalities?\nThe financial system is pretty clever about getting around chang-\nes in regulation. Even if we regulate financial leverage, leverage can\nmigrate into balance sheets and operating leverage. Companies could\njust gear up and achieve leverage that way. You see, that is actually the\nbenefit of credit. Even if it is not the ideal instrument for the central\nbank to use, it is pretty easy to measure and ultimately maybe a better\ntool for the central bank to use to track this sort of stuff.\nMr. Sinai: The work is motivated by inflation targeting. Our Fed\nhas had a dual mandate for decades now. And, for more than 200\nyears, I am not sure there was any inflation targeting central banks\noperated on. So, how do you square what you derived from the model\nwith the facts of life as you present them on low-inflation stock market\nbooms and then go from that to a policy conclusion that is somewhat\ncritical of the Fed creating the bubbles and booms? I can’t quite get the\nsquaring of that, and it leads me to ask a question about the relevance\nof the model motivated in the way it was.\nMr. Collins: I just had a follow-up comment about the practical-\nity of regulating leverage and whether you’d really thought about the\nmechanics of that in terms of the ability of the current regulatory\nenvironment to do what you’re talking about, not just through the\nbanking system, but through the securities markets and the enormity\nof that challenge as a policymaker.\nMr. Geanakoplos: One of the questions I addressed in my pre-\nsentation was, Why did leverage get so high in this crisis? There are\na bunch of reasons. One is a prolonged period of low volatility. Sec-\nondly, securitization was a huge way of increasing leverage. In fact,\njust the whole idea of securitization was founded on increasing lever-\nage. Part of it was a regulatory arbitrage. You can take a bunch of\nstuff that you had to put down a lot of regulatory capital to own, and\n\nGeneral Discussion 169\nyou cut it up into a bunch of pieces that add up to the same thing\nand the banks can buy the individual pieces and leverage them more.\nAnd, in total, they could put less money down on all the pieces than\nthey would have had to put down on the original pool. So securi-\ntization, by the way, by breaking into tranches is also… there are\nmany ways securitization increased leverage and I don’t have time to\ntalk about it. The government, of course, with its implicit guarantees\nallowed people to leverage much more—notably, Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac. And then the irrationality part of it: Low interest rates\nand global imbalances, everybody says, “Well, that’s what caused the\ncrisis.” But, when you get a little bit further, how did it cause the\ncrisis? It got people to leverage more. There is a missing step. They\nsay global imbalances lowered interest rates—why is that so terrible?\nBecause people seeking yield leveraged more. Also, people hid lever-\nage better. Those are reasons leverage went up so much more.\nNow, writing down principal causing moral hazard? It causes less\nmoral hazard! Our current policy, which is once you stop paying, the\ngovernment comes in and says, “Let’s see if we can help you by low-\nering your interest payments if you show they are too high.” That’s\na moral hazard. If you write down the principal before the guy has\ndefaulted, that doesn’t cause moral hazard. If you look at Chart 6,\ndefaults are extremely sensitive to how far underwater you are. So,\nyou can tell who is going to default. Two years ago, we knew who\nthe people were—the subprime people—who were going to default.\nThey were the ones who were furthest underwater. You write down\nthe principal before they’ve defaulted, and you save the lender money.\nThe government doesn’t have to pay anything. The lender should be\nforced to do the write-downs. In fact, the lenders would want to do\nthe write-downs, if they could get together, but they are all different\nbondholders and they can’t communicate. That is why they haven’t\nwritten it down themselves. So, the government should have stepped\nin and facilitated that communication to write down the principal,\nbut they didn’t do it.\nThe right level of leverage? If you keep track of all the loan-to-value\nratios of all these securities and you see them suddenly going up, at\nthe same time their prices are going up, you are going to be able to\n\n170 Chair: Susan M. Collins\ntell if that leverage is skyrocketing and something wrong has hap-\npened. How does the Fed figure out what interest rate to set? We just\nfound out the rule they’ve been using for 30 years makes no sense\nand gives you bubbles. So, if they don’t know what interest rate to set,\nwhy worry they can’t figure out what leverage to set?\nMr. Christiano: Thank you very much, John, for your comments\nand for all the other comments. I won’t be able to respond to ev-\nerything. I wanted to say a couple of things first. I want to clarify\nsomething. When I started talking about this particular issue about\nthe interaction between inflation targeting and stock markets, I did\nnot mean to suggest that’s the only, or even most important, topic\nnow facing us.\nI do agree regulation and issues about whether leverage is natu-\nrally wrong, if you wait for the economy to produce its own leverage\nratios, are very, very important issues. Personally, I would probably\nrank them ahead of the one I’m talking about. The one I’m talking\nabout is relevant and interesting, and one can say something about\nit because of the historical data. That’s why I chose to talk about it.\nLet me react to a couple of people. Maybe Don Kohn’s remarks\nmight be a place to start. I’m sometimes accused of writing compli-\ncated papers where no one can figure out what’s going on, where there\nare 15,000 different things going on. The idea with this paper is to try\nto make it simple. I tried to focus specifically on this worry that a part\nof stock market booms is floating on thin air on expectations about the\nfuture. I tried to address the idea that inflation targeting might be able\nto take the steam out of that part of the stock market boom.\nThe story is going to be a lot more complicated if we have some ac-\ntual productivity growth going on at the same time. But it will always\nstill be true, particularly with these models I work with. They linearly\nadd up. It will always still be true the part riding on hopes and expec-\ntations will be overstimulated by an inflation-targeting rule. That fact\nwould have been complicated if I had merged everything together.\nBy the way, you raised the question that it looked like things were\non the ground happening in the 1990s. I want to remind you of one\nlittle thing, which is the analysis here suggests it is really tough to\n\nGeneral Discussion 171\ndetermine whether things are happening on the ground or not. In\nmy own simulation, labor productivity was rising a lot.\nOne response I wanted to make to John Geanakoplos. There is\na clarifying point. I may not have made this clear enough in the\npaper. The simulations with credit growth in the model involve a\nmodel where credit is essential. It involves a version of the model that\nincorporates the Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist financial frictions,\nand credit is essential in that model, and leverage is endogenous and\nmoving around all over the place.\nNow, net leverage is never inappropriate in that model. With lim-\nited liability, the vague promise of a bailout, and so on, then lever-\nage can get out of whack in a private economy. That is the way it is\nin the United States, and that is why regulation is a very important\ntopic. But I want to emphasize the final conclusion that maybe cred-\nit growth could help and the conclusions about these stock market\nbooms are all done in a version of the model that has financial fric-\ntions in it.\nOn Alan Blinder’s question about why people work harder in this\nthing, in the actual equilibrium, most of what is happening is be-\ncause of the blast coming from the monetary authority. The reason\nwhy they are working harder is basically because we have an expan-\nsionary monetary policy. Interest rates should be high, but it’s actu-\nally going down in the wrong direction.\nHowever, even in the efficient equilibrium, employment is taking\noff. Perhaps your question had to do with that. Well, in the efficient\nequilibrium, the promise that things are going to be better in the\nfuture means there is going to be a lot more investment in the future\nbecause ex ante you don’t know this is not going to happen. In the\nmodel, it is the case the efficient way to get ready for an investment\nboom in the future is to start gearing up now. It is like a presentation;\nthe efficient way to prepare a presentation for this audience is not\nto start the night before, but to start a little bit of time in advance.\nThat is built into the model. You know you are going to be doing a\nlot of investment in the future. And, through various mechanisms\nin the model, you get the outcome that it is desirable to get more\n\n172 Chair: Susan M. Collins\ninvestment in the present. That is part of the story about what leads,\nthen, to a rise in employment during the boom.\nThere were some questions about the relevance of the 19th cen-\ntury data because we were under a gold standard a lot of the time,\nalthough we went off the gold standard during the Civil War—but I\ndropped the Civil War from the database. What I want to emphasize\nis what we’re concluding from this is there is a surprising correlation\nbetween inflation and stock market booms that spans lots and lots of\ndifferent monetary policies.\nActually, I was quite persuaded by John Taylor’s argument he made\na few years ago that all policy at all times is actually a Taylor rule,\neven the gold standard. Under the gold standard, it looks a lot like\na Taylor rule. You have high prospective inflation under a gold stan-\ndard. If you have high prospective prices in your country under the\ngold standard, what you will get is outflows of gold because you will\nrun a current account deficit—outflows of gold. That will cause a\nshortage of specie in the country and raise interest rates. So, a gold\nstandard operates a lot like a Taylor rule.\nThe coefficients are not 1.5 and 0.5. But what I want to stress\nhere is I can avoid this kind of discussion because what I am trying\nto stress is, if we look at data, we don’t see evidence inflation takes\noff in stock market booms. At most, we see evidence inflation goes\ndown a little bit. Now, I agree a lot of these booms probably involved\nreal things. But remember, every single boom I looked at in the 19th\ncentury ended in a crash and panic. So, there must have been a big\ncomponent, at least toward the end, that was riding on thin air.",

U.S. Eastern Time,\nMonday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n“Perspectives on the Economy,\nand on the Opportunities Ahead”\nSusan M. Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nPublic remarks hosted by the\nGreater Boston Chamber of Commerce\nSeptember 26, 2022\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nKey Takeaways:\n1. Policymaking in the public interest: My Fed colleagues and I are\ncommitted to price stability and maximum employment, our core mandates.\nWe are tightening monetary policy, to bring supply and demand into better\nbalance and reduce inflation to the 2% target before high inflation rate\nbecomes entrenched in expectations – for the long-term good.\n2. How I’ll lead: I’m committed to following data without presumption or\nbias as we study the economy. I’ll complement data with outreach, to\ngather insights from stakeholders in different regions and sectors\nthroughout New England. I embrace the breadth of our work at the Boston\nFed, all of it rooted in helping to support an economy and financial system\nthat works for everyone.\n3. Behind the scenes: There is exciting work at the Fed to ensure the\ncountry’s payments infrastructure can meet the public’s needs. Reserve\nBanks underpin many of the ways Americans make and receive payment,\nand the Fed is in the process of launching a new, real-time payments “rail”\nthat will improve payments for all – called the FedNowSM Service.\n4. In the region: In support of a strong, resilient inclusive economy for New\nEngland, the Boston Fed makes a unique impact through our “Working\nPlaces” initiatives, now in 30 communities in five states. The Fed does not\ndirect this research-informed work; it is truly local. Collaboration across\nsectors and working toward a common long-term vision generated at the\nlocal level, is the key.\n5. A unique role and opportunity: I am excited to be back in New\nEngland and working to help the region’s economy flourish. Many\nchallenges are not for the Fed to solve, given our toolkit and roles. But our\ncommitment to a vibrant, inclusive economy and financial system mean we\ncontribute as nonpartisan, data-driven researchers, and as conveners\nhelping cross-sector efforts.\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nGood morning, and welcome to everyone joining us. It is wonderful to be\nwith you for my first public talk as president of the Boston Fed. My thanks to Jim\nRooney for his kind introduction, for inviting me to speak, and for opening the\nevent to all who wished to attend or tune in.\nBefore we begin, my warmest wishes to those who are observing Rosh\nHashanah, and reflecting on the year past and the new year ahead. We have\nmade sure the video will be available online for any who could not attend today.\nI’d also like to congratulate the Greater Boston Chamber for its focus on\nlong-term issues related to our economic environment, such as expanding\nopportunities for people in our region to contribute and prosper, regardless of\ngender, race, age, or background. Such opportunities are key elements of a\nvibrant economy. And we appreciate the Chamber, and others, participating in\nthe work underway to assess, and address, barriers to creation of generational\nwealth in communities of color.\nMy comments today will touch on monetary policy and the national and\nregional economy. I’ll also share some early observations about this very special\norganization with a public mission – the many ways we help foster a vibrant,\ninclusive economy that works for all. After my remarks, I’ll look forward to Jim’s\nquestions and those from the audience.\nBy Way of Introduction\nFirst, I’ll say a little more about me, by way of introduction. My parents\nwere both from Jamaica; however, I was born in Scotland and grew up in New\nYork City. So perhaps it’s no surprise that I became an international\nmacroeconomist.\nAfter grad school, I worked as a professor, researcher, and policy advisor\n– both here in Boston and in Washington, D.C. As Jim mentioned, I then spent\nten years as dean of the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nMichigan, eventually becoming provost, the chief academic and budget officer for\nthe University.\nI had the opportunity to serve on the Chicago Fed’s boards for nine years.\nThis really broadened my understanding of the Federal Reserve and the many\nways it can help improve people’s lives.\nThis role at the Boston Fed combines three things about me – my\nbackground as a policy-focused macroeconomist, my commitment to education,\nand my experience leading complex organizations with a public purpose.\nI also recognize that I am the first Black woman to lead one of the Federal\nReserve Banks. I see that as a privilege, a responsibility, and an opportunity. In\nparticular, it is an opportunity to engage even more broadly with constituents – to\nexpand understanding of how our economy works, and how it could work better.\nI am excited to continue the Bank’s work, including with groups that have\nbeen under-represented in leadership and policy roles. Our economy needs the\nbest ideas, energy, and effort from everyone.\nPerspectives on the Economy, and Monetary Policy\nNow I’ll turn to some high-level perspectives on current economic\nconditions and monetary policy. These views are my own; I’m not speaking for\nmy colleagues at other Reserve Banks or the Board in Washington.\nCongress has charged the Federal Reserve with a dual mandate of price\nstability and maximum employment. We define price stability as 2% inflation – a\nlow level, where consumers and businesses do not have to focus on protecting\nthemselves from eroding purchasing power. Maximum employment, while less\nspecifically defined, refers to the broad inclusive goal of job opportunities for all\nAmericans. History has shown that price stability is a precondition to achieving\nmaximum employment over the medium and long run. The two dimensions of\nour mandate are intertwined.\nBut at the moment, inflation remains too high. Rapidly rising prices for\nnecessities like food, housing, and transportation are also disproportionately\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\naffecting the most vulnerable. And rising input costs, and wage pressures,\ncomplicate investment and planning decisions for firms, as well.\nIt is the Fed’s mandate to bring inflation back down to the 2% target. The\nFed’s monetary policymaking committee is called the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, or FOMC. Actions taken by the FOMC since March, together with\nthe guidance provided in its most recent projections, illustrate policymakers’\nresolve to address high inflation expeditiously, and prevent it from becoming\nentrenched in expectations.\nThe rise in the overall inflation rate after the early stages of the pandemic\nstems from supply bottlenecks caused by the pandemic, and the food and energy\ndisruptions related to the war in Ukraine – as well as from the very rapid\neconomic recovery from the COVID outbreak, which has resulted in an extremely\ntight domestic labor market.\nThere is little the Fed can do to alleviate pandemic-related bottlenecks in\nthe global supply chain and increases in energy and commodity prices related to\nthe war in Ukraine. Some of the global supply chain problems that contributed to\ntemporarily high inflation are beginning to fade. But of course, we don’t know\nwhen the war will end, or when effects of the pandemic will fully abate.\nFurthermore, domestic labor supply developments are also beyond the\nFed’s control – though of course, we study these trends to understand their\nimplications. An aging population, lower immigration, pandemic-related health\nconcerns, and early retirements have all contributed to a shortage of workers.\nMonetary policy does, however, play an active role in affecting demand.\nAnd demand for goods and services clearly exceeds the economy’s productive\ncapacity right now, which is being manifested in a very hot labor market. The\nexcessive labor market tightness is illustrated by an historically high level of job\nvacancies – currently around two vacancies for every unemployed worker – and\nby the inflationary push associated with rapidly rising wages.\nTo address this situation, the Fed is raising interest rates, which slows the\ninterest-sensitive components of demand. Returning the markets for goods,\nservices and labor to a more stable balance is how monetary policy lowers\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ninflation back to the 2% target. I do anticipate that accomplishing price stability\nwill require slower employment growth and a somewhat higher unemployment\nrate. And I take very seriously that unemployment is painful, and that its costs\nhave been disproportionately concentrated among groups that have traditionally\nbeen marginalized.\nHence it is no surprise that, as monetary policy moves to a restrictive\nstance to transition the economy to more sustainable labor market conditions,\nthere is apprehension about the possibility of a significant downturn. I do believe\nthe goal of a more modest slowdown, while challenging, is achievable.\nThere are reasons to be somewhat more optimistic about the ability to\nachieve the necessary slowing of demand without leading to a significant\ndownturn, this time around. Household and business balance sheets are\nconsiderably stronger than in previous tightening cycles, reducing the risk of a\nsignificant retrenchment in spending and investment as interest rates rise.\nLabor market conditions also differ from past cycles. Firms seem to have\ntoo few workers, not an excess, suggesting that this time a slowdown in activity\nmay have a smaller impact on employment.\nDespite these potentially more favorable conditions, there are of course\nalso downside risks to the outlook. A significant economic or geopolitical event\ncould push our economy into a recession as policy tightens further. Moreover,\ncalibrating policy in these circumstances will be complicated by the fact that\nsome effects of monetary policy work with a lag.\nI’ll end this part of my remarks by reiterating my commitment to bring\ninflation back to the 2 percent target, recognizing the toll that high inflation is\nalready taking, noting that it will be harder to bring inflation down if high expected\ninflation were to become entrenched, and reiterating that price stability sets the\nfoundation for sustainable maximum employment.\nReturning inflation to target will require further tightening of monetary\npolicy, as signaled in the recent FOMC projections. It will be important to see\nclear and convincing signs that inflation is falling, and I will continue to assess the\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nrange of incoming data, both quantitative and qualitative, as inputs to my future\npolicy determinations.\nA Focus on New England\nTurning briefly to New England’s economy, the mix of cutting-edge work\nbeing done here, and the smart people who do it, make the region a national\ntreasure and an international powerhouse. Of course, it does have challenges.\nLet me say a bit more about the regional economy – building both from\nstatistical analyses and what we hear from stakeholders. I’m sure some of these\nthemes will be familiar to you.\nAmong the strengths, I’ll highlight:\n▪ The region’s collective brainpower, diverse and skilled workforce, and\necosystem of innovation.\n▪ The world-class institutions and organizations – in many fields, but\nnotably in education, health, technology, and finance.\n▪ Our vibrant nonprofit, cultural, and public-policy sectors.\n▪ The geography and physical features that make New England such\nan appealing place to live, locate a business, or visit.\n▪ And last but not least, job opportunities have historically been plentiful\nin this region – though with some variation by area. Of course, high\nunfilled job openings factor into the region’s economic challenges, too.\nLet me summarize some key challenges and opportunities:\n▪ I repeatedly hear about the cost and availability of housing. House-\nprice and rent increases have been substantial. Housing affordability\nendangers our ability to attract and retain the workers needed in the\nregion’s economy.\n▪ In addition, pockets of the region face persistent social and economic\nchallenges.\n▪ Concerns about the reliability of key services essential to participating\nin the job market (such as dependent care, and transportation).\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n▪ New England, like many parts of our country, is challenged by\nreduced labor force participation.\n▪ And demographic factors, including net aging of the population,\ncontribute to lower labor-market participation and have implications for\nthe demand and supply of goods and services.\nThoughts on the Boston Fed, as its New Leader\nMany of these challenges are the purview of elected leaders and fiscal\npolicymakers. At the Fed, our commitment to a vibrant, inclusive economy and\nfinancial system leads us to contribute as objective researchers; and at times as\nconveners, bringing attention to cross-sector opportunities.\nWith the fresh eyes of someone immersed in this organization for just a\nfew months, I’ll share some early observations about the Boston Fed and its\nroles, and what I would like us to prioritize and build on, going forward.\nOne is our tradition of analytical rigor, as we study the economy.\nNonpartisan, unbiased research can be a public service, we hope, to anyone –\nand particularly those whose decisions impact others. With a commitment to\npursuing our dual mandate, I will focus on the data and analysis as I participate\non the FOMC, as a voting member in the rotation this year, and going forward.\nTo me, statistical data is complemented by qualitative information –\ninsights that stakeholders from different regions and sectors provide. I’ve started\nengaging with a range of stakeholders, to better understand the challenges and\nstrengths of the economy from their perspectives.\nI’m also very committed to the breadth of our work at the Boston Fed.\nWhat we do is much more extensive and varied than most people realize.\nThe roles we play are broad, but they all have a strong link to supporting\na healthy economy and financial system characterized by price stability and\nmaximum employment, our mandate. Today, let me mention two areas.\nFirst, there is exciting work underway to ensure our country’s payments\ninfrastructure meets the public’s needs. Reserve Banks underpin many of the\n8\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nways Americans make and receive payment – supporting coins and currency,\nchecks, and electronic payments (like the automated clearing house which\nsupports services like direct deposit, and systems that support wire transfers).\nThe Fed is building a new, real-time payments “rail” that will change the\nfuture of payments – called the FedNowSM service. Our C.O.O. Ken\nMontgomery, and many others at the Boston Fed, are leading the execution of\nthis work.\nThe FedNow service will provide a new clearing and settlement\ninfrastructure, enabling participating financial institutions to provide instant\npayment services in real-time – 24/7, 365. The Fed’s connections with more\nthan 10,000 financial institutions mean this instant-payments infrastructure really\nwill be nationwide.\nFor businesses, it will mean the ability to make just-in-time payments to\nworkers or suppliers, or receive an immediate payment at the time of sale. For\nindividuals, instant payments can be used to facilitate time-sensitive bill\npayments or reduce high-cost “bridge” borrowing. We recently announced that\nFedNow’s release is planned for mid-2023.\nSecond, I’d like to mention work to support community economic\ndevelopment, expanding opportunities for everyone to participate in the\neconomy.\nThe Boston Fed is making a unique impact on economies of smaller\ncities, regions, and rural areas through our “Working Places” initiatives. The\nwork builds on the lessons from formerly industrial areas that adapted well to the\nloss of manufacturing jobs some decades ago. Research showed that for\nresurgence, the key seems to be collaboration across sectors, and working\ntoward a common long-term vision at the local level.\nSo Working Places, which began in 2013, has helped foster increases in\nthat collaboration among state government, the private sector, philanthropy, local\norganizations, and residents. The Fed does not direct this work; it is truly local.\nWe help convene, catalyze, and connect – and it makes a difference.\n9\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Monday, September 26, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nCommunities participating in Working Places report solving problems,\nmaking changes that create opportunities and jobs, and enlisting new voices and\npartners to shape progress. Local teams develop goals and strategies, which\ncommonly include workforce development, poverty reduction, affordable housing,\nand removing barriers to entrepreneurship. Working Places has expanded to 30\ncommunities in 5 New England states.\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, at the Boston Fed our focus will always be on serving the\npublic interest. We’ll work in ways both well-known and “under the hood” to\nsupport a vibrant economy and financial system that all can depend on.\nThe challenges in our region, some of which I mentioned, clearly require\ncross-sector collaboration. If sectors work together, there are opportunities to\nsecure a regional economy that flourishes for generations to come. Like so\nmany of you, I am energized and inspired by that prospect.\nThank you for the opportunity to share some of my views. I look forward\nto speaking with you, Jim, and answering some questions. Indeed, I appreciate\ntalking with people around the region, in many different ways – including through\nforums like this.\nThank you.\n10",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nJanuary 9, 2025\nBoston, Massachusetts\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, January 9, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nKey Takeaways\n1. As we begin the new year, “the economy is in a good place overall.”\n“Inflation is down significantly from its 2022 peak,” and data continue to point to a gradual, if uneven,\ntrajectory back to the Fed’s 2 percent target. This has been accomplished with a labor market that has\nstayed healthy “as unsustainably hot job-market conditions from two years ago cooled in an orderly way.”\n2. By describing the economy as in a good place overall, Collins is not declaring victory – and in fact\nsees “considerable uncertainty accompanying my baseline outlook.”\n“While inflation is down significantly, it is still above target; and its decline has been slower and bumpier”\nthan anticipated. Collins described multiple types of uncertainty – including “noisy” measurement of key\neconomic variables, unusual features of the post-pandemic economy, and possible future policy changes\nand geopolitical developments.\n3. Reflecting on 2024, Collins notes three takeaways that influence her thinking about 2025.\nThe first involves the importance of supply factors, which have been critical in economic developments since\n2020 (including supply-chain disruption and then normalization, favorable labor-supply developments, and\ngrowing productivity). The second takeaway involves unusual features of the economy persisting post-\npandemic. These include the longer-than-expected cushion from strong household and firm finances, which\n“potentially lengthened the time for higher rates to work their way through the economy,” and the long catch-\nup process of existing rents to new market rents in keeping shelter inflation elevated. A related and the third\ntakeaway is the importance “of distinguishing potential new price pressures from the dynamics of past\nshocks.”\n4. In achieving both parts of the Fed’s dual mandate from Congress, Collins noted the importance of\ncontinued focus on price stability and preserving healthy job market conditions.\nAppropriately restrictive monetary policy has helped to rebalance demand and supply. A cooling labor\nmarket was an important reason for beginning to normalize policy, but “my concerns about emerging labor\nmarket fragility have decreased more recently, as the unemployment rate stabilized” after rising in the first\nhalf of 2024. On the other facet of the Fed’s mandate, although the rate of price increases has moderated\nnotably, high price levels have eroded purchasing power – underlining that “not just restoring, but\nmaintaining, price stability is essential.”\n5. Collins said she supported the rate cuts in November and December although “the most recent\none was a closer call.” Her current outlook is broadly in line with the median forecast in the\nDecember Summary of Economic Projections by participants in the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\n“On balance, the December cut provided some additional insurance to preserve healthy labor market\nconditions while maintaining a restrictive policy stance that is still needed to sustainably restore price\nstability.” Collins expects inflation in 2025 to run somewhat higher than she previously thought, with the risks\nlikely having shifted to the upside.\n6. A gradual, patient, and holistic approach to policymaking is appropriate.\nPolicy is well positioned to adjust as required to evolving conditions – holding at the current level for longer if\nthere is little further progress on inflation, or easing sooner if the need arises – “but there is no preset path.”\nWith the economy in a good place overall but with significant risks and uncertainties, “the appropriate policy\nstrategy is gradualism, anchored by holistic data assessment, careful analysis, and patience” – taking the\ntime to fully assess additional information, not over-reacting to individual data readings, and calibrating\npolicy meeting by meeting.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, January 9, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIt is a pleasure to be with you this morning. I’d especially like to thank Tamara Small, CEO of\nNAIOP Massachusetts, for inviting me to join you. And Kim Sherman Stamler, president of Related Beal,\nfor being part of this program. Kim is a member of our board of directors at the Federal Reserve Bank,\nproviding us with terrific insights on the industry and financial conditions. I’m very grateful for her public\nservice on the board.\nI’d also like to welcome all of you to the Boston Fed. Interacting with a wide variety of\nstakeholders in our economy is so important to monetary policymaking. I make sure to meet, and listen to,\nparticipants in the economy from all industries and backgrounds. Certainly it is wonderful to meet with so\nmany leaders in commercial real estate today.\nSince many of you are involved in development, I’ll briefly mention that we at the Boston Fed\nconsider this place an example of the civic role of buildings, and development vision. It is one way our\norganization has been able to contribute to Boston’s vibrancy. By all accounts the late sixties and early\nseventies had not been especially kind to this part of Boston, and when the Fed outgrew its Pearl Street\nlocation, and built this site, it helped expand the city’s financial district.1 Today, this tower hosts a number\nof tenant firms as well as the Boston Fed. This area has since been enhanced with many buildings and\ndevelopments, by the restoration of Dewey Square, the creation of the Greenway, and the remarkable\ngrowth of the Seaport to the east of us.\nWe at the Boston Fed are here working on a variety of functions – all supporting the foundations of\nthe economy and financial system. Our work includes monetary policy, economic research, bank\nsupervision, payments and financial-infrastructure services, and community economic development.\nMy comments today will focus on the economy and monetary policy. As we begin this new year,\nthe economy is in a good place overall. However, economic uncertainty is high, and additional information\n– about developments in inflation and the labor market, about possible fiscal and trade policy changes,\nand more – will be key to determining the appropriate course for monetary policy in the year ahead.\nIn my remarks today, I’d like to do four things. I’ll start with describing what I mean when I say the\neconomy “is in a good place” and will refer to current conditions as well as my outlook. That will lead me\nto a brief discussion of elevated uncertainty, and the implications for monetary policy. I’ll end by offering a\nfew reflections from 2024 that are influencing my thinking about the economy and policy for 2025. Then I\nlook forward to taking some questions in the discussion with Kim.\nBut first, my standard disclaimer: these are my own perspectives, not necessarily those of my\ncolleagues on the Fed’s Board of Governors or at other Reserve Banks.\n1 See “A Bank, A Man, A Region” - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, pgs. 18-20.\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, January 9, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThe Economy is in a Good Place Overall\nMy views about the economy are based on a wide range of information – including assessments\nof the broad array of quantitative indicators my team and I monitor, statistical analyses, and what I learn\nfrom engagements with stakeholders across the Boston Fed’s District, which is most of New England.2\nThere are some mixed signals in all of this information and the data continue to be noisy (which I’ll have\nmore to say about). Still, key dimensions of the economic picture seem to me reasonably clear with\nrespect to progress toward price stability and maximum employment – the Fed’s dual mandate from\nCongress.\nThe Fed defines price stability as 2 percent inflation. I think of it more generally as inflation that is\nlow and stable enough that most people aren’t paying attention to it while they go about their activities.\nClearly, that benign state has not prevailed since inflation surged in the aftermath of the pandemic, and\nwe have all seen how difficult high inflation is for households and for firms. Maximum employment, the\nother leg of the Fed’s dual mandate, is defined less precisely, but can be thought of as an economic\nenvironment that offers job opportunities to those who want work.\nAs we enter 2025, inflation is down significantly from its 2022 peak, and the data continue to point\nto a gradual, if uneven, trajectory back to the Fed’s 2 percent target. Importantly, this progress has been\naccomplished with a labor market that has stayed healthy overall, as unsustainably hot job-market\nconditions from two years ago cooled in an orderly way. Demand and supply for workers are now in much\nbetter balance, and the unemployment rate has remained low by historical standards, amid solid\neconomic growth. This is all good news, and central to what I mean by describing the economy as being\nin a good place.\nContributors to the Positive Developments So Far\nI’ll briefly note three sets of factors that have contributed to these positive outcomes so far.\nFirst are developments related to the supply side of the economy. Economic growth that is\ndemand-driven tends to be inflationary, while the combination of strong growth with limited signs of new\nprice pressures point to supply improvements playing an important role. In that dimension, supply-chain\n2 I have gained valuable insights about economic conditions by hearing on-the-ground perspectives, for\nexample related to the pervasive challenges of housing availability and the widespread business-leader\nfocus on enhancing productivity. More generally, given the Boston Fed’s overarching mission of a vibrant\neconomy that works for all, it is essential for our Bank to engage with stakeholders of all types across\nurban and rural parts of the six states in our District.\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, January 9, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nnormalization has been particularly important (especially during 2022).3 And we have seen growth in labor\nsupply and productivity. The labor-supply expansion has come both from significant increases in\nimmigration4 and from a larger-than-expected rise in prime-age labor force participation (evident across\ngender and racial/ethnic groups).5 These supply improvements were particularly welcome amid very tight\nlabor markets. And last but not least, labor productivity – that is, output per hour worked – has been\ngrowing notably faster than its pre-pandemic trend. To be clear, there are many possible explanations for\nthis rise in trend productivity growth, and it is unclear how long it will persist. However, the improvements\nto date have had favorable implications by supporting economic growth and the disinflation process.6\nSecond, restrictive monetary policy has been doing its job, helping to rebalance demand and\nsupply by restraining the interest-sensitive segments of demand and thus reducing pressure on wages\nand prices.7 The large, rapid increases in the Fed’s policy rate in the second half of 2022, followed by\nmore gradual hikes and then holding rates at 5.5 percent for over a year, underscored the Fed’s\ncommitment to restoring price stability and helped to keep long-term inflation expectations from rising.\nThe fact that inflation expectations have remained well anchored reflects the Fed’s earned credibility –\nand is something I’ll continue to watch closely.\nThe third, related, point is that both household and firm balance sheets were unusually strong\ncoming out of the pandemic, and supported economic growth even in the face of higher interest rates.\nWhile balance sheets remain in good shape, some buffers have waned over time as many households\nhave depleted their excess savings and corporate cash balances have reverted to pre-pandemic trends.\nThis normalization was accompanied by a slowdown in labor demand.\nA cooling labor market was an important reason for beginning to reduce the degree of policy\nrestrictiveness in September. This policy decision was reinforced by concerns about possible emerging\nfragilities, as slowing and more concentrated payroll growth, together with declining quit and job-finding\nrates, increased the risk of a more pronounced and unwanted weakening of labor market conditions.\nIndeed, with inflation heading back to target, a key goal for policy became preserving healthy labor\n3 The New York Fed provides a monthly index of global supply chain pressures – which surged during\n2020-2022, falling back to its pre-pandemic range by the first quarter of 2023. See the Global Supply\nChain Pressure Index (GSCPI) - Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n4 On the effects of recent immigration on labor supply, see “Quantifying the Recent Immigration Surge:\nEvidence from Work-permit Applications” - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n5 See the discussion in my November 20, 2024 speech at the University of Michigan: Perspectives on the\nEconomy and Policy - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\n6 Additional discussions of recent labor productivity gains include my November 20, 2024 University of\nMichigan speech, as well as “The Recent Rise in US Labor Productivity” by Luke Pardue, published by\nthe Aspen Economic Strategy Group of the Aspen Institute (Labor Productivity In Brief).\n7 Demand-driven inflation has moderated notably since 2023, which coincides with my assessment of\nwhen monetary policy moved firmly into restrictive territory.\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, January 9, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nmarket conditions while continuing to bring inflation down. I continue to monitor a range of indicators\nclosely, but my concerns about emerging labor market fragility have decreased more recently, as the\nunemployment rate stabilized after rising notably in the first half of 2024.\nA Closer Look at Inflation\nTo be clear, by describing the economy as in a good place overall, I am not declaring “victory.” In\nparticular, while inflation is down significantly, it is still above target; its decline has been slower and\nbumpier than I anticipated; and there is considerable uncertainty accompanying my baseline outlook. It\nwill be essential to remain data dependent going forward, with a clear commitment to restoring price\nstability over time, while being mindful of sustaining healthy labor market conditions.\nIn tracking inflation, I find it helpful to focus on core (instead of total) inflation. Although it omits\nthe obviously vital (though volatile) components of food and energy, core is generally a better gauge of\nunderlying inflation trends. On a 12-month basis, core PCE inflation was 2.8 percent in October and\nNovember. While this partly reflects high monthly readings in the first quarter of 2024, it is only a marginal\nimprovement from the 3 percent rate registered at the end of 2023.\nSome insight into the recent disinflation process is provided by dividing core inflation into its three\ncomponents, which behave quite differently. Core goods inflation had declined back to its pre-pandemic\nrange by the end of 2023, as supply-chain disruptions normalized. Non-housing services is a large, varied\ncategory where inflation has been highly volatile, including a big, unexpected bump at the beginning of\n2024. But recent monthly inflation readings for this component have also returned to their pre-pandemic\nrange – and I’ll be watching closely to see if the decline is sustained.\nMuch of the continued elevation in inflation comes from the third component, housing services,\nwhich seemed “stuck” at the end of 2023 and well into 2024. This has likely reflected long lags for the\nrents charged to existing tenants to catch up to the significantly higher rent levels associated with new\nleases.8 Here too, recent data are promising. If new market rent growth remains subdued, shelter price\ninflation should eventually normalize, though it is difficult to predict when or how quickly this will happen.\n8 In 2022 and early 2023, rent to new lessors surged, contributing to higher inflation and pushing up the\nlevel of new market rents. This created a large gap between the rent landlords were receiving from new\nrenters relative to those with existing leases in similar units. Over time, the gap is being narrowed as\nmany landlords ask existing renters for larger than typical annual rent increases. This “catch-up” is a key\nsource of the current elevation of shelter inflation, and it is difficult to tell how long it will last. But it reflects\nadjustment to the past surge in new rents. Although the level of new market rents remains high, they have\nbeen growing at a similar pace to growth rates pre-pandemic for many months. So, growth in new market\nrents does not appear to be a source of new price pressures.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, January 9, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nImportantly, current labor market conditions also appear unlikely to be a source of new price\npressures – even though wages continue to grow more rapidly than their pre-pandemic trend. Indeed,\nanalysis by Boston Fed staff show that labor remains relatively inexpensive overall, given recent\nproductivity gains and price developments. There is likely some room for additional wage gains that would\nhelp to raise the purchasing power and economic wellbeing of workers, without fueling inflation.9\nAlthough the rate of price increases has moderated notably since 2022, I continue to hear during\nmy visits across New England how high price levels have eroded purchasing power for some households.\nThis is a concern especially for those at the lower end of the income distribution. History has shown that\nperiods of sustained price stability can create conditions where the benefits of economic prosperity are\nshared more broadly. To me, this is another reminder that not just restoring, but maintaining, price\nstability is an essential part of the Fed’s mission to serve the public. I’ll turn to policy and my outlook after\nsaying a bit more about the elevated uncertainty.\nElevated Uncertainty\nIn a speech given at Wellesley College in the fall of 2023, I focused on monetary policy amid\nuncertainty.10 Drawing on the large literature on this topic – summarized, for example, in an influential\n2004 speech by then Fed Governor Ben Bernanke11 – my remarks emphasized two points.\nFirst, there are multiple types of uncertainty. All were elevated at the time, and uncertainty\nremains elevated. One type of uncertainty relates to data and measurement of key economic variables.\nFor instance, monthly inflation indicators, such as the CPI and PCE, continue to exhibit more than the\nusual degree of volatility. There is also a wide range of views about current levels of economic\nfundamentals, such as the potential – or trend – growth of the economy and the neutral rate of interest.12\nA second type is uncertainty about relationships between key economic variables that influence policy\ndecisions. For instance, as I have noted, the Fed increased rates rapidly starting in early 2022 and has\nmaintained a restrictive policy stance for a considerable amount of time. But high interest rates appear to\n9 For recent analyses on this topic, see “Is Post-pandemic Wage Growth Fueling Inflation?” - Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston (bostonfed.org), and “Productivity Improvements and Markup Normalization Can\nSupport Further Wage Gains without Inflationary Pressures” - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\n(bostonfed.org).\n10 See my 2023 Goldman Lecture in Economics at Wellesley College, “Reflections on Phasing Policy\nAmidst (Pandemic) Uncertainty”, available at https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-\nevents/speeches/2023/reflections-on-phasing-policy-amidst-pandemic-uncertainty.aspx.\n11 See FRB: Speech, Bernanke--Gradualism--May 20, 2004.\n12 For instance, the FOMC participants provide a wide range of estimates in the quarterly SEP (Summary\nof Economic Projections) – and this range has grown recently. See The Fed - December 18, 2024:\nFOMC Projections materials, accessible version\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, January 9, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nhave had a smaller and more delayed impact on demand than historical estimates suggest. And the third\ntype relates to unforeseen future events, including pandemics, natural disasters, future policy changes,\nand geopolitical developments. Here, I’ll note the sizable recent rise in indicators of U.S. trade policy\nuncertainty.13\nSecond, heightened uncertainty about current economic conditions and benchmarks and about\nthe economy’s response to policy changes typically calls for a cautious, gradual approach to monetary\ndecision-making. The need for more aggressive policy adjustments arises when policymakers see\nimminent risks to the achievement of their objectives. But with an economy that is in a good place overall\nand policy already closer to a more neutral stance, I view the current nature of uncertainty as calling for a\ngradual and patient approach to policymaking.\nThe Outlook, and Policy\nAmid this uncertainty, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began normalizing policy in\nlate 2024, beginning with a 50 basis-point cut in September. I saw this move as fully appropriate – given\nthe significant, if bumpy, progress on inflation. The adjustment recognized that there was no need for\nfurther cooling of the no-longer-overheated labor market; that a given nominal policy rate would become\nincreasingly restrictive as inflation came down; and that as the pace of growth moderates, the economy\ncan be more vulnerable to adverse shocks.\nI also supported the smaller additional rate cuts in November and December – though for me, the\nmost recent one was a closer call. On balance, the December cut provided some additional insurance to\npreserve healthy labor market conditions while maintaining a restrictive policy stance that is still needed\nto sustainably restore price stability.\nLooking ahead, my current outlook is broadly in line with the median forecast in the December\nFOMC Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).14 In particular, I expect inflation in 2025 to run\nsomewhat higher than I previously thought, with the risks likely having shifted to the upside. As I’ve\ndiscussed, inflation, while notably closer to the 2 percent target, has proved “stickier” than anticipated.\nHowever, it is too early to tell how future policy changes by the new administration and Congress might\ninfluence the trajectories of inflation and economic activity. Separately, I will also note that it will take\nsome time for the effects of our monetary policy actions to filter through to the economy (often referred to\n13 See the Trade Policy Uncertainty Index at https://www.matteoiacoviello.com/tpu.htm, which is based on\nthe work by Caldara, Iacoviello, Molligo, Prestipino, and Raffo (2020), \"The Economic Effects of Trade\nPolicy Uncertainty,\" Journal of Monetary Economics, 109, pp.38-59.\n14 Summary of Economic Projections, December 18, 2024\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, January 9, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nas “long and variable lags”). And while the labor market remains healthy, I will continue to watch for\npossible fragilities, remaining attentive to both sides of our dual mandate, and recognizing risks to both\ninflation and employment.\nThis context calls for a patient approach to policy – taking the time to fully assess available\ninformation and not over-reacting to individual data readings, as we calibrate policy meeting by meeting.\nAs in the median SEP projection, this likely implies a more gradual approach to policy normalization. But\nthere is no preset path, and a projection is certainly not a promise. In my view, policy is well positioned to\nadjust as required to evolving conditions – holding at the current level for longer if there is little further\nprogress on inflation, or easing sooner if the need arises.\nSome Lessons from 2024, for 2025\nAs I reflect on economic developments from the past year (and more generally, from the two and\na half years I have served as Boston Fed president), three things stand out that influence my thinking\nabout the year ahead. While each has been included in my remarks today, I’ll pull these lessons together\nhere, and then wrap up by connecting them to policy:\nThe first lesson: don’t forget about the supply-side of the economy. Supply factors have played a\ncritical role in economic developments since 2020. Arguably, the severity and persistence of supply-chain\ndisruptions were underappreciated as inflation surged in 2022. And as noted above, favorable productivity\nand labor supply developments have been key, both to disinflation amid strong economic growth, and to\nsolid wage growth that is increasing purchasing power without fueling price pressures. These linkages\nmay seem evident in hindsight but were not fully anticipated. Of course, we cannot count on such\nfavorable supply developments persisting – and the supply side of the economy will continue to warrant\ncareful attention.\nSecond, recognize that unusual features of the economy are persisting post-pandemic. My\nremarks highlighted two examples. One is the longer-than-expected “cushion” from strong household\nbalance sheets. In the aftermath of the pandemic, this has contributed to resilient household spending\nand potentially lengthened the time for higher rates to work their way through the economy. A second is\nthe longer-than-expected catch-up process of existing rents to new market rents, and the associated\ndifficulties in predicting the evolution of shelter inflation in the post-pandemic housing market.\nThird, focus on distinguishing potential new price pressures from the dynamics of past shocks.\nThis point connects closely to the prior one. In particular, my confidence that shelter inflation is on a\ndownward (if slow and bumpy) path relates directly to the evidence that new market rent growth has\nstabilized at its average pre-pandemic rate. Provided that this pattern continues, there is much less\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, January 9, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nreason for concern about the longer-than-expected “catch-up” period to narrow the gap between rent\nlevels on existing and new leases. Similarly, the likelihood that recent solid wage growth will generate\nnew price pressures must be assessed in the context of productivity developments and past inflation –\nand there is little evidence of this so far. I’ll be looking carefully to see if new price pressures emerge in\nthe months ahead.\nImportantly, as I have noted, uncertainty remains elevated. This includes volatile (or “noisy”)\nmonthly data, uncertainties related to unusual features of the post-pandemic economy such as those\nnoted above, uncertainty about possible future policy, and uncertainty about fundamentals such as the\nlevel of the neutral rate of interest.\nWith noisy data providing some mixed signals, focusing on only a few indicators can paint a\nmisleading picture. It is essential to assess a broad range of information over time to gain a clearer\npicture of current economic conditions and, importantly, their likely evolution. Furthermore, as I have\nemphasized, in this context, with the economy in a good place overall but with significant risks and\nuncertainties, the appropriate policy strategy is gradualism, anchored by holistic data assessment, careful\nanalysis and patience.\nWith that, I’ll again say thank you to NAIOP, Tamara Small, and all of you for being here today.\nVery best wishes for a wonderful 2025. I look forward to sitting down with Kim Sherman Stamler for some\nquestions.\n8",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nAugust 31, 2023\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nKey Takeaways\n1. To build a vibrant, inclusive economy, we need the best ideas, energy, and participation\nfrom everyone. Community colleges play a critical role in this important work by providing\naffordable, accessible higher education and essential skill development – ultimately\nstrengthening our economy and society.\n2. Collins said we can and should do much more to discover and nurture the potential in\npeople with a range of experiences and backgrounds – including individuals who may be\nthe first in their family to attend college and individuals who may look different in\nappearance from those who’ve traditionally held particular roles.\n3. Reflecting on her first 14 months as Boston Fed president, Collins said she’s been\nimpressed and encouraged by the leaders and residents she’s met who are working to\nensure everyone has a chance to participate and thrive in the economy. The Boston Fed\nbelieves in the power of collaborative leadership to make local economies stronger and\nmore inclusive. The Bank knows from experience that tangible, practical, community-based\nefforts serve to strengthen our region.\n4. Collins commended community college students for having resilience, determination, and\nthe ability to overcome challenges. These traits, she added, give them the potential to be\nhighly capable contributors to economy. She also shared her appreciation for the faculty\nand staff supporting those students.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIt is truly a pleasure to join you this morning for the 2023 Bunker Hill\nConvocation! It’s always wonderful to be among faculty and staff, and I am delighted to\nknow many students are here as well. I want to thank President Eddinger and Provost\nCaniff for inviting me to be with you today.\nThe start to a new academic year is a very exciting time – and I know, also an\nextremely busy one. Having spent most of my career in academia, your convocation\nreminds me of so many starts to the academic year – initially as a student, then for\nabout 25 years as a faculty member, and for nearly another 15 as a university\nadministrator. I have many wonderful memories of meeting students; launching\nprograms; and welcoming, and welcoming back, faculty and staff – who are the\nessential pillars in every higher education institution.\nIn my current role, I lead an institution that, like yours, has a public mission. At\nthe Federal Reserve, we work to foster a vibrant, inclusive economy – characterized by\nour congressionally mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment – an\neconomy that works for everyone, not just for some people. However, we know that\neconomic outcomes for some people, some communities, and some places have\ndiverged – despite best efforts – and therefore, many have been unable to fully\nparticipate in the economy. A healthy economy needs the best ideas, energy, and\nparticipation from everyone – with the opportunity to work hard, contribute, and prosper.\nIn that context, I have a particular appreciation for the critical role that Bunker Hill\nCommunity College plays in the greater Boston region. More broadly, I’m thinking\nabout the essential ways community colleges serve our educational system in New\nEngland, and nationally. Simply put, community colleges are foundational to higher\neducation in this country. They enroll nearly half of all first-time undergraduate\nstudents1 and provide an affordable, accessible opportunity for investing in essential\nskills. Here at Bunker Hill, you are supporting students of all ages and backgrounds,\n1 See “Community Colleges and Upward Mobility” by Jack Mountjoy, American Economic Review, Vol.\n112, No. 8, Aug. 2022 (pp. 2580-2630): https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20181756.\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nmany who are the first generation in their families to attend college.2 Your students are\nwonderfully diverse, and you’ve earned the designation of a Hispanic-Serving\nInstitution, and an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving\nInstitution, from the U.S. Department of Education. I want to express my admiration and\nappreciation for all that you do to support and invest in your students. You are\nstrengthening our economy and our society.\nIn my remarks this morning, I’d like to talk about two things. First, I’ll briefly discuss\nmy own career trajectory, with a bit of reflection on lessons and takeaways that I hope\nyou will find helpful. Then I’d like to share my perspective on the importance of a\nvibrant, inclusive economy and mention some of the ways we at the Fed, community\ncolleges like yours, and people across the region are working to achieve that goal. In\nthis discussion, I have a few key themes, including: the vital role of community colleges,\nespecially your work here at Bunker Hill. I’ll also touch on the importance of\npartnerships and collaboration – since success in my work, and yours, requires all of us\nworking together. And finally, since this is a convocation beginning a new academic\nyear, I’ll offer a thought on beginning, persisting, and finishing.\nMy Own Path\nI’d much prefer to talk about the work of the Boston Fed, or Bunker Hill\nCommunity College, than about myself. But I am often asked how I got to be in this\nrole, and whether I have advice for others – especially since I am the first woman of\ncolor to lead a Federal Reserve Bank. I see this as an honor, a privilege, and a\nresponsibility. So, I’ll share some brief reflections based on my own path.\nLike many of your students, I have an international background. I was born in\nScotland to Jamaican parents, and raised in New York City with frequent visits to\n2 See “Community Colleges and the Future of Higher Education” by Michael Patrick Rutter and Steven\nMintz in Inside Higher Ed (March 2019): https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher-ed-\ngamma/community-colleges-and-future-higher-education.\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nJamaica. I see exposure to different cultures as something to joyfully embrace and\nlearn from – and a source of strength for navigating the inevitable challenges each of us\nencounters.\nMy parents certainly passed on their love of learning, and I see myself as a\nlifelong learner. I hope you see yourselves that way, too. While many things interested\nme early on, I took courses in economics in college, and found it really appealed to me\n– including a fascination with how analyzing data could help us understand the complex\neconomy. Studying economics in graduate school, my experiences visiting Jamaica\nand other countries led me to specialize in the international aspects of\nmacroeconomics, with a focus on econometrics, or data analysis.\nLike my father, I began my career in academia as a professor, engaged in\nresearch and teaching, and becoming increasingly interested in using my expertise to\nhelp improve public policies. I eventually moved to academic administration – as dean\nof a public policy school, and then provost. Then fourteen months ago, I started in this\nposition, giving me the opportunity to use my background and experiences now as a\npolicymaker, serving the public interest.\nI know many Bunker Hill students are the first in their families to attend college,\nand recognize how helpful it was for me to have parents and other family members with\nadvanced degrees. Observing them made it easier for me to see myself as a\nprofessional, possibly in a leadership position one day. But while my family saw my\npotential, I can tell you that not everyone in society saw a small, very young-looking\nblack woman as likely to become an economist, a professor, a dean, a provost, or\npresident of a Federal Reserve Bank.\nThere is much more we can, and should, do to look for and nurture the potential\nin people from all backgrounds, including – perhaps especially – people who look\ndifferent from those traditionally seen in particular roles. We should avoid making\nassumptions about the capabilities and possibilities that lie behind mere appearance.\nThis mindset influenced my work as a faculty member, and is one factor that led me to\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nacademic administration. It is also critical for the Fed – as I’ve said, a healthy economy\nneeds ideas, energy, and participation from everyone.\nI also recognize that I’ve been blessed with considerable support throughout my\neducation and career. I’ve benefitted from having a family – parents, as well as a\nhusband and now adult children – who supported and encouraged me along the way. I\nhad instructors, advisors, and mentors too; and the best ones were those who\nchallenged me the most. I am very grateful to each of them.\nBut not everyone has that level of support, which makes the work you do here at\nBunker Hill all the more important. People like to talk about trailblazers opening doors,\nbut an image that resonates with me involves the responsibility, once through that door,\nto hold it open for excellent, high-potential people. I want to congratulate and commend\nyou for opening doors – and holding them open – for your students.\nThis is a convocation, a gathering to mark a beginning of a new school year.\nBeginnings are important, but I suspect you and your students are focused on the entire\njourney – including its resolution. I’m reminded of the extraordinary Jamaican sprinter\nUsain Bolt, who said “There are better starters than me, but I’m a strong finisher.” A\nchallenging start to a journey – whether a sprint or a career – does not determine the\noutcome. What matters is staying the course and finishing. And to be clear, I do not\nsee the most important journeys in life as races. I wish you great success in your own\njourneys as you support your students throughout this school year and beyond.\nCreating a Vibrant, Inclusive Economy – Together\nThe Fed works to foster a vibrant, inclusive economy, and we do that in a much\nwider range of ways than most people realize – monetary policy, economic research,\nfinancial stability work and bank supervision, community and economic development\nactivities, and initiatives and infrastructure related to payments, technology, and finance.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nToday I want to mention a few aspects of the Boston Fed’s work that show the\nbreadth and depth of our efforts to support a strong economy characterized by equitable\nopportunity.\nThe Boston Fed has a reputation for analytical rigor and analysis of current\neconomic data. This is absolutely vital for policy work – as is our long-term research on\na variety of empirical and theoretical topics. We hope our nonpartisan, unbiased\nresearch is a public service. Of course, we study a range of topics related to credit,\nemployment, and inflation. But our work is much broader than that.\nUnfortunately, we can see through our own research that not everyone has the\nsame opportunities to contribute to our economy – which limits its strength and\nvibrancy. We are committed to doing our part to help address this challenge by\nfostering inclusion. Key ways we do this are by examining factors that could limit\npeople participating in the economy going forward, and by collaborating with other\norganizations.\nAs part of that work, the Boston Fed has a decades-long history of studying\nwealth disparities for groups and places. We believe better understanding these gaps\ncan expand opportunities, making them more equitably available, help bring more\npeople into the workforce, and strengthen economic growth and competitiveness.\nIn this context, the Boston Fed recently launched a multi-year research initiative\nto explore wealth disparities in Greater Boston and across Massachusetts. It’s a\ncomplex issue, and we aren’t taking it on ourselves. Our community partners include\nthe Boston Foundation, the Barr Foundation, Eastern Bank Foundation, and the Greater\nBoston Chamber of Commerce.3\n3 See Federal Reserve Bank of Boston press release, “Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and community\npartners launch research effort to explore wealth divides” (April 2022): https://www.bostonfed.org/news-\nand-events/press-releases/2022/boston-fed-and-community-partners-launch-research-effort-to-explore-\nwealth-divides.aspx\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThe initial priorities for this work include measuring family wealth and exploring\nwealth differences between racial-ethnic groups and across geographies. We want to\nbetter understand why certain disparities persist. We hope the findings will be used by\na broad group of public, private, and nonprofit organizations to develop solutions that\npromote equity in wealth – which is a key foundation for greater economic opportunity.\nI’d also briefly mention the Boston Fed’s work to support community economic\ndevelopment, expanding opportunities for everyone to participate in the economy.\nSince 2014, our staff have focused on encouraging local efforts to find economic\nresurgence in smaller cities and rural areas facing long-term struggles. We call it\n“Working Places.”4\nThis initiative, started in 2014, is based on research that showed that an essential\nelement of place-based economic resilience is cross-sector collaboration among local\nindividuals willing to take on shared leadership. Now in 30 communities across 5\nstates, teams of local leaders choose a shared goal for improving the economy that\nbenefits low-income people, and then develop and implement strategies to address\nthem. They focus on issues such as workforce development, poverty reduction,\naffordable housing, and removing barriers to entrepreneurship. This initiative has helped\nfoster collaboration among state government, the private sector, philanthropy, local\norganizations, and residents. The Fed hosts, convenes, and supports these efforts.\nThis ongoing work demonstrates our belief in the power of collaborative networks.\nAs I talk to people in all parts of our region, I hear that people really do want to\ncollaborate and work together to solve problems. Efforts large and small are essential,\nand in combination they can make a real difference and build resilience. In this, I’m\nreminded of the Kenyan proverb, that “Sticks in a bundle are unbreakable.”\nI think about all the working people, leaders, and organizations I’ve visited with\nover the 14 months I’ve been in this job. And in addition to being so impressed with\n4 Learn more about the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s “Working Places” initiatives:\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nwhat they are doing, I’m also incredibly encouraged that local, tangible efforts are\nadding up to real strength in our region. I’d like to tell you about a few of them, and\nhope you find them inspiring and motivating, as I do.\nOften these efforts focus on the basic, practical things that get in the way of\nparticipation in the job market and economy – whether skillsets and training, or reliable\nand affordable childcare, or transportation, or the ability to find housing that’s affordable\nin the vicinity of a job or school. It is important for us to celebrate these sorts of efforts,\nlearn from them, and build on them!\n• A first, obvious example would be right here – the way community colleges give\npeople options to affordably develop skills to lead better lives. I note in your\nmission statement that “The College provides inclusive and affordable access to\nhigher education, supports the success of all students, and forges vibrant\npartnerships and pathways...” And I know you work so hard to provide\n“wraparound” services that help smooth the issues that may be getting in the way\nof students continuing to progress. I also note the range of partnerships with\norganizations you’ve built, to give your students options and opportunities. As\nsomeone who thinks about the economy’s health all the time, I just want to thank\nand commend you for that vital work.\n• Another example – another stick strengthening that bundle – is in Connecticut,\nwhere East Hartford CONNects has launched a Professional Skills Academy with\nthe goal of connecting residents with local employers – in the words of their\ndirector, trying to fill the gap between folks saying, “We need training,” and\nemployers saying, “We will hire anyone as long as they’re career-ready.” A\nrelated effort recruits underrepresented groups into manufacturing with training,\nand stipends that make it possible for people to take time for that training.\n• Other examples touch on the critical economic issue of child care, which gives\noptions to parents who want or need to participate in the workforce. To that end,\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nLeaders for Equitable Local Economies5 is an outgrowth of our Working Places\neffort, and in Fitchburg, the team has implemented a bilingual child care\nentrepreneur training program to help support individuals in opening up their own\nsmall businesses in childcare. The program has 80 graduates and started its fifth\ncohort this month! Similarly, the Waterbury, Connecticut Working Places team\nhas provided training for residents looking to open licensed, home-based child\ncare facilities. So far, 15 new facilities have opened.\nThere are so many other examples I could mention, from longstanding initiatives\nsuch as the public-private partnership facilitated by the Boston Private Industry Council\nfor the Boston Fed and many other employers to hire summer interns from Boston\nPublic Schools, to very recent ones such as the Boston Fed’s Economic Research\nImmersion pilot program this past summer for a small number of community college\nstudents – most from here at Bunker Hill.6 As I go around the region and meet with the\nwide range of the Fed’s stakeholders, people I talk to cite many challenges in our\neconomy in New England, and also many strengths and opportunities. I find these\nstories of people and organizations making a difference to be inspiring and so gratifying.\nWhat you do, what your students do, what we at the Boston Fed are doing, and\nwhat people are doing across New England are all part of making our economy resilient,\nvibrant, and inclusive. Efforts like these are adding to that Kenyan proverb’s bundle and\nhelping to make it unbreakable.\nConcluding Observations\nIn conclusion, I’ll just say that it is so essential that all in society have\nopportunities to enhance skills. You may have heard the saying, likely around for a long\n5 Learn more about the “Leaders for Equitable Local Economies” efforts at:\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces/leaders-for-equitable-local-economies.aspx\n6 See “Boston Fed Program Aims to Attract Diverse Students to Careers in Economics” by Amanda\nBlanco, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (Aug. 2023): https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-\nevents/news/2023/08/boston-fed-program-aims-to-attract-diverse-students-to-careers-in-economics.aspx\n8\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nThursday, August 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ntime and cited by F.D.R., that smooth seas do not make for skilled sailors. One thing I\nlove and respect about community college students is that they set an example in\ncontending with challenges. While no one would wish hardships on a person, there is\nno doubt that your students have built capability, resilience, grit, and the ability to\nmanage many challenges. This gives them the potential to be some of our economy’s\nmost capable contributors. We all do well to recognize that in them!\nHowever, let’s think about that analogy of rough seas. Surviving them can be full\nof amazing lessons – but let’s be honest: on the sea or in life, an instructor, guide,\nmentor, and supporter can turn a harrowing, possibly disastrous challenge into a\nformative one. That’s what you do for your students here at BHCC. For that,\ncongratulations. Best wishes for a great year ahead. And thank you for all you do.\n9",

    "text": "General Discussion:\nAfter the Fall\nChair: Susan M. Collins\nMr. Meltzer: I am a great admirer of the work that Carmen and Vince\nReinhart and Ken Rogoff have done. Carmen and I have discussed this\nat a previous symposium, so she knows I admire the work they have\ndone. What I admire most about it is, unlike most economics, it really\npays attention to the longer-term consequences of actions that are taken,\nsomething sorely missing both in policy discussions and in economic\ndiscussions— and perhaps for the same reason.\nHaving said that, the role of policy is certainly the missing element\nin this study. The two comparable periods they use are the Great\nDepression and the 1973 oil crisis. By 1936, the United States had\napproximately returned to its 1929 level of per capita gross domestic\nproduct (GDP). It then made the serious mistake of ending the fiscal\nstimulus that came from the bonus payment and coupling that with\na severe monetary contraction, usually attributed to the doubling of\nreserve requirements, but in my belief, it had more to do with the\nend of the period of monetizing the gold inflow. We went to a period\nof sterilizing the gold inflow, and that ended that expansion. Would\nthe expansion have looked different but shorter if we had not made\nthat mistake?\n77\n\n78 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nWould the 1973 oil shock have been less severe if the Federal Re-\nserve, led by Arthur Burns, didn’t make the mistake of thinking what\nthey saw was inflation instead of a relative price change and then slam-\nming the economy in order to cut down on the inflation when they\nlater learned in the 2000s the right thing to do was to tell people this\nwill pass through and the inflation rate will not be greatly affected?\nLike Bill White, I am concerned about whether policy could have\nmade a difference. But a major message of this paper and the Rogoff-\nReinhart book for me is the thing you have to change is what you\ndo before, not what you do after. And the major error is the policy\nbefore. In the current crisis, it seems to be clear the Fed had been\nfollowing the Taylor rule pretty closely, and they abandoned it. Al-\nthough that did not cause the crisis, it facilitated a mistake in housing\npolicy by helping finance the last years of that housing policy.\nIn the Federal Reserve’s history of 97 years, the longest period of\nlow inflation and stable growth is the period during which they more\nor less followed the Taylor rule. The period that followed that was a\nperiod in which we have this disaster. So, it seems to me the major\nlesson of this policy is that forecasting is not something economists\ndo very accurately, and they are better off if they follow rules.\nMr. Sinai: Carmen, this is a research question and a suggestion for\nfurther work, if you have not already done it. It relates to the stock\nmarket, especially the generic episodes before and after 1929 and be-\nfore and after 1973 and specifically the latest episode.\nYou examine the behavior of real GDP, unemployment, inflation,\nbank credit and real estate prices in a 21-year window. A price bubble\nin real estate that bursts has been a part of a lot of crises. But why\ndidn’t you include stock prices as a variable of interest, where you\nmight have the data?\nIn the latest episode, United States and globally, in the U.S. eq-\nuity market we had the second-biggest bear market ever—down 56\npercent from peak to trough. Some studies show a huge negative\neffect on household wealth and on consumption and on the funds\nthat come out of the stock market, as well as the change in the cost\nof capital. Psychology had a lot to do with the collapse in consumer\n\nGeneral Discussion 79\nspending, which in turn reverberated around the world to give you\nsome of the synchronous, somewhat-puzzling massive decline in half\nof the 182 countries in the fourth quarter of 2008 that you cite. The\nstock market always plays a big role in these things, so why not in-\nclude it in a list of variables to examine?\nVery quickly a question like Allan Meltzer’s and others’: What\nmight you say about policies in the aftermath of these crises and com-\nmonalities between them if anything, at this point, that we would be\ninterested in hearing about at this conference?\nMr. Feldstein: I think this is a very valuable, very interesting paper,\nand it makes me want to know more using this framework.\nFirst, about deflation, in Chart 12 you show us inflation news—all\nof which is pretty reassuring, reassuring in the sense that all of the dis-\ntribution is in positive inflation rates. And yet there is a lot of concern\nabout the possibility of deflation now. So, I wonder whether asking\nthe question in a different way, a way that emphasizes the degree of\nexcess capacity or the initial starting point, would be a way of helping\nus see whether past episodes suggest deflation is a greater risk today\nthan this chart indicates?\nA second thing that interests me is the story about savings. As\nChairman Bernanke pointed out, we now know the saving rate has\nbeen rising over the last few years, but there is a question of what\nwill happen to savings going forward. Historically, the United States\nhas had a low saving rate for a long period of time. But, if you go\nback to the quarter-century from 1960 to 1985, the saving rate never\ndropped below 7 percent and averaged 9 percent. Given today we\nhave a saving rate of 6 percent—and there has been a lot of loss of\nhousehold wealth—I wonder if there is a way of learning from the\npast experience whether there is still a significant probability of rising\nsaving in the years ahead?\nOne third thing: I like the idea of comparing the decade before\nand the decade after the crisis. A lot of that comparison reflects what\nhappens in the immediate years just before the crisis and the imme-\ndiate years just after the crisis. It would be interesting to know what\nthese comparisons would look like if one omitted, say, the three years\n\n80 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nbefore the crisis and the three years after the crisis so that we saw the\npreceding, say, seven years and the subsequent seven years.\nMr. Gallagher: Carmen, I’m interested in your finding that real\nestate prices are lower almost always 10 years after the crisis than\nbefore the crisis. I know this is beyond the scope of your paper, but\nhow much of that do you think is normal for the housing market\nversus how much of it might be the result of government policies that\nfor whatever reason suppress market forces and prevent a shorter but\nsharper adjustment in real estate prices? Is there enough variation in\nthe policy reaction and enough variation in the housing price pat-\nterns for you to draw any inferences?\nMr. Mussa: Carmen, I am concerned with this paper as it pre-\nsented and interpreted the use and understanding of two words: “af-\nter” and “following.” Forty-four years ago when I read Freidman and\nSchwartz, I learned the financial crisis in the Great Depression may\nhave begun with the stock market crash. It culminated with the bank\nholiday of March 1933. So, I date the end of the crisis and the pe-\nriod beginning the aftermath of the crisis with the summer of 1933.\nThat involved a very spectacular economic recovery over the next\nfour years.\nSimilarly, in the comparison of pre-1929, GDP growth up to a cy-\nclical peak and then the decade afterward, which includes a massive\nrecession not only in the United States but also worldwide, is almost\nsurely going to have lower average annual growth than the preceding\ndecade. We’re not necessarily learning very much from that about\nhow things look once the immediate crisis has been dealt with.\nIt is true that Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve Board made\na horrible mistake in 2008 and 2009 by not allowing another Great\nDepression because by avoiding another Great Depression, we’ve\navoided the possibility beginning two or three years from now of see-\ning GDP growth rates in the range of 8, 10 or 12 percent for a period\nof four or five years. But we want to be a little careful about making\nthose types of comparisons and conclusions.\n\nGeneral Discussion 81\nLet me just note, in the case of Japan, we have a very serious prob-\nlem. Japan had an asset-price inflation far surpassing the 1929 epi-\nsode in the United States. They had a decade of very slow growth.\nBut they had no major depression during that period. Economic pol-\nicy in Japan may have had its problems, but it successfully avoided\na massive collapse of economic activity. Maybe part of the cost of\navoiding that collapse is you get a more prolonged period of relatively\nsluggish growth, rather than one of spectacular recovery.\nMr. Geanakoplos: I admire your work of comparing things across\ncountries, as everyone else has said. I am particularly happy to see\nyou are giving so much attention to leverage and deleveraging. But I\nhave a suggestion, maybe even a critique. You find deleveraging takes\nplace quite a bit after the crash. It is interesting to see it is still going\non so far after the crash. But the fact you’re finding that it happened\nso late is due to a common mismeasurement of leverage. That is,\nleverage should be measured as the loan-to-value ratio of new loans.\nBut, because you are doing such a global thing, you have all the old\nloans there. When things go bad, the old loans are still outstanding.\nGDP is going down, equity is going down, and it looks like leverage\nis going up or not going down very much. But, if you look at the new\nloans, you might find it preceded the crash or happened simultane-\nously with the crash.\nMr. Acharya: I have one suggestion on the methodology. To re-\nally nail it down that the aftereffects you document are because of\na credit cycle preceding the crisis, you should look at some episodes\nwhere there were similar wealth shocks to the economy but that were\nnot preceded by such a substantial rise in leverage. A good exam-\nple would be the NASDAQ crash, which was a pretty large wealth\nshock, probably comparable in magnitude to the recently witnessed\nhousing price shock, but because it wasn’t preceded by a significant\nleverage cycle, the aftermath was easier to deal with. This could also\nexplain why the traditional policy tools that central banks are used to\nemploying are not working as well given we have had a leverage cycle.\nPerhaps we have to write down debt rather than simply stimulating\nthe asset side of the economy?\n\n82 Chair: Susan M. Collins\nMs. Collins: There are already a number of issues on the table,\nand I wanted to take the prerogative of the chair to raise one other\nthought that might be interesting. It’s quite striking how many coun-\ntry episodes one is able to put together, and the Reinhart-Reinhart\nwork as well as the earlier sets of papers really make that clear, the ex-\ntent to which there might be some distinguishing features from those\neconomies that they were able to pull out either more quickly or in a\nmore systematic way. It would be interesting if it were possible to dis-\ntinguish those experiences from some of the other experiences. A lot\nof this clearly early analysis on the longer term focuses on averages, as\nit should. But pulling those things out would be very valuable.\nMs. Reinhart: Thank you, Bill. And thank you all for your com-\nmentary. Very briefly on the issue of supply and demand, which was\nraised more than once. Restoring the supply of credit doesn’t guar-\nantee the renewal of credit. We are pretty cognizant of that. One\nillustrative point was during the Japanese crisis when domestic credit\nwasn’t growing; it wasn’t growing entirely because the supply was\nparalyzed. There was a lack of demand, which in effect drew Japa-\nnese banks to begin their lending boom to emerging Asia in 1995\nand particularly in 1996 and 1997. So, we’re very cognizant that we\nobserve a credit outcome in tracing whether it is supply constraint or\ndemand issues. We’re very cognizant that it is both.\nOn the long-term consequences Allan pointed out, I’d also like to\nhighlight the long-term consequences of the policy response—fiscal\nversus monetary— are very different. In a short paper called “Growth\nin a Time of Debt,” we have tried to highlight the issue that high levels\nof government debt are associated with adverse outcomes for growth.\nVery briefly on Mike’s comment. I think we do say in the paper the\nGreat Depression is remembered for the collapse in output, not the\nslowdown in growth. That is taken strictly from the paper. So, yes, I\ndoubt we would be calling Chairman Bernanke having made a policy\nmistake by putting a very high floor on the output decline.\nMarty, we’ve done as you suggest; we just haven’t gone quite that\nwide with a window. But we do sensitivity analysis in which we do\nnot exclude three years—three years is a lot of information to throw\n\nGeneral Discussion 83\nout. But we do exclude t-1 and t+1 from the analysis. The results are\ndiscussed in a footnote. We have not gone quite as far as you suggest,\nbut in that line.\nOn the policy mistakes: What I’d like to highlight from the analysis\nis the policy response is very heterogeneous in the 15 episodes. Some\ncountries had no fiscal stimulus. Some countries had very, very ag-\ngressive policies for writing down bad debts. Uniformity of the pat-\ntern—because we don’t just report the aggregate results, we report\nthe individual country results as well—does highlight the credit story\nis a very important one to consider, irrespective of what the policy\nresponse was.\nLast, on the issue of leveraging: This is actually a point made that\ndebt-to-GDP often goes up into the crisis, in part because GDP is\noften declining. The point is one to highlight the debt overhang,\nthat the only way you start really seeing the debt-to-GDP go down\nis when it is either through repayment, which is very slow, or also\noutright restructuring of private debt, as this is a discussion of private\ndebt. But those restructurings are often quite delayed. The write-\ndowns either do not materialize or materialize very gradually.\n\n",

    "text": "Commentary: Role Reversal\nin Global Finance\nSusan M. Collins\nIt is a pleasure to discuss Eswar Prasad’s very interesting and\nbroad-reaching paper. One of its strengths is that it weaves together\na large amount of material. In particular, it does an excellent job\nof highlighting some important and dramatic changes in emerging\nversus advanced economy linkages with the global financial market.\nWhile I agree with many of its conclusions, my role as discussant\nis to emphasize some of the areas where we have a different take or\nperhaps disagree.\nLet me start with the paper’s title—role reversal—which frames\nmuch of the approach taken in the first half of the paper, and thus\nmany of the conclusions. As Eswar convincingly demonstrates, this\ncharacterization of what has happened in global financial markets is\ntrue in some very striking ways. However, there are also some ways\nin which I find it misleading, as discussed below.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, as a group the emerging markets—or the\ndeveloping countries as they were then called—were struggling to\ngrow, there was considerable truth in the saying that when the ad-\nvanced countries caught a cold, many developing economies caught\npneumonia. They were mired in external debt, often related to large,\nunsustainable fiscal deficits. They were extremely vulnerable to balance\n391\n\n392 Susan M. Collins\nof payments driven financial crises. In contrast, advanced countries\nincreasingly thought those types of vulnerabilities were behind them.\nThey no longer expected to have any need for balance of payments\nsupport from the IMF, and instead to be a resource for less-developed\neconomies that got into trouble.\nA large literature related developing countries’ vulnerability to\nbalance of payments crises to a variety of structural issues. As the\npaper effectively highlights, these included weak governance insti-\ntutions, underdeveloped domestic financial market, dollarization\nand “original sin.” Their vulnerability also related to mismatch in\nthe currencies of assets and liabilities, sudden stops of cross-border\ncredit flows, limited availability of domestically controlled external\nresources and insufficient financial market regulation.\nFast forward to the more recent period—say 2000-08. As the pa-\nper documents very nicely, this characterization no longer fits the\nemerging markets group. There have been tremendous changes, in\nparticular, in terms of the composition of balance sheets of emerging\nmarkets, with liabilities shifting away from debt and assets shifting\ntoward foreign exchange reserves.\nAnother striking difference is that emerging markets—not the ad-\nvanced economies—have become the drivers of global growth. Again,\nthis is well documented in the paper. (While metrics based on pur-\nchasing power parity (PPP) instead of market exchange rates would\nbe preferred, this would not alter these basic points.) The emerging\nmarkets are trade powerhouses. There have also been striking shifts\nin their net foreign asset position and composition, as already dis-\ncussed. Not only have they proved themselves much less vulnerable\nto financial crises, they are now financing significant portions of the\ndebts of the advanced countries.\nClearly, all of this constitutes strong evidence of role reversal. Over-\nwhelmingly, these changes should be seen as indicative of huge policy\nsuccesses among emerging economics, associated with dramatic im-\nprovements in current living standards and prospects from a signifi-\ncant share of the world’s population.\n\nCommentary 393\nIn contrast, advanced countries are struggling to grow. Many\nconfront major fiscal challenges. Unfortunately, they have learned\nthe hard way that they are, indeed, vulnerable to financial crises. In\npart, their vulnerability is related to instability in their own banking\nsystems—not because of underdevelopment, but because of the ex-\ntremely rapid growth in the size and complexity of financial markets.\nThis growth would have created challenges for prudential regulation,\neven if oversight had not been lax.\nExtensive and growing cross-border linkages have created problems\nof currency mismatch for advanced countries that have been difficult\nto unwind. And post-Lehman, they have also learned they are (still?\nagain?) subject to sudden stops in cross-border capital flows. Again, I\nfully agree that these changes reflect important dimensions in which\nthe role of advanced versus developing countries has “reversed.” In\nthis sense, the term “role reversal” provides a valuable frame for un-\nderstanding developments in global financial markets.\nHowever, in other ways, the role reversal terminology may be mis-\nleading. In particular, it could be taken to suggest that emerging mar-\nkets are increasingly taking over from advanced economies to drive\nglobal financial market integration, as they are increasingly driving\ncross-border trade in goods and services. I do not see emerging mar-\nkets assuming this role in financial markets to date. Further, I see\nlittle indication that “role reversal” in this sense is on the horizon.\nBeginning in the 1960s, advanced economies markets have liberal-\nized their financial borders. They have embraced—indeed becom-\ning stewards of—relatively unfettered cross-border capital flows, al-\nbeit subject to prudential regulations. The emerging markets—and I\nwould argue for good reason—have a much more varied and ambiva-\nlent attitude. I do not think, and the paper does not explicitly argue,\nthat these countries are moving to take over this historically impor-\ntant dimension of the advanced countries’ financial market role.\nThe paper documents that global financial market integra-\ntion has resumed post-crisis and that flows are again on the rise for\nmajor economies. However it does not point out that this process has\ngone much more slowly in the emerging markets than it has for the\n\n394 Susan M. Collins\nindustrial countries. While emerging economies account for half of\nglobal gross domestic product (GDP), (using PPP measures), their\nshare of the global financial market remains substantially smaller\nin terms of growth as well as level. These countries are increasingly\nattractive sites for global capital, so this is, at least in part by design,\nreflecting slower and more nuanced financial liberalization policy. This\nsuggests we are shifting toward a global economy in which one set\nof (emerging) countries dominates growth in real transactions while\nfinancial transactions are dominated by actors from a different set of\n(advanced) countries. Certainly a new and interesting international en-\nvironment—but not one accurately described as role reversal.\nThe paper also provides an extensive and valuable discussion of\nthe many challenges and risks of grappling with global integration.\nHowever, it concludes that capital controls are a poor way to address\nthose challenges. I take a much more nuanced view. In particular, it is\nimportant to separate controls on inflows from controls on outflows,\nrecognizing that these can have very different implications. In partic-\nular, Magud, Reinhart, and Rogoff (2011) provide a comprehensive\nassessment, highlighting that inflows have been helpful in retaining\nmonetary authority as well as in changing the composition (not the\nvolume) of inflows. In some circumstances, the net benefits may be\npositive. I agree with those who argue that some types of capital con-\ntrols are a useful part of the policymakers’ toolkit.\nAlso relevant in the context of this conference on growth is work by\nAizenman, Pinto, and Radziwill (2007), which examines the extent\nto which fixed capital formation has been financed by foreign ver-\nsus domestic saving. Based on analysis of a large sample of countries\nthroughout the 1990s, it concludes that domestic sources accounted\nfor some 90 percent of investment. The domestic share did not de-\ncline in the periods of increasing financial integration, and countries\nwith higher self-financing ratios exhibited faster economic growth.\nIn the context of the growth theme of this conference, this perspec-\ntive raises questions about the costs and benefits from external capi-\ntal. As Ross Levine argues persuasively in his paper for this volume,\nmore need not be better—warranting a much stronger emphasis on\ntype of capital and its allocation, than on the volume of capital.\n\nCommentary 395\nEswar argues the recent crisis was just a brief pause in financial\nintegration. I would cast this a little differently. It seems to me the\nrecent crisis exacerbated some of the differences in perspective on the\nextent to which global integration is important for growth. I don’t\nwant to be misinterpreted. I certainly believe that financial systems\ncan play an extremely positive role in supporting growth. But, as\nnoted above, allocation is at least as, if not more, important than the\ntotal amount. We also have to be broad-minded about appropriate\ntiming for liberalizing capital markets in the context of a broader\nportfolio of associated policies, especially given all the uncertainty\nsurrounding us.\nI would like to suggest a different “frame” for thinking about the\nissues addressed in the second half of the paper than the “role rever-\nsal” frame emphasized here. The frame that kept occurring to me as I\nread the paper relates to a 1985 movie, “Back to the Future.” I hope\nthose of you who remember the movie will forgive my simplified and\nselective summary of the main theme. In “Back to the Future,” the\nmain character is accidentally transported back in time a quarter of a\ncentury and confronted by a world of the past featuring many things\nhe thought had been left behind, including a bully, which I will come\nback to later. His main task is to figure out how to get back to the\nfuture, which of course is the “real” world he has just come from. In\ndoing so, he figures out how to tame the bully, so the future he actu-\nally returns to is, in fact, a much rosier one.\nHere’s the analogy. Think of us as having been accidentally transport-\ned back to a world of about 25 years ago, in which advanced as well\nas emerging market economies were extremely vulnerable to financial\ncrises. The bully in this story, of course, is that part of the financial\nsystem associated with very large and predatory cross-border capital\nflows. Our challenge is how to get back to the future we thought we\nwere living in—one in which we could harness those financial flows in\norder to support growth, and knew how to remove or reduce the vul-\nnerability to financial crisis. From the vantage point of this frame, the\n“simple insurance mechanism” outlined in the second half of the paper\nis really a proposal to try to help us tame that bully.\n\n396 Susan M. Collins\nThe paper motivates its insurance mechanism proposal with a brief\ndiscussion of foreign exchange reserve accumulation as a means of\nself-insurance against financial crises. As it notes, reserve holdings\nhave exploded since 2000—with many emerging economies ac-\ncumulating both before and after the crisis—and some (including\nChina) even continuing to accumulate during the crisis. This puzzling\nbehavior has generated a growing literature, to which the paper pro-\nvides a helpful overview. It emphasizes the costs of this self-insurance\nto individual countries. However, especially for small economies, in\nthe absence of a reliable external alternative, the discussion may un-\nderstate the benefits since large reserve stocks do seem to have helped\ninsulate many emerging economies against an output collapse. The\npaper also mentions that this reserve accumulation behavior creates\na collective action problem by encouraging fiscal profligacy and by\nincreasing the instability of global financial markets. However, these\nare only a subset of the systemic issues involved. For instance, the\npaper gives short shrift to the important challenge of China’s massive\nreserve accumulation, and the associated currency misalignment that\nimposes significant costs on the global economy. As the countries ac-\ncumulating reserves have grown, global assessments of the costs and\nbenefits of this behavior have become more important relative to as-\nsessments from each individual country’s perspective. These complex\nissues warrant considerably more research as well as more attention\nthan they are given here.\nThe paper develops a very interesting proposal to tame the financial\nbully through an ex ante global insurance mechanism. The features of\nthis proposal are clearly described in the paper, and I will not repeat\nthem here. To put my punch line up front, while I see some real strength\nin the proposal, I was not ultimately convinced of its feasibility.\nIn terms of strength, the paper does a good job of spelling out some\nof the key features such a mechanism ought to have. Specifically, the\nproposal is intended to help depoliticize access to liquidity in times\nof need, and reduce the stigma associated with some of the IMF\n\nCommentary 397\nfacilities. Importantly, it stresses the value of shifting from a purely\nindividual calculation by countries to a much more systemic under-\nstanding of the costs and benefits of individual country behavior on\nthe global economy.\nIn terms of feasibility, I would highlight the following three chal-\nlenges. First, how would the insurance premiums be determined and\nby whom? It is not at all clear how to set nonlinear weights to relate a\ncountry’s annual premium to its debt level, or how to set that weight\nrelative to the weight on, say, “excess” foreign exchange reserves, in\nsuch as way that participating countries would agree. Without a “be-\nnevolent dictator” or a well-functioning global governance institu-\ntion, determining important “details” as these seem likely to be sty-\nmied by politics. The proposal really doesn’t address the issue of how\nall of that would get worked out. Second, who would bear the risk?\nThe mechanism is intended for liquidity, not solvency challenges. As\nstated, participating countries would be allowed to borrow for a year\n(or specified period). Those that do not pay back on time would get\nkicked out to the IMF. But that does not pin down who would be\nleft holding the bag. And finally, although addressed briefly, more\nattention needs to be paid to moral hazard. The idea of access to\nunconditional finance raises additional questions about implications\nfor runs on countries that participate.\nIn sum, this is a very interesting paper that is already quite widely\ncited. After documenting some of the dramatic changes in key fi-\nnancial market metrics, it convincingly forecasts that, in the coming\ndecade, advanced economies will remain vulnerable to external crises\nwhile emerging economies will be more exposed to domestic fragil-\nity. This is indeed a striking reversal, and the author offers a valuable\ndiscussion of possible implications—some of which reflect ways in\nwhich the roles are only partially reversed. While his creative global\nliquidity proposal seems unlikely to tame the bully of the financial\nmarkets and help us to get “back to the future,” putting proposals\nlike this on the table do provide a valuable step in that direction.\n\n398 Susan M.

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nFebruary 28, 2024\nTuck School of Business at Dartmouth\nHanover, New Hampshire\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nKey Takeaways\n1. The U.S. economy overall performed remarkably well in 2023: inflation slowed notably, while\njob growth and output growth remained quite strong. Importantly, the pandemic recovery has\nbeen unusually equitable, with employment gains having been broadly shared across racial and\nethnic groups.\n2. Recent economic data releases highlight that progress toward achieving the Fed’s mandated\ngoals — price stability and maximum employment – could continue to be bumpy. And with the\nvolatility of monthly inflation remaining elevated, it is important not to overreact to individual data\nreadings. More time is needed to discern whether the economy is sustainably on a path to price\nstability, amid a healthy labor market.\n3. Collins notes she will need to see more evidence that the disinflationary process will continue\nbefore starting to carefully normalize policy – however expecting all of the data to speak uniformly\nis too high a bar. Some of the factors Collins plans to consider in assessing progress toward the\nFed’s dual mandate goals include inflation expectations remaining well anchored, as well as an\norderly moderation in labor demand. She also wants to see continued evidence that wage growth\nis not adding inflationary pressures, consistent with the recent work by Boston Fed economists.\n4. Collins also wants to see continued declines in housing inflation and non-shelter services\ninflation — the two subcomponents of inflation that have been stickier and are taking longer to\nreturn to pre-pandemic levels. The focus on inflation components is not about adding additional\nobjectives – the Fed’s target is 2 percent year-over-year growth of total PCE prices – but rather\nabout gaining greater confidence in the overall inflation outlook.\n5. Still, in Collins’ view, the threat of inflation settling persistently above the Committee’s 2 percent\ntarget has receded, and risks to the economy overall are moving into better balance. However, a\ndurable return to 2 percent inflation will likely require demand growing at a more moderate pace\nthis year. Collins sees the current stance of monetary policy as consistent with achieving this\noutcome. And while not on a preset path, she believes it will likely become appropriate to begin\neasing policy later this year.\n6. Collins also notes that overall, the strength of an economy has many dimensions. In this\nregard, the Federal Reserve is involved in a breadth of activities to support a vibrant economy\nthat works for all: monetary policymaking, economic research, bank supervision, infrastructure\nand services for the financial system, and supporting collaborations that expand prospects for\nprogress in low- and middle-income communities.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIt is truly a pleasure to be with you today. I appreciate the warm welcome, and\nparticularly want to thank Dean Matthew Slaughter and Emily Weis of the Tuck School;\nthe Center for Business, Government & Society; and Dartmouth College.\nAs always, I should mention that my comments today are my own views, not\nnecessarily those of colleagues on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors or the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed’s interest rate setting committee.\nAt the time of the Tuck School’s founding – as the world's first graduate school of\nmanagement – Dartmouth’s president “recognized the need for ‘training commensurate\nwith the larger meaning of business’.”1 I mention this because it overlaps with the spirit\nof my journey in New Hampshire today. Our focus at the Boston Fed, which covers\nmost of New England, is on supporting a vibrant economy that provides opportunities\nfor everyone to participate, contribute, and prosper.\nAs I prepare for deliberations on interest rates and monetary policy at the FOMC,\nI consume a lot of statistical data and analysis. I also listen to people in the economy –\nemployers, employees, entrepreneurs, those struggling to participate in the labor force\nfor one reason or another, and those helping to support and advance community\neconomic development. Hearing how people are experiencing the economy is vital to\npolicymaking, and incredibly meaningful to me and my team.\nAs a case in point, today I visited Hypertherm Associates to learn about that\ncompany’s industrial cutting and shaping business and its workforce. Then I met with\nthe Vital Communities Corporate Council – a group of business leaders that work to\nimprove lives for area residents.2 After this talk, I’ll meet with economic and community\ndevelopment practitioners for their perspective on challenges and opportunities in the\n1 https://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/about/facts-and-figures/history\n2 https://vitalcommunities.org/corporate-\ncouncil/?doing_wp_cron=1708393268.5731968879699707031250\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nregional economy. And I’ll end the day hosting a business leader roundtable\ndiscussion, in Concord.\nThe Federal Reserve\nI like to say our work at the Fed is all about supporting a vibrant, inclusive\neconomy that works for everyone, not just for some people. Of course, an economy’s\nstrength and stability has many dimensions – so the Fed has a number of roles.\nWe are entrusted with monetary policymaking – in particular, setting short-term\ninterest rates that ultimately affect the availability of money and credit for businesses\nand households. In this, we are guided by our dual mandate from Congress: stable\nprices and maximum employment. We carefully analyze economic conditions – using\ndata, doing research, and listening to stakeholders.\nWe’re also supervisors of some of the nation’s financial institutions, and provide\nvital back-end infrastructure and services to the financial system and the U.S. Treasury,\nranging from currency and coin circulation to various ways to transfer funds\nelectronically. For many years, we have been involved in innovating to make payments\nsystems more efficient.3 Last July, the Fed launched a new instant-payments\ninfrastructure, called FedNow®. When fully available, instant payments will provide\nsubstantial benefits for consumers and businesses, such as rapid access to funds when\nuseful, and just-in-time payments helping to manage cash flows.4\n3 It wasn’t that long ago that paper checks had to be flown around the country to settle at the bank they\nwere drawn on – a slow, costly necessity. The Boston Fed and others helped pioneer digital check\nimaging and expanded automated clearing.\n4 For example, individuals can instantly receive their paychecks and use them the same day, and small\nbusinesses can more efficiently manage cash flows without processing delays. Over the coming years,\ncustomers of banks and credit unions that sign up for the service should be able to use their financial\ninstitution’s interfaces to send instant payments quickly and securely. Learn more about the FedNow®\nService at https://explore.fednow.org/about\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nIn addition, we examine factors that limit people’s participation in the economy,\nand support collaborations that expand their opportunities.5 In that spirit, during my last\nvisit to New Hampshire, I explored the economic effects of limited child-care options –\nwith providers, consumers, and advocates – in Manchester.6\nThe National Economy and Monetary Policy\nI’ll focus the rest of my remarks on the economy, monetary policy, and my\noutlook. As a Federal Reserve policymaker, I am resolutely committed to bringing\ninflation sustainably back to our 2 percent target in a reasonable amount of time. And I\nremain optimistic – realistically optimistic, I like to say – that this can be accomplished\namid a healthy labor market.7\nRecent Economic Performance\nIn elaborating on my views, I’ll refer to some charts to illustrate key points.\nFigure 1 sets the stage, showing the history of inflation and unemployment –\nencapsulating the facets of the Fed’s dual mandate. Shaded bars indicate recessions.\nThe panel on the left depicts 12-month PCE inflation.8 The blue line is total (or\n“headline”) inflation, while the red line – core inflation – excludes the volatile, though\n5 One can learn more about the Bank’s work to support growth in smaller cities and rural areas at\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/community-development/supporting-growth-in-smaller-industrial-cities.aspx.\nOur mandate and our concern for a vibrant, inclusive economy bring our focus to the challenges that\nprevent people from participating in the economy or the workforce – issues like childcare, housing,\ntransportation, and broadband. Studying factors that limit people from participating, and disparities for\ngroups and places, can help expand opportunities, bring more people into the workforce, and strengthen\noverall economic growth and competitiveness.\n6 See https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/news/2023/05/boston-fed-president-heads-to-new-\nhampshire-to-talk-child-care-business-economic-barriers.aspx\n7 This would achieve both goals of our Congressional mandate, price stability and maximum employment.\n8 The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-\nexpenditures-price-index)\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nobviously vital, categories of food and energy. The chart clearly shows the recent surge\nin inflation, after many years of price stability. It is important to remember the\nchallenges that high inflation poses for households, firms, and our economy.\nWhile total inflation has come down significantly from its recent peak, it remains\nelevated, and progress returning it sustainably to our 2 percent target will likely continue\nto be bumpy. Indeed, core inflation, which historically provides a good indication of\nfuture inflation trends, has further to go to return to our target.\nThe unemployment rate, shown on the right, rises during recessions, then\ntypically recovers gradually. The pandemic-induced unemployment spike was\nparticularly severe, but the recovery was remarkably quick — not spread over many\nyears. And unemployment has remained below 4 percent since February 2022.\nWith the goal of restoring price stability in a reasonable amount of time, the\nFOMC began raising the federal funds rate in March 2022. Figure 2 shows that the rise\nwas unusually rapid – an increase of 525 basis points over just 16 months. Roughly 80\npercent of the increase came in the first nine months – moving the Fed’s monetary\npolicy stance from highly accommodative to restrictive. The FOMC has maintained the\nfunds rate at its current level of 5¼ to 5½ percent since July 2023, and the Committee is\ncarefully assessing when it will be appropriate to begin reducing the target range.\nDespite tighter policy, economic activity has been remarkably resilient. Real\nGDP growth (the blue line in Figure 3) rebounded quickly and has recently been close\nto its pre-pandemic rate, when interest rates were much lower. GDP growth in 2023, at\n3.1 percent,9 was considerably stronger than most forecasters expected at the end of\n2022.\nThe red line shows household consumption, which accounts for about two-thirds\nof GDP. This has been a crucial driver of economic growth in the aftermath of the\npandemic and has continued to expand at a robust pace recently. And I’ll note that\n9 This GDP figure is current at the time these remarks were finalized, but updated data for 2023:Q4 is\nscheduled for release at 8:30 AM on February 28, and could entail a revision.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nbusiness investment growth – another key component of private domestic demand –\nhas also held up well, despite the higher cost of credit.\nIn the labor market, continued strong economic activity has translated into an\nunemployment rate near historic lows, and robust recent wage growth. Importantly,\nthese positive labor market developments have been associated with an unusually\nequitable recovery.10\nThe panels in Figure 4 compare the evolution of employment (relative to\npopulation) during this labor market recovery (the blue lines) with the average for the\npast three recessions (the red lines) for different racial or ethnic groups. The panels\nshow that job loss in the pandemic recession was sudden and sharp, but followed by a\nrapid recovery. And this time around, the employment recovery did not take longer for\nminority groups. Wage growth is not shown, but I’ll note that it has been relatively\nfavorable for lower-paying occupations, benefiting less advantaged groups. While these\ndevelopments cannot be taken for granted, they represent tangible progress toward\nachieving a more broad-based and inclusive notion of full employment.\nOne of the reasons for the inflation surge was demand outpacing supply, putting\nupward pressure on prices and wages. So, the slowdown in inflation in the second half\nof 2023, in this context of strong growth, was remarkable. Indeed, core PCE inflation\nfell to around 2 percent over the last six months of 2023. Substantial disinflation amid\nsustained real activity points to improvements in supply having played an important role.\n10 The fact that these positive economic developments have continued to be unusually equitable is a point\nhighlighted by Cecilia Rouse, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and now president of the\nBrookings Institution, at the Boston Fed’s economic conference last fall. Dr. Rouse’s presentation can be\nfound at https://youtu.be/inRU_TPE3z4. All the conference materials and videos can be found at\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/events/economic-research-conference-series/rethinking-full-\nemployment.aspx. The conference provided analysis of factors that likely prevent some people from\nparticipating fully in the labor market, even when the overall economy is thriving. Conference presenters\nexplored past and current thinking on measuring full employment, paying particular attention to the role of\nlong-term labor market trends as well as to more recent changes in labor market structure. Participants\nalso discussed recent research on how monetary policy can be conducted to achieve full employment\nand price stability at the same time.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThese developments can be traced largely to three factors: the resolution of\nsupply chain bottlenecks, a rebound in prime age labor force participation11 (driven in\npart by immigration), and notable labor productivity gains in some sectors. Narrowing\nthe gap between demand and supply has put downward pressure on inflation.\nSo far, tight monetary policy has had a limited overall impact on economic\nactivity. This is likely due to factors specific to this recovery, which have strengthened\nhouseholds’ and businesses’ balance sheets and made demand less interest sensitive.\nIn particular, consumers have been able to finance expenditures by drawing on a buffer\nof savings built early in the pandemic. And many businesses were able to refinance\nand extend their debt maturity when interest rates were very low.\nThe Outlook\nGiven the evolution of economic conditions so far, what can we expect going\nforward, and what are the implications for conducting monetary policy in such an\nenvironment? A key but open question is how much longer supply-side progress might\nreduce inflationary pressures amid strong economic activity. Figure 5 shows that the\nprime age labor force participation rate is above its pre-pandemic level — suggesting\nthat the potential for more workers to “come off the sidelines” may be limited. However,\nthe Congressional Budget Office recently increased its forecast for population growth,\npartially based on higher – though highly uncertain – projections for net immigration.\nAnd productivity is always difficult to forecast. Many businesses, especially in\nservices, have learned to operate with fewer workers – but this trend likely cannot\ncontinue indefinitely. And while it is possible we will see further reductions in price\npressures from earlier supply improvements, firms’ willingness to pass on additional\ncost savings will likely require a slower pace of demand going forward. I believe the\n11 Defined as 25-54 years of age.\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ncurrent policy stance should deliver the more sustainable rate of growth, while\npreserving a healthy labor market.\nIn fact, I do see some signs consistent with an expected demand moderation.\nDelinquencies on credit card and auto loans have been rising and are at, or above, pre-\npandemic levels. Some consumers are financing expenditures with revolving debt.\nExcluding aircraft, capital goods orders are slowing, suggesting that firms are becoming\nmore interest sensitive. And despite recent hiring strength, there are indications the\nlabor market is normalizing at healthy levels.12\nBut there is considerable uncertainty about when, and by how much, activity is\nlikely to slow. The January FOMC statement acknowledges this uncertainty and says,\n“the Committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target of the\nfederal funds rate until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving\nsustainably toward 2 percent.”13\nSome of the recent data illustrate the need for greater clarity that inflation is\nsustainably on a path back to the 2 percent target before adjusting the policy stance.\nThe January jobs report showed much more hiring than expected, with job gains for\nDecember also revised up. And the data we have for price growth in January was also\non the high side.\nSo, more time is needed to have greater confidence about the outlook. My\nemphasis here is on “greater,” because I do expect the economy will eventually slow as\nwe see the full effects of past monetary policy actions take hold. But I also expect the\npath will continue to be bumpy, and we should not overreact to individual data readings.\nFurthermore, I see the risks around the outlook as having come into better\nbalance. It is essential not to ease policy too soon, to ensure price stability is restored.\nAt the same time, waiting too long would run the risk of an excessive slowdown.\n12 In particular, job turnover rates have declined noticeably since the first half of 2023.\n13 https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20240131a1.pdf\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nPolicy Implications\nWhat would I need to see in the data to determine when it will be appropriate to\nease policy? Expecting all data to speak uniformly is too high a bar. Still, it will be\nimportant to see sustained, broadening signs of progress toward the Fed’s dual\nmandate goals – while recognizing that progress may be uneven.\nThe higher-than-expected January CPI inflation numbers I just mentioned are an\nexample of this unevenness. Indeed, Figure 6 shows one measure of volatility in\nmonthly core inflation.14 While moderating, it remains elevated – highlighting the\nimportance of not reading too much into one data point.\nAnd in terms of inflation, I will continue to pay close attention to its main\nsubcomponents. The three panels of Figure 7 decompose core PCE inflation into core\ngoods, housing, and core services excluding housing. In each panel, the blue line is the\n12-month measure, and the red line shows 3-month annualized averages.15\nWhile goods inflation has returned to and moved below its pre-pandemic levels,\nthe other two subcomponents are more “sticky” and are taking longer. So, I will want to\nsee continued declines in housing inflation, as well as non-shelter services inflation.\nTo be clear, the Fed’s target is 2 percent year-over-year growth for total PCE\nprices – there are no individual objectives for the components. However, if the effects\nof supply chain improvements that have helped lower core goods inflation below historic\nlevels wane, inflation in other components will need to decline for our goal to be met.\nIt is also important that short- and long-term inflation expectations remain well\nanchored and that wages evolve in a way that is ultimately consistent with price stability.\nAnd given the importance of labor market developments for wages and the overall\noutlook, I will continue to look for signs of an orderly moderation in labor demand.\n14 Volatility is measured by the two-year trailing standard deviation of monthly inflation.\n15 In addition, the recent CPI release for January showed continued elevation in shelter and non-shelter\nservices inflation.\n8\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 12:15 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, February 28, 2024 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nI’ll end by saying a bit more about wages, which have been rising faster than\ninflation. Recent work by Boston Fed economists, available on our website,16 alleviates\nconcerns that wage increases are fueling inflation. The blue line in Figure 8 highlights\nthat prior to the pandemic, wages (as measured by the Employment Cost Index or ECI)\nwere growing consistently faster than inflation (the red line) to reflect labor productivity\ngains. Following the pandemic downturn, wage growth initially lagged price growth –\ndespite the fact that productivity continued to improve during this period. Therefore,\nthere is room for wages to continue increasing faster than the Fed’s 2 percent inflation\ntarget plus trend productivity growth, without necessarily being inflationary, but to make\nup for previous productivity gains and price increases.\nIn sum, I remain what I call a “realistic optimist” in thinking that the economy is on\na path to 2 percent inflation on a sustained basis, while maintaining a healthy labor\nmarket. The economy is in a good place overall, and policy is well positioned as\npolicymakers carefully assess the evolving data and outlook.\nI want to see more evidence of a sustained trajectory to price stability. Still,\nconsistent with projections from FOMC participants,17 I believe it will likely become\nappropriate to begin easing policy later this year. When this happens, a methodical,\nforward-looking approach to reducing rates gradually should provide the necessary\nflexibility to manage risks, while promoting stable prices and maximum employment.\nConcluding Observations\nIn closing, thank you for having me here today.

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nPublic remarks hosted by\nThe Brookings Institution\nNovember 4, 2022\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nKey Takeaways\n1. With inflation much too high, and job-availability robust, the priority is to\nbring inflation back to the 2 percent target, consistent with the Fed’s dual\nmandate from Congress. It is clear there is more work to do, to get there. I\nexpect this will require additional increases in the federal funds rate,\nfollowed by a period of holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level for\nsome time.\n2. Both unemployment and inflation are very costly for individuals and our\neconomy. The costs for both are also disproportionately borne by those\nwho are most vulnerable in our society, like those with lower incomes.\nReturning to low, stable inflation will set the foundation for maximum\nemployment that is sustainable; and for a vibrant, resilient, inclusive\neconomy that works for all.\n3. Lowering inflation requires slowing economic activity, and bringing\ndemand and supply in the labor markets into better balance to relieve\ninflationary pressures. While there are risks and uncertainties, I remain\noptimistic about the possibility of achieving this without a significant\neconomic slowdown.\n4. The aggressive pace of interest rate increases to date has been\nappropriate, given rates had been near zero before March. Now that rates\nare in restrictive territory, the next phase of tightening should shift from a\nfocus on pace to a focus on levels – determining the level needed to be\nsufficiently restrictive. I expect it will be appropriate to continue raising\nrates, with the size of future increases determined by a holistic assessment\nof incoming information.\n5. As policy becomes more restrictive, the risks of overtightening rise.\nIncreasingly, these risks must be thoughtfully weighed against the risks of\nmoving too slowly and allowing higher inflation expectations to become\nentrenched.\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nGood morning, and thank you for having me speak with you today. It is truly a pleasure\nto be hosted by the Brookings Institution for this talk. My association with the Brookings\nEconomic Studies area extends back some 30 years. I have many fond memories of my time\nas a senior fellow. The nonpartisanship, rigor, open-minded inquiry, and emphasis on impact at\nBrookings are values we share at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\nI also want to mention my appreciation for David Wessel, and his decades of work\nhelping people better understand the economy and policymaking, most recently as director of\nthe Hutchins Center. As a lifelong educator, I see this work as so important.\nI joined the Boston Fed as president just a few months ago. In this role, I have the\nprivilege and responsibility of serving on the Federal Open Market Committee (or FOMC), which\nsets national monetary policy – this year as a voting member.\nThe committee met this week. At this time of intense focus on the FOMC, I want to\nshare my perspectives on macroeconomic conditions and discuss some key dimensions of\nmonetary policymaking in the current context.\nBefore beginning, I would like to note that these views are my own, and I am not\nspeaking for colleagues at the other Reserve Banks or the Board in Washington.\nOverview\nI will start by providing some historical context for current monetary policy. Then I’ll turn\nto inflation and explore how we got to today’s environment – which is important for thinking\nabout mapping out future policy discussions. I’ll then discuss the recent path of monetary policy\nand explore some of the challenges to determining appropriate policy going forward – and\ninclude some of my own perspectives on monetary policymaking.\nAfter my remarks, I look forward to answering some questions.\nKey Context\nI’d like to start with some context.\nNot long ago, the challenge facing policymakers was persistently low inflation, and how\nto increase it to the FOMC’s target. Clearly, this is no longer the issue. Inflation has surged,\nand remains much too high, with serious repercussions for households, businesses, and the\neconomy.\nCongress has charged the U.S. central bank with a dual mandate – price stability and\nmaximum employment. We define price stability as two percent inflation – a low level, where\nconsumers and businesses do not have to focus on protecting themselves from eroding\npurchasing power. The other facet of our mandate, maximum employment, is less specifically\ndefined. It refers to the broad, inclusive goal of job opportunities for all.\nHistory has shown that low and predictable inflation is an important precondition for\nsustaining maximum employment over time. In other words, the two dimensions of the Fed’s\nmandate are intertwined; they work together in the long run. Price stability is foundational to\nachieving the Fed’s overarching mission, which is a vibrant, resilient, and inclusive economy.\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nAt the moment, with inflation well above the Fed’s 2 percent target, the Fed’s central\ntask must be to restore price stability. The FOMC has moved aggressively towards\naccomplishing this important goal, but the job is clearly not yet done. I expect more tightening\nwill be needed.\nThe higher interest rate environment necessary to restore price stability has challenging\nimplications for real people. I take this, as well as the costs associated with too high inflation,\nvery seriously. Indeed, policymakers must balance the risk that inflation remains elevated and\nbecomes entrenched in expectations, against the risk that policy actions excessively slow down\neconomic activity.\nThe economic environment is, admittedly, highly uncertain but today I will discuss why I\nam still optimistic about the possibility of restoring price stability while maintaining a relatively\nrobust labor market.\nMore generally, I will also discuss my perspectives about monetary policy going forward.\nWe are moving from the initial policy phase focused on moving rates into restrictive territory very\nquickly, to a second policy phase with a focus on determining how high rates need to go to\nreturn inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent target over a reasonable horizon. This requires a\ncareful, holistic assessment of available information and deliberate actions. I will say more\nabout this in my remarks as well.\nInflation\nI want to briefly review how inflation got to where it is, since that is important for\nassessing how best to go forward.\nThe initial rise in inflation, across many countries, resulted mostly from supply\ndisruptions rooted in repeated waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. They caused commodity\nprices to jump, and the cost of transportation to rise, particularly for imported goods. Then,\nRussia’s war in Ukraine disrupted production and trade for several key commodities, such as\nenergy and wheat.\nOver time it became apparent that problems with supply were not going to fade as\nquickly as expected, while demand was noticeably exceeding the economy’s productive\ncapacity. To restore price stability, monetary policy needed to respond to realign demand with\nsupply.\nAs the acute phases of the pandemic eased, the strength in U.S. consumer demand led\nto a very hot job market, characterized by widespread job vacancies, rising quits rates, and what\nI’ll call “hesitant” labor supply. All these factors had employers competing fiercely for workers.\nThis led to wage increases inconsistent with a sustainable rate of overall inflation.\nA number of factors have played, and are playing, a role in the shortage of workers –\nincluding a population that is aging, early retirements, lower immigration, and some potential\nworkers remaining on the sidelines with pandemic-related concerns. So far, high wages and job\navailability have yet to prompt a more robust return to the labor force.\nClearly, the evolution of the labor market and jobs during and after the pandemic is a\nvital topic and, parenthetically, I want to mention that it is the focus of this year’s Boston Fed\nannual economic conference, which will take place in two weeks.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nReturning to inflation, there is unfortunately little the central bank can do to address\nsupply constraints – whether related to COVID-19, Russia’s war in Ukraine, or workers’\ndecisions about labor-force participation. But monetary policy can influence demand, and our\njob right now is to slow demand, to bring it back into alignment with our economy’s productive\ncapacity and relieve pressures on inflation.\nIrrespective of source, current levels of inflation are simply too high, and are taking a\nsignificant toll on households and firms. If not addressed, inflation will be increasingly damaging\nto the economy and its participants. I’d like to spend a bit of time discussing some of these\ncosts, and why bringing inflation down is so important.\nOf course, the Fed conducts extensive analysis of economic data. We augment this\nanalysis by working to understand the experiences and economic realities of people and\norganizations in the economy. For example, an increase in inflation can reduce consumers’\nspending power – and that problem is more acute for lower-income individuals. I’ve heard\nabout the increasing difficulties that many lower-income households are having making ends\nmeet as costs for food, housing, and transportation rise. The rise in fuel and auto prices has\nalso made it difficult for some low wage workers to accept jobs that require a car to get to work.\nIn addition, many operators of small businesses have told me about the challenges they\nare experiencing with inflation’s effects on their raw inputs and supplies. I’ve also heard about\nfirms putting their expansion plans on hold because of the uncertainty created by inflation.\nImportantly, high inflation also risks upsetting the stability in inflation expectations seen\nover the past 25 years. Without well-anchored inflation expectations (that is, expectations\nconsistent with the Fed’s 2 percent target), the cost of bringing inflation down, which involves\nslowing economic growth and thus lost output, would be much higher.\nUnfortunately, recent data on price inflation show PCE inflation only slowly drifting down\nfrom its year-over-year peak of 7 percent, reached in June. This has been disappointing, and\nthere clearly is more work to do to bring inflation down, as I’ll discuss shortly.\nBut I’ll note that other, related price indicators are providing more encouraging signs. In\nparticular, some global supply chain problems that have contributed to inflation since early 2021\nare beginning to fade. Transportation costs and commodity prices have significantly retrenched\nfrom their peaks, and broader measures of prices paid by manufacturers have noticeably\ndeclined in recent months. In addition, recent wage data, specifically the private sector\nEmployment Cost Index, grew more slowly than anticipated in the third quarter of 2022.\nSo there are some hopeful signs, although not yet clear evidence, that inflation may be\nbeginning to moderate. It is also reassuring that long-run inflation expectations, measured in a\nvariety of ways, remain well anchored overall.\nMonetary Policy Actions to Date\nMonetary policymakers reacted to this significant rise in inflation by raising interest rates\nrapidly. I would like to briefly discuss the recent path of monetary policy. In doing so, I will\nexamine some factors that add challenges to determining appropriate policy going forward.\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, and concerns over additional waves of\nCOVID-19, the federal funds rate remained near zero from the beginning of the pandemic until\nthis spring.\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nSince March, the FOMC has embarked on an appropriately aggressive path of interest\nrate increases, moving the federal funds rate from near zero to nearly 4 percent, including this\nweek’s action. The strong pace of these increases in a short period of time has brought\nmonetary policy from a very accommodative stance in March to restrictive territory now, with the\ngoal of slowing demand.\nImportantly, however, the work to tame inflation is not yet finished. As Wednesday’s\nFOMC policy statement noted, \"the Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target\nrange will be appropriate” until the stance of policy is “sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to\n2 percent over time.”1\nVarious indicators do suggest that the policy tightening underway since March is having\nan effect. Raising the federal funds rate – which is a short-term rate – impacts the longer-term\ninterest rates that affect people and firms’ economic decisions. The runoff of assets from the\nFed’s balance sheet that was initiated earlier this year is also increasing interest rates at longer\nmaturities. In all, longer-term rates have proven to be more responsive than in some previous\neconomic cycles, and this amplifies the restrictiveness of the current level of the funds rate.\nThis has been especially notable with mortgage rates. They had risen 75 basis points at\nthe beginning of the year, then rose from roughly 4 percent in March to around 7 percent in\nOctober. This has had a strong impact on what was an extremely hot housing market.2\nDemand is also slowing for appliances and other durable goods that go along with home\npurchases.\nAgain, the path to price stability involves bringing what has been very strong demand\ninto better balance with supply. So I believe we need to see growth at a below trend pace in\ninterest-sensitive sectors of the economy and more broadly — growth that is hopefully still\npositive but down from the rapid pace we saw last year. Indeed, there are some early signs that\ngrowth in consumer spending is slowing to a pace closer to trend. Ultimately, this broader\nslowdown in demand will affect the labor market. Restoring a better balance between demand\nand supply in the labor market will play an important role in reducing unsustainable wage\ninflation, and with it, price inflation.\nIn this context, it is notable that wage inflation is now much higher than it was pre-\npandemic, despite a similar unemployment rate. A possible explanation is that demand for\nlabor is stronger, relative to labor supply, than it was pre-pandemic. Some evidence of this can\nbe gleaned from the fact that vacancies per unemployed worker are now considerably higher\nthan they were in 2019. Another sign is that workers have been quitting their jobs for other\nopportunities at higher rates than before the pandemic.\nWith a very low unemployment rate, and very high vacancy and quit rates, wages were\nbound to increase sharply. I hope it will be possible to see a decline in wage inflation with only\na relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate, as demand in the labor market cools\nand vacancies and quits decline.\nThe possibility of re-equilibrating the labor market with only a modest increase in the\nunemployment rate is one important reason for optimism about reducing inflation without a\nsignificant downturn.\nThere are also other reasons for optimism. Household balance sheets remain strong,\nand there do not appear to be significant imbalances in the nonfinancial business sector. So,\nhouseholds and businesses are fairly well positioned to support spending, and weather tighter\nfinancial conditions – which has not typically been the case in earlier cycles. In particular,\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nhouseholds accumulated more than two trillion dollars in excess savings over the course of\n2020 and 2021, and while they have started to spend out of this stock, the buffer is still large.\nMoreover, many firms may be reluctant to lay off workers they have had considerable difficulty\nhiring.\nAnd well-anchored medium- to longer-term inflation expectations, as I have noted, will\nreduce the extent of the slowdown in activity needed to reduce inflation.\nI recognize that this scenario might sound rosy, and acknowledge that there are a\nnumber of significant risks. The continued stresses and uncertainties of the pandemic period\nhave been extremely challenging, taking a toll on individuals, families, and communities.\nUnderstandably, this has also dented consumer sentiment, which implies a risk that\nexpectations of a downturn could become self-fulfilling, with a sudden curtailing of spending.\nAnd, unfortunately, we cannot rule out additional supply or demand shocks, whether\nfrom a resurgence of COVID-19 or from food and energy supply disruptions due to other factors.\nWe have also seen a sharp appreciation of the dollar, interest rate hikes around the globe, and\ngrowth slowdowns in many nations. These factors increase the risks of a more rapid decline in\nglobal and domestic demand.\nBut overall, while a realist and attuned to the significant risks, I am optimistic about the\npath for our economy, as we do the essential work to restore price stability – which is\nfoundational to an economy that works well for everyone.\nMonetary Policy Going Forward\nGiven all the imperatives and uncertainties I have mentioned, what is the way forward for\nmonetary policymaking?\nThe FOMC’s goal is to bring inflation back down to the Committee’s 2 percent target\nover time, and as Wednesday’s FOMC statement and communications stressed, this will likely\nentail raising rates to a sufficiently restrictive level and then holding there for some time.\nBack in March, rates were far from being restrictive – they were near zero. Since then,\nthe FOMC has tightened policy at a very fast pace to reach a level of the federal funds rate near\n4 percent. The swiftness of these actions was appropriate, and reflected the FOMC’s\ncommitment to price stability.\nWith rates now in restrictive territory, I believe it is time to shift focus from how rapidly to\nraise rates, or the pace, to how high – in other words, to determining what is sufficiently\nrestrictive. And down the road, when we get there, in my view we’ll need to shift again to focus\non how long to hold rates at that level.\nIn thinking about how to reach the level of the funds rate at which the Committee will\ndeem appropriate to hold policy, I believe it is important for us to consider the various options for\npolicy moves. This will include 75 basis points, as well as smaller increments. I note that a 50\nbasis-point move was considered a large move in the past.\nIn my view, smaller increments will often be appropriate as we work to determine how\nmuch tightening is needed to reach a level of the funds rate that is sufficiently restrictive. A\nfocus on the level (not the pace) is what “resolve” looks like in this second policy phase.\nImportantly, as policy tightens further, the risks of overtightening increase. As I’ve\ndiscussed, I do not believe a significant slowdown is required to accomplish our goal of restoring\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 4, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nprice stability. Therefore, it will increasingly be important to balance the risk of possibly slowing\ndemand in the economy too much, with the risk of allowing inflation to persist too long and\npossibly de-anchoring inflation expectations.\nMaking policy decisions going forward will not be easy – it never is at this stage in the\neconomic cycle. There is no one single indicator that will be sufficient by itself to guide policy.\nDecisions, even more than usual, will require a careful, holistic assessment of the range of\ninformation available. Our task is further complicated by some unusual challenges of extracting\nthe signal from what can be very noisy data. For example, demand indicators and the labor\nmarket may send somewhat different signals as the need by businesses to fill vacant positions\nmay persist even with some slowing of demand. The continued above-trend growth in payrolls\nin this morning’s October employment report is consistent with this view.\nIt is premature to signal how high rates should go. However, I will say that the median\npath in September’s Summary of Economic Projections can be taken as a starting point of my\ncurrent thinking, with the possibility of a higher path depending on incoming information.\nIn determining appropriate policy, I will assess how much financial conditions have\ntightened and look for evidence that our cumulative policy actions are slowing demand, cooling\nlabor markets, and having the desired effects on wages and prices. Indeed, as noted in this\nweek’s FOMC statement, the Committee “will take into account the cumulative tightening of\nmonetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and\neconomic and financial developments.”\nConcluding Observations\nTo conclude, let me reiterate my commitment to the Fed’s dual mandate – price stability\nand maximum employment – and specifically, my resolve to restore price stability. Policy has\nmoved expeditiously into restrictive territory, but there is more work to do. In this next phase for\npolicymaking, my focus is shifting from raising rates rapidly to determining the level that the\nfunds rate must reach to be sufficiently restrictive to achieve the desired outcomes. This\nrecognizes that the risks of inflation falling too slowly and of the economy weakening too quickly\nare becoming more balanced.\nReturning to price stability will set the foundation for sustainable maximum employment\n– and for achieving the mission of a vibrant, inclusive economy that works best for all in the long\nrun.\nThank you again for hosting me today, to discuss my perspectives on the economy and\nmonetary policy. David, I look forward to your questions.\n1 To view the full statement, see Nov. 4, 2022 Federal Reserve Board - Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement.\n2 Home buying has been slowing, house price increases have been decelerating (if not declining in some areas), and residential\ninvestment has been contracting quite sharply.\n8",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nOpening Remarks\nat the Bank’s 66th Economic Conference,\n“Labor Markets During and After the Pandemic”\nNovember 18, 2022\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nKey Takeaways\n1. The Fed’s focus on the U.S. labor market is grounded in its dual mandate\nto achieve price stability and maximum employment. Restoring price\nstability remains our current imperative as monetary policymakers, and it is\nclear there is more work to do. Understanding how the pandemic is\naffecting employment in the short and longer term, while challenging, is\nessential for that effort.\n2. There has been a significant amount of work on COVID-19 and the labor\nmarket among academic economists as well as researchers within the\nFederal Reserve System. This conference brings together leading experts\non the topic, enabling us to benefit from their perspectives and learn about\nremaining questions to be answered.\n3. Answering key questions about the pandemic’s effects on labor demand\nand labor supply is important for calibrating monetary policy and reducing\ninflation back to 2 percent. By raising rates, we are aiming to slow the\neconomy and bring labor demand into better balance with supply. I remain\noptimistic that there is a pathway to re-establishing labor market balance\nwith only a modest rise in the unemployment rate – while remaining realistic\nabout the risks of a larger downturn.\n4. Potentially long-lasting effects of the pandemic on the labor market, such\nas increased remote work and accelerated automation of service-sector\njobs, are likely to have differential effects across the workforce.\nUnderstanding these differences is important for achieving the Fed’s\nmission of a vibrant, inclusive economy in the wake of COVID-19.\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nGood morning. It is my great pleasure to welcome everyone to the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston. We are also pleased to be joined by those watching on the\npublic livestream.\nThis is the 66th economic conference organized by the Boston Fed. And while it\nis my first conference as the Bank’s president, it is wonderful to be reconnecting with\nmany friends and colleagues attending today to explore some very important issues.\nI’m delighted to now be part of the Boston Fed’s long conference series. These\nmeetings foster analysis and discussion – among a diverse set of researchers, central\nbankers, and other policymakers. They focus on complex issues where the work\npresented and discussed can inform, and make a difference – consistent with the Fed’s\ngoal to support a vibrant, resilient, and inclusive economy. Our conference this year is a\nprime example, and I want to commend our economic research team – led by our\nDirector of Research Geoff Tootell – for designing such a timely and impactful agenda.\nBefore beginning, I note as always that the views I share today are my own. I am\nnot speaking for colleagues at the other Reserve Banks or the Board in Washington.\nContext: Maximum Employment and Price Stability\nLet me start with some context. At the Fed, policy-relevant discussions are\nrooted in the dual mandate assigned to us by Congress – maximum employment and\nprice stability. We define price stability as 2 percent inflation. Maximum employment is\nless specifically defined; but I see it as a broad, inclusive goal of job opportunities for all.\nI’ve noted in past remarks that these two mandates are intertwined. Price stability\nis key for achieving sustained maximum employment – meaning, only when inflation is\nlow and stable can the economy in general, and the labor market in particular, work well\nfor all Americans. Labor market conditions also influence inflation dynamics, as we have\nseen recently with very tight labor markets contributing to high inflation.\nAt the Fed we approach our mandate with the utmost seriousness, and\nconferences like this help in achieving our goals – by providing insights, challenging\nassumptions, and exploring central questions about the economy. And coming out of\nthe acute phase of the pandemic, there are many relevant questions about the U.S.\nlabor market to explore. For instance:\n How has the pandemic affected job opportunities, and how is labor supply\nresponding to those changes?\n Which recent changes in the labor market reflect transient, cyclical conditions;\nand which reflect developments in long-run, structural forces that monetary\npolicy has little influence over?\nThese sets of questions are important for the key task the Fed faces today:\nlowering inflation back to 2 percent. By raising rates, we are aiming to slow the\n3\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\neconomy and bring labor demand into better balance with supply. The intent is not a\nsignificant downturn. But restoring price stability remains the current imperative and it is\nclear that there is more work to do. I expect this will require additional increases in the\nfederal funds rate, followed by a period of holding rates at a sufficiently restrictive level\nfor some time. The latest data have not reduced my sense of what sufficiently restrictive\nmay mean, nor my resolve. Still, despite being realistic about the risks, I look at current\nconditions1 and remain optimistic that there is a pathway to reestablishing price stability\nwith a labor market slowdown that entails only a modest rise in the unemployment rate.\nIn my remarks today, I will begin with the issue of structural versus cyclical labor\nmarket developments, then touch on aspects of the labor market that are especially\nsalient for the current conduct of monetary policy, and finally consider some longer-run\nissues related to full employment in an inclusive economy.\nStructural Trends Versus Cyclical Movements\nDistinguishing long-run trends from temporary cyclical movements in the\neconomy and labor market is challenging. And it is vital for calibrating monetary policy,\nso as to ensure we restore price stability in a reasonable timeframe without slowing real\nactivity more than necessary.\nChanges in the labor market are typically driven by a combination of structural\nand cyclical forces, and parsing their relative impact is complex. For example,\nmanufacturing employment is highly cyclical, but the two recessions in the decade from\n2000 to 2010 likely brought forward some of the longer-run declines in factory jobs that\nwould have happened anyway, from increased automation and globalization. In other\nwords, structural change can be concentrated in recessionary periods.2,3\nOf course, structural influences have not prevented the job market’s return to a\nhealthy state during ensuing economic recoveries. That was the case after the COVID-\n19 recession, as the unemployment rate quickly returned to low, pre-pandemic levels.\nEven so, there are potentially many long-lasting implications of the COVID-19\nrecession for the labor market. It is quite possible that COVID-19 brought significant\n1 For example, it appears many firms are still “catching up” to fill staffing vacancies even as demand\nslows. In addition, strong household balance sheets should help support consumer spending.\n2 See for example “Why does structural change accelerate in recessions? The credit reallocation channel”\nby Cooper Howes, in the Journal of Financial Economics, Volume 144, Issue 3, June 2022, pgs. 933-952.\n3 More generally, fears of increased structural unemployment have often followed recessions, going back\nat least to the early 1960s. In 2011 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) discussed whether a\nsignificant amount of the high unemployment that remained after the Great Recession was structural.\nSee, for example, a now-public memo on structural unemployment presented to the FOMC in 2011.\n4\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nchanges that bear directly, and over the long term, on the Fed’s goal of a thriving,\ninclusive economy.\nConsider that in addition to a significant decline in aggregate demand, the\nCOVID-19 recession also saw large changes in aggregate supply as firms shut down\nearly in the pandemic. Firms have re-opened, but pandemic-related adjustments like\nincreased remote work and the accelerated automation of service-sector jobs have the\npotential to affect aggregate supply in the longer run.\nAnd these trends will probably have differential impacts on workers with different\ncharacteristics. This is important because the Fed’s mandate is to support a healthy\neconomy characterized by price stability and maximum employment – for everyone. To\ndo so, policymakers must assess which of the labor market changes originating in, or\naltered by, the pandemic are likely to last. For example, there have long been troubling\ngaps in the rate of unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers relative to national\naverages. Beyond their human toll, these gaps reflect underutilization of our country’s\nlabor resources, and adversely affect productivity and prosperity. It is important to\nunderstand the factors behind these gaps in general, and how (and for how long) they\nare affected by labor market disruptions like Covid-19.\nParsing the Pandemic’s Effects\nOne way the COVID-19 recession’s aftermath has played out differently than that\nof past recessions involves the relationship between the unemployment rate and other\nlabor market variables. In contrast with recent recoveries, unemployment returned quite\nquickly to its prior rate after the COVID-19 recession and has remained between 3.5\nand 3.7 percent since March.\nHowever, other indicators are now quite different than they were pre-pandemic. A\nchallenge for current monetary policy is determining whether the changes in the\nrelationship between the unemployment rate and other labor market variables stem\nfrom temporary effects of the pandemic, or from longer-lasting labor market trends that\nthe pandemic might have influenced.\nIn particular, both price and wage inflation are now much higher than before the\npandemic, even though the unemployment rate is back to pre-pandemic levels.\nOne explanation for a higher inflation rate coinciding with the pre-pandemic\nunemployment rate has to do with the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation as\ncaptured by the Phillips Curve. More specifically, the Phillips Curve may be steeper at\nunemployment rates near 3.5 percent.4\n4 Demand pressures appear much more pronounced now than before the pandemic. With a much steeper\nPhillips Curve at low unemployment rates, these additional demand pressures would result in much\n5\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nA key question for monetary policy is whether relationships at this low\nunemployment rate are symmetric. If true, this would raise the likelihood of a similarly\nrapid decline in inflation associated with modest increases in unemployment, as tight\nmonetary policy eases demand pressures. But we cannot rule out other explanations\nthat would point to a less favorable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, such\nas an increase in inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting.\nThe pandemic has also highlighted challenges in measuring labor market slack.\nVacancies relative to the unemployment rate, as captured by the so-called Beveridge\nCurve, are now at historically high levels. One reason could be that firms are struggling\nto replace workers who move from job to job to obtain higher wages. Alternatively, the\nrecent increase in vacancies could signal a longer-lasting increase in frictional\nunemployment, and therefore in the natural rate of unemployment.5\nThese alternative explanations for the recent observed vacancy-to-\nunemployment relationship matter for monetary policy, and how we think about labor\nmarket slack. If the substantial increase in vacancies mostly reflects temporary factors,\nthen a slowdown in labor demand could work primarily through lower vacancies, rather\nthan higher unemployment. This scenario for the Beveridge Curve would be consistent\nwith a steeper Phillips Curve at low unemployment rates – the possibility I just\nmentioned.\nLonger-Run Issues Affecting the Labor Market\nThe increase in remote work is just one example of longer-term trends that the\npandemic may have accelerated, or in other cases slowed. These trends are relevant\nbecause they affect our understanding of the cyclical position of the economy, and also\nbecause they matter for what the Fed considers to be maximum sustainable\nemployment. Moreover, trends affected by COVID-19 could have disparate effects on\ndifferent groups in the labor force.\nI’ll briefly highlight three key trends that we will explore in more detail over the\nnext day and a half – remote work, education, and automation.\nFirst, remote work, while not an option for all jobs, could alter employment\nopportunities at the individual, sectoral, and regional levels. Given all the considerations\nfor employees and employers, these changes are unlikely to apply uniformly across\nworkers and firms. Nevertheless, at the individual level, the ability to work remotely\nhigher inflation, with little further reduction in the unemployment rate. In this view, the pandemic has\ntraced out a portion of the Phillips Curve that may have always existed but was not empirically relevant in\nrecent decades.\n5 For example, workers may not live in areas of increased labor demand due to a lack adequate housing\nin those places. Although housing markets may eventually adjust, restoring regional balance between\nlabor demand and supply may take a long time.\n6\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\ncould help people with family responsibilities or physical limitations participate in the\nlabor force to a greater degree. At the regional level, the ability to work in remote\nlocations could help spread the population more widely and limit the disproportionate\ngrowth of job opportunities in high cost, “superstar” cities.6\nHowever, remote work may not ameliorate troublesome geographic disparities.\nRather than repopulating cities that had lost manufacturing jobs, remote workers may\ninstead flock to places with relatively high consumption amenities, which may worsen\nthe housing shortages in those places. And given that higher-income, college-educated\nworkers were more often able to work from home during the pandemic, they may be\nmore likely than others to benefit from a long-run shift toward remote work.\nSecond, we need to parse the pandemic’s effects on education – a topic near\nand dear to me, and very important to the labor market. College enrollment was 6.8\npercent lower for students graduating from high school in 2020 than in the previous\nyear.7 This unprecedented decline could reduce the lifetime college attainment rate for\nthe affected cohort – and was more pronounced among students from disadvantaged\nhigh schools.\nThird, automation may well extend beyond assembly-line and clerical jobs, which\nhave been disproportionately automated during the last several decades, to encompass\nmore jobs in the service sector. The push for additional automation may be fueled in\npart by limited labor supply in the service sector following the pandemic. In general,\neconomists view favorably the application of new technologies to production since\nproductivity growth is the ultimate source of rising living standards. But economists also\nrecognize that there are often winners and losers from automation. Increased\nautomation of service-sector jobs could exacerbate wage inequality.\nConcluding Observations\nThe sessions at this conference will address critical labor-market issues –\nincluding the effect of COVID-19 on labor supply, the future of remote work, the effects\nof automation, retirement trends, immigration, short-time compensation, and new firm\nformation. The analysis and discussion will help illuminate COVID-19’s implications.\n6 A few months before the pandemic began, the Boston Fed hosted a conference on regional disparities.\nThe growth of remote education and work has the potential to ameliorate some problems the conference\nhighlighted.\n7 A March 2021 report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center (NSCRC) documents\nCOVID-19’s effect on college enrollment among students graduating from high school in 2020. The report\nnotes that the pandemic “disproportionately affected graduates of low-income, high-poverty, and high-\nminority high schools, with their enrollments dropping more steeply than their more advantaged\ncounterparts. For instance, enrollment declines are 2.3 times steeper for low-income high schools\ncompared to higher income schools.”\n7\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:40 A.M. U.S. Eastern Time, Friday, November 18, 2022 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nWhile fascinating in their own right, the conference sessions are highly relevant\nfor monetary policy given the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. At the Fed we are\ncommitted to returning inflation to the 2 percent target in a reasonable amount of time.\nOnly when inflation is low and stable can the economy in general — and the labor\nmarket in particular — work well for all Americans.\nClearly, policymaking benefits from careful, ongoing study of all the ways the\npandemic has changed the labor market. So it is a fitting time to gather, and deepen our\nunderstand of the labor market during and after the pandemic.\nThank you again for being here. Now we’ll move into the first session. This\nmornings’ sessions will be moderated by Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes from the University\nof California, Merced.\n8",

It is wonderful to be here. This is a bit of a homecoming for me – both because I have\nbeen a member of the Council for many years, and because I always enjoy being back in Manhattan,\nwhere I grew up.\nI will start, as I always do, by noting that my comments today are my own perspectives; I’m not\nspeaking for any of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors or other Reserve Banks.\nIn these opening remarks, I’ll refer to a few charts to help illustrate my view of economic\nconditions, baseline outlook, and assessment of appropriate policy, which are rooted in my analysis of\neconomic data. I think it is very important – always, but perhaps especially in times of change and\nscrutiny – to clearly explain how, as policymakers, we’re analyzing and interpreting the data.\nTurning to the Data\nEconomic growth remains resilient, but the labor market has softened. Inflation has been above\ntarget for more than four years, and while well down from earlier peaks, it has picked up recently.\nA softening labor market amid inflationary pressures presents a challenge for monetary policy. At\nthe September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), I supported the 25-basis point\npolicy rate reduction. In my view, a bit of easing was appropriate to address the recent shift in the balance\nof risks to our inflation and employment mandate. But I continue to see a modestly restrictive policy\nstance as appropriate, as monetary policymakers work to restore price stability while limiting the risks of\nfurther labor market weakening.\nMy first slide shows two key labor market indicators. First, job growth, in Figure 1A, has declined\nsignificantly in recent months. Hiring is way down from the exceptionally tight post-pandemic labor\nmarket, and notably below the pre-pandemic pace. This slowdown partly reflects reductions in labor\nsupply – in particular, related to immigration restrictions. But it also reflects reductions in labor demand –\nas evidenced, for example, by the decline in job openings per unemployed worker (not shown).\nHowever, as shown in Figure 1B, the concurrent reductions in labor demand and supply have\nresulted in only a modest rise in the unemployment rate to date. Low initial unemployment insurance\nclaims also indicate that firms, while not hiring much, are not laying off many workers. My baseline\noutlook doesn’t see the labor market softening much further – but there are risks. In particular, I see some\nincreased risk that labor demand may fall significantly short of supply, leading to a more meaningful and\nunwelcome increase in the unemployment rate.\nAnemic job gains amid solid economic growth are a somewhat puzzling combination. The current\nstate of heightened uncertainty may explain why many firms are reticent to hire, while also trying to get\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, September 30, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nmore output from existing workers.1 Indeed, as shown in Figure 2, labor productivity continues to expand\nmore rapidly than its pre-pandemic pace, as firms are finding ways to increase efficiencies.2 This was a\npriority coming out of the pandemic when it was difficult to find workers. A continued productivity-\nenhancing mindset, which is ubiquitous in my discussions with CEOs across New England, may now be\ntempering hiring despite solid economic growth.\nTurning to recent price developments, Figure 3 shows the behavior of the three main components\nof core PCE inflation. In each panel, the blue line shows price growth over 12 months, while the red line\nshows the timelier, though noisier, three-month measure. As a benchmark, the dashed lines show\naverage inflation rates prevailing over 2001–2007 – a period when core PCE inflation averaged 2 percent.\nCore goods inflation, in Panel A, has risen notably in recent months, a move largely attributable to tariffs.\nIn contrast, housing inflation – Panel B – continues its slow uneven decline. And inflation for core non-\nhousing services – Panel C – has returned to a range consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent target.3\nLooking Ahead\nAs I look ahead, my baseline outlook continues to be relatively benign. I anticipate hiring will pick\nup as firms adjust to the new tariff environment. And while inflation is likely to remain elevated into next\nyear, I expect it to resume its gradual return to target over the medium term. This outlook is similar to the\nmedian forecast in the September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). But in this highly uncertain\nenvironment, I do not rule out scenarios featuring higher and more persistent inflation, more adverse\nlabor market developments – or both. Still, with less scope for inflationary pressures from the labor\nmarket, the upside inflation risks I was concerned about a few months ago are more limited.\nIn this context, it may be appropriate to ease the policy rate a bit further this year – but the data\nwill have to show that.\nI’ll close with a final slide, showing examples of my engagements across New England. This is\nsomething else we consider essential to responsible policymaking – listening to people throughout the\n1 Another margin that firms are leveraging to lower their labor demand is the amount of work done by\nexisting employees. While the economy-wide average work week has been stable for over a year, it has\nincreased in several sectors where job gains have been modest at best, including information, financial\nactivities, and retail trade.\n2 Business outlays for high-tech equipment and software have been robust recently, consistent with\nelevated demand for AI-related products and associated infrastructure.\n3 While core non-housing services inflation is above its pre-pandemic range (2012-2019), this period also\ncoincides with inflation below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective. Thus, the dashed line in Figure 3C shows\nthe mean for the period 2001-2007, when 12-month core PCE inflation averaged 2 percent.\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 9:00 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nTuesday, September 30, 2025 – OR UPON DELIVERY\neconomy. I deeply value engaging with a wide range of people to hear how they are experiencing the\neconomy and anticipating its future. And using those findings to complement the data and analysis.\nSo there is much to discuss, and I look forward to my conversation with Seema and then to your\nquestions.\n3",

Collins\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston\nMay 31, 2023\nBoston, Massachusetts\nThe views expressed today are my own, not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nOpening Remarks\nGood morning. I am Susan Collins, president of the Boston Fed, and it’s my\npleasure to welcome you – whether here in person or online -- to the Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston for this half-day forum on several aspects of the post-pandemic\neconomy.\nThank you all for joining us today. Special thanks to Fed Governor Michelle\nBowman for coming to the Boston Fed for our FedListens event. Before I invite\nGovernor Bowman to give some opening remarks, I’ll just say a few things about our\nevent today.\nAs you may know, it is part of a series the Federal Reserve began a few years\nago, and the second we’ve hosted here in Boston.1 The FedListens series is an\nimportant opportunity for Fed policymakers, at both the regional banks and the Board of\nGovernors in Washington, to expand the ways we hear from participants in the\neconomy.\nThat’s why, today, we’ve brought together panelists and audience members who\nreflect the diversity of the New England region. For some of you, this may be your first\nopportunity to engage with the Boston Fed – we look forward to your participation.\nThere are a number of Fed leaders in the room today, including those\nresponsible for economic research and for community development, among other key\nareas. Our goal today, as leaders at the Federal Reserve, is that we really listen to you,\nto help us deepen our understanding of post-pandemic experiences, and of the\nchallenges and opportunities facing each of you, and our region.\nOur conversations today focus on three key topics - labor markets, housing, and\nstate and local fiscal health. We’ve distributed some background materials on each,\nand hope you’ve found them informative and helpful.\nAnd as you’ll hear more about shortly, we have ensured a variety of ways for you\nto share your views with us, whether you are on a panel, in the room or online.\nSo, I want to welcome you all again – and it’s now my pleasure to invite Governor\nMichelle Bowman to the podium.\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:50 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nGovernor Bowman has served as a member of the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System since 2018. Before joining the Board in Washington, she\nserved as the state bank commissioner of Kansas, and prior to that, as vice president of\nFarmers & Drovers Bank in Kansas. At the Federal Reserve, Gov. Bowman has been a\nleader and a proponent of these FedListens gatherings, and we’re thrilled to have her\nhere with us today.\n###\nClosing Remarks\nLet me close out our gathering by first offering my sincere thanks to our\nmoderators, panelists, attendees. We greatly appreciate today’s robust discussion, and\nyour valuable insights – in the panel sessions, around the tables, and from input shared\nby those online.\nThanks as well to Governor Bowman and the other members of the Board of\nGovernors for promoting events such as this one. It is so important for policymakers to\nhave windows like this, into regional experience and perspectives.\nI want to say just a few things about how I believe we can use the insights gained\ntoday to advance the work we are charged with doing here at the Fed. First, I will give\nmy standard disclaimer, which is that the views I share today are my own and not the\nviews of my colleagues on the Board or at other Reserve Banks.\nI like to say that the Fed’s overarching mission is to foster conditions that support\na vibrant, inclusive economy that works for all – not just for some people.\nThat is why it is essential for us to connect with and learn from people across the\nBoston Fed’s district, which encompasses most of New England, about their\nexperiences, challenges, and opportunities.\nThe Boston Fed prioritizes engaging with the community in a variety of ways,\nfrom collaborations, to serving as a nonpartisan resource, to convenings such as this\none. And since I started in this job nearly 11 months ago, being out and meeting with\nstakeholders across the region has been a key focus.\n1\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:50 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\nThe perspectives you’ve all shared today augment what I have heard from my\ntravels. Community leaders in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine, Vermont,\nMassachusetts, and just last week, New Hampshire, have raised many recurring\nthemes – in particular, the toll from high inflation, challenges related to worker\navailability and retention, and barriers to full participation in the region’s economy and\njob market, such as the availability and cost of housing, and childcare.\nYour input today helps to us to flesh out what we learn from the statistical data,\nand to connect quantitative analyses to the real-world experiences of people.\nThis is particularly relevant as we, at the Fed, focus on our dual mandate from\nCongress: price stability and maximum employment. We are intent on reducing inflation\nthat is simply too high and impacting everyone, with particular challenges for those with\nlower incomes. I’ll note that price stability is a foundation for maximum employment that\nis sustainable - a robust job market with opportunities for all.\nOur next monetary policy meeting is in mid-June. And as I shared in remarks\nlast week to an audience at the Community College of Rhode Island, I believe it is\nimportant to make each policy decision based on a wholistic assessment of all the\navailable information.2\nPolicymakers continue to monitor a wide range of data – about price\ndevelopments, labor markets, financial conditions and more. And we will continue to\nhave conversations such as these with business and community leaders, in order to\ncomplement the economic data and to help us more comprehensively assess how the\neconomy is doing.\nHere at the Boston Fed, the insights we’re gathering today will broadly help to\ninform the wide range of work we do to advance our commitment to promoting a strong\nand equitable economy.\nAgain, I want to thank you for your active participation. We have enjoyed this\nFedListens event and look forward to continuing these conversations with many of you\nover lunch, and to future opportunities to engage.\n###\n2\n\nRemarks as Prepared for Delivery\nEMBARGOED UNTIL 8:50 A.M U.S. Eastern Time,\nWednesday, May 31, 2023 – OR UPON DELIVERY\n1 For more about the FedListens series, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-\ntools-and-communications-fed-listens-events.htm\n2 See May 25, 2023 remarks by Susan M.
