    "text": "Thank you for having me here to speak today.  It is a real pleasure to\n  have this opportunity to speak at CEPS again—this is a great forum to\n  talk about policy issues.  Tonight I want to discuss some of the challenges\n  we face in making our financial system more robust.    We have\n  learned a great deal over the past two years about our financial system and\n  its vulnerabilities.  The task ahead is to put these lessons to good use.  Our\n  goal must be to make the financial system more resilient to shocks.  If\n  we can do that successfully, we should be able to reduce the risk of financial\n  crises.\n\nIn assessing the causes of this crisis, one clear culprit was the failure\n  of regulators and market participants alike to fully appreciate the strength\n  of the amplifying mechanisms that were built into our financial system.  These\n  mechanics exacerbated the boom on the way up and the bust on the way down.  Only\n  by better understanding the sources of these damaging dynamics can we construct\n  solutions that will strengthen our financial system and make it more robust.\n\nToday, I am going to focus mainly on the extraordinary liquidity events that\n  played out during this crisis.   I will tackle this topic in four\n  parts.  I will begin by describing how funding dried up rapidly for firms\n  such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG.   I then will propose\n  a conceptual framework that might prove helpful in better understanding what\n  went wrong on the liquidity front.  With this conceptual framework in\n  hand, I will then suggest some concrete steps we might take toward making the\n  financial system more resilient—cautioning that there are no magic bullets.  Finally,\n  I will talk about the major initiatives that are already underway to help reduce\n  the risk of future liquidity crises.\n\nAs always, my remarks reflect my own views and opinions and not necessarily\n  those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAt its most fundamental level, this crisis was caused by the rapid growth\n  of the so-called shadow banking system over the past few decades and its remarkable\n  collapse over the past two years.  Let me give you some figures to illustrate\n  the disparity between the growth of what I will call the  “traditional” commercial\n  banking system and the shadow banking system in recent years.   At\n  the end of 2006, the shadow banking system had grown so large that U.S. commercial\n  banks’ share of credit market assets had fallen to only 17.7 percent,\n  down from 27.3 percent in 1980.\n\nWith this shift in the composition of activity also came an important change\n  in the composition of funding, particularly in the middle part of this decade.\n  Commercial paper outstanding grew from $1.3 trillion at the end of 2003 to\n  a peak of about $2.3 trillion. Repo funding by dealers to nonbank financial\n  institutions—as measured by the reverse repos on primary dealer balance\n  sheets—grew from less than $1.3 trillion to a peak of nearly $2.8 trillion\n  over this period.  In contrast, commercial bank retail deposits rose by\n  less than 30% in the four year period from 2003 to 2007.\n\nThough the shadow banking system was often credited with better distributing\n  risk and improving the overall efficiency of the financial system, this system\n  ultimately proved to be much more fragile than we had anticipated.   Like\n  the traditional banking system, the shadow banking system engaged in the maturity\n  transformation process in which structured investment vehicles (SIVs), conduits,\n  dealers, and hedge funds financed long-term assets with short-term funding.  However,\n  much of the maturity transformation in the shadow system occurred without the\n  types of stabilizing backstops that are in place in the traditional banking\n  sector.\n\nA key vulnerability turned out to be the misplaced assumption that securities\n  dealers and others would be able to obtain very large amounts of short-term\n  funding even in times of stress.  Indeed, one particularly destabilizing\n  factor in this collapse was the speed with which liquidity buffers at the large\n  independent security dealers were exhausted.  To take just one illustrative\n  example, Bear Stearns saw a complete loss of its short-term secured funding\n  virtually overnight.  As a consequence, the firm’s liquidity pool\n  dropped by 83 percent in a two-day span. 1\n\nThese liquidity dynamics were driven by two main factors.    The\n  first factor was the underlying stress on dealer balance sheets as the prices\n  on complex collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), private label residential\n  mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), and commercial real estate-related assets\n  fell sharply and uncertainty about underlying asset values rose sharply.  The\n  uncertainty stemmed, in part, from the lack of transparency about what prices\n  these assets could be sold for, which, in turn stemmed from the difficulty\n  of valuing these extremely complex and heterogeneous securities.\n\nThe stress on underlying asset prices and the uncertainty about the valuations\n  of pools of illiquid assets caused investors to become concerned about the\n  solvency of some of the weaker dealers. 2 These\n  concerns contributed to liquidity pressures, which, in turn, led to forced\n  asset sales by dealers and others.  These sales both further depressed\n  asset prices and increased asset price volatility.\n\nThe second factor contributing to the liquidity crisis was the dependence\n  of dealers on short-term funding to finance illiquid assets.   This short-term\n  funding came mainly from two sources, the tri-party repo system and customer\n  balances in prime brokerage accounts.  By relying on these sources of\n  funding, dealers were much more vulnerable to runs than was generally appreciated.\n\nConsider first tri-party repo, a market in which money market funds, securities\n  lending operations, and other institutions finance assets mainly on an overnight\n  basis.  As asset prices fell and volatility climbed during this period,\n  the financial condition of some dealers became more troubled.  As a result,\n  some investors in this market became worried about the risk that they might\n  not get their cash returned in the morning, but instead might be stuck with\n  the collateral that secured their lending.  Investors responded by increasing\n  their haircuts—that is the margin of extra collateral used to secure\n  their funding—and reducing the range of collateral they would accept\n  as security for their lending.  Of course, these very rational reactions\n  on the part of investors only further weakened the liquidity positions of the\n  major securities firms.\n\nA similar dynamic occurred in the context of prime brokerage accounts.  Some\n  institutions treated the free cash balances associated with these accounts\n  as if they were a stable source of funding.  Implicitly, they assumed\n  that these balances would be “sticky” due to the strength of broader\n  business relationships and the cost incurred by customers in shifting the business\n  elsewhere.  However, once markets became strained, this assumption of\n  stable funding proved to be false.  Prime brokerage customers began to\n  withdraw their free credit balances and some moved their business elsewhere.   Both\n  of these steps reduced dealer liquidity buffers and further tightened the funding\n  noose.\n\nIn the case of the tri-party repo market, the stress on repo borrowers was\n  exacerbated by the design of the underlying market infrastructure.   In\n  this market, investors provide cash each afternoon to dealers in the form of\n  an overnight loan backed by securities collateral.\n\nEach morning, under normal circumstances, the two clearing banks that operate\n  tri-party repo systems permit dealers to return the cash to their investors\n  and to retake possession of their securities portfolios by overdrawing their\n  accounts at the clearing banks.   During the day, the clearing banks\n  finance the dealers’ securities inventories.\n\nUsually, this arrangement works well.  However, when a securities dealer\n  becomes troubled or is perceived to be troubled, the tri-party repo market\n  can become unstable.   In particular, if there is a material risk that\n  a dealer could default during the day, the clearing bank may not want to return\n  the cash to the tri-party investors in the morning because the bank does not\n  want to risk being stuck with a very large collateralized exposure that could\n  run into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  Overnight investors, in\n  turn, don’t want to be stuck with the collateral.  So to avoid such\n  an outcome, they may decide not to invest in the first place.  These self-protective\n  reactions on the part of the clearing banks and the investors can cause the\n  tri-party funding mechanism to rapidly unravel.   This dynamic explains\n  the speed with which Bear Stearns lost funding as tri-party repo investors\n  pulled away quickly.\n\nDespite the strains created by the collapse of Bear Stearns, the “rivets” of\n  the tri-party repo system held for several reasons.  First, Bear Sterns\n  did not fail; instead it was acquired by JPMorgan Chase with assistance from\n  the Federal Reserve.  Second, the Federal Reserve stepped in to support\n  the tri-party repo system by implementing the Primary Dealer Credit Facility\n  (PDCF).  The PDCF essentially placed the Fed in the role of the tri-party\n  repo investor of last resort thereby significantly reducing the risk to the\n  clearing banks that they might be stuck with the collateral.  As a consequence,\n  the PDCF reassured end investors that they could safely keep investing.  This,\n  in turn, significantly reduced the risk that a dealer would not be able to\n  obtain short-term funding through the tri-party repo system. 3\n\nOver much of this period preceding the failure of Lehman Brothers, U.S. commercial\n  banks were relatively insulated from the liquidity run dynamics that plagued\n  the securities dealers. 4 This\n  relative stability was due, in part, to the broad access these commercial banks\n  had to the Fed’s discount window through the traditional primary credit\n  facility and through the Term Auction Facility (TAF), which had been introduced\n  earlier in the crisis in response to liquidity strains in the interbank market.  The\n  fact that most commercial banks relied on insured deposits for significant\n  portions of their funding was also important.  Not only were these insured\n  deposits stable sources of funding because they were guaranteed by the Federal\n  Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), but also because they were unsecured;\n  these deposits freed up collateral that could be used by banks to secure borrowing\n  from the central bank and elsewhere.\n\nHowever, once Lehman Brothers failed, many commercial banks and other financial\n  institutions encountered significant funding difficulties.   News that\n  the Reserve Fund—a large money market mutual fund—had  “broken\n  the buck” due to its holdings of Lehman Brothers paper led panicked investors\n  to withdraw their funds from money market mutual funds.  This caused the\n  commercial paper market to virtually shut down.   This hurt bank holding\n  companies and other large financial firms that depended on the commercial paper\n  market for short-term funding.\n\nThe result was a widespread loss of confidence throughout the money market\n  and interbank funding market.  Investors became unwilling to lend even\n  to institutions that they perceived to be solvent because of worries that others\n  might not share the same opinion.   Rollover risk—the risk that\n  an investor’s funds might not be repaid in a timely way—became\n  extremely high.\n\nThe extreme market illiquidity did not abate until a number of extraordinary\n  actions were taken by the Federal Reserve and others.  For example, the\n  Federal Reserve introduced the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) to\n  reduce rollover risk in the commercial paper market, the Federal Reserve and\n  other central banks’ massively expanded the ability of banks to obtain\n  dollar funding through the TAF and associated foreign exchange swap programs;\n  the Treasury guaranteed money market mutual fund assets; and the FDIC increased\n  deposit insurance limits and set up the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program\n  (TLPG) to backstop bank and bank holding company debt issuance.\n\nHaving described “what”  happened on the liquidity front during\n  the crisis, I next want to examine, in a bit more detail, “why” it\n  happened. To do this, I will lay out a simple conceptual framework that I will\n  then use to assess what can be done to mitigate the risk of such runs occurring\n  in the future.   As a starting point, I will talk about how unsecured\n  lenders react in a crisis, and then I will consider the behavior of secured\n  lenders.\n\nUnsecured liquidity providers run for two basic reasons.   First, they\n  run because there is a risk that the company they are lending funds to is insolvent.  In\n  other words, there is a risk that the assets will be worth less than the liabilities,\n  creating the potential for loss to the creditor.   The second reason\n  that unsecured creditors run is the risk that they will not be repaid in a\n  timely way.   Even if the borrowing firm ultimately turns out to\n  be solvent, there may be a delay in a lender getting its funds back, and this\n  delay may prove to be unacceptably costly to the lender.\n\nThis second cause of liquidity runs—the risk of untimely repayment—is\n  significant because it means that expectations about the behavior of others,\n  or their “psychology”, can be important.  This is a classic\n  coordination problem. Even if a particular lender judges a firm to be solvent,\n  it might decide not to lend to that firm for fear that others might not share\n  the same assessment.  The less certain any one lender is about the willingness\n  of other lenders to provide liquidity to a firm, the greater the risk that\n  too few loans will be extended to prevent liquidation. In that case, even if\n  the lender turns out to be correct in its judgment of the firm’s solvency,\n  there still will be a cost in terms of delay in receiving repayment.\n\nA few pictures can help to illustrate these concepts.  Figure 1 illustrates\n  what a creditor’s assessment of the net worth of a financial firm might\n  look like in normal times.  Creditors have uncertainty about what that\n  value is, thus, the valuation is represented by a probability distribution.  The\n  higher the degree of uncertainty, the greater is the degree of dispersion in\n  the probability distribution.  As long as the probability distribution\n  is sufficiently far to the right—in other words—well within positive\n  territory so that there is virtually no risk that the firm is insolvent, lenders\n  will generally be willing to lend.\n\nSo what happens in a financial crisis?   First, the probability\n  distribution shifts to the left as the financial environment deteriorates and\n  the financial firm takes losses that deplete its capital.  Second, and\n  even more importantly, the dispersion of the probability distribution widens—lenders\n  become more uncertain about the value of the firm.  These two phenomena\n  are shown together in Figure 2.    A lack of transparency in the\n  underlying assets will exacerbate this increase in dispersion.  As the\n  degree of dispersion widens, a portion of the probability distribution falls\n  into negative territory.   This means that there is a real risk of\n  loss for unsecured creditors if the firm were forced to liquidate its assets.\n\nFinally, in a crisis, unsecured lenders become more uncertain about others’ assessment\n  of the probability distribution.   For example, if creditor A believes\n  the probability distribution looks like Figure 1, but at the same time is concerned\n  that creditor B views the probability distribution as looking like Figure 2,\n  creditor A may pull back.  If there is a risk creditor B and others will\n  not lend, the firm may not receive sufficient funding.  In other words,\n  even if creditor A believes the firm is solvent, it may not lend because it\n  does not want to risk a delay in repayment.\n\nSo what can creditors do to mitigate these risks?   First, they\n  can respond by charging a higher interest rate in compensation for the increase\n  in the risk of default.   However, there are a number of difficulties\n  that limit how well this works in practice.  Most significantly, by undermining\n  the firm’s profitability, the higher interest rates may increase the\n  risk of insolvency.  If higher rates push insolvency risk up sharply,\n  then higher rates may not be sufficient to make lending—even at higher\n  rates—an attractive proposition.\n\nIn addition, some investors such as money market mutual funds may have a very\n  low tolerance for risk.  Thus, they may not be interested in trading off\n  higher rates as compensation for a non-negligible increase in insolvency risk.  Finally,\n  paying higher rates may generate an adverse signal about the health of the\n  borrowing institution.  This may cause investors to become more worried\n  about the risk of default.\n\nSecond, creditors can secure their lending—taking collateral valued\n  at more than the amount they lend.  However, this is not foolproof because\n  secured funding can be just as vulnerable to a run dynamic as unsecured funding.  For\n  starters, the same types of uncertainties about the value of the firm may apply\n  to the liquidation value of the collateral.   This is especially\n  the case if the collateral is lower quality and markets are already illiquid.  Moreover,\n  if creditors are left with the collateral instead of being repaid, fear of\n  widespread collateral liquidation might further erode collateral values. If\n  investors respond by seeking more collateral to ensure they will be secured—that\n  is, that they will be made whole in a liquidation scenario—the firm may\n  run out of high-quality collateral that the firm can borrow against.   This\n  is a significant risk when a financial firm is highly leveraged and equity\n  is only a very small proportion of total assets. 5\n\nThe risks of liquidity crises are also exacerbated by some structural sources\n  of instability in the financial system.   Some of these sources are\n  endemic to the nature of the financial intermediation process and banking.  Others\n  are more specific to the idiosyncratic features of our particular system.  Both\n  types deserve attention because they tend to amplify the pressures that lead\n  to liquidity runs.\n\nTurning first to the more inherent sources of instability, there are at least\n  two that are worthy of mention.   The first instability stems from\n  the fact that most financial firms engage in maturity transformation—the\n  maturity of their assets is longer than the maturity of their liabilities.  The\n  need for maturity transformation arises from the fact that the preferred habitat\n  of borrowers tends toward longer-term maturities used to finance long-lived\n  assets such as a house or a manufacturing plant, compared with the preferred\n  habitat of investors, who generally have a preference to be able to access\n  their funds quickly.  Financial intermediaries act to span these preferences,\n  earning profits by engaging in maturity transformation—borrowing shorter-term\n  in order to finance longer-term lending.\n\nIf a firm engages in maturity transformation so that its assets mature more\n  slowly than its liabilities, it does not have the option of simply allowing\n  its assets to mature when funding dries up.  If the liabilities cannot\n  be rolled over, liquidity buffers will soon be weakened. Maturity transformation\n  means that if funding is not forthcoming, the firm will have to sell assets.\n  Although this is easy if the assets are high-quality and liquid, it is hard\n  if the assets are lower quality. In that case, the forced asset sales are likely\n  to lead to losses, which deplete capital and raise concerns about insolvency. 6\n\nThe second inherent source of instability stems from the fact that firms are\n  typically worth much more as going concerns than in liquidation.   This\n  loss of value in liquidation helps to explain why liquidity crises can happen\n  so suddenly.   Initially, no one is worried about liquidation.  The\n  firm is well understood to be solvent as shown in Figure 1.  But once\n  counterparties start to worry about liquidation, the probability distribution\n  can shift very quickly toward the insolvency line, as shown in Figure 2, because\n  the liquidation value is lower than the firm’s value as a going concern.\n\nThere are also a number of idiosyncratic sources of instability worthy of\n  mention, some of which are unique to our particular system.  One source\n  of instability is the tri-party repo system that I discussed earlier.  Another\n  is the convention of tying collateral calls to credit ratings.  In this\n  case, if a firm’s credit rating is lowered, the firm may have to post\n  additional collateral to its counterparties, eliminating this collateral as\n  a potential source of funding.  This phenomenon was a particularly important\n  problem for AIG, which lost its access to the commercial paper market and was\n  subject to increased collateral calls.  Both factors caused the liquidity\n  of the AIG parent company to be depleted very quickly.   Finally, if asset\n  volatility rises, haircuts can increase.  This can lead to haircut spirals\n  in which higher haircuts lead to forced asset sales, increased volatility and\n  still higher haircuts.\n\nThese sources of instability create the risk of a cascade—of firms moving\n  rapidly from the situation represented in Figure 1 to that shown in Figure\n  2.  Once the firm’s viability is in question and it is does not\n  have access to an insured deposit funding base, the next stop is often a full-scale\n  liquidity crisis that often cannot be stopped without massive government intervention.\n\nFortunately, there are ways to mitigate the risk of a cascade.  First,\n  we can require that financial intermediaries hold more capital.  This\n  would push the probability distribution to the right in Figure 2.  With\n  sufficient additional capital, the probability of insolvency could be reduced\n  to a low enough level that liquidity providers would not run.\n\nHigher capital requirements work to reduce the risk of liquidity runs, but\n  potentially at the cost of making the process of financial intermediation much\n  more expensive.  In particular, a requirement that firms must hold more\n  capital increases intermediation costs. Moreover, banks may respond to higher\n  capital requirements by taking on greater risk.   If an increase in risk-taking\n  were to occur, the movement of the probability distribution to the right in\n  Figure 2 might be offset by an increase in the degree of dispersion.  Thus,\n  higher capital requirements might not necessarily be sufficient to push all\n  of the probability distribution above zero.\n\nSecond, regulators could require greater liquidity buffers.   These\n  buffers would help protect the firm against having to liquidate assets under\n  duress, and would therefore help prevent the probability distribution from\n  sliding left toward the zero line in Figure 2.    But there is a\n  cost to the firm from holding greater liquidity buffers in terms of lower returns\n  on capital.  So, requiring greater liquidity buffers would also tend to\n  drive up intermediation costs.   And, just as in the case of higher\n  capital requirements, banks could respond by taking greater risks.\n\nThird, regulators could implement changes that would reduce the degree of\n  dispersion in the potential value of a firm, pushing the right tail of the\n  distribution in Figure 2 to the left.  For example, we could require greater\n  transparency about the composition and quality of the firm’s assets and\n  liabilities.  Or, regulators could increase transparency by forcing greater\n  disclosure of the sale price of assets and/or by pushing for greater homogeneity\n  and price discovery for products such as OTC derivatives.   We could\n  improve the quality of regulation and supervision, which would increase confidence\n  in regulatory measures of capital and financial firms’ soundness.\n\nFourth, the central bank could provide a liquidity backstop to solvent firms.  For\n  example, the central bank could commit to being the lender of last resort as\n  long as it judged the firm to be solvent and with sufficient collateral.  This\n  would reduce the coordination problem and the risk of panics sparked by uncertainty\n  among lenders about what other creditors think.   If the central bank\n  is willing to provide backstop liquidity, then a lender that judges the financial\n  firm to be solvent should be willing to lend. The backstop liquidity ensures\n  timely repayment.  The lender of last resort role eliminates the externality\n  in which the expectations about the willingness of one lender to lend influences\n  the decisions of others.\n\nHowever, providing a liquidity backstop is not without its own set of problems.  If\n  firms have liquidity backstops that are viewed as credible, then this creates\n  moral hazard.  Firms do not have to worry as much about what lenders think\n  about their capital adequacy or the size of their liquidity buffers.  This\n  creates incentives to run leaner in terms of capital and liquidity, which increases\n  the risks to the backstop liquidity provider.\n\nTo mitigate such effects, the backstop liquidity provider could presumably\n  charge financial firms for the value of the backstop.  But what fee would\n  be appropriate? It is difficult to assess the probability of financial panics\n  and the value of backstop liquidity facilities. 7\n\nFifth, regulators could take steps to reduce the difference between the value\n  of the firm dead versus alive.  For example, we could improve the resolution\n  process so that less of a firm’s value is destroyed by the liquidation\n  process.  If we could reduce the difference in value between a firm as\n  a going concern versus the same firm in liquidation we could reduce the severity\n  of the cascade effect when financial conditions deteriorate.\n\nSixth, we could make structural changes to the financial system to make it\n  more stable in terms of liquidity provision.  For example, consider the\n  three structural issues outlined earlier that amplified the crisis—tri-party\n  repo, collateral requirements tied to credit ratings, and haircut spirals.   In\n  the case of tri-party repo, the amplifying dynamics could be reduced by enforcing\n  standards that limited the scope of eligible collateral or required more conservative\n  haircuts.  Formal loss-sharing arrangements among tri-party repo borrowers,\n  investors, and clearing banks might reduce or eliminate any advantage that\n  might stem from running early.   Eliminating the market’s reliance\n  on intraday credit provided by clearing banks could eliminate the tension between\n  the interests of clearing banks and investors when a dealer becomes troubled.  In\n  the case of collateral requirements, collateral haircuts could be required\n  to be independent of ratings.\n\nMany of these suggestions are already in the process of being implemented.  For\n  example, the Basel Committee is in the process of strengthening bank capital\n  in four ways:  1) higher capital requirements; 2) higher quality capital;\n  3) more complete risk capture; and 4) capital conservation measures, including\n  the use of contingent capital instruments.   With greater capital\n  buffers, the risk of liquidity runs should be reduced going forward.    It\n  should be noted, however, that use of contingent capital instruments, or any\n  other potential changes to our current capital regime, does not obviate the\n  need for an improved resolution process.\n\nSecond, the Basel Committee is moving forward with its work in establishing\n  liquidity standards for large, complex financial institutions.   These\n  liquidity standards would consist of two parts.  First, there would be\n  a liquidity buffer made up of high-quality liquid assets that would be of sufficient\n  size so that the firm could manage a stress event caused by a short-term loss\n  of investor confidence.  Second, there would be rules concerning the degree\n  of allowable maturity transformation.  Long-term illiquid assets would\n  have to be largely funded by equity and longer-term borrowing, not by short-term\n  borrowing, such as tri-party repo.\n\nThird, the Federal Reserve is working with\n  a broad range of private sector participants, including dealers, clearing banks,\n  and tri-party repo investors to eliminate the structural instability of the\n  tri-party repo system so that tri-party borrowers are  less vulnerable\n  to runs.  Exactly\n  how the mechanics of the tri-party repo system will be adjusted is still a\n  work in process. 8\n\nFourth, the major U.S. securities dealers are now subject to supervision by\n  the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act.  This means that\n  their liquidity funding needs are subject to supervisory oversight, including\n  stress tests, to ensure that the firms can meet large funding drains.\n\nLiquidity risk will never be eliminated, nor should it.  The preferences\n  of borrowers to borrow long and of lenders to lend short means that the maturity\n  transformation process generates real benefits.  However, we can do better\n  to make our system less prone to the types of liquidity runs that we have experienced.  If\n  we remain committed to implementing the reforms that are already underway,\n  I am confident that we can dramatically reduce the risks of the type of liquidity\n  crises that we experienced all too recently.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________ 1 The collapse of the shadow banking system, in turn, put intense pressure on commercial banks.  Off-balance- sheet items came back on to bank balance sheets and the quality of bank assets fell sharply.  The end result was a sharp tightening in the availability of credit that served to exacerbate the downward pressure on economic activity. 2 Some dealers were further weakened by having provided significant amounts of funding to failed investment funds, which reduced the amount of funding that was available to meet other needs. 3 One final factor that was important in exacerbating the funding crises was the novation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivative exposures away from a troubled dealer.  In a novation, a customer asks a different dealer to stand in between the customer and the distressed dealer.  This process results in the outflow of cash collateral from the distressed dealer.  The novation of OTC derivatives was an important factor behind the liquidity crises at both Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. 4 There were funding strains prior to the Lehman Brothers failure and these were most apparent in the elevated spreads evident in term LIBOR funding compared with the federal funds rate. 5 Moreover, certain classes of investors such as money market mutual funds do not take much comfort in collateral.  Also, the headline risk of having exposure to a troubled participant could subject investors such as money market funds to liquidity pressures of their own. Investors could withdraw funds before losses are realized. 6 This problem has been largely addressed in the banking sector by deposit insurance and by providing access to lender of last resort facilities.  In addition, supervisory and reporting requirements address transparency issues. 7 Supervision could also be brought to bear to limit the tendency for firms to reduce their capital and liquidity when provided with a credible liquidity backstop. 8 Work is also underway to shift the settlement of OTC derivative trades to central counterparties (CCPs).  This is important because CCPs reduce risk exposures by netting out the offsetting exposures among the CCP participants.  Also, because the counterparty risks move to the CCP rather than staying with the individual dealers, the incentive to novate—move trades away from troubled dealers—is reduced.",

    "text": "Good morning. I am very  pleased to speak at the 6th Annual Community Development Conference.  I would like to give a special thanks to the  Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development for organizing this conference  about issues of importance to the community development industry and to the  future of New York City.\n\nAt  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we develop a wide variety of research and  data products to gain a deeper understanding of regional economic  conditions.  We track the health of household  balance sheets at the state and local level using data from the New York Fed’s Consumer Credit Panel .  We also  conduct an annual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and  credit availability.  My meeting with you today is part of our continuing  efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy  and to share insights from the New York Fed.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve has dual objectives, set by Congress, with respect to monetary  policy—maximum sustainable employment and price stability.  I would like to focus my remarks today on the  first of these objectives. As always, what I have to say today reflects my own  views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the  Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe  Federal Reserve’s employment objective can be viewed both narrowly and broadly.  Narrowly, we focus on the degree of slack or tightness in the labor  market.  This leads to discussion of many  measures of the labor market such as the unemployment rate, the participation  rate and the growth of wages. Broadly, the economy’s potential growth rate  depends on effectively investing in and taking advantage of all of the  resources in the economy—in particular, we need to achieve the full potential  of the human capital of all Americans. For the United States to reach its  maximum economic potential, all Americans must have the opportunity to reach  their potential.\n\nThe  United States has always prided itself on being “the land of opportunity.”  Parents hope that their children can achieve more than they did. Over the  course of our history, immigrants have journeyed to America in search of a  better life, a chance to live the “American Dream.”\n\nWhat  defines the American Dream? President Reagan thought that one element of the  American dream is “the opportunity to grow, create wealth, and build a better  life for those who follow,” while President Obama has described it as follows:  “A child’s course in life should be determined not by the zip code she’s born  in, but by the strength of her work ethic and the scope of her dreams.”  One’s destination in life should not depend  on where the journey begins.\n\nEqual  opportunity does not imply equal outcomes—some people may work harder, be more  fortunate in terms of their disposition and endowments, or just be luckier in  how their lives evolve.  But it does  require that income mobility—in particular, upward mobility—be widely evident  and remain part of the fabric of the nation.\n\nIt  is important to keep in mind the distinction between income mobility and income  inequality. Income mobility is a dynamic concept—the degree to which  individuals or families can move up or down in the income distribution over  time.  Income inequality is a static  concept—how unequal are individual or family incomes at a particular point in  time.\n\nRecognizing  that rising income inequality in the United States is an important issue, my  focus today will be mainly on income mobility.   I don’t think the issue of income mobility receives the attention it  deserves.  It is a foundational element  for a well-functioning democratic society and provides evidence about the  ability of an economy to provide opportunities for its citizens.\n\nA  standard approach to measuring income mobility is to compare where a child is  in the income distribution relative to where the parents were in the income  distribution. A striking result is that intergenerational income mobility in  the U.S.—a child’s chances of moving up in the income distribution relative to  her parents—has remained stable over the past half century. However, because of  the increase in income inequality, the consequences of being born to low-versus  high-income parents are larger today than in the past.  One explanation for the lack of a correlation  between income inequality and income mobility in the U.S. is that income  inequality is strongly influenced by the top one percent of the income  distribution, but there is little correlation between income mobility and this  top income percentile. 2\n\nWhile  income mobility in the United States has been relatively unchanged, it remains  well below several other nations. According to Stanford economist Raj Chetty,  the probability of moving from the bottom quintile to the top quintile is 7.5  percent in the United States, as compared to 11.7 percent in Denmark and 13.5  percent in Canada—two countries with relatively high levels of  intergenerational mobility. 3 So  effectively the chance of achieving the American Dream is not the highest for  children born in America.\n\nImportantly,  Chetty finds even more significant variation in intergenerational mobility  across different metro and rural areas within the United States. 4 While some regions in the U.S. match the  highest mobility levels among developed countries, others persistently offer  less mobility than in most other developed countries. Relative income mobility  is highest in the Mountain West and the rural Midwest and lowest in the  Southeast. Now these differences could be caused by the experience of living in  different neighborhoods, but they may also simply reflect differences in the  people living in these neighborhoods. In an effort to distinguish between these  two possible explanations, Chetty and fellow economists study children from  families who changed their neighborhood during childhood and provide evidence  that much of the variation in upward mobility reflects the experience of living  in particular neighborhoods. Their findings imply that upward mobility depends  strongly on where you grow up as a child.\n\nThis  research indicates that it is the places themselves, rather than the families  who live there, that affect the outcomes for children. An important question is  what specific features of neighborhoods are associated with greater upward  mobility. Chetty and co-authors find that higher upward mobility is associated  with areas that are less residentially segregated by race or income, have lower  income inequality (i.e. a bigger middle class), higher quality schools, 5 stronger social networks, higher community involvement and stable family  structures.\n\nThe  finding that intergenerational mobility is primarily a local problem has two  broad policy implications. The first is the need for place-based policies to  invest more in at-risk communities to improve their childhood environments. The  second is to facilitate families to be able to move into areas with better  childhood environments.\n\nWith  respect to the first, I would initially like to talk about the importance of  schools―and in particular, strong public education.   Consistent with the findings by Chetty,  there exists a large literature that has established the importance of  high-quality education as a key determinant of economic mobility.  While there are differences of opinions on  the most relevant measures of school quality, there is ample evidence that  children who attend better schools on average end up with better outcomes later  in life—such as higher levels of educational attainment and higher earnings. It  is also well known that there exist large disparities in the quality of  education by geography and socioeconomic background. Compared to children born  to low-income parents, those born to higher-income families can better afford  to move and live in areas with high-quality schools.\n\nThe  sorting of families by income and their desire for better educational  opportunities leads to enclaves of higher-quality and higher-spending schools  that are separated from areas of economically less-advantaged populations and  lower-quality schools. To a degree, this residential segregation has been  perpetuated by our system of school financing that relies heavily on local  property tax funding.  Local financing of  public schools leads to a bundling of two distinct choices—residential choice  and school choice—and increases the degree of socioeconomic segregation across  school districts.\n\nWe  can promote greater income mobility by unbundling the residential and school  choices. This can be done in one of two ways. The first is to work to equalize  school quality across location, while the second is to allow parents more  choice of schools from a given location. Along the lines of the first approach,  New York Fed research has shown that school finance reforms that seek to  equalize funding across school districts by reducing the role of local property  taxes can go a long way in decreasing residential segregation and equalizing  quality of education. 6 The key mechanism is that such reforms make underperforming neighborhoods more  attractive, thus reducing socioeconomic segregation and leading to consequent  gains in peer quality in previously-challenged enclaves. This in turn reduces  disparities in school quality stemming from reduced socioeconomic segregation.\n\nOn  the second approach, there exists research indicating that school vouchers that  enable students to move to private schools or better-quality public schools can  lead to improvements in public school quality and student performance by  increasing competition among schools. 7 It  is important to note, though, that not all voucher programs are created  equally, and the design of the program matters in how vouchers impact school  quality.  Charter schools have provided  another source of school choice in education.   More research into evaluating the effectiveness of voucher programs and  charter schools at raising student achievement would be desirable in terms of  informing public policy choices. 8\n\nThe  importance of education is not limited to elementary and secondary levels.  In fact, there exists convincing evidence  from the child development literature that suggests that educational  investments early in childhood have especially large rates of returns in terms  of lifetime earnings and other outcomes. Take, for example, the Perry Preschool  program for low-income African-American children, a two-year preschool program  experiment in the mid-1960s. Recent research shows that this program had very  large beneficial long-term effects, with participants experiencing higher rates  of high school graduation, higher salaries, higher homeownership, more stable  family structures, fewer arrests and lower welfare dependence. The large  positive economic externalities from these investments in children imply that  such programs more than pay for themselves over the long term. Estimates  indicate that the aggregate benefits over the life of a child exceeded by  eightfold the program’s per-pupil cost. 9 Almost equally-large gains were reported for children who enrolled in Head  Start, a federally-funded nationwide preschool program for low-income children. 10\n\nRelated  literature on neighborhood effects has found that labor market outcomes for  adults are also significantly affected by the type of neighborhoods where  people reside.  The  role of labor market networks and referrals has been amply-demonstrated as  affecting the likelihood of finding a job, the quality of matches between  employers and workers, and the earnings associated with these jobs. Several  studies show that many of these networks have a significant local neighborhood  component. Further, workers who live in neighborhoods with higher-quality  networks are more likely to move to jobs with higher wages. 11\n\nLet me  now turn to policies aimed at improving upward income mobility through  increased residential mobility.  There is  some striking evidence that shows providing more opportunities for families to  move to wealthier areas may improve upward mobility while also being  cost-effective. 12 In the mid-1990s, as part of a lottery-based housing mobility experiment  sponsored by HUD—called the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment—families in  high-poverty housing projects were given housing vouchers to move to  lower-poverty mixed-income neighborhoods.   While this project appears to have had little impact on the economic  outcomes of the adults and older children, the program appears to have had  remarkable long-term impacts on children who moved to such neighborhoods at a  young age, with the impacts increasing by the number of childhood years they  ended up living in the better environment.\n\nAnalysis  of the data from the experiment shows that those who moved to lower-poverty  areas when they were 12 or younger were found to earn about 30 percent more, on  average, in their early- to mid-twenties compared to those who did not move,  were 27 percent more likely to have entered college, and 30 percent less likely  to be a single parent.  The MTO  experiment again illustrates the importance of neighborhood effects on child  development early in childhood. It also demonstrates that grants to move  families to lower-poverty neighborhoods may reduce the intergenerational  persistence of poverty.\n\nOf  course, mobility of the sort that Chetty and other researchers have emphasized  interacts in a very important way with the availability of affordable  housing.  Making high quality  neighborhoods accessible to families from all socioeconomic backgrounds is a  major challenge for public policy.   Of  course, illegal racial and other discrimination has played a role in preventing  access to high-quality neighborhoods.   However, part of the challenge arises from the fact that in a  free-market economy, the quality of the environment is reflected in the price  of land—and thus housing—in that place.   This means that the neighborhoods with the best schools, the best access  to jobs, shopping, recreation and other amenities will be the most desirable  and will have the highest cost of land and housing.  Simply put, families seeking the upward  mobility that better neighborhoods can promote may well find that housing in  these neighborhoods is unaffordable.\n\nSome  kinds of public policies may exacerbate, rather than lessen, the tendency of  the housing market to price some families out of good neighborhoods.  Zoning and other land use regulations are  sometimes enacted to artificially reduce the supply of housing, thus driving  its price up even further. Take, for example, minimum lot size zoning which  specifies a minimum amount of land per housing unit. When this regulation is  binding, it reduces the number of housing units that can be built in a given  area, and thus introduces artificial scarcity into the housing market, thereby  raising prices.\n\nZoning  can also be used to promote affordable housing—to include, rather than exclude  low-and moderate-income families by setting aside space for those families in  exchange for the right to develop market-rate units.  This is a strategy that New York and other  large cities have pursued for many years, and in these cities it is easy to point  to units that were developed under the program. Nonetheless, these programs are  often controversial—some economists and others argue by increasing the cost of  development they restrict supply.  Thus,  while some percentage of new units developed will be affordable, fewer new  units will be developed with uncertain effects on affordability overall.\n\nIt’s  perhaps informative to contrast this kind of program with one that has  historically been the main mechanism by which the supply of affordable housing  has increased. The program I have in mind here isn’t a housing program, but, in  my view, it has extremely important effects on the housing market. I’m talking  about intra-urban transportation, which can serve to dramatically increase the  locations available for development, and thus promote the availability of  affordable housing. 13 I  believe that safe, reliable, affordable and efficient transportation to job  locations should be a crucial element in an effective housing policy. Such a  program indisputably increases the supply of sites available for development,  which is a key way to get the benefits of lower prices to a broader set of  families.  Indeed, it is clear that  cities’ ability to grow and attract new residents requires them to either  increase density—essentially meaning taller buildings—or to expand outwards by  increasing transportation access.\n\nAccess  to affordable credit is yet another pillar of a policy program that promotes  housing affordability.  We at the Federal  Reserve have long worked to ensure that credit flows equitably and that financial  services are available to all U.S. citizens.   The Fed’s research on these subjects ranges from the pioneering study of  redlining by a team of Boston Fed economists, to a very recent New York Fed  study on “banking deserts” that appeared in our Liberty Street Economics blog  just last month, as well as ongoing community credit work.  We understand the importance of credit in  allowing communities to grow, and the importance of the Community Reinvestment  Act in requiring financial institutions to make investments in their  communities.  But, as my remarks here  have indicated, credit is only one factor—and perhaps not the most important  one—that affects the affordability of housing in our cities.\n\nI’ve  addressed the importance of geographic mobility in supporting income mobility  from the perspective of providing parents options for better neighborhoods in  which to raise their children. Geographic mobility is also important in terms  of individuals receiving the highest return to their human capital. Local economic  shocks can depress employment and wages in some labor markets. This creates a  strong incentive for individuals to move to an alternative labor market in  order to more fully utilize their skills. Financial frictions to geographic  mobility can reduce this movement of individuals across labor markets leading  to less-efficient outcomes for the economy.   Income mobility can be enhanced through policies that attempt to limit  these financial frictions. This argues for avoiding, where possible, policies  that create “in-place” subsidies where the household can access the benefits  only while remaining in a specific location.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve has the twin objectives of maximum sustainable employment and  price stability. Achieving the first of our objectives requires that every  individual has the opportunity to achieve her full potential in life. Where you  happen to be born should not determine your chance of living the American  Dream. Research is highlighting possible key determinants of economic  opportunity and income mobility. More research is necessary to inform future  policy choices in this critical area.\n\nReferences\n\nAngrist, Joshua, Sarah Cohodes, Susan Dynarski, Parag Pathak  and Christopher Walters. 2016. “Stand and Deliver: Effects of Boston’s Charter  High Schools on College Preparation, Entry, and Choice,” Journal of Labor  Economics , 34(2): 275-318.\n\nAslund, Olof, Per-Anders Edin, Peter Fredriksson and Hans  Gronqvist. 2011. “Peers, Neighborhoods, and Student Achievement: Evidence From  a Placement Policy,” American Economic Journal Applied Economics , 3(2): 67-95.\n\nBaum-Snow, Nathaniel. 2007. “Did  Highways Cause Suburbanization?” Quarterly Journal of Economics , 122(2):  775-805.\n\nBayer, Patrick, Steven L.

    "text": "Let me start by welcoming all of you to this workshop to discuss the issue of culture in the financial services industry.  This is an issue that has been on my mind for a long time.  In my view, the industry is not close to where it needs to be, and failure to address this situation should not be viewed as a viable option.\n\nIn a speech last November, I argued that ending “too big to fail” is a prerequisite for ensuring financial stability and sustainable economic growth. 1 For one thing, the excessive risk-taking undertaken by large and complex financial institutions was an important element of the financial crisis. For another, in terms of culture within these institutions, it doesn’t seem like things today are much better.  An “apparent lack of respect for law, regulation and the public trust” persists. I said that I believe that this reflects “deep-seated cultural and ethical failures.”\n\nWhy did I raise this issue, and why in a speech about too big to fail? Just as excessive risk taking can cause more damage when it occurs in large, complex and interconnected financial firms; the consequences of cultural and ethical failures in these same firms are also more severe and harmful to the economy. I suggested that breaking up these large financial institutions did not seem to be the most efficient means of making the financial system more stable. But, this view was predicated on the assumptions that both the too big to fail problem and the culture problem could be solved. Correcting one but not the other would still leave the financial sector and the economy vulnerable. Or, put another way, fixing the culture problem in the finance industry is also an imperative for achieving financial stability.\n\nToday’s workshop is a part of that effort. I thank all of you for your willingness to participate in what I expect will be frank and informative discussions.  Culture is not an easy thing to pin down and talk about.  Establishing and maintaining the culture of an institution takes work and constant effort, and is a journey as much as a destination—you will never be quite sure if you have gotten exactly where you wanted, but you have to stay committed to the path.  I think we’ll find that there are many different elements that have contributed to the current state of affairs and, likewise, an array of tools that will have to be brought to bear to move the industry’s culture to where it needs to be.\n\nThis morning will be aimed at putting some parameters around the problem—by looking at structural changes that have occurred in the financial sector, and at how compensation and other incentives have evolved over time. This afternoon will be focused on solutions—both those that are being led by the industry itself, and those that are available to the government through enforcement.\n\nSo let’s get started.  I am now very honored to introduce Sir David Walker as our keynote speaker today.  David, as chairman of Barclays, a longtime member of the Group of Thirty, and in several other official capacities, has been at the forefront of corporate governance issues and efforts to reform of the industry.  David, we look forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\n1 Ending Too Big to Fail",

    "text": "The scaling back of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchase program—both the prospect and the actuality—has created significant challenges for many emerging market economies. Although this shift in U.S. monetary policy was inevitable at some point, it seems to have triggered a broad-based sentiment shift in global markets.  Recent events are a reminder that U.S. monetary policy can have powerful effects abroad. What lessons should we draw from these events?   That will be the general theme of my brief remarks today.\n\nBefore I go on, though, I first would remind you that the thoughts I offer today are my own, and should not be interpreted as representing the position of the Federal Reserve System.  I also want to call attention to Terry Checki, who is being honored today and has been at the center of events in global finance for more than three decades, and who has done so much to shape them.  I can't think of a better way of recognizing his many contributions—and kicking off what I know will be an exciting and fulfilling next stage of his career—than this roundtable which brings us together here today.\n\nLet me begin by highlighting some of the key points I will be making.\n\nFirst, what we've seen recently is not new.  Changes in Fed policy, and especially moves in the past to tighten monetary policy, have often created challenges for emerging market economies (EMEs).  Second, these countries, as a group, are better equipped today to handle those challenges than at perhaps any time in the past.  This reflects the fundamental improvements and stronger policy frameworks that many emerging market economies have put in place over the past 15 years.  Third, given the role of the dollar as the global reserve currency, the Federal Reserve has a special responsibility to manage policy in a way that helps promote global financial stability.  Fourth, I believe we need better international mechanisms to cushion the adjustment process for when capital flows abruptly change direction.\n\nLike other central banks, our monetary policy mandate is domestic.  But, our actions often have global implications that feed back into the U.S. economy, and we need to always keep this in mind.  We also need to be careful not to underestimate the consequences of our actions.  Focusing only on direct channels, the effects that one would expect to ripple back to the United States from problems in one or two EMEs typically look quite small.  But, when all of the indirect channels of feedback are aggregated properly—which admittedly is difficult to do—the effects may be considerably larger.   My point is that we tend to underestimate these feedback effects.\n\nFor most of us, the market volatility of this past spring and summer still remains fresh in our minds.  EME financial markets were hit hardest, with declines in equity prices, a widening in sovereign debt spreads, and a sharp increase in foreign exchange rate volatility.  In the U.S., we saw a spike in Treasury yields, with 10-year rates rising by roughly 100 basis points from early May to early July, and rising by roughly another 30 basis points before peaking in early September.\n\nMost commentary has focused on the shift in expectations with respect to U.S. monetary policy—and, in particular, to uncertainty about the timing and implications of Fed tapering—as the catalyst for these moves.  This focus seems generally right, although other factors also played a role.  Market participants also had to evaluate the possibility that growth in China and other EMEs might be slowing even as growth in the U.S. and other advanced economies was picking up.  The subsequent market movements as investors withdrew funds from EME investments were an abrupt shock for EMEs generally, especially after the long earlier period of abundant liquidity and ample inflows.\n\nFrom one perspective, the unconventional nature of recent U.S. monetary policy adds little that is fundamentally new to the challenges now facing EMEs.  These policies simply represent a way of easing, driven by our coming up against the zero lower bound.   Central bankers have managed differences across countries in cyclical positions and policy stances many times in the past.  But, from another perspective, we have less experience operating with unconventional monetary policy and this creates more potential uncertainties.  This puts a premium on continued dialogue among central bankers, between central bankers and the market, and keen listening skills on our part.  In my view, the fact that our large scale asset purchase programs affect the size of term risk premia globally is important.  This set of monetary policies affects financial asset prices in a different way compared to changes in short-term interest rates, and we should be humble about what we claim about understanding the importance of this distinction.\n\nFor the period ahead, it seems likely that markets will remain focused on vulnerabilities they might have ignored a year ago.  The greater premium on strong fundamentals, policy coherence and predictability will likely remain.  There will be no one right answer in managing the trade-offs that come with the changed environment, and adjustment will sometimes be difficult.  Moreover, we will undoubtedly experience further bumps in the road.  The renewed volatility we saw in January is proof enough of that.  Yet, I think we can remain generally optimistic on the outlook so long as market participants continue to appropriately discriminate across countries, rather than treating EMEs as a homogenous group.\n\nFurthermore, many EMEs generally appear better equipped today to handle the Fed's prospective exit from its exceptional policy accommodation than they were in past tightening cycles.  This reflects the fundamental reforms these EMEs have put in place over the past 15 years, as well as the hard lessons learned from past periods of market stress.  Among the positives are:\n\nOf course progress has not been uniform across EMEs and more work remains to strengthen institutional structures further in some countries.  In particular, vulnerabilities have built up recently in several important EMEs.  Still, the fundamental improvements I’ve cited leave many EMEs better positioned than in the past to weather those times in the cycle when the external environment turns from welcoming to wary.\n\nThe impact that changes in Fed policy can have beyond our borders has led to calls for us to do more to internalize those impacts, or even that policymaking be internationally coordinated.  As I’ve already noted, Fed policies have significant effects internationally, given the central place of U.S. markets in the global financial system and the dollar’s status as the leading global reserve currency.  In pursuing our policy responsibilities, we seek to conduct policy transparently and based on clear principles.  We are mindful of the global effects of Fed policy.  Promoting growth and stability in the U.S., I believe, is the most important contribution we can make to growth and stability worldwide.\n\nThere is, of course, the argument that Fed policy has been too accommodative for too long, creating risks for financial stability worldwide.  Here, I think, it’s important to consider carefully the counterfactual.  Would countries beyond our borders really have been better off with a weaker U.S. economy?  The fundamental issue is whether U.S. monetary policy has helped support our dual objectives of stable prices and maximum sustainable growth and whether this is consistent with a healthy global economy.\n\nMoreover, it is far from clear that explicitly coordinated policy would produce better outcomes for the global economy generally, or the EMEs specifically.  Central banks have challenges enough in tailoring policies to their domestic circumstances.  I believe that it would be taking on too much to attempt to collectively fashion policy in reference to global conditions.  Moreover, our last system of explicit coordination—the system of fixed exchange rates under Bretton Woods—broke down for a reason.  Monetary policy meant to suit everybody is likely in the end to suit nobody.  Similar considerations underlie the widespread move in the emerging world away from fixed exchange rate regimes.  Policymakers worldwide have learned that a framework capable of responding in a disciplined but flexible manner to changing domestic conditions works best over the long run.\n\nWhile explicit coordination looks neither feasible nor desirable, there is more that central banks in general, and the Fed in particular, could do to be better global stewards.  One thing recent events demonstrate is the importance of effective Fed communication.  It is clear in retrospect that our attempts last spring to provide guidance about the potential timing and pace of tapering confused market participants.  In particular, markets seemed to conflate tapering with monetary policy tightening and raised their expected paths for policy rates.  Lately, we seem to have done better:  markets now seem to understand that policy rates will likely remain exceptionally low for a considerable period of time even after tapering is completed.\n\nAs you know, we’ve taken a number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve our communications.  This includes regular press conferences following Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings by the Fed chair; the publishing of growth and inflation forecasts of FOMC participants; and a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at to assess progress toward our mandate.  This last element, of course, goes along with our move to explicit forward guidance, as part of our efforts to provide stimulus at the zero lower bound.  We are, though, still learning how to more effectively communicate, especially given our new and expanded set of policy instruments.\n\nA second area in which we can and must do better is safeguarding financial stability.  Simply put, we failed to act either early enough or decisively enough to stem the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  The United States was not alone in this, but given our position in the global financial system, we especially should have done better.  We've taken important steps, reflecting both new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory and supervisory framework.  Systemically important banking organizations must now hold amounts of capital and liquidity that are better aligned with their risk profiles, compensation schemes for these institutions will be more focused on rewarding long-term results and the official sector is making progress in solving the too-big-to-fail dilemma.\n\nAll of this remains very much a work in progress.  But, these efforts should help us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the recent past, and to take a more proactive stance toward mitigating potential future vulnerabilities.  Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here.  Since the recent financial crisis, central banks worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how better to fulfill their mandates.\n\nI also think there is another area we need to work on, an area where very little has been done to date.  We need to collectively devise a better international mechanism for facilitating adjustment when the direction of capital flows changes abruptly.  The current regime strikes me as inefficient and often ineffective.  Holding large cushions of foreign exchange reserves is expensive, drawing down those reserves is often unattractive because of the potential adverse signal that this sends, and EMEs are loath to turn to the International Monetary Fund for resources to cushion the adjustment process.  It seems to me that we could design a better global solution of collective insurance—access to liquid resources in times of stress that were not stigmatized and that could and would be used to facilitate adjustment.  This could help reduce market volatility and dampen the size of foreign exchange and other adjustments.  This is a topic, in my opinion, that deserves greater attention from central bankers around the world.\n\nLet me close with a final thought.  The largest problems that countries create for others often emanate from getting policy wrong domestically.  Recession or instability at home is often quickly exported.  Equally important, growth and stability abroad makes all our jobs easier.  This means that there are externalities in the work we do, so that more effective fulfillment of our domestic mandates helps to bring us to a better place collectively.  Ensuring global growth and stability is and will remain our joint and common endeavor.  This is what Terry Checki has worked for over his distinguished career.  We have been very fortunate for his service and must carry the mantle forward.",

    "text": "I. Introduction\n\nChairman Brown, Ranking Member Toomey, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to testify on the effectiveness of financial institution supervision and the issue of regulatory capture.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009 our country faced its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  I mention those years as a touchstone for my remarks today.  Despite the passage of time and an economy that is steadily improving, the financial crisis is hardly something that happened in the remote past.  For the too many people who are still unemployed or underemployed, or who otherwise continue to struggle financially, it is living history.\n\nWhile the causes of the crisis remain subject to debate, it is undeniable that banking supervisors could have done better in their prudential oversight of the financial system.  This conclusion raises two fundamental questions:\n\nThe Federal Reserve is working diligently to improve both stability and supervision.  The two concepts are linked.  Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has made significant changes to the substance and process of supervision.  As a result, the financial system is unquestionably much stronger and much more stable now than it was five years ago.\n\nII. Substantive changes\n\nSince the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has redoubled its attention to bank capital.  Capital is the financial cushion that banks hold to absorb loss. 1 It provides an economic firebreak that helps prevent systemic stress from turning into a full-blown crisis.\n\nBefore the crisis, capital requirements were too low and inconsistent across jurisdictions.  Moreover, too much of the capital held by banks was of poor quality, and their internal capital assessments were not forward-looking. 2 Since the crisis, new regulation and heightened supervision have increased both the quantity and the quality of equity capital at the largest financial institutions that we regulate and supervise.  The Federal Reserve and other federal banking regulators implemented so-called “Basel III” international capital standards in July 2013, which raised the minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets.  Federal regulation also now requires stricter criteria for instruments to qualify as regulatory capital and higher risk weights for many classes of assets.  And the Federal Reserve mandated a new minimum supplementary leverage ratio that includes off-balance sheet exposures for the largest, most internationally active banking organizations and a leverage surcharge for large U.S. banking organizations.\n\nIn support of these new regulations, capital assessment has become a focus of supervision since the financial crisis.  Examiners monitor capital reserves and put banks through periodic stress tests that are evaluated on a cross-firm basis.  This has been one of the great advancements of bank oversight following the crisis.  These evaluations enable supervisors to assemble a composite assessment of the nation’s banking sector, which materially assists the Federal Reserve in its statutory mandate to promote financial stability. 3\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act mandates supervisory stress tests that assess whether large bank holding companies have a sufficient level of capital to absorb losses during adverse economic conditions. 4 The Federal Reserve also conducts a capital planning exercise, called the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or “CCAR.”  This evaluation combines the quantitative results from the Dodd-Frank Act stress tests with a qualitative assessment of whether the largest bank holding companies have vigorous, “forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks.” 5 The criteria for both sets of stress tests are dynamic and change in response to evolving risks.  For example, past tests have assumed a sharp, sudden, and widespread drop in markets triggered by, say, a large Eurozone shock.  The tests also evaluate market interconnectedness, including the risk of major counterparty default.\n\nTo increase public transparency, the Federal Reserve now publishes the overall results of its stress tests.  This helps rebuild confidence in the strength of the financial system.  The most recent round of stress tests concluded in the first quarter of this year.  In my view, the results were encouraging, although not uniformly satisfying.  In general, “firms participating in CCAR have more than doubled their Tier 1 common capital since 2009, an increase of $500 billion of additional, high-quality capital in the U.S. financial system.” 6 This impressive statistic notwithstanding, the Federal Reserve objected to capital plans from five of the 30 participating firms.  Four of those five firms submitted plans that raised firm-specific, qualitative concerns.  The remaining firm failed to meet a minimum quantitative requirement. 7\n\nThe consequences of failing to pass a stress test can be severe.  If its capital plan has been rejected, the Federal Reserve may, among other things, restrict a bank holding company from paying or increasing dividends on its common stock or increasing any repurchase of its common stock, or both. 8 For example, as a result of this year’s CCAR, Citigroup was not permitted to begin a new common stock repurchase program or to increase its quarterly common stock dividend. 9\n\nAs a companion to improved capital, the Federal Reserve also assesses liquidity—that is, how quickly a bank can convert its assets into cash.  Prior to the crisis, liquidity practices did not generally anticipate the possibility of severe drops in the prices of saleable assets.  Following the crisis, the Federal Reserve imposed new liquidity regulations, including the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio.  The objective of these new regulations is to require large firms to hold levels of liquid assets sufficient to protect against constraints on their funding during times of financial turmoil.  We have also implemented liquidity stress test assessments for systemically important financial institutions.  These assessments provide important insight into the adequacy of liquidity positions and bank preparedness for upcoming regulatory standards.\n\nBeyond capital and liquidity, the Federal Reserve has increased its focus on risk management practices at the largest and most systemically important financial institutions.  We learned from the crisis that risk management in the financial services industry had not always kept pace with changing market practices.  We have responded in several ways.\n\nFor example, we have paid greater supervisory attention to corporate governance.  We significantly increased the depth and frequency of interaction between senior supervisors from the Federal Reserve and directors and executives at banks.  This supplements our ongoing assessment of management’s oversight of risk.  Our review entails a critical analysis not only of firm policies, procedures and limits, but also of the quality of the risk reports escalated to senior management, the capabilities of the firm’s risk monitoring program, and the adequacy of control functions.\n\nWe have also increased our enforcement activity for violations of law or unsafe or unsound conduct.  Since 2009 the Federal Reserve has taken 36 public enforcement actions against institutions supervised by the New York Fed, which included $1.2 billion in fines.  On top of this, five firms supervised by the New York Fed paid $1.3 billion into a qualified settlement fund for mortgage borrowers, and the same five institutions were required to provide over $2 billion in other foreclosure prevention assistance.  These statistics do not include non-public enforcement actions, including restrictions on the further growth of banks that do not have satisfactory risk management regimes.  And, earlier this year, we assisted in consigning the concept of “too big to jail” to history when Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas pleaded guilty to criminal charges.  I am gratified that the Attorney General and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York have acknowledged the work of the Federal Reserve in supporting our law enforcement partners. 10\n\nThe New York Fed has also devoted significant resources and attention to the reform of bank culture and conduct.  Increased capital and liquidity are important tools to promote financial stability, but in the end a bank is only as trustworthy as the people who work within it.  I have personally delivered a strong message that the culture of Wall Street is unacceptable. 11 Bad conduct by bankers damages the public trust placed in banks.  In my view, this loss of trust is so severe that it has become a financial stability concern.  If bad behavior persists, it would not be unreasonable—and may even be inevitable—for one to conclude that large firms are too big and complex to manage effectively.\n\nOur nation’s largest financial institutions need to repair the loss of public trust in banks.  This means a back-to-basics assessment of the purpose of banking, including duties owed to the public in exchange for the privileges banks receive through their bank charters and other functions of law.  Among these privileges are deposit insurance and access to a lender of last resort.\n\nAs part of this effort, I have proposed four specific reforms to curb incentives for illegal and unduly risky conduct at banks. First , banks should extend the deferral period for compensation to match the timeframe for legal liabilities to materialize—perhaps as long as a decade. Second , banks should create de facto performance bonds wherein deferred compensation for senior managers and material risk takers could be used to satisfy fines against the firm for banker misbehavior. Third , I have urged Congress to enact new federal legislation creating a database that tracks employees dismissed for illegal or unethical behavior. Fourth , I have requested that Congress amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to impose a mandatory ban from the financial system—that is, both the regulated and shadow banking sectors—for any person convicted of a crime of dishonesty while employed at a financial institution.\n\nIII. Supervisory process\n\nIn tandem with our attention to capital, liquidity, and risk management, we have made important changes to the process of supervision.\n\nFor starters, the Federal Reserve now makes its most consequential supervisory decisions on a system-wide level through the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee or “LISCC.”  The committee comprises representatives across professional disciplines from several Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors.  The New York Fed supplies only three of its 16 members.  LISCC sets supervisory policy for the 15 largest, most systemically important financial institutions in our country and develops innovative, objective, and quantitative methods for assessing these firms on a comparative basis.  LISCC also coordinates the supervision of the largest supervised institutions through its Operating Committee, which reviews and approves supervisory plans for exams, receives regular updates on major supervisory issues, and makes material supervisory decisions regarding matters that affect the firms’ safety and soundness.  In this respect, the Operating Committee provides an important safeguard against regulatory capture by ensuring that no one person or Reserve Bank has the power to make a final decision on a matter of significance.\n\nAnother procedural change is our increased application of cross-firm, horizontal review.  This technique enables peer-to-peer comparison of banks, facilitates a better assessment of the overall health of the financial system, and safeguards against regulatory capture by providing insight from across the Federal Reserve System.  The analysis is done not only at the level of the Board of Governors—for example, through CCAR and Dodd-Frank stress testing—but also within the New York Fed.  We hold weekly discussions among senior supervisory and risk officers to identify developing concerns that may pose a systemic risk.  A current subject of horizontal analysis is leveraged loans—specifically, whether lax underwriting practices for such loans could pose a significant risk to financial stability.\n\nIn addition, we have reorganized the supervision group at the New York Fed in a number of ways that promote unbiased analysis and professional objectivity.  Many of these changes directly reflect the recommendations in a 2009 report that I commissioned from David Beim, which was featured in the recent This American Life program about supervision at the New York Fed.  For example:\n\nEach and together, these improvements to the substance and process of supervision contribute to financial stability by providing greater insight into bank resiliency and risk.  But these enhancements are not self-executing.  They depend on the hundreds of examiners who are dedicated professionals working in the public interest.  Our examiners fulfill their obligations with considerable care, mindful of the stakes to Main Street when something goes wrong on Wall Street.  I am grateful for their efforts.\n\nIV. Reasonable expectations\n\nBefore concluding, let me offer a broader view of what we at the Federal Reserve expect from prudential supervision.  Very briefly, I submit that supervision should be fair, conscientious, and effective.\n\nFair supervision means that the rules are applied consistently across the firms we supervise.  We all need to know the rules and follow the same rule book.  It also entails a commitment to independence from business or political influence, as envisioned by the Federal Reserve Act one hundred years ago.\n\nConscientious supervision means we must be committed to sustained and, if necessary, radical self-improvement.  The Beim report is an example of our willingness to commission and accept self-critical analysis and our commitment to improve.  But we cannot stop there.  To this end, we will be working with the Board of Governors on its upcoming review of whether the LISCC Operating Committee receives information that is sufficient to reach sound supervisory decisions.  One subset of this system-wide inquiry will analyze regulatory capture—specifically, how divergent views are presented to decision makers at the Board.  The review is expected to take several months.\n\nEffective supervision means tough supervision and demands a focus on large banks that pose systemic risk.  Bank supervisors cannot prevent all fraud or illegal conduct or forestall all undesirable behavior in large, complex financial institutions.  But we can help create more resilient, less complex, and better managed organizations that promote, rather than undermine, financial stability.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\nThe Federal Reserve will continue to improve its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.  We understand the risks of doing our job poorly and of becoming too close to the firms we supervise.  We work hard to avoid these risks and to be as fair, conscientious, and effective as possible.  Of course, we are not perfect.  We cannot catch or correct every error by a financial institution, and we sometimes make mistakes.  But in my view, a good measure of the effectiveness of supervision is the improved strength and stability of banks since the financial crisis.  Thanks in part to enhanced supervision and regulation, banks “have the ability to meet their financial obligations and continue to make a broad variety of financial products and services available to households and businesses even in times of economic difficulty.” 12 I can promise you that we will always strive to improve and that we will work hard to earn and retain your trust.\n\nI look forward to taking questions.\n\n1 I use the terms “bank” and “financial institution” interchangeably, but note that the two terms are not synonymous in federal regulation.\n\n2 See Joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, “Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Implementation of Basel III, Minimum Regulatory Capital Ratios, Capital Adequacy, Transition Provisions, and Prompt Corrective Action,” June 12, 2012, at 32.\n\n3 See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. § 5365(a)(1).\n\n4 See 12 U.S.C. § 5365(i).\n\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Press Release, October 23, 2014.\n\n6 Daniel Tarullo, “Stress Testing after Five Years,” Remarks at the Federal Reserve Third Annual Stress Test Modeling Symposium, Boston, Massachusetts, June 25, 2014.\n\n7 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 2014: Assessment Framework and Results, March 2014, at 7-8.\n\n8 See 12 C.F.R. §§ 225.8(c)(2) and (e)(2)(iv).\n\n9 See Citigroup, Inc., “Citi Statement on 2014 CCAR Results,” March 26, 2014.\n\n10 See U.S. Department of Justice, “ BNP Paribas Agrees To Plead Guilty To Conspiring To Process Transactions Through The U.S. Financial System For Sudanese, Iranian, And Cuban Entities Subject To U.S. Economic Sanctions ,” June 30, 2014 .\n\n11 See William Dudley, “Ending Too Big to Fail,” Remarks at the Global Economic Policy Forum, New York City, November 7, 2013; William Dudley, “Enhancing Financial Stability by Improving Culture in the Financial Services Industry,” Remarks at the Workshop on Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York City, October 20, 2014.\n\n12 Scott G.

    "text": "First, let me  thank Governor Carney, the Lord Chief Justice, and Dame Colette for including  me in today’s discussion.  It is an honor  to be here.  As always, what I have to  say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market  Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nI also want to  thank the Banking Standards Board for its important work on improving standards  of conduct in financial services.  The  effects of this work will, I think, be felt throughout the industry, not just  in the City of London.\n\nWe learned from  the LIBOR and FX scandals that poor conduct can proliferate quickly throughout  the global marketplace.  That’s because  short-term thinking—maxing out this year’s compensation bonus or this quarter’s  accounting profits—is a catalyst for poor conduct.  In contrast, good conduct may take longer to  catch on.  Good conduct depends on a  longer-term frame of reference.  It is  building a viable career that one can be proud of, and, at the firm level,  building franchise value and reputation that takes decades to accomplish.  In both cases, though, the same enabling  mechanism is at work: culture.\n\nCulture—within a  firm or across an industry—is not determined primarily by rules or laws, though  certainly rules and laws can amplify good or bad attributes.  Culture comprises, instead, what people  observe and do, resulting in accepted and mostly unspoken norms.  Mostly, people look for what succeeds and  what does not, and they try to align themselves with the former.\n\nIf we want to  improve culture and conduct, we need to start by being realists about human  behavior.  At the New York Fed’s culture  conference last October, Dame Minouche Shafik observed pragmatically that an  end to all misconduct is not the goal of reform.  There will always be a few bad apples.  Rather, the goals should be far fewer  instances of misconduct and far less scope, magnitude and duration when such  misconduct inevitably occurs.\n\nI submit that  the best way to keep problems small is to encourage a culture that spots issues  and raises concerns early.  In my view,  the most dangerous type of culture in finance occurs when people see something  wrong but do not say something.\n\nI think back to  the chat room transcripts from the LIBOR and FX scandals.  The way traders communicated so openly about  their manipulation of markets makes it hard to imagine that others in their  firms did not know what was happening.   So, why didn’t those people say something?\n\nThere are  understandable, human tendencies that can cause each of us to avoid rocking the  boat.  People want to be team players. 2 Those behavioral traits can be amplified  through a firm’s culture, which can weigh on one’s willingness to do the right  thing.  This is, unfortunately, what  seems to have occurred at Wells Fargo, one of the largest retail banks in the  United States.  Whether to obtain a bonus  or simply to keep a job, employees felt they had to keep quiet and meet sales  targets despite the cost to customers. 3\n\nSo, how do you  change a culture where silence leads to misconduct?  I will offer two ideas that might help and  one idea that will not.\n\nHere is what  will not work: Merely telling your employees to speak up.  Cultures do not change simply by  exhortation.  Eloquent speeches, a  well-phrased value statement, and an annual requirement to acknowledge the code  of conduct are just not sufficient.\n\nThat’s the easy  one.  The two ideas that might work are  harder.\n\nFirst, managers  have to lead by example.  Senior  executives must be seen within the firm to expect and respect challenges, and  in turn must challenge ideas themselves.   And, they have to explain difficult decisions to their employees—sharing  not only the news of what they have done, but why.  More important, mid-level managers have to do  the same.  Of course, mid-level managers  will not generally behave that way unless they see their senior leadership  setting the example.\n\nSecond, if your  organization values people when they raise their hand, your incentives have to  reflect that.  Employees who speak up  should be recognized.  The courage it  takes to speak up, despite the perceived costs, should be counted as a very  positive factor in evaluations.  And,  where raising one’s hand has saved the firm’s money and reputation by avoiding  or keeping a problem small, that action should be rewarded.\n\nIt’s only  natural for an economist like me to consider the issue of unintended  consequences.  One that comes to mind is  creating a culture of distrust and suspicion, where everyone looking over his  or her shoulder.  That would be  unfortunate and costly.  But, I think it  is more likely that a different culture will result. Instead, talented and  conscientious people will be happy to remain at a firm or in the industry  because their personal and professional values are well aligned.  Such employees will feel relief that they can  speak up without fear of reprisal, and they can enjoy a clear conscience for  having done the right thing.  There is significant  value in being able to sleep well at night.\n\nMoreover, being  receptive to diverse and dissenting views will likely yield better results. It  is in the industry’s self-interest to deter silence, not only because money  will be saved on fines not incurred for misconduct, but also because better  ideas will be brought to the table.  I  believe that business performance will benefit from having a culture in which  people feel empowered to speak up.\n\nLet me give you  a few examples from my own experience at the New York Fed.\n\nI want employees  to speak up.  That’s why, at the start of  my tenure as president, I made it clear that I wanted the “best idea to win,”  regardless of where it originated or whether it contradicted something that I thought.  In some instances, that will require people  to admit mistakes.  In that regard, I  have to set the example that we all make mistakes, and that recognizing and  addressing them head on—and, importantly, learning from them—is the best  approach.\n\nA few years ago  we created a new group at the New York Fed called Integrated Policy  Analysis.  Its purpose was to consolidate  teams from many parts of the organization to develop a more integrated view of  the economic and financial environment to help inform our policy  responsibilities.  I was a strong  advocate for the idea.  But, after two  years of effort, it became clear to me and others that it was not working as  well as we had hoped.  There were a lot  of reasons for that, and in the end we dissolved the group and reassigned the  work and staff.  I let our employees know  that I took a calculated risk and it didn’t work out.  By doing this, I aimed to show that when  things do not go as planned, the best approach is to address it, not to be  silent.  I hope that, when our people are  confronted with disappointing results in their work, they will do the same.\n\nI mentioned  earlier that we also need to reform incentives in order to encourage people to  speak up.  This is hard.  I’ll share with you some of the change we  have made at the New York Fed, recognizing that we do not have a monopoly on  good ideas, nor can we claim to have a perfect culture.\n\nNone of these  ideas is a panacea.  And, I know that we  have not yet achieved our goal: a culture in which employees perceive that, by  raising their hands and challenging what may be an orthodoxy or conventional  wisdom, they are contributing to the mission of the New York Fed.  I hope, however, that with the right  incentives and good leadership models, we can move closer to that ideal state:  an organization characterized by fresh ideas and open dialogue.\n\nAt conferences  like these, we tend to focus on the cost of misconduct.  But, getting rid of scandals should not be  the sole reason for changing culture. 4 The public expects more from the financial  sector than a lack of another financial crisis or scandal.  The industry would do well to listen to  Baroness Onora O’Neill: Think about your purpose. 5 What are you for?  Surely, no one would answer that question by  saying, “We’re for a lack of misconduct.”\n\nRather, the  financial services industry should support a well-functioning, growing economy,  reflecting the interests of all its stakeholders.  Banking in particular should provide critical  intermediation services—the economic infrastructure that allows businesses to  grow, families to save and invest, and standards of living to improve over  generations for as broad a cross section of people as possible.  When society prospers, the financial services  industry prospers, too.  Creating a  culture that encourages and rewards diversity of thought, perspective, and  experience is one means by which the industry can both do good and do well at  the same time.\n\nThank you for  your kind attention.",

    "text": "Thank you for inviting me to speak here today.  It always is a special pleasure to address my fellow economists.  In my remarks today, I am going to focus on the economic outlook and the implications of that outlook for monetary policy.\n\nMy views on the economy have not changed much since last fall.  Although economic growth stalled in the first quarter, some slowing was expected and unseasonably harsh winter weather appears to have done the rest.  The fundamental supports for a strengthening economy remain in place, and recent data seem to confirm that forecast.  On the price front, I expect inflation to drift higher over the remainder of the year as the effects of some temporary factors that have been holding inflation down dissipate and the labor market continues to tighten.\n\nIf my forecast is correct, as growth strengthens and inflation drifts higher, the focus will turn to monetary policy.  In particular, what will be the timing of lift-off?  And when lift-off occurs, how quickly will the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raise rates and to what level?\n\nAlso, with an exceptionally large balance sheet there will be considerable attention on the methods that the FOMC will likely use in order to exert control over the level of short-term rates.  I can’t tell you yet how we will do it, but I am fully confident that we have the necessary tools to control the level of short-term rates and the credit creation process, and I will share with you some of my own thoughts on the subject.  As always, what I have to say here today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTurning first to economic activity, the trajectory of economic growth continues to disappoint.  Since the downturn ended in mid-2009, real GDP growth has averaged only 2.2 percent per year despite a very accommodative monetary policy.  This performance reflects three major factors—the significant headwinds resulting from the bursting of the housing bubble, the shift of fiscal policy from expansion toward restraint, especially in 2012 and 2013, and a series of shocks from abroad—most notably the European crisis.\n\nThe good news is that all three of these factors have abated.  With respect to the headwinds resulting from the financial crisis, they are gradually becoming less severe.  In particular, the sharp decline in household wealth due to the decline in housing prices and the weakness in equity prices has been largely reversed.  As housing prices have climbed, the number of homes moving into the foreclosure process and the number of households with mortgages underwater have fallen sharply.  Moreover, households have deleveraged their balance sheets.  Debt levels have declined and lower interest rates have cut financing costs.  As a result, the financial obligation ratio, which measures the debt servicing cost of households, has declined from a peak of 18.1 percent of disposable income in the fourth quarter of 2007 to 15.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013.  This is a level not seen since the early 1980s.\n\nOn the fiscal side, the amount of restraint has diminished sharply.  For 2014, the projected drag is about ½ percent of GDP, roughly half the level of 2013.  Moreover, much of this restraint was frontloaded into the beginning of the year, with the cessation of long-term unemployment compensation, the expiration of the bonus depreciation provisions and the higher tax rates that applied to final tax settlements for the 2013 tax year.  For the remainder of this year and next, the degree of fiscal restraint should be very modest.\n\nIn terms of the outlook abroad, the circumstances are more mixed.  Although Europe is doing better, Japan is digesting the large hike in consumption taxes that was implemented on April 1, Chinese growth is slowing and some other emerging market economies are coping with structural imbalances that are anticipated to lead to slower growth this year.  One obvious wildcard is the situation in Ukraine and relations with Russia.  How this will evolve is difficult to predict.  The big risk is that conditions deteriorate and the ultimate outcome is a disruption to energy supplies from Russia.  When all these cross-currents are considered, the impetus to growth from abroad appears little changed from last year.\n\nNow a reasonable question would be: If the outlook is improving, then how does one explain the sharp slowdown in growth in the first quarter?  My own view is that the principal factors behind the slowdown were transitory so we should not be overly concerned at this point.  Some slowing in the first quarter was nearly inevitable.  Foreign trade and inventories provided unsustainably large contributions to growth over the second half of last year and payback for those large gains was expected in the first quarter of this year.  Also, the expiration of extended unemployment compensation benefits and bonus depreciation at the end of the year was likely to take some of the starch out of consumer spending and business fixed investment.  Beyond these anticipated factors, we had unusually harsh winter weather, which likely depressed housing activity, manufacturing production and some aspects of household spending such as motor vehicle purchases.\n\nWith the fundamentals of the economy improving and fiscal drag abating, I expect the economy to get back on to a roughly 3 percent growth trajectory over the remainder of this year, with some further strengthening likely in 2015.  But, there remains considerable uncertainty about that forecast and, given the persistent over-optimism about the growth outlook by Federal Reserve officials and others in recent years, we shouldn’t count our chickens before they hatch.\n\nBusiness fixed investment and housing are two key areas where activity has been disappointing.  They need to kick in more forcefully for the economy to grow at an above trend rate for a sustained period.\n\nWith respect to capital spending, the recent trajectory has been very soft relative to the apparent strong underlying fundamentals.  Corporate cash flows have been strong, profit margins are high, balance sheets are healthy and financing generally appears readily available at low interest rates.  Moreover, the absolute level of capital outlays is low so that the capital stock is expanding only slowly.  Despite these positive fundamentals, real business spending on equipment and software has risen only 3.2 percent over the past four quarters and contracted in the first quarter.   This is a bit of a puzzle to me.  But, I expect it to be resolved by a pickup in capital spending.  Recent trends in durable goods orders and conversations I have had with businesses in my district suggest that such a pickup may finally be occurring.\n\nOn the housing side, residential investment has stalled out over the past few quarters.  Although I expected some slowing due to the rise in mortgage rates in the middle of 2013, the extent of the slowdown has surprised me given that the recent pace of housing starts—roughly  1 million per year—is far below what is consistent with the economy’s underlying demographic trends.\n\nI think housing has been weaker than anticipated because several significant headwinds persist for this sector.  First, mortgage credit is still not readily available to households with lower credit scores.  Second, some people are coping with higher student loan debt burdens that have delayed their entry into the housing market as first-time homebuyers.  This, in turn, makes it more difficult for existing homeowners to sell and trade-up.  Third, there may be some ongoing difficulties increasing housing supply.  The housing downturn was very deep and protracted.  It takes time to shift resources back into this area.  Also, in some markets house prices still appear to be below the cost of building a new home.  Thus, in those markets, it remains uneconomic to undertake new home construction.  Although I expect that the housing recovery will resume, the pace will likely be slow, especially relative to past economic recoveries.\n\nWith respect to the outlook for prices, I think that inflation will drift upwards over the next year, getting closer to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective for the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator.  Some of the factors holding down inflation—such as the cut in Medicare reimbursement rates last April—were one-offs and are now dropping out of the year-over-year figures.  In some other areas, such as owners’ equivalent rent, price pressures look likely to firm somewhat.\n\nThat said, I see little prospect of inflation climbing sharply over the next year or two.  There still are considerable margins of excess capacity available in the economy—especially in the labor market—that should moderate price pressures.  Most notably, the trend of labor compensation is running at only about a 2 percent annualized pace.  This is far below the roughly 3½ percent pace that would be consistent with trend productivity growth of 1 to 1½ percent and the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective.\n\nRecently, some economists have argued that the amount of slack in the labor market may be smaller than suggested by the official unemployment rate of 6.3 percent.  They focus on the level of short-term unemployment—those workers unemployed for less than 27 weeks—which has returned close to its average long-term level—and argue that it is the short-term unemployed that are critical in driving compensation trends.\n\nMy own reading of this research suggests that one should not jump to such a conclusion.  Instead, I conclude:\n\nTo sum up, this isn’t likely to be a case of black (only total unemployment matters) or white (only short-term unemployment matters) with respect to compensation cost trends.  I suspect that the degree of attachment falls on average as one is unemployed for longer periods of time.  But, I don’t believe that this pattern of attachment is stable.  It is affected by the nature of the business cycle and how and why people have become long-term unemployed.\n\nBefore I turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy, let me leave you with a final thought on inflation and our inflation objective.  I think there is some confusion as to whether the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective is a ceiling or not.  My own view is that 2 percent is definitely not a ceiling.  Once we reach 2 percent, I would expect that we would spend as much time slightly above 2 percent as below it, recognizing that we will hardly ever be exactly at 2 percent because of the inherent volatility in prices.  If inflation were to drift above 2 percent, all else equal, then we would tend to resist such a rise.  But, if inflation were slightly above 2 percent even as unemployment remained far above levels consistent with maximum employment, then the unemployment consideration would dominate because we would be further from the unemployment objective than we are from the inflation objective.  This should not surprise anyone.  This is what our “balanced approach” implies.\n\nGiven my outlook for above-trend growth and inflation gradually drifting higher, the inevitable question is what this means for the monetary policy outlook.  Over the near-term, if circumstances evolve relatively close to my forecast, I would continue to favor gradually reducing the pace of asset purchases by staying on the same glide path of a $10 billion reduction in the monthly purchase pace following each FOMC meeting.\n\nAssuming asset purchases end sometime this fall, the focus will shift to the timing of lift-off, the pace of tightening once lift-off occurs and where short-term rates are ultimately headed over the longer-term.  The issue of how the Fed will manage its balance sheet will also be relevant, as well as how monetary policy will be conducted during a period when the amount of excess reserves in the banking system is unusually large.  I will give you some of my early thinking on each of these issues in the remainder of my remarks.\n\nTurning first to the timing of lift-off, how the outlook evolves matters.  We currently anticipate that a considerable period of time will elapse between the end of asset purchases and lift-off, but precisely how long is difficult to say given the inherent uncertainties surrounding the outlook.  If the economy is stronger than expected, causing the excess slack in the labor market to be absorbed sooner and inflation to rise more quickly than forecasted, then lift-off is likely to be pulled forward in time.  If, instead, economic growth disappoints, inflation stays unusually low and the labor market continues to exhibit evidence of considerable excess slack, then lift-off will likely be pushed back in time. 1\n\nWith respect to the trajectory of rates after lift-off, this also is highly dependent on how the economy evolves.  My current thinking is that the pace of tightening will probably be relatively slow.  This depends, however, in large part, not only on the economy’s performance, but also on how financial conditions respond to tightening.  After all, monetary policy works through financial conditions to affect aggregate demand and supply.  If the response of financial conditions to tightening is very mild—say similar to how the bond and equity markets have responded to the tapering of asset purchases since last December—this might encourage a somewhat faster pace.  In contrast, if bond yields were to move sharply higher, as was the case last spring, then a more cautious approach might be warranted.\n\nIn terms of the level of rates over the longer-term, I would expect them to be lower than historical averages for three reasons.  First, economic headwinds seem likely to persist for several more years.  While the wealth loss following the financial crisis has largely been reversed, the Great Recession has scarred households and businesses­—this is likely to lead to greater precautionary saving and less investment for a long time.  Also, as noted earlier, headwinds in the housing area seem likely to dissipate only slowly.\n\nSecond, slower growth of the labor force due to the aging of the population and moderate productivity growth imply a lower potential real GDP growth rate as compared to the 1990s and 2000s.  Because the level of real equilibrium interest rates appears to be positively related to potential real GDP growth, this slower trend implies lower real equilibrium interest rates even after all the current headwinds fully dissipate.\n\nThird, changes in bank regulation may also imply a somewhat lower long-term equilibrium rate.  Consider that, all else equal, higher capital requirements for banks imply somewhat wider intermediation margins.  While higher capital requirements are essential in order to make the financial system more robust, this is likely to push down the long-term equilibrium federal funds rate somewhat.\n\nPutting all these factors together, I expect that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with 2 percent PCE inflation over the long run is likely to be well below the 4¼ percent average level that has applied historically when inflation was around 2 percent.  Precisely how much lower is difficult to say at this point in time.\n\nThe fact that the equilibrium real federal funds rate is likely to be lower for a long time underscores the need for caution in applying the benchmark Taylor Rule as a guide to the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  As typically applied, the Taylor Rule assumes an equilibrium real rate of interest of 2 percent.  This seems much too high in the current economic environment in which headwinds persist, and somewhat too high even when these headwinds fully dissipate.\n\nThe next question I wish to consider is how the Fed will likely manage its balance sheet as the taper process is completed and lift-off eventually occurs.  Unlike previous normalizations of monetary policy, which only involved the level of short-term rates, this prospective tightening cycle also involves considerations with respect to the size and composition of our balance sheet.  The Committee stated in its June 2011 exit principles that changes in short-term rates will be the primary means for adjusting monetary policy post-liftoff, not discretionary shifts in the balance sheet.  In other words, the balance sheet will be set on automatic pilot.  I believe this approach still very much applies.\n\nHowever, the language in the June 2011 exit principles concerning agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) sales no longer applies.  As Chairman Bernanke noted in the press conference following the June 2013 FOMC meeting: “While participants continue to think that in the long run the Federal Reserve’s portfolio should consist predominantly of Treasury securities, a strong majority now expects that the Committee will not sell agency mortgage-backed securities during the process of normalizing monetary policy.”  The balance sheet would shrink post-lift-off as Treasury securities matured and mortgages were prepaid, but outright agency MBS sales are no longer contemplated during the process of monetary policy normalization.\n\nAlso, I think that the language in the June 2011 exit principles with respect to reinvestment needs to be revisited.  The exit principles state: “To begin the process of policy normalization, the Committee will likely first cease reinvesting some or all payments of principal on the securities holdings in the SOMA.”  There are two considerations that suggest to me that ending the reinvestments prior to lift-off may not be the best strategy.  First, such a decision might complicate our communications regarding the process of normalization.  Ending reinvestments as an initial step risks inadvertently bringing forward any tightening of financial conditions as this might foreshadow the impending lift-off date for rates in a manner inconsistent with the Committee’s intention.\n\nSecond, when conditions permit, it would be desirable to get off the zero lower bound in order to regain some monetary policy flexibility.  This goal would argue for lift-off occurring first followed by the end of reinvestment, rather than vice versa.  Delaying the end of reinvestment puts the emphasis where it needs to be—getting off the zero lower bound for interest rates.  In my opinion, this is far more important than the consequences of the balance sheet being a little larger for a little longer.\n\nWith respect to the issue of how the FOMC will control money market rates with an enlarged balance sheet, the Federal Reserve already has the necessary tool—the ability to pay interest on excess reserves.  However, the degree of control could be further buttressed.  Enhancing confidence in the Fed’s ability to control money market rates, and hence, inflation, might also help keep inflation expectations well anchored.\n\nOne method the Fed has been testing is an overnight, fixed rate, reverse repo (RRP) facility.  The Federal Reserve posts a fixed interest rate and accepts cash from counterparties, which include some banks, dealers, money market funds, and government sponsored enterprises, on an overnight basis in return for a security.  The repo facility is “reverse” because the direction in which the funds and securities move—participants are lending funds to the Fed rather than vice versa.  Users of the facility are making the economic equivalent of an overnight collateralized loan of cash to the Federal Reserve.\n\nIf implemented, the facility could be set up as “full allotment,” which means that there is no cap on the amount of funds accepted from any of its counterparties at the posted overnight interest rate.  Or, caps could be imposed on either an aggregate or per counterparty basis in order to limit total usage.\n\nThe amount of funds invested in the facility is likely to be sensitive to the spread between the posted interest rate and comparable money market rates and the level of caps placed on usage.  The narrower the spread to comparable money market rates, the greater the participation is likely to be.  In our ongoing tests with this facility, the New York Desk has varied the RRP rate from 1 to 5 basis points and the cap on usage by counterparty has gradually been increased to its current level of $10 billion.  As expected, narrower spreads to comparable money market rates and larger caps have led to greater usage.\n\nAlthough the testing process is still ongoing, early results suggest that the overnight RRP facility will set a floor under money market rates.  Treasury repo rates have generally traded no more than a basis point or two below the overnight RRP rate. 2 Thus, the early evidence suggests that this facility would help strengthen our control over money market rates.\n\nTwo issues with the overnight reverse repo rate warrant careful consideration.  The first is how big a footprint the facility should have in terms of volume.  To the extent that the overnight RRP rate were set very close or equal to the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER) without caps, then this might result in a large amount of disintermediation out of banks through money market funds and other financial intermediaries into the facility.  This could encourage further development of the shadow banking system.  If this were deemed undesirable, this would argue for a wider spread between the overnight RRP and the IOER in order to reduce the volume of flows into the facility.\n\nThe second issue is the facility’s potential impact on financial stability.  In particular, would such a facility make financial instability less likely?  And, when financial stress did occur, would such a facility amplify or dampen financial strains?\n\nOn the first point, it seems that such a facility would tend to make financial instability less likely.  The overnight RRP facility allows us to make a short-term safe asset more widely available to a broad range of financial market participants.  The provision of short-term safe assets by the official sector might crowd out the private creation of runnable money-like liquid assets.  This might enhance financial stability by reducing the likelihood of a financial crisis.\n\nHowever, if a financial crisis were to occur, the existence of a full allotment, overnight, RRP facility might exacerbate instability by encouraging runs out of more risky assets into the facility.  That is because the supply of a full allotment facility would be completely elastic at the given fixed rate.  Money market mutual funds and other providers of short-term financing could rapidly shift funds into the facility away from assets such as commercial paper that support the private sector.  In contrast, in the current regime, when financial crises lead to flows into less risky assets, their interest rates fall, limiting the appetite for these less risky assets.  Consequently, under a full allotment setup, runs could be larger and these runs could exacerbate the fall in the prices of riskier assets.  Note that the risk here is how quickly financial flows could reverse from one day to the next, not the average level of take-up of the facility over time.\n\nFortunately, this risk seems relatively easy to address.  One could design the facility to prevent rapid inflows during times of financial stress.  This could be done by building in circuit breakers such as caps on overall usage of the facility.  The circuit breakers would not affect the amount of take-up during normal times or prevent take-up from rising at moderate rates.  Instead, they would be in place to limit the pace and magnitude of inflows during times of stress.\n\nA second option to improve the Fed’s control over short-term rates is to drain reserves by offering banks term deposit accounts in which to invest funds for longer terms than overnight.  There are two issues that might make this option somewhat less attractive.  First, to strengthen monetary policy control significantly through this course, it might be necessary to drain most of the $3 trillion of reserves.  This could be done of course with effort, but is the effort worth it?\n\nSecond, the Fed would undoubtedly have to “pay up” to induce banks to hold term deposit accounts relative to keeping their monies in reserves at the excess reserves interest rate.  This would likely result in higher Fed interest expenses relative to relying on an overnight RRP facility to set a floor on money market rates.\n\nThe choices here are important and I expect that considerable testing, analysis and discussion will be necessary to reach firm conclusions about the appropriate course.  My goal would be to clarify our intentions later this year, long before we begin to contemplate raising short-term rates.\n\nI also think that the choices are about how to conduct monetary policy during the transitional phase, not about the long-term monetary policy framework.  Longer term, the issue will be whether to return to the type of corridor system that was in place prior to the crisis or to instead to stay with the type of floor system that will likely be the type of regime that is in place as the balance sheet gradually normalizes.  I expect that the choices made over the near-term can be implemented in a way so as not to forestall either a corridor or a floor system over the longer term.  The experience we gain with operating monetary policy effectively with a very large balance sheet will undoubtedly inform that choice.\n\nBut, that topic is putting the cart far before the horse.  First, we need an economy that is strong enough to more fully utilize the nation’s labor resources and to begin to push inflation back towards the Federal Reserve’s long-term objective.  Only then can the monetary policy normalization process proceed.  Although we are making progress towards our goals, we still have a considerable way to go.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 It is worth noting that the views of market participants as expressed in the Eurodollar futures market and those of FOMC participants as expressed in the March Summary of Economic Projections seem consistent with one another and indicate an anticipated lift-off sometime near the middle of next year.\n\n2 The floor has been more solid since the testing was extended in January for a full year. In part, this is likely because the extension allowed market participants to plan ahead knowing that they could rely on the facility. Raising the caps has also been a factor in solidifying the floor.",

    "text": "It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here. Today I will focus on two related aspects of the regulatory reform agenda that are complex and global in nature.\n\nFirst, I will discuss the efforts underway to reform the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. This includes creating strong incentives to standardize trades and clear those trades through central counterparties (CCPs) and improving disclosure and transparency through mandatory reporting of all OTC derivative trades to trade repositories.\n\nSecond, I will discuss the global program to establish tougher standards for the regulation and oversight of financial market infrastructures (FMI)—focusing particularly on CCPs for over-the-counter derivatives.\n\nOver the past two years, two important standard setting bodies—the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have been developing a new package of standards called, Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures . The aim is to strengthen the resiliency and robustness of FMIs that are systemically important and are the backbone of the global financial system. I anticipate that the approval process will be completed and the finalized Principles document will be issued and broadly distributed sometime next month.\n\nAs always, what I have to say here reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. Also, I speak for myself rather than for CPSS and IOSCO.\n\nTurning to my first topic, the financial crisis exposed many shortcomings with respect to the OTC derivatives market. For example, the use of OTC derivatives referencing private-label mortgage-backed securities that held poor quality subprime and alt-A mortgages multiplied the amount of gains and losses in the financial system. There were not only the losses on the actual mortgages, but also on the CDS that were linked to these mortgages through the OTC derivatives market. This increased the stress on the system when the referenced subprime and alt-A mortgages began to perform poorly.\n\nMoreover, the structural characteristics of the over-the-counter derivatives market itself amplified the shocks created by the housing bust in several ways. First, the collateral calls generated by sharp movements in the mark-to-market value of the OTC derivative trades drained liquidity buffers and provoked the fire sales of assets. These fire sales increased volatility and provoked still greater margin calls. This dynamic was one reason why the market prices of these assets overshot to the downside—that is they fell more than needed simply to reflect the increase in expected credit losses. In other words, the illiquidity risk premiums embedded into the prices of these assets became very large.\n\nSecond, the bilateral nature of the OTC derivatives market—between the two parties to the contract—be it dealer and customer or dealer and dealer—created its own set of difficulties. When counterparties became concerned about the health of a particular dealer, they often moved their trades—via novation—to other dealers. They did this to protect themselves should the dealer subsequently fail. But this process was difficult to carry out quickly and in size. The cumbersome nature of the process disturbed market liquidity and function. It also tended to drain off the liquidity from the troubled dealers because these dealers often used the counterparty cash collateral to fund their own operations. When customers moved their business, the collateral balances departed with them and this worsened the funding crunch on the troubled dealers.\n\nThird, when a large counterparty, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy, it could no longer meet its obligations. The claims of Lehman’s customers, including those open OTC derivatives positions in which Lehman owed them money, were frozen. The lack of adequate segregation of the customers’ assets from the Lehman estate and the inability to move the outstanding obligations to other dealers—which we refer to as the lack of portability—created large problems for Lehman’s counterparties. Often Lehman’s clients were in the position that one side of a trade executed with Lehman was frozen, but the offsetting side remained open and exposed to volatile financial markets. This asymmetry contributed to the sharp increase in market volatility, the dramatic reduction in market liquidity, and the impairment in market function following the Lehman failure. Fear that this could happen again if another firm failed, encouraged flight from other dealers perceived by market participants to be relatively weak that might have large potential exposures.\n\nOf course, as if this were not bad enough, the opaqueness of the OTC derivatives market made the situation much worse. No one had a clear insight into the financial health of their counterparties. Although each market participant could calculate its bilateral exposures to a particular dealer and the particular dealer could understand its own exposure to each of its own counterparties, this didn’t answer the broader question: how exposed were the clients and dealers to others in the financial system through their derivatives trades and other open positions? Because there was no easy way to know who was in difficulty or not, the incentives were all on the side of assuming the worse—closing out open trades, hoarding liquidity, and retreating to the sidelines. The crisis had made it crystal clear that the regulatory regime had not kept pace with the rapid growth of the global OTC derivatives market.\n\nIn assessing the shortcomings of the OTC derivatives market after the crisis, a global consensus has been reached. Although I will be over-simplifying in the interest of time, I view the following aspects of reform as the most important. First, there have to be strong incentives in the system—such as capital requirements on banks and securities dealers—to provide an impetus for dealers to standardize OTC derivatives trades whenever practical. The goal is fewer bespoke trades and more standardized trades. Second, the G20 leaders agreed that all standardized OTC derivative trades should be mandatorily cleared through CCPs by the end of 2012. Third, records for all OTC derivative trades—including bilateral bespoke trades—must be reported to trade repositories. The data as part of this reporting requirement would include key trade attributes and a legal entity identifier so that aggregate exposures could be readily calculated. Fourth, the two standard-setting bodies mentioned earlier—CPSS and IOSCO—would strengthen and broaden the principles for financial market infrastructures. Fifth, these Principles would be adopted globally, strengthening the resilience of the financial system.\n\nThe logic behind these five elements of reform goes like this:\n\nStandardizing trades improves transparency and price discovery. This mitigates the opaqueness that helped to generate the illiquidity and loss of market function evident during the crisis.\n\nRequiring that such trades be cleared through CCPs is designed to reduce the aggregate amount of risk in the system. That is because the gross exposures can be netted down when all the dealers clear through one common central clearing party. In a CCP framework, the bilateral exposures of each dealer to one another are replaced by a single set of claims to and from the CCP. The idea is that because some dealers are likely to be long some trades to one dealer and short some trades to other dealers, passing both sets of trades through a single CCP can reduce the aggregate amount of risk in the system. This would occur as the long trades are netted out against the short trades, leaving only the remaining smaller net exposure of the dealer to the CCP.\n\nInserting a CCP in between two counterparties to a trade can also help reduce the \"run risk\" faced by a potentially troubled dealer. As we saw during the crisis, market participants often abruptly pull their trades away from a dealer that they perceive to be weak, which in turn can have the self-fulfilling effect of magnifying market or liquidity pressures on the dealer. If, however, trades with the dealer are cleared through a CCP, direct exposures to the dealer are eliminated and replaced by exposures to the CCP itself. This risk shifting can reduce the incentives to suddenly halt trading with a dealer, for example, due to uncertainty about the dealer’s financial condition or future prospects.\n\nMandatory reporting of trades to trade repositories is designed to ensure that the details of each contract are preserved and available to the regulatory authorities.\n\nFinally, the fact that CCPs will be central to the system dramatically increases their importance. In essence, global CCPs will be systemically important. Thus, for the system to be safer it is not sufficient to ensure that trades are standardized and that they are mandated to be cleared through CCPs, but also it is necessary that CCPs be “bullet proof.” They have to have the ability to perform and meet their obligations regardless of the degree of stress in the financial system and even if one or more of their participants were to fail in a disorderly manner. Hence, there is a compelling need for tougher principles that are broadly enforced.\n\nIn addition, to ensure that this all works as well in practice as in theory, the Financial Stability Board, CPSS and IOSCO, and other regulatory authorities have emphasized the importance of four safeguards to ensure that mandatory, standardized clearing through CCPs will make the financial system more robust and resilient.\n\nThe first safeguard is that the oversight of global CCPs needs to be cooperative—involving the securities regulators and central banks in the country in which the CCP operates (the home country) and the countries for which the CCP may be systemically important. Global CCPs are likely to be established—some are already up and running—that will clear different types of OTC derivatives such as interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, or commodity-based swaps that are traded around the world, both solely within one country or on a cross-border basis.\n\nMany regulators have important stakes in ensuring that a global CCP can meet its obligations. In addition to regulators of the country in which the CCP is headquartered, these include foreign regulators. These regulators may be interested parties for many reasons. For example, their currencies may be used in settling the obligations of the CCP, they may have counterparties to the CCP that are headquartered or do significant amounts of business in their country, or they may have FMIs that are linked to the CCP.\n\nI want to emphasize that effective cooperative oversight is essential. Otherwise, the risk is that the system will become overly fragmented, with a proliferation of national CCPs. In this case, many of the risk-reducing benefits from CCPs could be lost or severely attenuated. That is because fewer offsetting positions would likely be cleared through any particular CCP and this would reduce the scope for reducing large gross exposures into much smaller net positions.\n\nThe second safeguard is to ensure fair, open and safe access to global FMIs around the world.  It is important, for example, that global CCPs have rules that are not exclusionary or that unnecessarily entrench the position of whatever dealer, firm, or FMI is currently dominant in the market.\n\nThe third safeguard is to establish rules to ensure that, if a major market participant were to fail, a CCP can liquefy its collateral quickly so that it can meet its obligations in a timely way. But this also needs to be done in a way that would not disrupt financial markets or the CCP’s participants. As I will discuss shortly, although there may be a potential role for central banks here, CCPs, at a minimum, must have their own liquidity resources as the first line of defense.\n\nFourth, there needs to be a viable resolution regime for CCPs. This is needed to ensure that the CCP either can be recapitalized and recover or, if necessary, wound down in an orderly way without disrupting the provision of essential market services. Also, a resolution regime is necessary to ensure that a central bank that might lend to a CCP in extremis will be repaid.\n\nTo help ensure that these safeguards are met, a major part of the reform effort is to establish a strong set of principles for financial market infrastructures. These principles must embody the four safeguards and ensure that the infrastructure can withstand any stresses that could plausibly occur.\n\nThe process of developing such a set of principles began about two years ago and is now nearing completion.\n\nSo why the new principles and what do they embody? During the crisis, financial market infrastructures performed very well.  In fact, FMIs were actually a source of strength. They enabled market participants to settle obligations when they came due in a timely way. Also, their robustness gave confidence to market participants that they could continue to trade, knowing that the transactions would almost certainly be settled and cleared without difficulty.\n\nDespite this excellent record of performance during a period of unprecedented stress, there still is room for improvement. First, future stresses could be more severe or might come in different forms. This could expose vulnerabilities in FMIs that have, up to now, not been visible. Also, extraordinary interventions in the crisis to backstop market function or rescue key financial intermediaries may have prevented the stress level from reaching the point where FMIs couldn’t perform their functions. Because there can be no assurance that such interventions will necessarily occur in the future, it is important that the stability of the FMI architecture not depend on timely extraordinary interventions.\n\nSecond, under the new regime of central clearing for standardized OTC derivatives trades, the role of FMIs will become even more important in the future. Moreover, the new regime will lead to the development of new types of FMIs. CCPs for OTC derivatives will become widespread—and trade repositories will be established. Principles are needed to underpin these new institutional arrangements.\n\nThird, for FMIs to be resilient they would undoubtedly need to have some ability to access central bank services, including the lender of last resort function. But, if FMIs had access to such services, this would create moral hazard. The best way to address this conundrum is to hold the FMIs to tougher global standards.\n\nFourth, a stronger and better system of FMI governance and oversight can help to ensure that those systems that support a global market are subject to consistent standards regardless of the jurisdiction where they operate. Relying solely on a patchwork of differing national standards in a global world would not work well. It would encourage business to migrate to the lowest standard. Without establishing a global floor, there would otherwise be a “race for the bottom.”\n\nThese are the major reasons why CPSS and IOSCO took on the task of strengthening and broadening the standards for FMIs.\n\nThere are two major goals of this effort. The first goal is to strengthen the current standards by: 1) raising the bar for existing standards such as for governance, credit risk, liquidity risk, collateral and margin requirements; 2) including requirements for new areas such as segregation and portability, general business risk, links, tiering and disclosure; and 3) extending coverage to include trade repositories.\n\nAs proposed in the consultation document, the Principles will significantly strengthen existing requirements for an FMI’s governance and financial resources. One way the Principles do this is by requiring FMIs to take a more comprehensive and proactive view of the roles they play, the risks they face, and their potential to support the stability of the broader financial system. In particular, as markets become even more interconnected, FMIs must approach their governance and risk management more holistically, in a manner consistent with their growing importance to the global markets and the stakeholders that they serve.\n\nRegarding an FMI’s financial standards, it is important that they be prepared to handle even greater potential disruptions and more extreme market conditions. For example, while an FMI must cover its largest current credit exposure to any single participant under pre-crisis standards, the Principles would require an FMI to collateralize its current credit exposures to all of its participants. Furthermore, for CCPs that face potential future credit exposures from the open contracts that they guarantee, the Principles impose rigorous stress testing and strengthened margin and default fund requirements. These requirements are to guard against a wide range of possible stress scenarios in extreme but plausible market conditions.\n\nThe Principles also raise the bar for an FMI’s management of liquidity risk to ensure that systemically important payment obligations can be settled on time. For instance, when sizing its potential liquidity needs in the event of a participant default, an FMI should have sufficient liquid resources to cover not only the shortfall caused by the default of the individual legal entity that settles directly through the FMI, but also the shortfall that could arise from the failure of all affiliates of the direct participant. In addition, FMIs will need to address how potential uncovered liquidity shortfalls or credit losses would be allocated, and how the FMI would replenish any financial resources it uses in a stress event so that it can continue to operate in a safe and sound manner.\n\nThe Principles also introduce a number of new requirements. Some of these address shortcomings that were observed during the crisis. For example, the Principles require CCPs to have segregation and portability arrangements that protect customer positions and collateral. An FMI will also be required to manage the risks it bears from and poses to, not only its participants and their customers, but also to other entities with which it does business such as linked FMIs, settlement banks, custody banks, and liquidity providers. Furthermore, the Principles will require FMIs to establish a dedicated financial cushion that could absorb unanticipated general business losses. This is to ensure that an FMI can continue to provide its critical services. The Principles also require that FMIs have plans for their recapitalization or orderly wind down, if that were to prove to be necessary.\n\nFinally, the coverage of the international standards has been expanded to trade repositories as a new category of FMI, to further complement the G-20 OTC derivatives initiative for mandatory trade reporting. The Principles that address trade repositories focus on their transparency and the disclosure of market data. This reflects the important and unique role they will play in disseminating information both to regulators and to the market more broadly.\n\nThe second major goal is to promote consistent global enforcement of the standards. Toward this end, the Principles unify and harmonize three existing sets of standards— Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems; Recommendations for Securities Settlement Systems; and Recommendations for Central Counterparties .\n\nAs part of this effort, the Principles strengthen the “responsibilities of authorities.” This includes a new framework for cooperation among financial authorities. It calls for central banks, market regulators, and other relevant authorities to cooperate with each other, both domestically and internationally, and to support each other in fulfilling their respective mandates to promote the safety and efficiency of FMIs. This builds upon existing frameworks that have already been used successfully by CPSS and IOSCO for effective cooperation in the oversight of global institutions.  Such cooperation can facilitate more comprehensive oversight, improve efficiency and effectiveness, reduce or eliminate any gaps in regulation, supervision, and oversight, and minimize potential duplication of effort and burden on both the FMIs and the cooperating authorities.\n\nToward the goal of consistent global enforcement, the Principles are considered to be minimum requirements. In contrast, the three old sets of guidance were weaker, being recommendations rather than requirements. As recommendations, they could be ignored. In contrast, as the Principles make clear, countries that are members of CPSS and IOSCO are to apply the principles to “the fullest extent possible.” This means that regulation and legal frameworks are to be adjusted as needed in order to accommodate the standards.\n\nTo ensure that this happens, CPSS and IOSCO are also developing disclosure and assessment regimes. The purpose is to facilitate a consistent set of disclosures by the different FMIs and a consistent set of assessment methodologies that can be used by the relevant international institutions, namely the International Money Fund and the World Bank, and by the relevant national authorities of the FMIs domiciled in their jurisdictions.\n\nWhen the Principles are published next month, CPSS and IOSCO will also issue a disclosure regime proposal and an assessment regime proposal. These will be put forward for a 60-day consultation period to give the market participants, FMIs, and regulators an opportunity to comment.\n\nAlso, once the Principles are rolled out and countries start to implement the legal and regulatory changes necessary to put the Principles into practice, it is anticipated that CPSS and IOSCO will undertake a monitoring effort to see how it is going. The focus will be on evaluating how quickly and broadly the Principles are being embedded in national legal and regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe Principles are important in supporting the G20 strategy of mandatory clearing of standardized OTC derivatives trades and in ensuring that the four safeguards discussed earlier for global CCPs and other FMIs are implemented.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the new Principles lay out the responsibilities of authorities for cooperative oversight. Cooperation can take a variety of forms, including formal arrangements that are organized under memoranda of understandings, specific protocols or other documentation for the exchange of critical information, and informal arrangements for regular and ad hoc communications. Much work is currently underway to establish various forms of effective cooperation, particularly for individual CCPs and trade repositories that are becoming globally important. However, as the work toward meeting the G-20 commitments continues, much more work is needed to design and implement such arrangements for the relevant FMIs.\n\nIn terms of the issue of access, explicit requirements for FMIs are embedded in the Principles. The Principles establish a framework that covers access by direct participants, indirect participants—i.e., those who trade indirectly through a direct participant, and access and links between FMIs.\n\nIn terms of the lender of last resort issue, the Principles strengthen the requirements for FMIs in terms of such aspects of financial strength such as capital and liquidity, and operational and business risk. This implies that enforcement of the Principles should significantly mitigate any moral hazard issue that could arise if an FMI were able to obtain credit from a central bank.\n\nOn resolution, the Principles contain explicit requirements to ensure that all systemically important FMIs have viable recovery plans and, if circumstances ever warrant, could be wound down in an orderly fashion without the disruption of the provision of key services. The Principles’ provisions for an FMI’s recovery and orderly wind down will inform upcoming work by CPSS-IOSCO on the potential role and attributes of official regimes for the resolution of FMIs. This work is underway and should be completed later this year.\n\nI’m pleased to see what has already been accomplished. But let’s be clear, when the Principles are published that won’t be the end. To quote Winston Churchill, it will only be “the end of the beginning”. Thereafter, the resolution, disclosure and assessment frameworks will need to be finalized later this year. The CPSS and IOSCO members will have to adopt the new Principles into their regulatory and legal frameworks, with a target date of year-end. The new Principles will then be put into effect next year, with FMIs expected to observe the new Principles as shortly thereafter as is feasible.   This is obviously an ambitious schedule, but one that is fully consistent with the G20 leaders’ mandate.\n\nFinally, we should recognize that the global financial system is a complex one that is continuously evolving and that we are introducing many significant changes into that system. We have to recognize that there may be trade-offs between some of our objectives, and that the system may evolve in ways that we do not expect.  There  may be unintended consequences. Maybe the major dealers will not standardize as many trades as is desirable or, perhaps, CCPs will develop in too fragmented a manner so that the netting of risk doesn’t occur to the extent potentially feasible.   Or the development of global CCPs could have unanticipated negative consequences for market structure, competition and/or efficiency.\n\nWe must be open-minded about the potential need for mid-course corrections. We will need to ensure that the incentives are right to get the greatest amount of risk reduced in the most efficient manner. Currently, for example, we are evaluating how the changes in terms of the Basel capital and liquidity standards for banks will interact with the changes in the OTC derivatives regime in terms of influencing the incentives for standardizing OTC trades and mandatory clearing through CCPs.  But we shouldn’t kid ourselves—we’ll be off in our forecast. Thus, we must be ready to make adjustments as this process unfolds and we learn more.\n\nAs long as regulators, FMIs, and market participants make the effort, we should be able to make the financial system much safer, resilient, and transparent. The changes in train, if properly executed, should, over time, significantly reduce the shortcomings in the OTC derivatives market that exacerbated the financial crisis. Properly enacted and implemented, net exposures should be smaller because of the netting that occurs through the CCP process. Transparency into counterparty risk should be greatly improved via disclosure requirements and the ability to aggregate trade information in trade repositories, and end user trading positions should be much better protected by segregation and portability requirements and a more robust financial market infrastructure. Although there is still much to do as part of this process, I’m optimistic that we are on the right road.  We just need to continue to push ahead and not forget the lessons learned from the financial crisis.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "To start, let me stress that it is essential that the United States put in place a credible program of medium-term fiscal consolidation that addresses our sizeable and growing structural deficits in a manner that is consistent with supporting ongoing economic recovery.\n\nToday I am going to discuss two specific issues relevant to U.S. fiscal policy. First, I am going to highlight the importance of taking the increase in debt service costs into account that will take place when economic conditions permit the normalization of monetary policy. I will argue that we are in an unusual period in which net interest expense is temporarily depressed. This will not last and the fiscal authorities need to factor this in when considering what needs to be done to put the federal budget deficit and the nation's debt burden on a sustainable path.\n\nSecond, I will argue that fiscal consolidation should take into consideration the offsetting adjustments needed to keep the economy on an even keel. While fiscal consolidation is a necessary condition for a healthy economy over time, it is not a sufficient condition. Fiscal adjustments require offsetting changes in private-sector spending and saving behavior, and in the trade sector. Prudent economic policies and international coordination can help ensure that such adjustments take place in ways that support economic activity (and, by extension also support government revenue).\n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and opinions and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs we all are aware, the federal budget deficit is very high and the federal debt burden has climbed sharply as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) (Figure 1) .\n\nThese unusually low interest rates are the result of monetary policy actions taken by the FOMC. The sole purpose of these actions has been to promote the dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability in the wake of the financial crisis. The FOMC has stated that it currently anticipates keeping short-term interest rates exceptionally low until late 2014 and this has contributed to the decline in long-term rates. In addition, large-scale asset purchases and the maturity extension program have pushed down longer-term interest rates by removing duration from the private market. As a result, both the U.S. government and private-sector borrowers have benefited from unusually low borrowing costs.\n\nIndeed, the net interest burden data shown in Figure 2 actually overstates the net cost to Treasury. That is because the interest payments from the Treasury to the Federal Reserve are included in the net interest cost shown in Figure 2, but no offsetting adjustment is made for the fact that the Fed remits almost all of the interest it receives from the Treasury and on its other portfolio holdings right back to the Treasury. The Federal Reserve's remittances to the Treasury are included in the budget separately in the miscellaneous receipts category. Thus, one should deduct these receipts from the debt service numbers to properly measure the Treasury's net interest burden.\n\nNormally, this adjustment doesn't change the picture much. However, it is relevant now because Federal Reserve remittances are unusually high. This is because the Fed's balance sheet is unusually large, as a result of asset purchases undertaken to promote the dual mandate, and because the spread between the cost of the Federal Reserve's liabilities (mainly the 0.25 percent rate that the Fed pays on excess reserves) and the return on its assets is unusually high. As shown in (Figure 3) , the Fed's net remittances to the Treasury have climbed sharply in recent years, rising to more than $75 billion per year over the past two years, after averaging about $27 billion over the 2005-07 period. 1\n\nSubtracting net remittances from the Fed from the Treasury's net interest cost (as a share of GDP), one can see that the increase in our enlarged federal debt has not yet generated a significant rise in the net debt service burden (Figure 4) ,\n\nThis means that the ancillary effects on the federal deficit from the Fed's monetary policy actions are incidental and will prove temporary. Eventually, as economic and financial conditions improve, the pursuit of the dual mandate will lead to a different monetary policy stance, one that requires higher short-term interest rates. And, the Federal Reserve will also eventually shrink the size of its balance sheet. These actions will tend to increase the Treasury's net interest costs and pull down the Federal Reserve's remittances to the Treasury. Together, these two effects will sharply push up the Treasury's net interest burden.\n\nTo show how this may play out, let's use as an illustration a \"current policy\" baseline based on information provided by the Congressional Budget Office, including its macroeconomic assumptions. Under these assumptions, the output gap is closed and monetary policy is normalized by 2017. As shown in Figure 5, net debt service is projected to rise to 3.3 percent of GDP by fiscal year 2020 up from 1.0 percent in 2011, based on an assumption that the interest rate for three-month Treasury bills will rise from around 10 basis points today to 3.8 percent by 2020 and the interest rate on benchmark 10-year Treasury securities will increase from around 2 percent today to 5 percent by 2020.\n\nOn top of this, Federal Reserve remittances are projected to fall sharply. In its recent current law baseline projection, the CBO calculates that net remittances will decline from a peak of 0.55 percent of GDP in 2011 to a long-run average of around 0.2 percent by 2017 and beyond. Thus, on the current policy baseline, the combined effect of higher debt service and lower remittances will total 2 ¼ percent of GDP by fiscal 2020 relative to the current fiscal year (Figure 5) . Of course, this assumes that interest rates follow the trajectory used in the CBO baseline. If interest rates rose faster and reached a level 100 basis points higher in 2020 than what the CBO has assumed, the net debt service burden would be about\n3 ¼ percentage points higher by 2020, all else equal. Given the uncertainties around economic forecasts that far into the future, it would be highly desirable for the fiscal authorities to put in place a medium-term program of fiscal consolidation now, while market conditions are benign. At the same time, I think we must be careful and not focus exclusively on the imperative of fiscal consolidation. That is because fiscal policy adjustments have important implications for the level and composition of economic activity more broadly—both here and abroad. If we must undertake fiscal consolidation— and over time we must—then we need to be cognizant that this adjustment will need to be accompanied by other offsetting changes in the composition of economic activity in our and the global economy. 2 One way of illustrating these interrelationships is to use the following accounting identity, which imposes an adding up constraint on the overall economy: If you define private-sector net saving as the private balance and public sector net saving as the public balance, then: Private balance + public balance = current account balance. At the outset of the financial crisis, the private balance, which was negative, swung sharply into surplus, and this was largely accommodated by a decrease in the public balance—in other words, an increase in the government deficit. Recently, 3 this accounting identity looked roughly like this: 6.5% of GDP private balance + (-9.5% of GDP) public balance = -3% of GDP current account balance Realistically, the public balance 4 needs to be reduced to about -3 percent of GDP over the next five years or so for the ratio of federal debt held by the public-to-GDP to stabilize around 75 percent to 80 percent of GDP. One might reasonably do more, but this just strikes me as the minimum adjustment that would be prudent and sustainable. This requires a large change from where we are today. For the accounting identity to continue to hold, which it must, there needs to be sizable shifts in the private balance and/or the current account balance. This is not a policy choice – it is basic math – but policy choices can help ensure that the adjustments take place in a way that is supportive of economic activity. The private balance can be further divided into two pieces—the household balance and the business balance. Currently, for the United States, the household balance is about 2.5 percent of GDP and the business balance is about 4 percent of GDP. As shown in (Figure 6) , which shows these two components over time, the business balance is currently unusually high; that is, businesses have very high cash flows relative to their investment outlays. This suggests that some of the required adjustment could occur by fostering greater investment spending as a share of GDP. For this to occur, it will be important that economic policies promote long-term growth and financial stability, and ensure that the United States is a competitive place to base production, with a well-functioning infrastructure, a skilled workforce and a reasonable tax and regulatory system. In addition, it seems desirable that some of the adjustment should take place in the trade sector. Although a current account deficit of 3 percent of GDP by itself would be sustainable over time, for the household balance to remain close to current levels and the public balance to sharply narrow, then the current account may need to move further toward balance. For this to occur, there needs to be two offsetting adjustments. On one hand, the U.S. economy must be reoriented toward global demand and stronger net exports. On the other hand, there will have to be offsetting adjustments elsewhere in the world. After all, on a global basis, the current account balance—properly measured—must sum to zero. This means that countries with significant trade surpluses will need to reorient their economies over time toward increasing domestic demand and running smaller trade surpluses. To sum up, the United States faces substantial fiscal challenges in the years ahead. And, in one important respect—net interest expense—these challenges may be more daunting than fully appreciated currently. In particular, the interest bill on the growing federal debt burden has been temporarily restrained by the low level of interest rates and high level of remittances from the Federal Reserve to the Treasury. In addition, while significant fiscal adjustments must take place, it is important to recognize that such efforts will necessitate offsetting shifts in private domestic spending and production both here and abroad. Finding ways for these adjustments to occur smoothly is an important challenge for economic policy. Thank you for your kind attention. _____________________________________________________ 1 The 2011 remittance figure is a preliminary unaudited estimate. 2 See \"Securing the Recovery and Building for the Future.\" Remarks by William Dudley at United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, November 17, 2011, for a more detailed discussion of this issue. 3 Third quarter 2011, the latest period for which data are available. 4 The federal public balance is roughly equivalent, though not identical, to the federal budget deficit; the overall public balance numbers provided here include state and local government.\n\nOf course, this assumes that interest rates follow the trajectory used in the CBO baseline.

    "text": "Thank you to the graduates and members of the faculty and administration for selecting me as New College of Florida's 44th commencement speaker. I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak here today in such a beautiful setting. It's nice to be back.\n\nEarlier today, I had the pleasure of meeting a few of you—in a smaller setting—to hear about your plans for after graduation; or should I say, tomorrow. I am very impressed with the high caliber of graduates in your class. I also had a tour of the campus today, which I must say has changed a lot in the past 30 years. One thing that hasn't changed, however, is the Palm Court—or as you all so affectionately call it, the \"center of the universe.\"\n\nI have very fond memories of my time at New College, aside from those great Palm Court parties. I received a terrific education and made some life-long friends. I hope the same has been true about your New College experience.\n\nI am especially grateful for the support from the faculty over the years—both while I was a student and afterwards. There are two people I would particularly like to highlight:\n\nJan Van der Veen—Jan was the professor who really got me started in economics.\n\nBob Bennedetti—Bob agreed to a contract in which I would get a semester of college credit mainly through working on the 1972 presidential campaign in the California primary election and in Ohio for the general election. Probably learned more from that experience than anything else I have ever done in higher education. I would encourage all of you—Republicans, Democrats and Independents—to get involved in public service at some point in your careers.\n\nI have many memories of New College—some about people such as Jan and Bob, and others about events and experiences. For example, one of the most remarkable events I have ever witnessed occurred here one night in December 1972—the first Apollo spacecraft night launch. I remember staring out from the top of a dormitory roof not far from here across the horizon looking at the star specks —wondering, is that the rocket? When it actually came up over the horizon it truly was amazing. I remember it as no bigger than a half-inch gap between your thumb and index finger at arm's length. And as the liftoff proceeded and the vapor trail started to decline over the horizon following the curvature of the Earth—I really could see clearly that the world was truly round. Maybe that's a good metaphor for my New College experience!\n\nMy only truly unpleasant memory here was one literature course (student taught, I might add) in which I received an evaluation that essentially noted that I could not read, write or think. I like to think that was a bit harsh, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion!\n\nNew College truly is a special place. I like to call it \"graduate school for undergraduates\" because it really is a place that encourages students to intellectually engage, learn, think and communicate.\n\nThe unstructured format of evaluations and contracts rather than grades is not for everyone—some folks need more structure. But I see that you have made it through and I congratulate you for that—it is an important milestone in your life.\n\nToday, I want to talk about two issues: the economy you face as you graduate, and some advice—call it \"lessons learned\"—that might have some value to you as you contemplate what you are going to do with the rest of your life.\n\nThe Economy You Face as New Graduates The U.S. economy is recovering and we are now seeing the first signs of significant employment growth. Thus, this is a better year to graduate than last. However, finding a job will not be easy—the unemployment rate is much too high—nearly 10 percent. And the recovery seems likely to be more sluggish than we would like.\n\nThe economy is suffering from the hangover of the real estate and consumption boom that ended a few years ago. That boom collapsed beginning in mid-2007. The result was a very deep downturn from which we are now only emerging.\n\nAlthough the Federal Reserve has been aggressive about easing monetary policy to support economic activity, the recovery is not likely to be as robust as we would like for several reasons.\n\nFirst, households are still in the process of deleveraging. The housing boom created paper wealth that households borrowed against. This pushed the consumption share of nominal gross domestic product to a record high of about 70 percent. When the boom turned into a bust, those paper gains evaporated. In fact, many households now find that the value of their homes is less than the amount of their mortgage debt. This has created a difficult time for many families and has caused the hangover to last longer.\n\nSecond, the banking system is still under significant stress. This is particularly the case for small- and medium-sized banks that have significant exposure to commercial real estate loans. This stress means that banks have been slow to ease credit standards as the economy has moved from recession to recovery.\n\nThird, some of the sources that have supported the nascent recovery are temporary. The big swing from inventory liquidation during the recession back to accumulation will soon end as inventory levels come back into better balance with sales. And fiscal stimulus from the federal government is subsiding and will soon reverse.\n\nCoupled with the benign outlook for inflation, these headwinds to growth and employment explain why the Federal Reserve is keeping short-term interest rates unusually low. We want to do all we can to support more rapid economic and employment growth, subject to keeping inflation low and stable, and inflation expectations well anchored. The situation has improved and total employment is now growing—for example, U.S. payrolls rose by 290,000 last month. But we are still far from where we want to be.\n\nIn this environment, finding a job will be tough, but when you hit the pavement remember that the job market is improving. Don't get discouraged. Get your foot in the door by doing something productive, even if it may not be exactly what you want to do for the rest of your life. Gaining knowledge and experience is what is important at this point. The first job out of college is a foot on the ladder—the job doesn't have to be perfect to be valuable to you.\n\nA Bit of Advice In terms of your career, my first bit of advice is: don't rush. There is plenty of time for your careers to unfold. It's not a sprint, it's a marathon. I didn't really start my career until I went to work for the Federal Reserve Board at 28 after graduate school and didn't begin working on macroeconomics until I joined Goldman Sachs when I was 33.\n\nWhen I entered the job market from New College in the fall of 1974—the economy was in recession. I interviewed for many jobs, and I was told that I was overqualified for a few and under qualified for many. I eventually got a job as a methods analyst, which is essentially an internal efficiency consultant. It wasn't much, but it was a start and I went from there. My second bit of advice is to take the time to find out what really interests you. This means you may want to try a few different things before settling on a particular career path. When I left New College I certainly didn't know where I was headed. I only made the decision to become a professional economist two years later when I was deciding between law school and economics. And I didn't decide to opt for more policy-related work rather than become an academic until I entered the job market from Berkeley five years later.\n\nThe important point is that if you like what you are doing, you almost certainly will be successful at it.\n\nMy third bit of advice is to be true to yourself. It is a lot easier to keep things straight and be happy if your public persona and private persona are not in conflict—you are one integrated person.\n\nBeing true to yourself also means facing up to problems and mistakes early. Early on in my career as a professional economist, I got involved in writing a paper about tax reform with the head of the firm's research department. The night the paper went to the printers, I woke up with complete clarity that there was a mistake in the paper. The mistake did not affect the conclusions of the paper. It just slightly changed all the numbers and was obscure enough that no one would probably catch it.\n\nWhat to do? I decided to take my medicine. I walked into the office of my co-author the next morning and said that we needed to throw out the 10,000 copies of the paper that had been printed. The head of research—Leon Cooperman—was known for his—let me say this delicately—strong personality. But rather than blowing up at me, he said fine, let's fix it.\n\nFacing up to the error must have actually worked in my favor since I won his respect. A few months later, he introduced me to Robert Rubin—who, as you know, went on to become the U.S. Secretary of Treasury. And through Robert Rubin I met all sorts of interesting people in the Clinton administration.\n\nMy fourth bit of advice is to continue to build your human capital. That means seeking out jobs and opportunities that give you new experiences and skills. Keep up with your mentors and continue to cultivate relationships and build your network. Education isn't just about college course work, it should be a lifelong experience. If your employer asks you do something new—don't shy away from it. Instead, think of it as a wonderful deal: Your employer is going to pay you to deepen your skills and knowledge base. You will be paid to become more valuable.\n\nFor me, the ability to build my human capital has happened—in spades—several times. The first occurred here at New College and at Berkeley for graduate school. Here I learned to really read critically and how to write—the one literature course that I mentioned earlier notwithstanding.\n\nThe second was the opportunity early on in my career to become involved in macroeconomic forecasting and policy analysis. Up to that point, I had been a regulatory economist. I had only taken one course in macroeconomics in graduate school and it was the only course on which I received a \"B\" grade—I had not revealed any great affinity for that subject. At first, the work was stressful. When people asked me questions, I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to know the answers or not. At first, I felt quite ignorant, but eventually that passed.\n\nThe third was when I was asked to head the Markets Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the beginning of 2007. It was an unexpected opportunity for public service after spending the bulk of my career in the private sector. The Markets Group is the operational arm of the Federal Reserve System. It helps to have an economics background, but it was a very different task managing 300 people who worked in many complex businesses ranging from Treasury auctions to providing services to foreign central banks. And, when the financial crisis began in earnest in August 2007, the learning curve accelerated sharply.\n\nAnd the fourth was when I had the opportunity to succeed Timothy Geithner as president of the Bank in January 2008. Now it is 3,000 people, not 300 to manage and a much wider set of responsibilities.\n\nSome of the most interesting parts of the job have been getting troubled financial institutions onto a stronger footing so that these firms could provide greater credit and support to the U.S. economy. Obviously, working closely with Chairman Ben Bernanke and my Fed colleagues at the Board of Governors and around the other 11 Reserve Banks has also been particularly rewarding.\n\nEach time, the opportunities helped me broaden my knowledge and skills. My career benefited as a consequence.\n\nIn implementing this advice, it also helps to have lots of good luck. In that regard, I have been blessed. Think of the chain of events for me to get my \"dream job\"—head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I had to decide to leave Goldman Sachs at the end of 2005; be asked by Timothy Geithner to be head of the Markets Group in 2006 and be smart enough to take him up on his offer; Barack Obama had to win the presidential election; Tim had to be selected to be Treasury Secretary; and the Board of Directors of the Bank in collaboration with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., had to agree on me as Tim's successor. If you ever thought that train of events was even remotely likely, I think you would have been considered delusional!\n\nMy final piece of advice is the most important one: Don't forget all that they have taught you here about thinking critically and speaking up.\n\nSo, let me sum up. Go into the job market with enthusiasm and don't be daunted by the inevitable rejections. That's part of the process of getting started. Don't feel in a rush to figure out all the details of your career. If you are true to yourself, continue to build your human capital and don't forget everything that they have taught you here, I know that you will meet with every success.",

    "text": "National Economic Conditions I’ll begin by commenting on national economic conditions. Since the recession ended in 2009, the economy has grown at a modest pace. When we met in February, the brisker pace of growth in the last quarter of 2010 appeared to be carrying over to the beginning of this year. Since then growth has been somewhat softer than anticipated, with real gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at only a 1.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2011. A number of factors contributed to the slowdown. Construction activity fell—likely reflecting the continued large supply of unsold homes—and government expenditures at the federal, state and local levels declined. In addition, real, or inflation-adjusted, consumption growth in the first quarter was slower than in the last quarter of 2010. This occurred, in part, because of the rise in gasoline and food prices that pushed up consumer price inflation last quarter and reduced discretionary income. The rise in energy prices contributed to a fall in consumer confidence, which also may have had a negative impact on consumer spending.  However, the weakness of real GDP growth in the first quarter probably will prove temporary. In particular, production and business survey indicators, including the New York Fed’s own Empire State Manufacturing Survey, generally continue to signal strength. And financial conditions continue to improve. The temporary reduction in payroll taxes and other fiscal measures also are providing support to demand. In addition, demand abroad—particularly in Asia—remains robust, supporting our exports. Most importantly, the labor market has shown further improvement, as demonstrated by today’s employment report. Although payroll employment growth has been subdued during most of this recovery, the latest figures show the economy added 244,000 jobs in April—and an average of 233,000 over each of the past three months. While the unemployment rate—which is based on a different survey—ticked higher last month to 9 per cent it is nonetheless 0.8 percentage points lower than it was in November, a relatively rapid decline by historic standards,  Private-sector job growth has been strong enough to more than offset government layoffs, particularly at the state and local level.  A particularly encouraging sign is the rapid growth of manufacturing jobs over the past year and the recent broadening strength in services employment. While the exact pace of a jobs market recovery is always hard to predict, we were expecting the rate of job growth to pick up over the first half, and I am hopeful that job growth will continue to strengthen in the coming months. We would welcome this.  Even if the economy added 300,000 jobs per month from now on, we would likely still have considerable labor market slack at the end of 2012. Despite these clearly encouraging signs, there are still some downside risks to the growth outlook that bear watching.  Let me list them for you: As I mentioned earlier, high oil and commodity prices have cut into household purchasing power, a difficult situation for many families that could constrain overall spending more than I anticipate. The renewed decline in home prices could dampen consumer spending and housing activity more than I expect. Finally, aggressive near-term government spending cuts or tax increases could slow economic growth at least in the short- to medium-term—although a credible plan for medium-term fiscal consolidation is sorely required and would have many economic benefits. That said, I want to emphasize that these are risks rather than likely outcomes. In regard to inflation, on a year-over-year basis, the headline measures have increased to levels near those consistent with our objectives—which most members of the FOMC consider to be 2 percent or a bit less on the personal consumption expenditures measure. Moreover, the rise in commodity prices over the past year probably will push up headline inflation even further in coming months. It is noteworthy, however, that even with the sharp rise in oil and food prices, there has been little pass-through into broader measures of prices. In fact, most measures of underlying inflation trends—such as core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy prices)—remain below levels consistent with our mandate. Going forward, futures markets do not signal that investors expect rapid ongoing increases in commodity prices from current levels.  Provided these prices stabilize (or indeed retreat), I would expect headline inflation to move back to a mandate-consistent rate. While this process plays out, however, it is critical that we ensure that inflation expectations do not become unmoored. It is much harder to keep inflation in check if people begin to raise their expectations of inflation. At this point, measures of inflation expectations overall remain stable. Economists at the New York Fed have examined inflation expectations using a unique survey that we sponsor. As reported in a recent post on our new Liberty Street Economics blog, they find no evidence to suggest that a wage-price inflation spiral is getting underway. However, we will continue to monitor expectations for medium-term inflation very closely. To sum up, economic conditions have improved in the past year. Yet, the recovery remains moderate and we still have a considerable way to go to meet the Fed’s dual mandate of full employment and price stability. Regional Economic Conditions Now, how is our region doing? As attendees at previous press briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators to help monitor the performance of the region. I am pleased to report that the latest months of data no longer suggest that the regional recovery has paused, as they indicated in February. Based on these measures: The recovery of activity in New York State and New York City continues at a steady and sustained pace. In New Jersey, activity also has begun to increase following a long period—roughly a year—where activity in the state was essentially flat. We monitor Puerto Rico using an index produced by the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico. The index shows that the decline in activity on the island began in 2005 and continued through late 2010. However, there are some signs that the economy has stabilized in recent months. Regional Employment Trends Now, let me turn specifically to employment trends in the region, the focus of our briefing today.  In particular, we want to describe our region’s experience during the recession and recovery. Nationally, the Great Recession, which began in December 2007, has been the deepest economic downturn since World War II. At the jobs trough in February 2010—about 7 months after the official end of the recession—the country had lost almost 6.5 percent of its jobs and the unemployment rate had more than doubled. Many people lost their jobs or saw their hours or income cut, and the duration of unemployment for jobless workers reached a historical high. For many families, this distress was compounded by losses of wealth from declining home prices and stock market losses. Since the jobs trough, unemployment has retreated by a percentage point and jobs growth has resumed, albeit at a slow pace. Today, we will review questions about jobs in our region such as:  How severe was the downturn? Where are jobs returning? And, what factors affect the employment outlook? As in other parts of the country, employment in our region declined substantially during the recession. But, New York and New Jersey and Puerto Rico had very different experiences. Employment in much of New York State, including New York City, declined less severely than the nation. Both the state and city lost about 3.8 percent of their jobs.  As we discussed at our briefing last October, part of reason for the more moderate decline in jobs in New York during the recession was a less pronounced boom-bust housing cycle. Indeed, as a percentage, the city and state lost fewer jobs during this recession than they did during either of the last two downturns. By contrast, the downturn in employment in New Jersey in the current cycle was more severe.  About 250,000 jobs were lost, or roughly 6.0 percent of total state employment—about the same as in the country as a whole. This decline is comparable to the job losses during the most severe recent recession in the state, that of 1989-1992. Fairfield County in Connecticut, also part of our District, saw declines comparable to the nation, while Puerto Rico experienced much deeper and longer job declines than the nation.  In fact, employment in Puerto Rico began declining nearly two years before the onset of the recession on the mainland. Now, as in the nation, a labor market recovery has begun across much of the region. Over the past year, the tri-state region added roughly 100,000 private-sector jobs. Within the region, however, the recovery has been somewhat uneven. New York City, upstate New York and Fairfield County have been gaining jobs for more than a year now—at roughly the same pace as the nation. However, employment in New Jersey has only begun to expand during the past few months. In Puerto Rico, job growth has yet to be firmly established. The recession, which began in 2005, has seen employment leveling off since last summer, but no clear reestablishment of growth. Businesses in a variety of services sectors have contributed to the recovery of jobs in the region, including professional and business services, education and health, and leisure and hospitality, as well as finance. The overall expansion of our private sector is being partially offset by ongoing losses in manufacturing and construction, where firms in our region are not matching the modest growth seen in jobs at the national level. In addition, state and local government jobs in our district have declined sharply. After holding steady for much of the recession, state and local governments in New York and New Jersey have reduced job counts by more than 40,000. These losses effectively offset about half of the private-sector jobs created over the period. The government job declines were particularly severe in New Jersey and Puerto Rico, and considerably steeper than in the United States overall. Looking ahead, the continued expansion of employment at the national level should have positive effects on many industries in our region. As elsewhere, state and local government will likely be a drag for some time. However, some new detailed job listing data point to an expansion of job openings in a number of key occupations in the region. Finally, despite the overall recovery of employment across much of the region, unemployment rates remain very high. Although down from their year-ago levels, March’s unemployment rate of 8.0 percent in New York State and 9.3 percent in New Jersey remain unacceptably high. And there is disappointingly little evidence of any sustained improvement in Puerto Rico’s 16.1 percent unemployment rate. Conclusion To sum up, the national economy experienced a soft patch in activity during the first quarter of 2011, while the recovery in much of the region continued at a good pace. New York continued to expand and New Jersey has shown signs of turning the corner in the last two months. Puerto Rico may have bottomed out. During the Great Recession, most of New York sustained less severe job losses than the nation as whole. By contrast, New Jersey’s losses were comparable to the rest of the country and Puerto Rico’s job losses have been more severe. As the recovery takes shape, private services are the most likely source of job growth throughout the region. There are many reasons to believe conditions are in place for stronger growth in the coming months in the nation and the region. Nevertheless, both nationally and regionally, unemployment remains stubbornly high and is likely to remain so for many months to come. Thank you for your kind attention. I will now ask James Orr to provide more details on regional economic conditions.\n\nNational Economic Conditions I’ll begin by commenting on national economic conditions.

    "text": "Good morning and welcome once again to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Regional Economic Press Briefing.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak with you.  This morning I want to focus on economic conditions in our region, giving particular attention to the kinds of jobs created in New York, Northern New Jersey and Puerto Rico during the recovery from the Great Recession.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhile the New York Fed has broad operating responsibilities on behalf of the FOMC and the Federal Reserve System, we are also deeply committed to our region.  That commitment manifests itself in several ways.  We produce monthly indices of economic activity that enable us to gauge the performance of the region’s economy.  We conduct a regular poll of small businesses in our region, and just last week, we hosted a summit examining new sources of credit for small businesses.  We developed block-by-block flood maps which were created after Superstorm Sandy to inform residents and businesses in Brooklyn of their vulnerability to future storms.  And, we work with area schools to improve students’ understanding of monetary policy, the Fed and economics.\n\nIt is also important to me that I visit different parts of our District on a regular basis and talk directly with the people who live and work here.  For example, last fall I visited Western New York and saw the many positive changes helping to revitalize what has been a slow growing economy for some time.  Earlier this year, I met with companies on a visit to Brooklyn and observed some of the new hi-tech jobs that are being brought to the City—a good precursor to today’s presentation.  While in Brooklyn, I also visited Brownsville, a neighborhood which underscores the reality of the challenges that many face and the fact that the economy is not improving for everyone.  Later this year, I have similar trips planned to Puerto Rico, the Bronx and Albany.  Obtaining on-the-ground intelligence is valuable and helps shape my view of the region, the economy and my outlook on policy.\n\nAs you may know, the District we cover is quite diverse.  It is not just a single regional economy, but rather many different local economies.  Let me talk a bit about how the different parts of our region have been doing.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nSince our last briefing in November, the economic recovery has been variable across the region—strong in some places but weaker in others.  Let me begin with the area that has struggled the most.  Puerto Rico’s economy has, unfortunately, been in a deep economic slump that has lasted for nearly a decade.  Over the past few years, public sector job losses have continued to weigh against modest job gains in the Island’s private sector.  And ongoing difficulties in the Island’s labor market continue, with labor force participation still alarmingly low, and unemployment stubbornly high at a rate well above the mainland’s.  The good news is that we are finally beginning to see some firming in economic conditions on the Island.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, New York City has been experiencing a robust recovery.  While the Great Recession was clearly the worst post-war downturn in U.S. history, New York City was not as badly affected as the rest of the country.  As of April, almost five years since the end of the recession, the nation has recovered nearly all of the jobs that were lost.  By contrast, New York City reached this milestone more than two years ago.  And, as we’ve highlighted in previous press briefings, this rebound has occurred despite the lack of any significant recovery in employment on Wall Street.\n\nThe recovery has generally progressed at a more moderate pace in the other parts of our region.  Consistent with historical patterns, Upstate New York as a whole has been growing modestly, with Buffalo and Rochester doing a little bit better than their upstate peers.  Binghamton, on the other hand, has really been struggling with no signs yet of any meaningful recovery.  Meanwhile, Northern New Jersey’s economy had been growing fairly steadily until this past winter when activity softened, probably due at least in part to the unusually harsh weather.  Now that spring is finally upon us, we hope to see economic conditions improve more significantly.\n\nWhat Kinds of Jobs Have Been Created During the Recovery?\n\nLet me turn to the topic of today’s press briefing:  how the types of jobs in the region have changed over the last business cycle.  Firms often change the way they utilize workers and the mix of skills they employ during recessions and recoveries.  The weakening demand during recessions forces firms to look for new ways to be more efficient to cope with hard times.  These adjustments do not affect all workers equally.  Indeed, it’s what we typically think of as middle-skilled workers—for example, construction workers, machine operators and administrative support personnel—that are hardest hit during recessions.  Further, a feature of the Great Recession and indeed the prior two recessions, is that the middle-skill jobs that were lost don’t all come back during the recoveries that follow.  Instead, job opportunities have tended to shift toward higher- and lower-skilled workers.\n\nAs we’ll show, these same trends have played out in our region.  While there’s been a good number of both higher-skill and lower-skill jobs created in the region during the recovery, opportunities for middle-skilled workers have continued to shrink.\n\nI believe it is important for us to highlight these job trends and to understand their implications for our region.  There have been significant and long-lasting changes to the nature of work.  As a result, many middle-skilled workers displaced during the recession are likely to find that their old jobs will never come back.  Furthermore, workers are increasingly facing higher skill requirements in order to land a good job.  These dynamics in the labor market present a host of challenges for the region to address.  However one thing is clear: workers will need more education, training and skills to take full advantage of the types of job opportunities being created in our region, as well as across the nation.  So, it’s important that we work together to find ways to help people in our region adapt to these changes.\n\nI will now ask Jaison Abel to provide an update of economic conditions in our region.",

    "text": "Good morning and welcome to the New  York Fed’s Economic Press Briefing.  I am  pleased to have this opportunity to speak with the journalists covering our  region.  You are an important  communication channel to the people in our District.  This morning I want to focus on economic  conditions in our region, giving particular attention to job growth.  I also want to discuss our ongoing work on  Puerto Rico.  As always, what I have to  say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market  Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe New York Fed is deeply  committed to serving our region.  This  commitment manifests itself in several ways.  We produce business surveys and local economic  indexes to help our constituents track regional economic conditions.  My staff writes papers and blog posts on  economic issues important to our region.  We meet with a number of advisory boards  comprised of community and business leaders.  And, I regularly visit different parts of our  District so that I can meet with local businesses, community development  professionals, and the people who live and work here.  This on-the-ground intelligence is valuable to  me and helps inform my view of the region and the economy, which, in turn,  plays an important role in shaping my outlook on policy.\n\nLet me now talk a bit about job  growth in our region. ` Job Growth in the Region\n\nNationally, the labor market has  added 2.4 million jobs over the past year.  And, the strong jobs reports released over the  past two months have helped allay concerns that arose earlier this year that  job growth was beginning to stall.  Indeed,  these reports reinforce my view that labor market conditions continue to  improve.\n\nTurning to conditions closer to  home; job growth in our region has generally been somewhat below the national  pace.  One important exception is New  York City, where job growth has been strong, despite the relatively sluggish  performance of the financial services industry.  In the past, the City has counted on job  growth from Wall Street to fuel economic growth during recoveries and  expansions.  This time around, however,  job gains in the securities industry have been meager.  Instead, the City’s job growth has been quite  widespread in sectors outside of finance.  One that is especially noteworthy is the  City’s burgeoning technology sector, which has been creating jobs in industries  such as internet publishing, online shopping, and scientific research and  development.  Growth in these high-paying  jobs is picking up much of the slack created by the softness of the securities  industry.\n\nIn fact, strong growth in New York  City has been helping many of its surrounding areas, including northern New  Jersey, Long Island and Fairfield County.  Many workers residing in these areas commute  to New York City and have access to the City’s vast, diverse and expanding job  market.  For example, Long Island’s  unemployment rate is now below 4 percent, its lowest level in nearly a decade.  In Connecticut, Bridgeport has also benefited.   When I visited a few months ago, I saw  firsthand some of this resurgence.  Bridgeport  is both the largest and poorest city in Fairfield County, and for decades had  seen its population and job base steadily decline.  But, since 2000, its population has started to  grow again for the first time since the 1940s.  Even as other parts of Fairfield County  struggle with a number of high-profile corporate relocations, jobs have begun  growing and Bridgeport is showing signs of revival.\n\nIn upstate New York, economic  growth has generally been modest, with job growth running well below the  national pace.  This isn’t new, as  upstate New York has historically tended to grow much more slowly than the  nation.  Though growth has been slow for  the region as a whole, some places are doing relatively better than others. In  particular, job growth has picked up in Buffalo, and the Capital Region  continues to see sturdy growth coupled with significant manufacturing job  gains.\n\nHowever, not all parts of upstate  New York are seeing the same degree of economic progress.  There has been little to no growth in the  center of the state, and Utica and Binghamton continue to see employment  declines.  Binghamton stands out as being  particularly challenged, as its economy has yet to see any meaningful recovery  from the Great Recession. Steep manufacturing job losses have weighed heavily  on the area, though these losses appear to be nearing an end.  I had the opportunity to visit Binghamton  earlier this summer, and I was encouraged by what I saw.  The region is making serious efforts to boost  economic growth, with Binghamton University playing a key role in fostering  local business activity.  And, like many  places dealing with steep manufacturing job losses, there is a large swath of  displaced workers that need assistance returning to the labor market.  This has proved challenging and remains a  priority.\n\nUpdate on Puerto Rico\n\nOn balance, I think it’s fair to  say that the economic news from much of the Second District has been quite  positive.  An important exception,  though, has been the fiscal crisis faced by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,  home to 3.5 million U.S. citizens.  Unfortunately,  Puerto Rico continues to struggle under the weight of economic stagnation, employment  declines and outmigration.  This year,  the government has been unable to make its debt payments on schedule and has  lost access to the public debt markets.  The  pressures that culminated in these missed payments have been building for some  time.  This is an issue that we have been  focused on for several years.  We have  published a number of reports in order to help highlight challenges and  opportunities, to inform the discussion around solutions.\n\nI have visited Puerto Rico on  several occasions, and had the opportunity to talk to residents and hear about  the challenges they face.  As an  outgrowth of one of these trips—taken in 2011—I commissioned my staff to  produce a report on the competitiveness of the Island’s economy.  We released this report in 2012, and it served, I  believe, a useful purpose in providing technical analysis and identifying some  important issues deserving of policy attention.  Over the following two years, the Island’s  fiscal problems worsened.  Consequently,  in 2014 we published an update to the initial report―this time focusing on the  Island’s public finances―and again offering suggestions for consideration.\n\nIn June, Congress and the Obama Administration  took action providing a framework to help address the Commonwealth’s fiscal crisis.  Part of that agreement re-emphasized  that the Commonwealth’s fiscal sustainability depends crucially on an expanding  economy.  In an effort to continue to  shed light on the important issues, last week we published in our Liberty  Street Economics blog a five-part series entitled “Restoring Economic Growth in  Puerto Rico.”  Some important conclusions emerged  from our analysis, and I want to emphasize those today.\n\nFirst and foremost, Puerto Rico’s  current level of public debt is unsustainable.  Achieving fiscal sustainability requires real reforms and a significant adjustment to the Commonwealth’s debt burden, as  Congress and the Administration have recognized.  To illustrate this point, our analysis  demonstrates that even if growth were to return to between 2 and 2.5 percent  per year—an optimistic scenario—debt as a share of GDP would continue to rise  under the current fiscal balance and debt structure.  This underscores that the current regime is  not sustainable.  Second, while fiscal  reform is definitely needed, restoring economic growth remains a crucial  ingredient to achieving a sustainable fiscal regime.  Puerto Rico slipped into recession in 2006,  and a decade later a recovery has yet to materialize.  Any fixed level of debt will grow even more  burdensome if the economy is shrinking.   Consequently, this long deep recession has exacerbated the Island’s  fiscal woes.\n\nMuch of last week’s analysis  focused on a key contributor to economic growth—the labor force—so let me point  out a few conclusions that I drew from that work.  Puerto Rico’s outmigration remains an  important concern, and is both a cause and an effect of the economic decline.  Although the skills of those who have migrated  to the Mainland look much like those who remain, the departure of tens of  thousands of residents each year represents a huge drain on Puerto Rico’s  potential growth.  Among those who remain  on the Island, low labor force participation, an aging population and  relatively poor preparation for skilled jobs represent significant headwinds to  growth.\n\nWhile our analysis seems to paint a  somewhat dark picture of economic conditions on the Island, it’s important to  remember that there are significant opportunities for action that can leverage  the Island’s strengths to foster economic growth.  These include its bilingual adult population,  an open economy occupying a central position in the Caribbean, wide experience  as host to international corporations, and close economic ties to the U.S.  mainland.  It is in exactly this spirit  that we present this analysis—in the hope that it will help policymakers focus  on actions that can help to restore growth and prosperity to the Commonwealth.  Going forward, we will stay engaged in this  effort.\n\nMiddle-Wage Jobs Returning\n\nLet me conclude by returning to the  theme of the labor market.  Job growth is  essential to the vitality of an expansion, but the types of jobs being created  are also important.  While the labor  market has continued to add jobs at a solid pace, many remain concerned about a  lack of job opportunities for the middle class.  Indeed, growth of middle-wage jobs has been  lackluster for the past few decades, with gains occurring disproportionately in  higher-wage and lower-wage sectors.  This  long-term hollowing out of jobs in the middle of the wage distribution has  helped fuel rising wage inequality, and has contributed to a growing sense for  some that they are being left behind in the current economic expansion.  At a previous press briefing, we showed that  many middle-wage jobs disappeared during the Great Recession with very few of  these jobs returning during the early stages of the recovery.  This made it especially difficult for many  workers who lost their jobs to rejoin the economy.\n\nToday, our economists will show  that the tide has begun to turn.  For the  first time in quite a while, gains in middle-wage jobs actually outnumber gains  in higher- and lower-wage jobs nationwide.   These middle-wage jobs include teachers, construction workers,  mechanics, administrative support personnel and truck drivers, just to name a  few.  I believe this is an important  development in the economy, because, if it were to continue, it would create  more opportunities for workers and their families who have been struggling up  to now.  Middle-wage jobs are also being  created in our region, though such gains have been more evident in some places  than others.\n\nI will now ask Jaison Abel to  provide more details about job growth in our region.\n\n1 Jaison  Abel, Jason Bram, Hunter Clark, Giacomo De Giorgi, Richard Deitz, Jack Gutt,  Andrew Haughwout and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.",

    "text": "It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today.  My remarks will focus on how I think about monetary policy in today’s challenging economic environment.  As part of this, I will discuss how simple policy rules might appropriately be used as a guide to decisionmaking.  I do this not because policy rules play a dominant role in my own thinking, but because the use of these tools is widespread, with many framing their arguments this way.  To start with the punch line, although I believe simple policy rules can provide useful input into the policymaking process, it would be unwise to rely on them mechanically.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nPolicy must strive to promote the dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability given to the Federal Reserve by Congress.  I believe that this should be done in a transparent and systematic manner because this will help us to achieve our objectives.  In particular, a well-articulated framework for policy that explains our goals and how we use our tools to promote these goals helps market participants, businesses, and workers to anticipate how the Federal Reserve will respond under different circumstances and plan accordingly. 1\n\nThis helps to anchor private sector expectations in ways that make it easier to achieve the dual mandate objectives.  In contrast, if we acted in an unpredictable way, policy would be ineffective at anchoring expectations and this shortcoming would disrupt the transmission of the monetary policy impulse to the real economy.\n\nOver the years, this logic has led the Federal Reserve to become increasingly transparent and systematic in its decisionmaking. 2 In January, the Federal Open Market Committee took another important step in this direction, endorsing a public statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.  This document articulated a 2 percent inflation o bjective and committed the FOMC to a “balanced approach” with respect to promoting the dual mandate objectives.\n\nFor me, the key issue is how to interpret these principles and put them into practice.  I interpret the strategy document as expressing a relatively straightforward proposition:  The Fed should seek the policy setting that generates the best achievable path back to full employment and price stability following shocks that push us away from either of our objectives.\n\nI regard the policymaking process as a systematic effort to investigate what policy setting would deliver the best achievable set of economic outcomes, 3 taking into consideration all available information, including risks not fully summarized in the base case point forecasts.  Our approach is not greatly different from those of central banks that operate inflation targeting regimes, but in our case we explicitly seek to promote both aspects of our dual mandate. 4\n\nThe basic question is how the FOMC should implement monetary policy to best push the economy back to its dual objectives.  Prescriptions from simple policy rules such as Taylor Rules, named after Stanford economist John Taylor, have a legitimate role to play in this evaluation as do more complex simulations such as optimal control rules.  In a Taylor Rule, the nominal federal funds rate depends on the equilibrium or neutral real short-term rate of interest, the deviation of the level of economic activity from estimates of the level of activity that would be consistent with long-run price stability, and the deviation of inflation from the central bank’s target. 5\n\nThe Taylor Rule formulation has a number of characteristics that make it a useful input into the policy-setting process.  First, it very explicitly focuses on the two parameters—the long-term inflation objective and the level of potential output consistent with that objective—that map directly to the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives.  Second, standard Taylor Rules are self-equilibrating.  They respond to economic shocks and forecast errors in a way that pushes the economy back toward the central bank’s objectives.  Third, academic research shows that Taylor-type rules typically perform quite well across a wide range of economic models.  This is important because we want rules that are robust; that is, not overly sensitive to model-specific assumptions about how the economy performs or how households and businesses alter their expectations and behavior in response to changes in monetary policy.\n\nFourth, with respect to the United States, the most popular versions of the Taylor Rule approximate how policy has evolved since the late 1980s—a period in which the Federal Reserve has been successful in keeping inflation in check (Figure 1) . This suggests that policymakers, faced with the economic conditions of that period, weighted deviations from their goals in a manner similar to the weights used in these versions of the Taylor Rule.\n\nDespite these attractive features, I do not believe that simple policy rules can take the place of in-depth analysis of economic conditions, evaluation of alternative policy plans, and ultimately policy judgment.  While simple policy rules provide useful information to policymakers, their very virtue—simplicity—means they cannot capture all information that is relevant for policymaking.  For example, such rules cannot easily incorporate asymmetric risks or financial stability issues.\n\nMoreover, the usefulness of simple policy rules depends critically on the stability of the relationship between monetary policy and economic outcomes.  If the relationship between monetary policy and the real economy were stable over time, following a relatively simple and unchanging policy rule would likely generate acceptable results.  However, if the linkage between monetary policy and the real economy is more variable, as I believe it is, then an approach that is more pragmatic and updates the policy setting in a clear and systematic manner based upon what the FOMC learns over time will be more effective.\n\nIn particular, a simple policy rule can generate poor macroeconomic outcomes when either the structure of the economy or the transmission mechanism of monetary policy changes in a significant way (whether the change is temporary or permanent).  If private sector economic agents—workers, businesses, investors— thought we would implement a particular policy rule regardless of changes of these kinds, policy would not be effective at stabilizing private sector expectations in ways that promote the dual mandate objectives.  This is particularly relevant in the unusual environment that we find ourselves in—the aftermath of a housing bust and a financial crisis.\n\nIn the current context, there is an additional complication that is extremely important.  Simple policy rules implicitly assume that monetary policy is unconstrained and that the Fed can always achieve the federal funds rate policy setting the rule proposes—even if it is negative. By extension, they also assume that it is as easy to ease policy as it is to tighten policy if certain risks materialize. In practice this is not the case.  Because our traditional tool, the federal funds rate, is already at its effective zero lower bound, we may want to react differently to a given economic outlook and set of risks than we would if policy were unconstrained.  We are certainly not completely constrained: we have additional tools such as the balance sheet and forward policy guidance that we can use to provide additional monetary policy stimulus.  But these tools have costs as well as benefits.  Moreover, we can only imperfectly translate the impact of these policy instruments into interest rate equivalents for the purposes of evaluation using simple rules.\n\nSo for many reasons, I focus my attention primarily on how we are progressing and expect to progress relative to our dual mandate objectives.  In this context, simple policy rules are an input, but my judgment also is informed by the economic environment and what we learn about the responsiveness of the economy to monetary policy.\n\nNevertheless, it is possible to translate my assessments into a language that would be more familiar to those who think in terms of a Taylor-type rule.\n\nRecall that in a Taylor Rule framework, five major parameters can be adjusted:\n\nThus, while the Taylor Rule generally is viewed as a fixed formula, its underlying framework is sufficiently flexible that such a rule could be modified to reflect certain types of new information. What values should we use?  In the United States, the inflation objective is well specified—a 2 percent annual rate for the personal consumption expenditures deflator. 6 The FOMC has formally committed itself to this objective.\n\nIn contrast, there is disagreement among FOMC participants about how far the U.S. economy is operating from potential.  Our staff forecast at the New York Federal Reserve estimates that the long-term unemployment rate is about 5 percent.  The central tendency in the most recent Summary of Economic Projections is a bit higher at 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent, but the degree of dispersion is not particularly wide.\n\nMore difficult is the judgment about what weights to put on deviations of output from potential versus deviations in expected inflation from the Fed’s inflation target.  This will differ among policymakers based on their views about the costs of deviations from the dual objectives and the structure of the economy.  This debate can be summed up by looking at the two most well-known versions of the Taylor Rule—the original version put forward by Mr. Taylor, which is commonly referred to as Taylor 1993, and a later version updated by other economists that Mr. Taylor has discussed but does not endorse, which is referred to as Taylor 1999. 7 Taylor 1999 puts more weight on deviations of output from potential than Taylor 1993.  Thus, Taylor 1999 would lead to a later liftoff of the federal funds rate as the economy returns to full employment.\n\nWhich set of weights is better is a matter of judgment. John Taylor prefers Taylor 1993.  My own thinking, when translated into Taylor Rule terms, favors the weights in the Taylor 1999 formulation.  I believe that Taylor 1999 is likely to perform better in achieving the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives.  Compared with Taylor 1993 it can achieve significantly greater stability in employment without sacrificing the medium-term inflation objective or significantly increasing the variability of inflation outcomes.\n\nFinally, the remaining parameter in the Taylor Rule is the neutral, real short-term interest rate.  This is the interest rate adjusted for inflation that neither stimulates nor slows the economy.  It is typically set at 2 percent.  Although there is no reason why the neutral real rate cannot change over time, the 2 percent rate is typically plugged in without further attention.  Whether this is appropriate is a critical question in today’s economic environment that I will return to a bit later.\n\nLet me now discuss the economic outlook, and examine some of the implications for monetary policy.  In doing so I will look at results obtained by applying some variants of the Taylor Rule, and explain some of my concerns about using simple policy rules in a mechanical way for setting monetary policy.\n\nAs I see it, the U.S. economy is continuing to slowly recover from the after-effects of the housing boom and bust and the financial crisis.  But the recovery has been disappointing. Indeed, when we look back at economic forecasts made over the past three or four years it is notable that growth has systematically fallen short of both the Federal Reserve and private-sector forecasts.\n\nDespite what has been an unusually accommodative monetary policy by historical standards, the economy has grown at only a 2.1 percent pace over the last four quarters and the Blue Chip consensus forecast only anticipates a modest acceleration to a 2.4 percent rate over the next four quarters (Figure 2) .\n\nThe headwinds retarding recovery are well known.  Consumers have been deleveraging in response to the large losses in wealth generated in large part by the collapse in home prices.  Housing activity remains depressed for many reasons.  These include the large shadow inventory making its way through the foreclosure pipeline, tight underwriting standards for new mortgage origination, and the sharp slowdown in household formation.\n\nAlthough the corporate sector as a whole is now reasonably healthy, there still is a significant constraint on the availability of credit to small business.  Fiscal policy has become restrictive as state and local governments have cut expenditures in response to revenue shortfalls;  and the uncertainty about how Congress and the Administration will address the 2013 federal “fiscal cliff” is likely to inhibit hiring and investment by business.  Global economic growth has slowed as European activity has stagnated and this is capping the demand for U.S. exports.\n\nOn the brighter side, some of these headwinds appear to be subsiding.  Employment growth has picked up somewhat (Figure 3) , which should eventually lead to faster household formation and more demand for housing.  U.S. banks are healthier so that credit conditions, while still tight, are gradually easing.  And, households appear quite far along in the deleveraging process by a number of important measures.  For example, the ratio of household debt service relative to income is back to levels last seen in early 1990s (Figure 4) .\n\nFor these reasons, I expect that growth will gradually strengthen over the next few years.  Nevertheless, significant downside risks remain, especially those related to the challenges in Europe and how the potential “fiscal cliff” in the United States will be resolved after the fall elections.  Even if these risks do not materialize, I anticipate only slow progress toward full employment.\n\nOn the inflation side, in recent years our forecasts have been noticeably more accurate than on the growth side, and we have succeeded in delivering inflation very close to our 2 percent price stability objective.  Through March, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures deflator, overall consumer prices have risen 2.1 percent over the past 12 months, and prices excluding food and energy have risen 2.0 percent (Figure 5) .\n\nBut price trends have been a bit stickier than one might have anticipated given the large amount of slack in the economy.  To some degree, this likely reflects the anchoring exerted by stable inflation expectations.  But some of the price pressures can be attributed to other, more temporary, factors:\n\nSome of these upward pressures on inflation appear to be fading. Oil and gasoline prices have fallen in recent months.  Apparel price inflation should gradually ease, given the sharp drop seen in cotton prices.  Owners’ equivalent rent should also eventually stabilize as multi-family construction picks up and programs that shift real estate owned by banks to investors so they can be rented gear up.\n\nMore generally, there are several reasons to think that inflation will remain moderate and close to our objective. First, and most obviously, the economy continues to operate with significant slack.  Second, measures of underlying inflation show little upward pressure.  In fact, one—the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Underlying Inflation Gauge—is turning down.  This measure uses a very wide set of variables to forecast the underlying inflation trend (Figure 6) . Third, it is hard to be very concerned about inflation risks when the growth rate of nominal labor compensation is so low and stable.  It is noteworthy to me that the employment cost index has risen only 2.1 percent over the past four quarters and has shown no acceleration (Figure 7) . Fourth, inflation expectations remain well-anchored (Figure 8) . This is critically important because inflation expectations are an important driver of actual inflation outcomes. Taking into account the current stance of monetary policy, I anticipate that inflation will decline to slightly below our 2 percent long-run objective over the next few years.\n\nSo what does this all imply for monetary policy?  I currently anticipate that the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate target will remain exceptionally low—that is at the current level—at least through late 2014.\n\nThis policy setting is more accommodative than the setting prescribed by the Taylor 1999 rule discussed earlier. 8 Using the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s current staff forecast, the Taylor 1999 rule—unadjusted for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet actions —implies liftoff in 2014. 9\n\nBut this is incomplete because it does not incorporate any adjustment for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet actions.  I estimate that the current balance sheet provides the equivalent of roughly 150 to 200 additional basis points of federal funds rate easing. 10 But as time passes, we will come closer to the date when the balance sheet will begin to be normalized.  This implies that the amount of stimulus from the balance sheet will gradually lessen over time.  Putting these adjustments into the Taylor 1999 formulation would pull the liftoff date to 2013 (Figure 9) .\n\nSo, why do I believe the policy that promotes the best achievable path back to our dual mandate objectives should be more accommodative than that implied by Taylor 1999—adjusted or unadjusted?  Taylor 1999, like other simple rules, does not take into account two key considerations:\n\nI don’t believe that the standard Taylor 1999 formulation is a good guide for policy right now because the neutral real rate assumption embedded in this rule of 2 percent simply doesn’t look plausible.  This is important because the degree of stimulus depends not on the current policy setting but on the difference between the current level and the neutral level. For example, a short-term rate that appears highly stimulative under standard assumptions may in fact be much less so under alternative estimates of the neutral real rate.  If the neutral real rate has fallen, as I believe it has, then the entire trajectory of short-term rates implied by Taylor 1999 shifts down and this pushes back the liftoff date implied by Taylor 1999 significantly.\n\nSo how strong is the evidence that the neutral real rate has fallen significantly at least in the short term?  First, and most importantly, if the neutral real rate were really 2 percent, then the U.S. economy should be growing faster 11 as monetary policy would be extraordinarily stimulative right now.  But, if that is the case, then why do we see such a lackluster economic performance?  Thomas Laubach and John Williams have devised a means of estimating how the equilibrium real interest rate varies over time based on how the economy has actually performed.  The estimate generated by their model for the first quarter of 2012 is 0.3 percent. 12\n\nSecond, we can identify good reasons why the neutral real rate is depressed currently. The channels through which monetary policy stimulates the economy are weaker than normal right now. 13\n\nMonetary policy works through its effect on financial conditions that influence economic activity.  Thus, the linkage between the policy setting and the economy can be affected by changes in the relationships between policy and financial conditions or between financial conditions and the economy.\n\nLet’s consider the linkage between the policy setting and financial conditions first.  In my view, the major components of financial conditions include: 1) the value of the equity market; 2) the level of real interest rates across the yield curve; 3) the level of credit spreads; 4) the availability of credit; and 5) the exchange value of the dollar.  There are certainly others, but these are probably the most important ones.  If we look at these financial indicators as a set, financial conditions do not appear to be unusually tight or easy in aggregate:\n\nSimilarly, there is evidence that the linkage between financial conditions and economic activity is attenuated as well. The most obvious example of this is the housing sector. But the subdued overall rate of credit expansion for both households and the business sector is also noteworthy. This has occurred despite a monetary policy that would be judged on its face as one of the most stimulative in history.\n\nFinally, market expectations suggest that the equilibrium real rate of interest will remain depressed.  To me, it is particularly noteworthy that the real forward interest rate expected 5 to 10 years in the future is currently only 0.3 percent.  It has been moving lower recently and is far lower than at any time in recent memory (Figure 15) . While this pattern likely reflects in part a very low term premium, it may also be driven by an assessment that the equilibrium real rate has fallen and will remain unusually low for years.\n\nThis evidence implies that current circumstances warrant the use of a significantly lower neutral real short-term rate in the Taylor Rule formulations.  As economic conditions normalize, supported by accommodative monetary policy, the neutral interest rate presumably would gradually rise back toward its long run level over time.  For example, adjusting Taylor 1999 for a zero percent neutral real rate that gradually normalizes over time would push liftoff beyond 2014 (Figure 16) .\n\nRisk management considerations also suggest that a more stimulative monetary policy than prescribed by Taylor 1999 is appropriate.  In particular, simple policy rules implicitly treat the welfare losses generated by deviations from the central forecast path symmetrically.  But I don’t believe that the potential losses are currently symmetric. In my view, the distribution of potential outcomes is currently skewed to the downside, reflecting risks posed by developments in Europe and the impending U.S. fiscal cliff.\n\nMoreover, the costs associated with such downside outcomes are likely to be considerably higher than the costs of realizing upside surprises.  For example, consider two alternative scenarios:  an economy that grows very quickly, but starting with some genuine spare capacity, versus an economy operating way below potential that stagnates, pushing the United States into a liquidity trap.\n\nIn the first case, we have good tools with which to respond.  As the economy moved closer to full employment, we could raise short-term interest rates and subsequently sell assets from our portfolio.  By doing this, we would tighten financial conditions, slow the economy and ensure it remained on a path consistent with our dual mandate objectives.  The losses to society from this scenario should not be very large, provided we act in a manner that keeps medium-term inflation expectations in check.\n\nBut the losses to society may be very high in the second case.  That is because—as Japan has discovered over the past two decades—once in a liquidity trap it is not easy to return to full employment and price stability.  Pinned at the lower bound, we don’t have as good a set of tools as we would ordinarily have to push the economy back toward our dual mandate objectives.  As a result of this asymmetry, we should give somewhat more weight to avoiding the liquidity trap outcome.\n\nEmbedded within the traditional Taylor Rule formulations is the implicit return path back to full employment and price stability that the FOMC achieved in the past when faced with shocks that pushed economic activity below its potential level. 14\n\nIn the current economic cycle, I think it is apparent that the path back to the Fed’s dual mandate objectives has been much slower than the one that the FOMC found acceptable in the past.  Growth has consistently been disappointing relative to both our own and consensus forecasts.  Recent performance and forecasts relative to the dual mandate objectives suggest that standard rules calibrated in earlier times understate the degree of accommodation required to achieve the desired return path to the dual mandate objectives.\n\nWe should focus on how fast we are moving toward our employment and inflation objectives, and be wary of the risks that we see around that path.  If progress toward the mandate objectives is slower than desired, then this is telling us that monetary policy needs to be kept at a more accommodative setting for a longer time period than a standard rule would suggest. As downside risks continue to be present, the case for accommodation is even stronger.\n\nGiven our forecast of stable prices and a still slow path back to full employment, there is an argument for easing further. But, unfortunately, our tools have costs associated with them as well as benefits.  Thus, we must weigh these costs against the benefits of further action.\n\nAs long as the U.S. economy continues to grow sufficiently fast to cut into the nation’s unused economic resources at a meaningful pace, I think the benefits from further action are unlikely to exceed the costs.  But if the economy were to slow so that we were no longer making material progress toward full employment, the downside risks to growth were to increase sharply, or if deflation risks were to climb materially, then the benefits of further accommodation would increase in my estimation and this could tilt the balance toward additional easing.\n\nUnder such circumstances, further balance sheet action might be called for. We could choose between further extension of the duration of the Federal Reserve’s existing Treasury portfolio and another large-scale asset purchase program of Treasuries or agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nConversely, I would be willing to consider tightening policy at a somewhat earlier stage if growth strengthened sufficiently to materially improve the medium-term outlook and substantially reduce tail risks, or if there was evidence of a genuine threat to medium-term inflation, including a rise in inflation expectations. In such a case, I would anticipate that the first step would be to bring in the late 2014 date of the policy guidance.  This would effectively tighten financial conditions not only by changing the expected path of short-term interest rates, but also by bringing forward the expected start of balance sheet normalization.\n\nTo sum up, I see substantial advantages in behaving in as systematic fashion as possible in setting monetary policy.  But that should be done in a way that fully accounts for any constraints on policy imposed by the economic environment, the presence of asymmetric risks, and allows us to learn as we go.  The fact is that the economy is recovering after an unusually deep recession and a severe financial crisis. We don’t have much experience with this type of episode and how the economy is likely to perform. What we need to focus on is not what interest rate a given rule generates, but what policy setting can be expected to deliver the appropriate return path to the dual mandate objectives—the type of return path that standard Taylor Rule formulations achieved in different economic circumstances in the past.\n\nThank you very much for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions. _____________________________________________________\n\n2 The policy response to the extreme shock of the financial crisis was predictably vigorous, even if its detail was hard to specify in advance, and the knowledge that the Federal Reserve would act “as needed” to promote the dual mandate anchored inflation expectations and helped to avoid a deflation outcome.\n\n3 In formal terms, this approach would be described as a target-rule or forecast-targeting rule.\n\n4 In practice, so-called inflation-targeting central banks also tend to take into account employment and other aspects of the real economy; hence, their approach is often referred to as “flexible inflation targeting.”\n\n5 More formally, a Taylor Rule can be represented as:\n\nFFR = r* + π + a(π-π*) + b[100(Y-Y*)/Y*]\n\nwhere: FFR = federal funds rate r* = neutral real federal funds rate π = rate of inflation π* = target inflation rate Y = output Y* = output at full employment a = weight put on inflation gap b = weight put on output gap\n\n6 Over the past 25 years, CPI inflation has averaged about 30 basis points to 50 basis points above PCE inflation.\n\n7 For Taylor 1993, the output gap and inflation gap parameters are both 0.5.  For the Taylor 1999 version, which updates the original formulation to take into account data over a longer period of time, the output gap parameter is 1.0: Taylor 1993  FFR=2% + π + 0.5(π-2%) + 0.5[100(Y-Y*)/Y*] Taylor 1999  FFR=2% + π +0.5(π-2%) + 1.0[100(Y-Y*)/Y*]\n\n8 In contrast, optimal control simulations using FRBUS put the federal funds rate liftoff in 2015; see Vice Chair Yellen’s speech of April 12 (http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20120411a.htm).\n\n9 For more details on this forecast, go to: http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2012/05/just-released-the-new-york-fed-staff-forecast-may-2012.html.\n\n10 This estimate should be considered very imprecise.  To generate this estimate we first need to estimate how much long-term rates have been pushed down because of the Federal Reserve balance sheet programs.  Although there is considerable uncertainty, New York Fed staff has estimated that the Fed’s programs have pushed down the term premium by about 50 basis points.\n\nThe question then becomes how much would the federal funds rate have to fall to generate the same result?  That depends on how changes in the federal funds rate pass through to longer-term interest rates.  If reductions in the federal funds rate were viewed as permanent, then the pass-through would presumably be 1 to 1.  However, if the federal funds rate reductions were viewed as fully transitory, then there would be virtually no pass-through.  Econometric estimates indicate a value of about 4 to 1, a four basis points reduction in the federal funds rate would lead to a one basis point reduction in long-term rates.  However, this degree of pass-through seems too low in the current environment in which the reductions in the federal funds rate have been in place for some time and are expected to continue for several more years.  If one assumes a parameter value of 3 to 4 and uses 50 basis points as the estimate of the balance sheet impact on longer-term rates, then this implies that these actions have been equivalent to a 150 to 200 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate currently.\n\nAs the onset of balance sheet normalization comes closer over time, the effect of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet actions on the term premium will gradually diminish.  This means that the size of the federal funds rate adjustment should also diminish over time.\n\n11 Or, if we were wrong about spare capacity, inflation should be higher.\n\n12 See Thomas Laubach and John Williams, “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics , November 2003, pp.1063-1070.  The link to the updated estimates is: http://www.frbsf.org/economics/economists/jwilliams/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xls.\n\n13 Impairment to the transmission mechanism implies that the neutral rate that neither stimulates nor slows the economy will be lower than it would otherwise be.\n\n14 Obviously, there is a cost to those who are unemployed longer than necessary with no offsetting gain in terms of greater price stability.  But there also is another potential long-run cost.  Those who have been unemployed for a long period of time may lose their job skills and become less employable in the future.  This can push up the non-inflationary rate of unemployment (NAIRU).  Not only is this bad for those who are unemployed due to the loss of their job skills, it is bad for the nation as a whole because the rise in the NAIRU lowers the effective productive capacity of the economy and, with it, the capacity of the country to service its debts.",

    "text": "It  is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today at Lehman  College.  In my remarks, I will focus on  the economic outlook—both over the near and longer term—and I will discuss some  of the important monetary policy issues that will be considered in the years  ahead, after my tenure at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is (sadly) over.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own  views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or  the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nOver  the near term, the economic outlook remains quite favorable.  I anticipate that the economy will continue  to grow at an above-trend pace in 2018 and 2019, which will put sufficient  pressure on the nation’s resources to push up inflation to the FOMC’s longer-run  2 percent objective.\n\nThere  are several reasons to be confident in this growth outlook: Monetary policy remains  accommodative, financial conditions are still easy, and the global economy is  in the midst of a synchronized expansion.   Moreover, significant fiscal policy stimulus from tax cuts and increased  federal spending will boost real household disposable income and corporate  profits, which should support further gains in consumption and capital  spending.\n\nIn  this context, I would not take much signal from the slowdown in consumer  spending in the first two months of this year.   As I see it, this slowdown was mostly due to two transitory factors: a  retrenchment following the spurt in activity from recovery efforts following Hurricanes  Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and the delay in this year’s tax refund payments to those  receiving certain tax credits. 2\n\nStrong payroll employment gains also suggest that the  slowdown in household spending will be temporary.  Over the last three months, payroll gains  have climbed to a monthly pace of 202,000 jobs, somewhat above 2017’s monthly  average of 182,000.  Robust job gains  coupled with moderate growth in labor compensation should ensure that household  incomes will continue to rise at a solid rate, even before factoring in the  impact of this year’s reduction in personal income taxes.\n\nWith respect to inflation, most of the evidence is  consistent with a slow movement toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.  On a year-over-year basis through February,  the overall Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index and the core  PCE price index—which excludes the more volatile food and energy components—have  risen by 1.8 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, from troughs of 1.4 percent  and 1.3 percent last summer.  Further  gains appear likely at the end of this month, when the sharp decline in  cellular telephone services prices that occurred a year ago drops out of the  year-over-year calculations.\n\nIn the current environment, I see three important issues regarding  the appropriate monetary policy stance:\n\nI will take each of these in turn.\n\nAs I see it, a gradual path of interest rate increases remains  appropriate.  Even though the unemployment  rate is low, inflation remains below our 2 percent objective.  As long as that is true, the case for tightening  policy more aggressively does not seem compelling.  My conclusion is reinforced by the fact that  we do not know with much precision how low the unemployment rate can go without  prompting a significant rise in inflation.   We do not directly observe the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment,  or NAIRU.  Rather, we only infer it from  the response of wage compensation and price inflation as the labor market  tightens.\n\nAlso, the U.S. labor market may have more slack than the 4.1  percent unemployment rate suggests.  Over  the past six months, the unemployment rate has remained steady despite robust  payroll gains.  As the labor market has  improved, more people have been actively seeking employment.  As a result, the labor force participation  rate has flattened out despite the ongoing aging of the workforce  population.  Furthermore, because the  U.S. labor force participation rate for prime age workers is low compared to  many advanced economies, the labor market could conceivably improve even further  before encountering significant resource constraints.\n\nThat said, the Federal Reserve should not overstay its welcome.  It is important to get monetary policy back  to a neutral setting before the labor market becomes so tight that wages and  prices begin to rise at a pace inconsistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation  objective.  Our mandate from Congress is  maximum sustainable employment and price stability—not simply a high level of  employment at one point of the business cycle.\n\nWith respect to how far the FOMC should go in removing  monetary policy accommodation, two major issues stand out.  First, what represents a neutral monetary  policy setting?  Second, under what  circumstances would it be appropriate to move beyond neutral to a restrictive  setting?\n\nUnfortunately, we do not also observe the neutral real  (i.e., adjusted for inflation) short-term interest rate, or r*.  There is a wide range of estimates at any  time, and they evolve as the economic environment changes.  For example, all else equal, continued buoyant  financial conditions amid recent and anticipated future rate hikes imply that  r* may be higher than previously estimated.   A shift to a more stimulative fiscal policy could also imply a somewhat  higher r*, at least temporarily.\n\nOne’s view of the neutral rate may also be influenced by one’s  assessment of the longer-term economic environment.  For example, if we are in a period of “secular  stagnation”—characterized by chronic excess global savings and aging  populations—then one would expect r* to remain persistently low. 3 But, if we are in a world of abating headwinds  as we recover from the financial crisis, then one would expect r* to rise over  time.  This lack of clarity about the  environment increases the degree of uncertainty about the level of r*.\n\nDespite all these uncertainties, one still has to have a  viewpoint.  In the current circumstances,  I would judge that r* over the medium term is likely to be somewhere around 1  percent.  Although that is higher than  the estimates from some models, I have nudged up my estimate because financial  conditions are still easy and fiscal policy will likely be quite stimulative in  2018 and 2019. 4\n\nIf the neutral real interest rate is around 1 percent, there  is still some distance to go before monetary policy actually gets tight.  At the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective,  my estimate of r* implies that the federal funds rate would need to rise to  around 3 percent for monetary policy to be considered neutral.  Of course, as the factors that influence r*  change, my estimate of r* will also move around over time.\n\nWhether monetary policy will need to move to a  restrictive setting depends crucially on how low the unemployment rate can go  without inflation climbing meaningfully above 2 percent.  Although the jury is still out on this  question, last month’s Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, is instructive. 5 Most FOMC participants—including me—have the  unemployment rate moving considerably below their estimate of NAIRU by 2020, with  inflation climbing slightly above 2 percent and the federal funds rate moving  above their estimates of its likely long-run value.  Thus, the March SEP implies that most FOMC participants  expect that monetary policy will need to become slightly restrictive in the  years ahead.\n\nRecent fiscal and trade policy developments are likely to  increase the uncertainty around the distance to a neutral monetary policy  stance and the possibility that the FOMC will have to move to a restrictive  stance.  The shift in fiscal policy  toward stimulus is somewhat challenging because of its timing—it is unusual to move  fiscal policy sharply in a stimulative direction at a mature stage of a  business cycle—and because the shift puts the nation’s fiscal path on an unsustainable  trajectory.  According to the projections  released earlier this month from the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, the  federal budget deficit is anticipated to exceed 4½ percent of GDP in 2019, well  above the level that would be needed to keep the federal debt-to-GDP ratio from  rising. 6 Moreover, the CBO expects that the pressures  on the budget will be substantial over the next decade, with deficit  projections ranging between 4½ and 5½ percent of GDP throughout the period.  Debt service costs will move sharply upward in  coming years as federal debt continues to grow and interest rates likely increase  further.  Additionally, entitlement  spending is likely to increase sharply as members of the baby boom generation continue  to retire—myself included. 7\n\nThe shift toward a more aggressive U.S. posture on trade  also likely increases uncertainty.  On the  one hand, such a posture could lead to revised trade agreements that provide the  United States with greater access to foreign markets and better protection of  intellectual property.  This would tend  to raise U.S. productivity and real GDP growth.   On the other hand, tougher bargaining could lead to retaliation and  higher trade barriers, here and abroad.   In contrast to the first scenario, this outcome would be quite negative—leading  to higher inflation, lower productivity, and slower potential GDP growth. 8 Over time, how U.S. trade policy evolves will  have important implications for the performance of the U.S. economy—and, by extension,  for U.S. monetary policy.  By increasing  uncertainty around the economic outlook, these shifts in fiscal and trade policy  could make it more difficult for the FOMC to achieve its dual mandate  objectives in the years ahead.\n\nLonger-term  Monetary Policy Issues\n\nOver the longer term, the FOMC will also need to address  a number of other important issues.  These  include: 1) Determining the appropriate long-term implementation framework for U.S.  monetary policy, and 2) deciding whether the strategic framework underlying  monetary policy decisions needs to be adjusted to mitigate the risks associated  with getting pinned at the effective lower bound for short-term interest rates. 9\n\nFor the first issue, I see two options: return to the “corridor”-type  system that was in place prior to the financial crisis, or remain with the framework  that has been in place since the crisis—namely, a “floor” system.  In a corridor system, reserves in the banking  system are scarce, and the federal funds rate is set by adjusting the supply of  reserves through open market operations to balance demand and supply at the FOMC’s  target range.  In contrast, in a floor  system, reserves are abundant, so that the interest rate the Federal Reserve  pays on excess reserves, or IOER, is the primary tool used to control the  federal funds rate.\n\nIn my view, the case for retaining the current floor system  is very compelling for a number of reasons.   First, it is operationally much less complex than a corridor system.  In the current regime, the setting of IOER is  largely sufficient to maintain the federal funds rate within the FOMC’s target  range, as we have seen over the past few years. 10 In contrast, a corridor system requires  forecasting the many exogenous factors that affect the amount of bank reserves  outstanding, and then engaging in open market operations on a near daily basis  to keep reserves at a level consistent with the FOMC’s target range. 11 This task would likely be more difficult now because  of greater fluctuation in these exogenous factors relative to when the corridor  regime was last in place.\n\nSecond, a corridor system constrains the Federal  Reserve’s ability to provide the types of lender-of-last-resort backstops that  can help support financial stability.   Prior to gaining the authority to pay interest on reserves in the fall  of 2008, Federal Reserve officials—myself included—were faced with a question: if  the take-down on a proposed liquidity facility were large, how would we be able  to drain the added reserves on a timely basis to maintain control of the  federal funds rate?  This was not just a  theoretical issue during the financial crisis.   The initial auctions of the Term Auction Facility, or TAF, were kept  relatively small, in part, because of concerns that larger programs would make  it more difficult for the manager of the System Open Market Account (me, in  that particular case) to drain sufficient reserves to offset the TAF reserve  additions.  Similarly, the Term  Securities Lending Facility (TSLF)—which involved the swap of Treasury  collateral from the Federal Reserve against lower-quality collateral held by  primary dealers—was introduced in large part because collateral swaps, unlike  cash loans, did not affect the amount of reserves in the banking system.  My overall point is that broad-based, open-ended  lender-of-last-resort facilities are more difficult to accommodate in a  corridor system because of the need to drain any reserve additions to keep the  federal funds rate close to the FOMC’s target.\n\nI see this as an important shortcoming of the pre-crisis corridor  regime that does not get sufficient attention.   Having the ability to introduce broad and credible lender-of-last-resort  backstops—well secured by pledged collateral—can be critical when confidence  falters and financial stability is at risk.   Private sector participants are more likely to continue to engage with  their counterparties—and to borrow and lend—when they know a central bank  backstop will be available if economic and financial conditions deteriorate.  A corridor regime could cause the Federal  Reserve to delay or avoid providing such backstops, which could increase financial  stability risks by causing lenders and borrowers to disengage with one another earlier. 12\n\nAlthough the FOMC has not made a final decision about a future framework  for implementing monetary policy, meeting minutes confirm that participants recognize  the advantages of a floor system.  As the  November 2016 FOMC minutes note: “Meeting participants commented on the  advantages of using an approach to policy implementation in which active  management of the supply of reserves would not be required….[S]uch an approach  was seen as likely to be relatively simple and efficient to administer,  relatively straightforward to communicate, and effective in enabling interest  rate control across a wide range of circumstances.” 13\n\nThe second major issue facing the FOMC is whether to  change its strategic framework to mitigate the risk of a return to the effective  lower bound for interest rates.  Once the  federal funds rate is close to zero, the FOMC is constrained in its ability to  lower short-term interest rates further, and the other available policy options  to provide monetary policy stimulus may be less effective.  If the FOMC were unable to provide sufficient  stimulus, the economy could have difficulty recovering.  In turn, inflation and inflation expectations  could fall—and thus raise real interest rates—effectively tightening monetary  policy and making the task of generating a sustainable recovery even more  difficult.\n\nSome have argued that a desirable way to reduce this risk  would be to raise the FOMC’s inflation objective from 2 percent to perhaps 3 or  4 percent.  Their reasoning is that if the  inflation objective were somewhat higher, nominal interest rates at the later  stages of the business cycle would also tend to be higher, which would provide greater  scope for the FOMC to cut short-term interest rates to stimulate the economy,  if necessary.\n\nWhile recognizing that there is a legitimate effective lower  bound risk, I do not support the option of raising the inflation objective, for  three reasons.  First, I doubt that a  higher inflation target would be viewed as consistent with the Federal Reserve’s  Congressional mandate to pursue price stability.  Our employment and inflation mandates have  been established by Congress, not by the Federal Reserve.\n\nSecond, the risks of being pinned at the effective lower  bound for interest rates may be overstated.   Only once in the postwar period have we reached the zero lower bound.  Upending several decades of effort to anchor  inflation expectations around 2 percent might be too high a price to pay to  reduce the effective lower bound risk by what might prove to be a small amount.  In this vein, it is important to recognize  that the FOMC now has a more credible set of tools available to use at the effective  lower bound than it did in 2008, when those tools were largely unproven.  Forward guidance about the path of short-term  interest rates and quantitative easing have been effective in providing monetary  policy stimulus in the post-crisis period.   Because this is now more broadly appreciated, households and businesses should  be more confident that the Federal Reserve has sufficient tools available at  the effective lower bound to generate a sustainable economic recovery.  This greater confidence, in turn, should help  keep inflation expectations from declining—which should also mitigate the risks  associated with hitting the lower bound.\n\nThird, there are arguably better ways of reducing risks  associated with the effective lower bound than a higher inflation objective.  In particular, Congress could increase the size  and scope of the automatic fiscal stabilizers that support economic activity  and income during economic downturns.  For  example, Congress could enact legislation in which employment payroll taxes would  be automatically reduced when the unemployment rate rose above a particular threshold.  With such stabilizers in place, households  and businesses would anticipate additional income support in the face of a  cyclical downturn.  This approach would  be more powerful than discretionary fiscal actions that carry a greater degree  of uncertainty.\n\nAnother option to help better anchor inflation  expectations around the current objective would be to move to a price-level  targeting, or PLT, regime.  Under the  current inflation targeting regime, the FOMC follows a “bygones are bygones”  policy: Misses of the inflation objective on one side are not deliberately  offset by subsequent misses on the other.   Therefore, when inflation runs persistently below the objective,  policymakers do not strive to push inflation above the objective in the future.   Under these conditions, the risk is that  inflation expectations will become unanchored to the downside.  In contrast, under a price-level targeting  regime, the FOMC would commit to make up any shortfalls below its 2 percent  objective by allowing inflation to climb above the objective for the time  necessary to eliminate the shortfall.  This  commitment to offsetting the period of below-target inflation with a period of  above-target inflation would, presumably, help keep inflation expectations from  becoming unanchored to the downside.\n\nHowever, a symmetric PLT regime—in which misses have to  be made up on both sides of the inflation objective—has an important shortcoming.  Compensating for inflation overshoots by  deliberately keeping inflation below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective would  increase the risk of getting pinned at the effective lower bound for interest  rates.\n\nAs a consequence, some—including former Chairman Ben  Bernanke—have proposed adopting an asymmetric PLT regime.  In such a system, misses below the objective would  be offset by misses above only when the effective lower bound was binding.  Under normal circumstances, misses above the  objective would not be offset.  Rather,  they would be treated as “bygones,” as is currently the case. 14\n\nHowever, I suspect that establishing a modified PLT  regime would present some challenges.  First,  for such a modified PLT to be effective in anchoring inflation expectations,  households and businesses would have to understand how the regime would work,  and view the Federal Reserve’s commitment as credible.  One can imagine that such credibility might  be hard to sustain during a long spell of inflation misses to the  downside.  Second, while such a regime  might be attractive in broad brush form, the devil lies in the details.  If inflation undershot for a few years, what  would the desired overshoot path look like?   How high would the FOMC permit inflation to go above its objective, and for  how long?  What would happen if the Fed  failed to fully offset past downside misses and cumulative undershoots became  sizable?\n\nMy view is that we should further study how PLT frameworks  might work in practice. 15 But, it is possible that a simpler approach  of committing to keeping the average inflation rate around 2 percent over the  medium term might be just as appealing.   It might be sufficient to better anchor inflation expectations while  avoiding the communication challenges and complexity of an asymmetric PLT  regime.\n\nIn this vein, I also would evaluate whether the inflation  goal should be recast as a range of, perhaps, 1½ to 2½ percent, from the  current 2 percent objective.  A range might  have several advantages over a point target.   First, it might be viewed as more realistic given that measured inflation  will always randomly fluctuate relative to its underlying trend. That is to  say, even if the FOMC performs its job exceedingly well, very rarely will the  inflation rate, as measured by the PCE price index, be precisely at 2 percent.  Second, having a relatively narrow range  would send a message that the FOMC is discriminating between two regimes—one in  which inflation is within the range and concerns about inflation are low,  versus another in which inflation is outside the range and concerns about  inflation are more elevated.\n\nEven so, I would not recommend shifting to such a range currently.  I would only consider doing so once the FOMC  has successfully and sustainably pushed inflation back to its 2 percent  objective.  Making such a change now  might be viewed as “moving the goal posts,” given the persistent shortfall of  inflation in recent years relative to the objective.  And, doing so now might imply a greater  tolerance for missing inflation to the low side in an asymmetric way.  That would not be desirable at a time when inflation  expectations are, if anything, too low, rather than too high relative to the FOMC’s  objective.\n\nTo sum up, the economy is broadly in a good place and the  short-term economic outlook remains favorable.   On a personal level, I am pleased that I will be leaving my current  position at a time when the FOMC is likely to be very close to its employment  and inflation objectives—recognizing, of course, the terrible damage of the  financial crisis and the long time it has taken to get here.\n\nUncertainty about trade policy and the fact that we are  now on an unsustainable fiscal path, however, have raised the longer-term risks.  With respect to monetary policy, there are a  number of important choices the FOMC will need to make in the years ahead.  I have outlined some of my preferences today:  continuing with the current floor system for the implementation of monetary  policy, and some of the steps that we could take to reduce the risk should interest  rates return to the effective lower bound in the future.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few  questions.",

    "text": "The topic of how systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) will be resolved is a very important subject.  As we saw during the financial crisis, the failure of Lehman Brothers generated huge shocks across the global financial system that led to a deep global downturn.  That is not an acceptable regime and I am very glad we are working hard to change it.\n\nI thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to make some short remarks.  Today, I’m going to take a somewhat broader view than some of the other speakers, focusing on two issues:\n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe first point I’d make is that I very much endorse the single point of entry framework for resolution as proposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  I think it is the best plan for implementing Title II given the complexity and scope of large, global financial institutions and I also think it is well-suited to the U.S. bank holding company framework.  By assigning losses to shareholders and unsecured creditors of the holding company and transferring sound operating subsidiaries to a new solvent entity, such a \"top-down\" resolution strategy will facilitate continuity for the critical services performed by the firm’s subsidiaries.  This will reduce the costs associated with the failure of the parent company and reduce the degree of disruption to financial markets and financial stability.\n\nWhile the Title II single point of entry strategy holds tremendous promise, I think it is important not to declare victory prematurely.  First, there are still significant issues about how the resolution of a large systemically complex firm would work in practice.  Second, even assuming that our efforts to overcome these challenges are ultimately fully successful, resolution is still likely to represent a \"second best\" outcome compared to preventing a systemically important financial institution from failing in the first place.  After first describing some of the current implementation challenges associated with Title II resolution, I will return to this second issue.\n\nImplementing the resolution regime on a cross-border basis remains one of the most significant challenges.  U.S. authorities are working with authorities abroad on the issues that require international collaboration, but the financial industry also has a role to play in overcoming these challenges.  I encourage the industry to promptly address the matters that require action on their part.\n\nIn particular, I am worried about two current shortcomings:\n\nUnless market participants make the appropriate contractual changes that will ensure that the entry of the parent company into Title II will not trigger the close-out provisions of those over-the-counter derivatives and other qualified financial contracts that are outside the reach of Title II’s U.S. application, foreign counterparties to the systemically important firm will tend to exercise this right whenever it is in their individual economic interest to do so.  This would create significant difficulties because such actions could greatly complicate the operations of the firm during a time when it is already under considerable stress and would propagate stress more broadly in financial markets.\n\nThere are two main options for addressing this issue, and they are not mutually exclusive.  Existing derivative contracts need to be amended and future contracts need to provide that the parent’s entry into the Title II proceeding does not trigger the close-out option, or legal changes need to be implemented abroad so that the \"one-day stay\" that applies to qualified financial contracts governed by U.S. law is enforceable against those contracts governed by foreign law.  Only by making these changes can we avoid the potential for disruptive close-outs.  I strongly encourage the ongoing efforts to address this critical issue.\n\nA second issue with respect to Title II resolution is that we cannot be certain how foreign authorities will react when the parent is put into the Title II proceeding.  While the U.S. authorities have been in discussion with our colleagues abroad to enable the coordination needed for a smooth cross-border resolution process, we cannot always be certain of the circumstances under which host authorities may choose to take or be required to take actions such as unilateral \"ring-fencing\" that might disrupt the implementation of the single point of entry approach.  Thus, we need to continue to work with foreign regulators to iron out any issues ahead of time so that the resolution regime will work well for global, systemically important firms.\n\nThe smooth operation of a resolution proceeding also depends on the existence of adequate liquidity in the early days of the process.  One of the key pillars of Title II is that, unlike a bankruptcy proceeding, the FDIC will have access to liquidity from the U.S. Treasury to help ensure an effective resolution.  While this access provides significant support for an effective resolution, it will still be important for the resolution authorities to provide clarity about the timing and the amount of liquidity resources that will be made available after a firm enters into resolution.  This clarity will likely be necessary in order to calm creditors and markets at the time of resolution.  Under the single point of entry framework, the intent is to create a highly capitalized bridge entity so that counterparties will be willing to stay engaged based upon the improved creditworthiness of the bridge parent and its recapitalized subsidiaries.  If successful, this will reduce the need for the up-front provision of external liquidity resources.  Nevertheless, to make the viability of the bridge entity fully credible, market participants must believe that the bridge company has access in a timely way to whatever additional liquidity resources might prove necessary.\n\nIn addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, Title II is not the baseline or preferred approach for dealing with the failure of a large complex firm.  For a firm to go through Title II, a determination must first be made that the failure of the firm and its resolution would have serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability under the insolvency law that would otherwise apply.  Because market participants will not know for certain which path U.S. authorities will ultimately take—allowing resolution under ordinary insolvency law, as contemplated under Title I, or instead initiating a Title II resolution—this uncertainty in and of itself could cause investors in short-term obligations that are likely to be protected under Title II to run.\n\nSeveral other issues are also worthy of note.  First, for the Title II single point of entry strategy to work properly, there needs to be a sufficient amount of debt outstanding at the parent company that can be converted by the FDIC into equity to ensure that the bridge company will be demonstrably well-capitalized.  We don’t yet have a long term debt requirement—this is an area where we are still working out the details.  My own view is that a holding company needs a substantial amount of long term-debt to ensure that the newly created bridge company is viewed as fully viable by its counterparties.\n\nWe also need to ensure that the holding company is structured so that the bridge bank formed upon resolution can easily downstream capital to its operating subsidiaries.  The ability to do this will help reduce the risks of preemptive ring-fencing by foreign regulators and runs by counterparties of the foreign operations of U.S. firms.\n\nTurning to the second main theme I would like to discuss, resolution is being offered up by some as not only a necessary element of the solution to the too big to fail problem (a proposition I agree with), but also as an entirely sufficient solution that eliminates the need for heightened prudential standards to reduce the probability of failure in the first place.  The argument is based on the view that, in resolution, shareholders’ equity will be wiped out and that some portion of the long-term debt will be converted to equity.  The prospect of this outcome will, it is argued, lead to a disciplining effect by the parent company’s long-term debt holders, who will demand higher yields now that the prospect of failure is credible.  This, in turn, will help to eliminate the implicit subsidy of too big to fail.  Under this theory, Title II would also limit the incentives for firms to become larger and more complex in order to gain this funding subsidy.\n\nBy itself, however, Title II does not entirely eliminate the advantages of being large and complex.  That is because large, complex firms are more likely to go through Title II than smaller, less complex bank holding companies, who will generally go through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding.  Also, only large firms will benefit from Title II’s one-day stay on qualified financial contracts.  Finally, under the Title II resolution regime, the businesses and the franchise value of the subsidiary-level customer relationships will be maintained relative to a traditional bankruptcy proceeding, which in the past has often led to the liquidation of the bankrupt entity.  As we saw in the case of Lehman Brothers, for financial firms, bankruptcy can destroy considerable value.\n\nThis isn’t an argument against Title II resolution.  Dodd-Frank’s addition of Title II to the resolution toolkit was an important advance to regulators’ ability to mitigate financial instability.  But we must recognize that Title II by itself it is not sufficient to eliminate the advantages of being perceived as too big to undergo ordinary bankruptcy at the holding company level.\n\nMoreover, even with a viable Title II resolution regime in place, we must recognize that there still will be disruption to the financial system when a large firm fails.  This suggests to me that while a Title II single point of entry resolution is a very useful tool that we should continue to develop, we should view it as more preferable to prevent the failure of the SIFI in the first place.\n\nIn this regard, I think we have made considerable progress by raising capital and liquidity requirements for large, complex firms.  In addition to the role of these requirements in reducing the probability of failure, higher capital and liquidity requirements for large, complex firms also have the ancillary benefit of offsetting any residual competitive advantage that might remain for SIFIs because of how they are likely to be treated under Title II resolution.\n\nThe Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress tests are important in this regard because they make the capital requirements for large, complex institutions forward looking.  What matters is not just the current capital ratio, but also what the capital ratio could be if a stress environment were to materialize.  The CCAR process is also useful because it focuses on the quality of the bank’s capital planning processes.  It is not sufficient just to have enough capital; the bank’s management and directors need to be able to evaluate the bank’s ongoing capital needs in a thoughtful and thorough manner.\n\nThe responsibility of the management of a large, complex firm does not end with capital planning.  Firms’ managers need to ensure that they can respond to financial or operational weakness of any type by having robust recovery plans that get triggered long before resolution becomes necessary.  Firms should develop and track metrics that not only identify when they are on the verge of insolvency or default, but also trigger appropriate remediation actions whenever the firm begins to become stressed.  These plans should identify actionable options that the firm can take in response to financial weakness that will restore the confidence of the firm’s counterparties in the firm without the need for extraordinary official sector support.  Firms must also have disciplined processes that analyze the root causes of their problems and identify longer-term strategies that will need to be employed as other recovery options to restore capital and liquidity are being executed.  And firms must support the viability of their contingency and recovery plans by implementing the internal governance necessary to develop, test, update and implement them credibly.\n\nThere is also more work that we, as supervisors, can do to reduce the probability of failure and to incent firm managers to act well before resolution becomes necessary.  We need to do more to create incentives to force banks to act sooner to steer away from impending icebergs—cut capital distributions earlier, raise new capital faster, restructure businesses sooner, and restructure senior management and boards of directors more radically when the firm is not performing well.  For example, one approach might be to implement a long-term debt requirement in a way that enhances market discipline.\n\nAnother reform would be to reduce the incentives of large, complex firms to rely on short-term wholesale funding to finance longer-term, illiquid assets.  Among other benefits, reducing a firm’s susceptibility to sudden runs associated with short-term wholesale funding will lengthen the \"runway\" for management to implement the strategic actions that would restore the firm to health.\n\nLet me conclude by emphasizing that these two paths—reducing the financial stability costs associated with the failure of a systemically important financial firm versus applying tougher capital and liquidity standards for such firms that reduce the probability of failure—are complements not substitutes.  We need to keep pushing forward with both approaches in order to make the financial system more resilient and robust.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak with you here today.   In my remarks, I will assess the outlook for the U.S. economy and the progress that the Federal Reserve has made toward its dual mandate objectives of maximum employment in the context of price stability.  I will argue that we are now closer to achieving these objectives.  That is the reason why the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) ended its latest Treasury and agency MBS asset purchase program last month.  But we still have further to go.  Although the U.S. labor market has shown substantial improvement, there still is a meaningful gap between where we are and full employment.  Also, inflation continues to undershoot the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.\n\nThis argues for patience with respect to the timing of lift-off of the federal funds rate and the beginning of the normalization of monetary policy.  Although patience is appropriate, if all goes well, I anticipate that we will begin to raise short-term rates sometime next year.  That would be a welcome development, because it would indicate that the U.S. economy has largely recovered from the damage caused by the housing boom and bust, and the financial crisis.\n\nHowever, we need to be mindful that this shift in policy most likely will be accompanied by some degree of market turbulence.  Moreover, the normalization of U.S. monetary policy could create significant challenges for those emerging market economies (EMEs) that have been the recipients of large capital inflows in recent years.  This leads to an important question: what can the Federal Reserve do to address these risks?\n\nI will make three observations about the potential international spillovers from normalizing U.S. monetary policy.  First, what we may see in terms of market strains and macroeconomic adjustment during this normalization process will not be new.  Changes in Fed policy, and especially the tightening of monetary policy, have often created challenges for countries abroad, especially EMEs.  Second, these EMEs, as a group, are better equipped today to handle those challenges than in the past.  This reflects the fundamental improvements and stronger policy frameworks that many of these countries have put in place over the past 15 years.  Third, given the dollar’s role as the global reserve currency, the Federal Reserve has a special responsibility to manage U.S. monetary policy appropriately in order to promote global financial stability.\n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook and the Implications for Monetary Policy\n\nSince the official end of the Great Recession more than five years ago, the U.S. economy has grown at a disappointing 2.3 percent annualized rate.  Several times over that period, it appeared that growth was breaking out on the upside and forecasts were raised, but each time such hopes were disappointed.  We are again at a similar junction.  Over the past two quarters, the pace of economic growth has picked up.  In particular, real GDP rose at a 3.5 percent annual rate last quarter, and is widely expected to grow at around a 2½ to 3 percent annual rate through the end of 2015.\n\nThis time, however, I believe that we are less likely to be disappointed.  That is because several of the various “headwinds” that have impeded U.S. economic activity in recent years have subsided.  This allows the improving underlying fundamentals to exert themselves more forcefully.  For example, fiscal restraint, which had a significant impact on economic growth last year, has abated, and is likely to disappear altogether next year.  Credit availability has also improved, reflecting healthier bank balance sheets and improving job and income prospects for potential borrowers.  In addition, the excess supply of housing that built up during the boom of the previous decade has been worked off.\n\nThis lessening of headwinds has allowed supportive financial market conditions spurred, in part, by very accommodative monetary policy to shine through.  As a result, I expect that both consumption and business investment spending will strengthen over the next few quarters.  On the consumer side, household balance sheets are now healthier, reflecting higher aggregate household net worth relative to income and less leverage.  Also, sturdy employment gains and falling energy prices are boosting real income growth.  Together with accommodative financial conditions, this should lend support to further gains in consumer spending.\n\nSimilarly, despite some recent market turbulence, conditions on the business side are supportive to sustained gains in investment.  Credit to businesses is generally readily available, cash flows are strong and corporate balance sheets are healthy.\n\nThe energy sector is another bright spot that has been supporting business investment and the U.S. economy.  New extraction technologies have had a dramatic impact on this sector, with natural gas production up 15 percent since 2010, and crude oil production up a remarkable 35 percent. 2 Moreover, natural gas prices have fallen significantly in recent years and are far lower than those in most other industrialized economies.  These developments have dramatically boosted jobs and incomes in these industries, with beneficial spillovers to manufacturing competitiveness more generally.\n\nOf course, as with any forecast, there is some meaningful chance that growth will turn out to be either weaker or stronger than expected.  However, I believe that the risks around this forecast are reasonably well balanced, and that the likelihood that growth will be substantially weaker or stronger than the forecast is relatively low.  The subsiding headwinds that I discussed earlier are the primary reason for seeing the downside risks as limited.  At the same time, there are a few factors that suggest that there is a relatively low likelihood of growth ending up substantially above the forecast.\n\nThree considerations seem important for assessing the degree of upside risk to growth.  First, the upside from housing is likely limited compared to what one might expect under more normal conditions.  We have seen an impressive recovery of multi-family housing starts over the past few years.  In contrast, starts of single-family homes remain at low levels despite the fact that home prices have risen substantially over the past two years and mortgage rates have remained low.  A contributing factor is that mortgage lenders continue to be extremely risk averse, and mortgage credit to those with lower credit scores is still significantly constrained.  There is little on the horizon that would lead me to believe that this situation will change in a material way any time soon.  Second, because motor vehicle sales are now close to their pre-recession levels, the future growth impetus from this cyclical sector probably will also be restrained.  Finally, growth in the rest of the world has slowed and the dollar has appreciated somewhat.  This will limit the growth in U.S. exports, and suggests that the trade sector is unlikely to be a strong wind at the back of the U.S. economy over the next year or two.\n\nWith respect to prices, inflation has been running somewhat below the Federal Reserve’s objective of a 2 percent annualized rate for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator.  For example, over the past twelve months, the overall PCE deflator has risen by 1.4 percent, and the core PCE deflator, which excludes food and energy, has increased by 1.5 percent.  Moreover, for the next few months, inflation is likely to moderate further as the impact of falling gasoline prices and the firmer dollar feed into the official U.S. inflation statistics.  Thereafter, I expect that inflation will begin to move back towards our 2 percent objective, pushed there as slack in the economy continues to diminish and pulled there by well-anchored inflation expectations.\n\nIn assessing inflation expectations, I currently put more weight on survey-based measures of inflation expectations as opposed to market-based measures.  Survey-based measures have been generally stable, consistent with inflation expectations remaining well-anchored.  However, market-based measures, such as those based on breakeven inflation derived from the difference between yields on nominal versus Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), have registered declines over the past few months, even on a 5-years forward basis.  Research done by my staff suggests that much of this decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation reflects a fall in the inflation risk premium—that is, what investors are willing to pay to protect themselves against inflation risk.  Adjusting for the fall in the inflation risk premium, inflation expectations appear to have declined much less than implied by TIPS inflation breakeven measures.\n\nSo what does this assessment of the outlook imply for monetary policy?  Since September 2012, when the last program of asset purchases was announced, there has been substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.  Because the asset purchase program had fulfilled the FOMC’s stated objectives, the FOMC decided to end the program last month.  At the same time, it still is premature to begin to raise interest rates—there remains slack in the labor market and the inflation rate is still too low.  Hence, the last FOMC statement states: “The Committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month.”  But this sentence should not be viewed as an iron-clad commitment.  As the statement goes on to say: “However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated.  Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.”  In other words, what the FOMC does going forward will depend on how the economy evolves, and how this affects the labor market and the inflation outlook.\n\nIn considering the appropriate timing of lift-off, there are three important reasons to be patient.  First, the Committee is still undershooting both its employment and inflation objectives.  Unemployment is too high and inflation is too low.  Thus, monetary policy needs to be very accommodative in order to close these gaps relative to the Committee’s objectives.  Second, when interest rates are at the zero lower bound, the risks of tightening a bit too early seem considerably greater than the risks of tightening a bit too late.  A premature tightening might lead to financial conditions that are too tight, resulting in a weaker economy and an aborted lift-off.  This would be problematic in that it would harm the Fed’s credibility and, more importantly, would be difficult to rectify.  The U.S. experience during the Great Depression and the Japanese experience over the past two decades illustrate the risks of raising interest rates too soon, especially when inflation is running below the central bank’s objective.  Finally, given the still high level of long-term unemployment, there could be a significant benefit to allowing the economy to run “slightly hot” for a while in order to get these people employed again.  If they are not employed relatively soon, their job skills will erode further, reducing their long-term prospects for employment and, therefore, the productive capacity of the U.S. economy.\n\nAll that said, I hope the economic outlook evolves so that it will be appropriate to begin to raise interest rates sometime next year.  While raising interest rates is often portrayed as a difficult task for central bankers, in fact, given the events since the onset of the financial crisis, it would be a development to be truly excited about.  Raising interest rates would signal that the U.S. economy is finally getting healthier, and that the Fed is getting closer to achieving its dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  That would be very good news, even if it were to cause a bump or two in financial markets.\n\nGlobal Implications of U.S. Monetary Policy Normalization\n\nLet me now turn to the implication of U.S. policy normalization for foreign economies. Like other central banks, our monetary policy mandate has a domestic focus.  Our monetary policy actions, though, often have global implications that feed back into the U.S. economy and financial markets, and we need to always keep this in mind.  For most of us, the market volatility that we saw in the spring and summer of 2013 during the so-called “taper tantrum” still remains fresh in our minds.  EME financial markets were hit the hardest, with declines in equity prices, a widening in sovereign debt spreads and a sharp increase in foreign exchange rate volatility.  In the U.S., we saw a spike in Treasury yields, with the 10-year rate rising by more than 100 basis points from early May before peaking in early September.\n\nMost commentary about the catalyst for these moves has focused on the shift in expectations with respect to U.S. monetary policy—and, in particular, to uncertainty about the timing and implications of Fed tapering.  This focus seems generally right to me, although other factors also played a role.\n\nFrom one perspective, the unconventional nature of recent U.S. monetary policy adds little that is fundamentally new to the challenges that face EMEs.  These policies simply represent a way of easing that was necessitated by hitting the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate.  Central bankers have managed differences across countries in cyclical positions and policy stances many times in the past.  This time should not be fundamentally different.\n\nBut, from another perspective, we have less experience operating with unconventional monetary policy, and this creates more potential uncertainties.  These uncertainties put a premium on keen listening skills on our part and clear communication among central bankers as well as between central bankers and market participants.  In my view, an important fact is that our large scale asset purchase programs affect the size of term risk premia globally.  This new set of monetary policies affects financial asset prices in a different way compared to changes in short-term interest rates, and we should be humble regarding what we claim to understand about this distinction.\n\nLooking ahead, it seems likely that markets will remain focused on vulnerabilities that they might have ignored prior to the taper tantrum in 2013.  The greater premium on strong fundamentals, policy coherence and predictability will likely remain.  There will be no one right answer in managing the trade-offs that come with the changed environment, and adjustment will sometimes be difficult.  We will undoubtedly experience further bumps in the road.  The renewed volatility we saw last month is evidence enough of that.  Yet, I think we can remain generally optimistic about the prospects for adjustment so long as market participants continue to appropriately discriminate across countries, rather than treating EMEs as a single group.\n\nFurthermore, many EMEs generally appear to be better equipped today to handle the Fed's prospective exit from its exceptional policy accommodation than they were during past tightening cycles.  This reflects the fundamental reforms that EMEs have put in place over the past 15 years, as well as the hard lessons learned from past periods of market stress. Among the positives are:\n\nOf course, progress has not been uniform across EMEs, and more work remains to further strengthen institutional structures in some countries.  In particular, vulnerabilities remain in several important EMEs, and some EMEs are now being hit by a sharp adverse turn in their terms of trade due to the recent fall in global commodity prices.  Still, the fundamental improvements I’ve cited leave many EMEs better positioned than in the past to weather those times in the cycle when the external environment becomes more difficult.\n\nThe impact that changes in Fed policy can have beyond our borders has led to calls for us to do more to internalize those impacts, or even further, to internationally coordinate policymaking.  As I’ve already noted, we are mindful of the global effects of Fed policy, given the central place of U.S. markets in the global financial system and the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency.  Accordingly, we seek to conduct policy transparently and based on clear principles.  Promoting growth and stability in the U.S., I believe, is the most important contribution we can make to growth and stability worldwide.\n\nThere is, of course, the argument that Fed policy has been too accommodative for too long, creating risks for financial stability worldwide.  Here, I think it’s important to consider carefully the counterfactual.  Would countries beyond our borders really have been better off with a weaker U.S. economy—an economy that might have required exceptional monetary policy accommodation for a much longer period of time?  The fundamental issue is whether U.S. monetary policy has helped support our dual objectives of maximum employment in the context of price stability, and whether this support is consistent with a healthy global economy.\n\nMoreover, it is far from clear that explicitly coordinated policy would produce better outcomes for the global economy generally, or EMEs specifically.  Central banks face enough challenges in tailoring policies to their own domestic circumstances.  I believe that it would be taking on too much to attempt to collectively fashion policy in reference to global conditions.  Monetary policy meant to suit everybody is likely in the end to suit nobody.  Similar considerations underlie the widespread move in the emerging world away from fixed exchange rate regimes.  Policymakers worldwide have learned that a framework capable of responding in a disciplined but flexible manner to changing domestic conditions works best over the long run.\n\nWhile explicit coordination looks neither feasible nor desirable, there is more that central banks in general, and the Fed in particular, could do to be better global stewards.  As an example, recent events demonstrate the importance of effective Fed communication.  It is clear, in retrospect, that our attempts in the spring of 2013 to provide guidance about the potential timing and pace of tapering confused market participants.  Market participants seemed to conflate the prospective tapering of asset purchases with monetary policy tightening, and pulled forward their expectations about the likely timing of liftoff and raised their expected paths for policy rates.  Lately, we seem to have done better: market participants now seem to share the Committee’s current assessment that policy rates will likely remain exceptionally low for a considerable period of time, even now that the asset purchase program has been completed.\n\nAs you know, we’ve taken a number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve our communications.  This includes regular press conferences by the Fed chair following FOMC meetings; the publishing of growth, inflation and short-term rate forecasts of FOMC participants; and a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at to assess progress toward our mandate.  We are, though, still learning how to more effectively communicate, especially given our new and expanded set of policy instruments.\n\nA second area in which we can and must do better is safeguarding financial stability.  Simply put, we failed to act both early enough and decisively enough to stem the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  The U.S. was not alone in this shortcoming, but given our position in the global financial system, we especially should have done better.  We've taken important steps through new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory and supervisory framework.  In particular, systemically important banking organizations must now hold amounts of capital and liquidity that are better aligned with their risk profiles, and the official sector is making progress in ensuring no financial firm will be too-big-to-fail.\n\nAll of this remains very much a work in progress.  But, these efforts should help us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the recent past, and enable us to take a more proactive stance toward mitigating potential future vulnerabilities.  Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here.  Since the recent financial crisis, central banks worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how to better fulfill their mandates.\n\nLet me close with a final thought.  The largest problems that countries create for others often emanate from getting policy wrong domestically.  Recession or instability at home is often quickly exported.  Equally important, growth and stability abroad makes all our jobs easier.  This means that there are externalities in the work we do, so that more effective fulfillment of our domestic mandates helps to bring us collectively to a better place.  Ensuring global growth and stability is and will remain our joint and common endeavor.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n1 Agria Sbordone, Thomas Klitgaard, Jonathan McCarthy and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing this speech.\n\n2 See Table 1.2 in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Monthly Energy Review, October 2014.",

    "text": "Good afternoon.  I am pleased to be here today at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).  It is always a pleasure to speak with members of the different communities that make up our region, and it is particularly exciting to have the opportunity to speak with the students and faculty here at the Lally School of Management and Technology.  Much of my day in the Albany area has been focused on the intersection of technology, the workforce and innovation, so it is a pleasure to speak with the people who are the future leaders in this fascinating evolution.\n\nMy meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy. Earlier on this trip, I met with government and business leaders to learn about some of the challenges the region faces as well as the collaborative efforts being taken to further economic development.  I listened to community leaders describe the problems in affordable housing, workforce development and employment facing many in the lower income communities.  I was also impressed by the potential innovations in energy production at the GE Global Research Center.  These could have large consequences not only in the United States but in developing nations as well.\n\nWe plan these trips so I can meet with a diverse array of representatives.  This allows me to get a comprehensive picture of economic conditions in the region and a fuller understanding of the major issues and concerns. This is our fifth trip to Upstate New York in the past few years. Other recent trips have taken us to Northern New Jersey, the boroughs of New York City, Long Island and Fairfield County, Connecticut.\n\nMy outreach trips complement the ongoing efforts of the New York Fed to assess conditions in the Upstate New York economy and throughout our District. We monitor economic performance on a monthly basis through special indexes we have created and through our monthly surveys of New York State manufacturers and business leaders in the non-manufacturing sector. We also get important input on economic conditions from our Upstate Advisory Board, whose members play important roles in the Upstate economy. We conduct a biannual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and availability.  The results of one particular poll led us to develop a series of clinics for small businesses to help them take the next step to access capital and identify new sources of funding.  We have constructed a consumer credit panel that allows us to better understand the financial condition of U.S. households and students. More recently, we extended this national analysis to include more detail about the states in our district, including a profile of households in New York State and the Albany area.  We look at how much consumers are borrowing, what they are borrowing for and if they are experiencing difficulties in making their payments.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are always eager to engage with students, and our commitment to the region includes a number of educational programs worth highlighting. First, Math x Economics , which encourages students attending schools serving lower-income families to consider a career in finance or economics. And, second, our yearly Fed Challenge competitions, in which teams of students from high schools and colleges in the District take on the roles of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and debate what the appropriate next step is for U.S. monetary policy.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues fully engaged with the communities we represent.\n\nLet me now review recent developments in the national and regional economy, and at the end of my talk, I will be happy to answer questions you may have about the economic outlook.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nSince the official end of the Great Recession more than five years ago, the U.S. economy has grown at a disappointing 2.2 percent compound annual rate. Several times over that period it looked as though growth was breaking out on the upside, but each time such hopes were dashed.\n\nWe are again at a similar junction.  A wide array of economic indicators now suggest that growth in the U.S. has picked up and is widely expected to be around 3 percent during the second half of 2014 and in 2015.\n\nThese forecasts seem quite reasonable to me and are consistent with views I have expressed in the past.  Various “headwinds” have been impeding economic activity, but some of these forces have gradually subsided, allowing the substantially improved underlying fundamentals to exert themselves more forcefully. For example, fiscal restraint, which was a big factor last year, has subsided and is likely to disappear altogether next year.  Credit availability has also improved, reflecting healthier bank balance sheets and improving job and income prospects for prospective borrowers.  In addition, the excess supply of housing built up over the boom of the previous decade has been worked off, and both home prices and rents suggest that the supply of housing is not keeping pace with demand.\n\nThis has allowed supportive financial market conditions, spurred, in part, by a very accommodative monetary policy, to shine through.  As a result, aggregate household net worth has climbed relative to income and consumer balance sheets are healthier.  On the business side,  financial markets conditions suggest that risk aversion has  subsided,  leading to some firming in business investment spending. All of these developments help boost the confidence of consumers and businesses that this consensus forecast will in fact unfold.\n\nOf course, as with any forecast, there is some meaningful chance that growth will be either weaker or stronger than the point forecast.  While I believe that the risks around this consensus forecast are reasonably well balanced, I also believe that the likelihood that growth will be substantially stronger than the point forecast is probably relatively low.\n\nSeveral factors lead me to this conclusion. First, despite the fact that the household deleveraging process appears to be largely over and aggregate household net worth has been restored to pre-crisis levels, consumer spending is not as strong as one might expect given these conditions.  As a result, the personal saving rate is currently significantly above what the historical relationship between household net worth and personal saving would suggest.  There are several potential explanations for this development.  Access to credit, while certainly improved, is probably still not fully restored, particularly for those with less than sterling credit histories.  It is also quite likely that, in the wake of the deep recession and relatively sluggish growth of the past five years, households have higher than normal levels of precautionary saving.\n\nAnother reason for seeing less than normal upside risk for consumer spending is that the growth stimulus from the consumer durable goods cycle is likely to weaken going forward. For example, sales of light-weight motor vehicles have steadily recovered from a low of 9.4 million units (annual rate) at the depths of the recession to an average of nearly 17 million units over the three months ending in September.  The fastest pace of sales in the previous business cycle was 17 million units for all of 2005. While there may be some additional upside potential to these sales given the quite long period over which they were depressed relative to fundamentals, it seems unlikely that they will continue to grow at the rate they have over the past few years.\n\nHousing is another area where the upside risks are likely to be less than what we might expect under more normal conditions.  We have seen an impressive recovery of multi-family housing starts over the past few years. However, starts of single-family homes continue to languish at relatively low levels despite the fact that home prices have risen substantially over the past two years and mortgage rates remain quite low.  Mortgage lenders continue to be extremely risk averse and mortgage credit to those with lower credit scores is still significantly constrained.  There is nothing on the horizon that would lead me to believe that situation will change in a material way any time soon.\n\nLastly, over the past few months the exchange value of the dollar has appreciated while growth prospects of key trading partners, particularly the Euro Area, have dimmed.  Of course, the appreciation of the dollar is likely due in part to increasing confidence that growth prospects in the U.S. have improved.  Therefore, this development does not mean we should abandon the consensus forecast. Rather, as with the other issues I have discussed, I view this development as limiting the upside risk to that forecast.\n\nDespite the limiting factors discussed above, the pace of growth envisioned in the consensus forecast implies that overall labor market conditions will continue to improve. But there is a great deal of uncertainty about the resulting path of the unemployment rate, with some forecasters expecting a fairly steep decline to around 5 percent by the end of 2015, while others anticipate a much more gradual decline.\n\nIn addition to how strong output grows, the ultimate path of the unemployment rate will also depend on the behavior of productivity growth and the labor force participation rate.  The labor force participation rate has declined a great deal since 2007, the previous cyclical peak, due to a combination of demographic factors and protracted cyclical weakness in labor demand. The behavior of the participation rate and its likely future path is an issue we continue to monitor and study intently.  While I still believe that the participation rate could move back up again as the demand for labor strengthens, I am less confident about this than earlier as the downward trend in participation rates has persisted even as the labor market has improved.  What I can say with greater certainty is that there still is a significant underutilization of labor market resources.  I come to this conclusion after assessing many labor market indicators, not just the level of the unemployment rate.  For example, the fact that the rate of growth of labor compensation costs remains so subdued is consistent with this conclusion.\n\nWith respect to prices, inflation has been running somewhat below the Federal Reserve’s objective of a 2 percent annualized rate for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator.  The latest Congressional Budget Office forecast has the four-quarter percent change of the core PCE deflator moving up from 1½ percent in the second quarter of 2014 to 1.9 percent by the fourth quarter of 2015. As with growth, I find this forecast to be quite reasonable, but would argue that the risks are on the side that inflation moves upwards more slowly than this. First, the appreciation of the dollar and weakening of foreign growth prospects that I mentioned earlier both act to dampen inflation pressures.  Second, energy production in the U.S. is rising much faster than I would have guessed just a few years ago, helping to reduce energy prices which in turn reduces a wide range of production and distribution costs.  Lastly, I would note that research suggests that inflation expectations play a very important role in the inflation process. Those expectations remain well anchored at the present time, despite concerns by some that the amount of slack in the economy has declined substantially.  I am quite confident that those expectations will remain well anchored in the future, limiting the increase in inflation set in motion by faster growth and further reductions in slack.\n\nSo what does this imply for monetary policy?  We have made substantial progress with respect to the labor market outlook since we began our current program of large scale asset purchases in 2012.  Because it looks very likely that the program will have fulfilled its objectives, I expect to support a decision to end the asset purchase program at the end of this month.  At the same time, it still is premature to begin to raise interest rates—the labor market still has too much slack and the inflation rate is too low.  The consensus view is that lift-off will take place around the middle of next year.  That seems like a reasonable view to me.   But, again, it is just a forecast.  What we do will depend on the flow of economic news and how that affects the economic outlook.  For example, firmer growth, higher inflation, and a more rapid tightening of the labor market could cause us to move earlier.  Conversely, should economic growth disappoint, the timing of lift-off could be pushed later.\n\nI hope the economy cooperates.  If it does and lift-off begins sometime next year, that will be something to be very excited about.  It will signal that the economy is finally getting healthier and that the Fed is getting closer to achieving its dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. That would be very good news even if it were to cause a bump or two in financial markets.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nLet me now turn to economic conditions a bit closer to home. While Upstate New York outperformed the nation during the Great Recession, it has now returned to its more typical pattern of modest growth. This is not unexpected as many regions in the Northeast have tended to grow more slowly in recent decades as the population has shifted to other parts of the country and as jobs in the once dominant manufacturing industry have diminished. That being said, some parts of the region are really struggling: Syracuse, Utica, Binghamton and Elmira have all yet to see a meaningful recovery in employment, which is troubling.\n\nThe Capital region, on the other hand, is a true bright spot. While Upstate New York as a whole has gained back only a little more than half of the jobs lost during the Great Recession, Albany is close to regaining all of the jobs that were lost. Though the Capital region’s public sector has exerted some downward pressure on job growth during the recovery, the education and health care sectors have been an ongoing source of stability and strength for the region. Employment in the education sector has climbed nearly 25 percent since the end of the recession, an increase of around 5,000 jobs, and the health care sector has added about 3,000 jobs.\n\nAnd there’s some especially good news to report from the Capital region’s manufacturing sector: jobs are growing, and growing quite strongly—a testament to the success of the area’s burgeoning high tech sector. Since the recovery began, the area has added over 4,000 manufacturing jobs, many of which are tied to computers and electronics. That’s an increase of nearly 25 percent. This pace of job growth is four times as great as the national pace. In fact, there are now more people employed in the Capital region’s manufacturing sector than before the recession. Not many places can say that, and this is certainly not true for the nation as a whole.\n\nIn part, the success of local manufacturing reflects the presence of strong partnerships between industry and higher education. These cooperative arrangements, which help in the creation, development and commercialization of new products and processes, drive innovation and put local companies at the leading edge of technology. Moreover, these partnerships directly support local jobs. Not only are students gaining real world experience by working in shared facilities while they are in school, but strong connections between local businesses and higher education institutions help workers train for jobs that are available, and help employers find the skilled workers they need. During my last trip to the region, I saw firsthand how universities and companies can successfully work together during my visits to the State University of New York Nanotech Center and the production facilities at Global Foundries.\n\nOf course, RPI has a long history of developing cutting edge technologies and fostering start-up companies. RPI’s Emerging Ventures Ecosystem initiative provides an excellent example of how a leading university can help local firms access the knowledge and intellectual property provided by its faculty and students. These types of collaborations are a key ingredient to improving the competitiveness of local businesses and increasing the relevance of the universities to the communities they serve.  We should take every opportunity to exploit these partnerships as much as possible to unleash their full potential. The strong foundation that has already been built has clearly been successful, and I expect these partnerships will support the region’s economic vitality going forward.\n\nCollege Graduates Finding Jobs\n\nFinally, I know that many of you here today are students, and you may be concerned about your ability to find a good job upon graduation. There is no doubt that this is a difficult time to be graduating from college and starting your career. While finding a job has gotten a bit easier over the past few years, finding a good job can still be a challenge. Indeed, research we’ve conducted at the New York Fed finds that underemployment among recent college graduates has continued to climb even as the unemployment rate has fallen. This is a troubling trend, and one we are actively trying to better understand.\n\nDespite the challenges now facing recent college graduates, I want to assure you that the value of a college degree remains high. While the Great Recession and its aftermath have made it more difficult to find a job out of college these past few years, those without a college degree have had an even tougher time. Students who major in technical fields—such as engineering, mathematics and computer science—have tended to have a much easier time finding a good job and have earned a high return on their educational investment.  Although it is true that the labor market has been difficult for college graduates in recent years, I am confident that most of you will find good jobs, especially as the labor market continues to improve.\n\nThank you for your kind attention and I would now be happy to take some questions.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to be here today and to have the opportunity to talk about the potential use of macroprudential tools in the United States.\n\nBefore I respond to Adam Posen, I’d like to make a few general comments on macroprudential tools.  I am interested in such tools both as a U.S. policymaker and in my role as chair of the Committee on the Global Financial System of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), a body that has done considerable work in this area in recent years.  What I have to say today represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe use of macroprudential tools has gotten considerable attention for several reasons.  Some countries have implemented macroprudential measures with respect to the housing market that may have limited the extent of home price appreciation and made their financial systems more resilient when the boom unwound.  Other countries have implemented countercyclical capital requirements that have made their banking systems more resilient.  Thus, the hope is that U.S. policymakers can learn from these international experiences and incorporate effective macroprudential tools into our toolkit that could be used to limit financial stability risks.\n\nSupport for using macroprudential tools in the United States has also been bolstered by our experience during the financial crisis.  The U.S. housing boom and subsequent bust might have been less severe had a set of macroprudential measures been in place at the time to limit the degree of leverage and speculative activity in the housing sector.  The housing boom was fueled by optimistic expectations for house price appreciation, combined with lax underwriting standards embodied in such practices as no-doc mortgages and widespread speculative activity by investors.  I remember, for example, the website, Condoflip.com, which says it all in terms of the degree of speculative fervor that was evident at the time.\n\nIf underwriting practices had been held to high standards (e.g., strict mortgage service-to-income ratio limits had been honored) and speculative activity had been constrained (e.g., by lower loan-to-value ceilings for investors with multiple mortgage liens outstanding), this might have limited the size of the boom and subsequent bust.\n\nMy own view is that while the use of macroprudential tools holds promise, we are a long way from being able to successfully use such tools in the United States.  There are two major sets of difficulties.  First, unlike monetary policy and microprudential regulation, there is not a well-defined framework for identifying emerging imbalances and applying macroprudential tools in response.  A recent tabletop exercise conducted by a number of Federal Reserve Bank presidents, which I will discuss a bit later, indicates some of the difficulties here.\n\nA workshop held by the Committee on the Global Financial System earlier this year in Hong Kong also noted this difficulty.  Appropriate calibration of macroprudential tools is difficult because of the lack of data and information about how the transmission process works―that is, what impact the tool will have on the targeted sector.  Even assessing the impact ex post is challenging because it is difficult to predict how the macroeconomy and financial system would have evolved if the macroprudential tool had not been in place.\n\nSecond, in the U.S., even if such a framework existed, there would still be a problem in terms of timely implementation.  The U.S. regulatory structure is fragmented, so that in most cases, no single regulator is able to implement macroprudential tools in a comprehensive manner.  As a result, imposing macroprudential tools in the United States would almost certainly leave significant gaps in coverage.  Such coverage gaps would likely lead to distortions within the financial sector, as the tool would have differential impacts across financial intermediaries inside versus outside a particular regulatory boundary.  Also, activity would migrate toward those areas outside the scope of the macroprudential tools that had been implemented.\n\nIt is important to note the regulatory mandates of the numerous federal and state regulatory authorities differ considerably.  Some simply may not view financial stability as an important part of their mandate.  As a result, I suspect it would be difficult to get all the relevant regulators on board in a timely way to implement macroprudential tools successfully.\n\nIn principle, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) might be well placed to coordinate a response across different regulatory jurisdictions.  But, I believe this is likely to prove difficult to do in practice.  Each of the regulatory agencies guards its own authority and prerogatives, and may not always be responsive to pressure from other regulators or the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThere is also the problem of responding to an emerging financial stability risk in a timely manner.  First, the emerging problem needs to be identified.  Then alternative policy responses need to be analyzed and debated.  And, there is an understandable bias to start small and to escalate only as needed given the lack of understanding about how big an impact a particular tool may have on the economy.  So, even if the FSOC could be effective in developing a consensus among the regulators, I wonder whether it could do this in a timely way.  The housing boom in the U.S. that culminated in the financial crisis began in 2002 and 2003.  By the time that it was broadly identified as an issue in 2005 and 2006, it might have been too late to do much to temper its effects, even with a sound macroprudential response by the regulatory community.\n\nIn the remainder of my time, I will discuss two topics in more detail.  First, I will discuss briefly what we learned at tabletop exercise with a number of Federal Reserve Bank presidents concerning the potential use of macroprudential tools in response to sectoral imbalances.  I think the tabletop exercise underscores the difficulty of using macroprudential tools in practice in the United States.  Second, I will discuss the issue that Adam Posen has raised—whether we should focus on the use of rules that are hardwired into the financial system ex ante or instead favor using macroprudential tools in a more discretionary, ex post basis, once particular problems have been identified.\n\nIn the tabletop exercise, the five Federal Reserve Bank presidents who are members of the Subcommittee on Financial Stability of the Conference of Presidents discussed the best way to respond to a scenario in which the commercial real estate market was overheating. 2 The scenario was much more detailed than that, but the commercial real estate sector was the major problem with respect to financial stability.  The stated goal of the exercise was to reduce the risk posed by the commercial real estate boom to financial stability and, by extension, to the Federal Reserve’s ability to achieve its macroeconomic objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.\n\nPrudential tools under consideration included:\n\nMonetary policy was also considered as a tool—either as a complement or as a substitute.\n\nIt was noteworthy that in the discussion there was no agreement as to what instruments should be emphasized and the ordering in which they should be used relative to monetary policy.  Among the available macroprudential tools, stress testing, raising margins on repo funding, and supervisory guidance garnered greater support compared to capital, liquidity, or credit-based tools.\n\nIn general, the exercise identified several issues with respect to the use of macroprudential tools.  One issue was the perceived difficulty of coordinating among different regulators.  Another was the fact that many of the tools have implementation lags.  The challenge of timely implementation steered some members back to using monetary policy, or toward those macroprudential tools—such as stress tests—that might be able to be implemented more quickly.  The exercise underscored that much more development work in the area of macroprudential regulation is needed.\n\nLet me now turn to the issue of ex ante, hardwired macroprudential standards that Adam has discussed.  In general, I see some advantages with having rules that are hardwired in place so that adjustment of the parameters of the tool—say, limits on the loan-to-value ratio—happen automatically in response to sectoral developments.\n\nAutomatic rules that are always in place have several advantages over discretionary measures that are implemented, ex post, only after some potential source of financial stability risk has been identified.  First, they are transparent and will work more quickly.  Second, they avoid some of the problems associated with announcing that a new measure is going to be put in place.  When implementing a new measure there will always be some reluctance to overcome in terms of deciding whether it is necessary.  Also, there may be political opposition to imposing a new measure.  For example, during the housing boom, limits on subprime lending would undoubtedly have provoked the objection that the regulators’ actions would limit home ownership for low-and moderate-income families.\n\nImposing automatic, countercyclical standards also has this difficulty to some degree.  But I think it is much less severe because at the time such standards are put in place, they generally will not be binding and it will be unclear whether they will necessarily become either more stringent or more binding in the future.  In other words, the rule’s potential impact will be highly speculative and uncertain at the time of implementation.  This may lessen the political opposition to putting such a rule in place.\n\nIn the same vein, automatic rules that are imposed ex ante might also be less risky in terms of potential unintended consequences.  When new rules are implemented it is always hard to gauge what the impact will be because imposition of the rule not only changes the economics of borrowing and investing in a particular sector, but also changes expectations about what might happen in the future.  When the rule is viewed as likely to be binding in the future—this seems more likely in the case of the ex post measures—it will be very hard to judge how economic agents will respond to a new measure.\n\nIn this regard, I think back to the Carter administration and the imposition of credit controls to restrain inflation in 1980.  Even though the credit controls were not expected to bind right away, the economy began to contract almost immediately as households and businesses rapidly adjusted their behavior to preserve some credit capacity.  The response was a much more powerful downturn in economic activity than had been anticipated, which forced the Carter administration to scrap the credit controls because they worked too well in restraining economic activity.\n\nSo I see some potential advantages of hardwired rules.  But, I think this advantage needs to be set against the practical difficulty of figuring out what rules would need to be in place now to deal with all the potential financial stability excesses that could occur in the future.  That seems a very difficult task to work out in my opinion.  It implies that such rules would need to be designed to treat broad issues, such as increases in financial system leverage or aggregate credit growth, rather than more limited sectoral issues.  This may work well in some circumstances in which the financial excess is occurring broadly, but might not be very effective when the problem, while extreme, may be more narrowly based.\n\nHistorical experience suggests that past bubbles in the United States that have threatened financial stability have taken many different forms and affected many different sectors of the economy.  Often, the bubbles have occurred in response to some important innovation in the economy or the development of instruments that facilitated real estate lending to lower-quality borrowers.  Examples of these include the development of the internet in the technology stock boom of the late 1990s, and subprime lending and mortgage securitization innovations prior to the financial crisis.  These innovations, in turn, sparked changes in belief systems that turned out to be false—such as, the rise in home prices reinforced the view that housing is an excellent investment and that national home prices can never decline.  When the assumption that widely supports a boom is revealed as false, the consequence is often a sharp reversal in behavior and prices as the boom deflates quickly.  I think it is very hard to anticipate these episodes and put rules in place that would limit such excesses.\n\nMy concern is that we could over-engineer the financial system, building in complexity in response to potential risks that might, or might not, manifest themselves in the future.  The complexity might not gain us much in terms of greater financial stability, either because the problem that ultimately manifested itself was different than we planned for, or because people found a way around the constraint that we had imposed on the system.\n\nThere are also the challenges of appropriate calibration and timing.  How much restraint should the rule exert as home prices rise or aggregate credit growth picks up?  Without historical experience and with an underdeveloped macroprudential framework, getting the calibration right is a difficult issue at this point.  Also, how quickly should the tool be unwound once it has done its work?  The tool needs to work in a countercyclical way, but turning points are difficult to anticipate and which makes it challenging to get the leads and lags right.\n\nWe have a very complex financial system in the United States.  I think we need to do much more work in developing a coherent macroprudential framework before we start contemplating putting a number of countercyclical measures in place.  Such a framework needs to take into consideration how it interacts with other policies, such as microprudential policies—to ensure the safety and soundness of individual institutions and monetary policy—designed to help ensure a stable macroeconomy.  When are these policies substitutes?  When are they complements?  How will they interact?  How will the governance work in coordinating across these three realms?\n\nIn the meantime, while we work to sort all this out, we should take considerable solace from the fact that we have made the financial system more resilient to shocks.  We may not be able to anticipate the next area of excess.  But with higher capital and liquidity requirements and the use of stress tests to assess emerging vulnerabilities, I think we are much better placed than we have been in the past.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n1 Tobias Adrian, Meg McConnell and Joseph Tracy

    "text": "Good morning. I am pleased to be at  the University at Albany. It is always a pleasure to speak with students and  faculty because of the intellectual leadership role you play in your  communities. I also welcome the addition of business leaders to this gathering  because you shape the economic landscape in the region. So, I thank you all for  coming today and helping make this such a rich audience.\n\nOver  the past 20 months, I have been engaged in a series of outreach meetings all  across my Federal Reserve District. I consider these visits just as important  as my trips to Washington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy or to  Switzerland to shape international bank regulation. The understanding of issues  and concerns that I gain today will help ensure that my policy decisions  reflect the public interest in the broadest sense.\n\nEach  visit within the region helps me deepen relationships with the people I  represent. As you may know, the New York Fed's District includes all of New  York State; 12 counties in northern New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut;  Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In August, I met with community  leaders, businesses and elected officials in Newark, Patterson and Jersey City.  Earlier this year I went to Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Puerto Rico, while  last year I visited several upstate cities.\n\nMy  trip started yesterday with a policy speech to the West Point cadets and was  followed by a colloquium with their economics faculty. So, this visit to the  upper Hudson Valley brings me in contact with some of our country’s future  leaders—you and the cadets who will lead our country in very important, if  different, ways.\n\nI  will also have a chance to see more of what makes Albany so distinct from both  downstate and Upstate New York. Of course, I may have a leg up on this because  I was born and raised close by, in western Massachusetts!\n\nThe  greater Albany area is home to 900,000 people—roughly the size of three average  cities in the United States. You and your fellow residents tend to be highly  educated and be employed as public servants. These factors are all part of what  makes Albany feel special.\n\nToday,  I want to talk with you first about the Fed—what we do and why we do it. Then  I’ll give you my views on the economy nationally and locally. It’s a serious  issue because it affects your family and students’ job prospects at graduation  time.\n\nWhat the New York Fed Does By way of introduction, I will  briefly review what the New York Fed does and what makes my job so interesting.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those  of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known  as the FOMC.\n\nI  am vice chair of the FOMC—a Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a  year in Washington to set interest rates and make other decisions about  monetary policy. The members of this committee all strive to set policy to  advance the mandate given to us by Congress to promote the maximum level of  employment consistent with price stability. Sometimes we have different views on  the specific policy choice on hand, and you should view this as completely  appropriate: these are hard questions— particularly at times like this—and we  make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike.  But we are united in our commitment to our  mandate and in our belief that Fed independence is essential to the public  interest, because it allows us to take tough decisions insulated from  short-term political pressures.\n\nAt  FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her  region and the nation. For these assessments, we consult our researchers and  add critical information that we learn from listening to our boards of  directors, regional advisory councils and community leaders, such as you and  others I'll meet on this visit.  This  trip includes meetings with the people at the SUNY Nanotech Center, Global  Foundries (an advanced microprocessor plant), the Capital Region Economic  Development Council, and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\nAt  the New York Fed, we continually track conditions in our District, and we have  created a number of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces  monthly indexes of economic activity for New York City, New Jersey and New York  State. These indexes are essentially local measures of output—similar to gross  domestic product, or GDP at the national level. These measures provide a more  complete gauge of activity than the employment report, which is the only other  available metric at the state level. We have also started a consumer panel to  track local household credit conditions, including the amount and type of debt  owed by an average person and whether payments are being made in a timely way.\n\nIn  addition, we have a new poll about credit and financing for small businesses,  the latter are an important source of new jobs. The survey asks firms about  credit applications and reasons for not seeking credit. Almost 900 regional  businesses responded to our May 2011 poll, of which nearly 15 percent were from  the upstate region. The next poll will be in January. If you, as part of a  small business, would like to participate in our January poll, please pass your  card to my colleagues in the audience.\n\nNext  month, we will host a workshop for the New York City metro area's small businesses—to  provide information about how they can participate in the global economy and  expand their companies by exporting their products and services. The  Export-Import Bank, the Small Business Administration and the U.S. Department  of Commerce will be on hand. They will tell participants how to tap demand in  the global marketplace and what government programs are available to enhance  credit, reduce payment risk and increase lines of working capital. We are also  facilitating a “speed mentoring” forum in which small businesses will receive  feedback on their business plans and advice about applying for financing from a  range of finance professionals.\n\nIn  2012, we’re planning similar events in the capital region. We hope to partner  with many of you to support the small business sector.\n\nAs  you know, even states as wealthy as New York  have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some key initiatives specifically  to low- and moderate-income groups. We have worked hard to help neighborhoods  that face high foreclosure rates. For the past three years we have provided  housing advocates, including the Empire Justice Center, with the latest  information on mortgage conditions, via roundtables, presentations and  newsletters.\n\nTo  share what we learn about our diverse District, we have a rich website. I  invite you to visit newyorkfed.org to explore our highly localized maps and  information on small business, credit and housing conditions and even the  latest job openings at the New York Fed.\n\nFinally,  and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with  our colleagues in Washington, D.C., and at other agencies to help put the  nation's financial system on a firmer footing. Yet, much remains to be done and  we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return  to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or  on the part of regulators like ourselves.\n\nAll  in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues busy.\n\nNational Economic Conditions Now, let me update you on  national economic conditions.\n\nWe  stand here today several years after the worst financial crisis in modern  times. The origins of the crisis are complex, but it had its roots in the  bursting of a credit bubble that had grown to great size during the middle part  of the last decade.\n\nPrior  to the onset of the crisis, a combination of rapid financial innovation and  imbalanced global economic integration resulted in a mispricing of risk  worldwide. This was particularly extreme in certain markets such as U.S.  housing and housing finance.\n\nThis  mispricing of risk led to a misallocation of resources and an excessive  build-up of debt in many parts of the global economy. Many—though not all—U.S.  households responded to the easy availability of credit and rising home prices  by taking on more debt. When the housing boom lost steam and began to burst,  expectations about housing prices and wealth were disappointed. The bursting of  the credit bubble also created instability within the global financial system  and, this, in turn resulted in a sharp drop in the credit available to  households and businesses.\n\nThe  result was what is now called the “Great Recession.” Over the period from late  2007 through mid-2009, real GDP declined by more than 5 percent, making this  recession the longest and deepest recession of the postwar period.\n\nThe  recession was felt in many ways, but one of the most painful was the severe  impact it had on the labor market. Employment dropped sharply during the  recession, contributing to a sharp rise in the unemployment rate from around  4.5 percent in the middle of 2007 to over 10 percent in October 2009.\n\nExtraordinary  actions by authorities around the world, including the Federal Reserve,  prevented full-scale financial and economic collapse, and the global economy  stabilized around mid-2009. But since then the recovery has been bifurcated.  While emerging economies have rebounded rapidly, the developed world has grown  only slowly. This has hastened a historic shift in the balance of economic  power that was already underway before the crisis.\n\nIn  the United States, the recovery has proven to be persistently weaker than  expected. Growth has been insufficient to either bring down unemployment  significantly or to achieve a self-reinforcing cycle of strengthening  confidence, demand, income and employment.\n\nAlthough  the latest news on the U.S. economy is somewhat more encouraging than that from  earlier in the year, we should not take much solace from that. After a very  weak first half, when GDP growth was less than 1 percent, economic activity has  strengthened somewhat and inflation pressures are starting to ease. Growth in  the third quarter is currently estimated to be 2.5 percent, and recent  indicators suggest growth in the fourth quarter could be somewhat higher. This  modest rebound reflects in part the passing of transitory factors such as the  damping effect on household and business spending power from rises in energy  and food prices as well as the supply disruptions related to the earthquake and  tsunami in Japan.\n\nHowever,  as we look toward 2012, the U.S. economy continues to face several obstacles to  a robust recovery. Accordingly I expect growth of about 2.75 percent for 2012.\n\nConsumer  price inflation has begun to moderate. This moderation is just starting to  become evident on a 12-month time horizon—in which consumer price inflation as  measured by the consumer price index (CPI) is rising at about a 3.5 percent  annual rate. Given current expectations for the path of energy prices—taken  from futures markets—consumer price inflation on a year-over-year basis should  continue to fall over the next few months.\n\nWe  cannot be satisfied with the current state of the economy or the outlook for  the next few years. The economy is operating far below its productive potential  –leaving the level of output, income and employment much lower than they would  be if the economy’s unused resources were put to work. One summary statistic  says it all—the unemployment rate is unacceptably high at 9 percent. Given my  outlook, the decline of unemployment over the next year is likely to be modest.  Furthermore, we also continue to face significant downside risks, mostly  related to the stress in the eurozone.\n\nIn  a speech yesterday at West Point, I highlighted the need for our nation to  deploy a full set of economic policy tools to secure the recovery and build for  the long term. This includes monetary policy, but also requires policies to  help repair housing markets, fiscal policy that supports growth in the short  and long run, and structural reforms that increase competitiveness and support  a shift in the pattern of economic activity toward a more sustainable growth  path than that which prevailed during the last business cycle upswing.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions How is the recovery proceeding  in the state and the region? As I mentioned, the New York Fed produces economic  activity indexes to help monitor conditions in New York State. 1 Based on our  index, the downturn in the state’s economy ended in November of 2009. Since  then, I would describe the state’s economy as recovering at a moderate pace,  although there appears to have been a pause in September.\n\nThe  New York Fed also conducts the Empire State Manufacturing Survey to learn about  conditions for regional manufacturers. I am pleased to say that November’s  report (issued this Tuesday) shows signs of stabilizing after five months of  weakening. In November, more manufacturers are adopting an optimistic outlook.\n\nLike  many other large states, New York has a bifurcated economy. New York’s  downstate area differs dramatically from the upstate area in terms of  industrial composition, occupations and job growth. While Albany may be  geographically midway between the two areas, its industry mix resembles neither  the downstate’s heavy concentration in the service sector, nor the upstate focus  on the manufacturing sector. What sets Albany apart is that it is home to the  state’s capital. About one quarter of employees in the Albany area work for the  government—about a third more than the statewide average.\n\nThe  local economy did not fare as poorly as the national economy during this  recession, but the impact was still severe and the recovery is not yet well  established. During the downturn, the capital region saw a loss of about 20,000  jobs, or roughly 4 percent of total employment, considerably less severe than  the 6.5 percent nationwide decline. Over the past year and a half, job losses  have slowed. But, in contrast to the rest of the state, we cannot confidently  say that a solid recovery is underway. The Albany area is not yet consistently  adding jobs. This is not surprising, considering the fiscal difficulties faced  by New York State. The state has cut a considerable number of government jobs  and reduced other expenditures as part of its effort to close significant  budget gaps. These job reductions have disproportionately slowed Albany’s local  economy. 2\n\nIn  contrast, I am pleased to say that Albany’s private sector is showing signs of  recovery. Your private employers have been adding jobs at a fast enough pace to  offset the public sector job losses. However, this job creation has not been  robust enough to bring down the unemployment rate, which remains at 7 percent  of the workforce. That is a lower rate of unemployment than the national rate,  as is usual for Albany. However, it is almost double the jobless rate in early  2007; and it has barely budged since the recession ended. It will be difficult  for growth in the region’s economy to resume and for unemployment to decline  until the public sector stabilizes.\n\nAn  important plus for the local economy is the capital region’s housing sector,  which has weathered the economic storm relatively well. As a result, the  drop-off in economic activity that is connected, directly and indirectly, to  the performance of the housing sector has not been as severe here as it has  been in many other places around the country. Like much of Upstate New York,  Albany’s housing market has proven more stable than much of the rest of the  country. During the 2000-2006 housing boom, Albany’s house prices rose by 85  percent, much higher than the roughly 50 percent average increase in Upstate  New York as a whole and almost as high as the doubling of house prices seen  nationally. Unlike the rest of the nation, though, the region’s housing market  has been comparatively stable since then. Prices have declined by about 7  percent from their peak here, compared with a decline of 32 percent nationally.\n\nNonetheless,  declining house prices coupled with a sluggish jobs recovery has increased  financial pressures on families. During the recession, all across the nation,  high levels of debt led to a soaring number of delinquencies. Many families  found that they needed to reduce their debt to more sustainable levels.\n\nDrawing  on the special consumer credit panel I mentioned earlier I can tell you that  these trends have certainly affected people in this area. 3 But the good news is that the effects have not  been quite as severe here as they have in much of the country. Households in  the Albany region did not accumulate as much debt as did households in the rest  of the state and country during the run-up to the crisis. Recent data indicate  that the average adult in Albany has about $40,000 of debt, which is about 20  percent lower than the average across the state and country as a whole. Thus, financial  strains on many families in the Albany area were lower than in many other  places around the state and nation.\n\nHowever,  the number of delinquencies did rise significantly during the recession in the  area, so it is clear that some households face strong financial pressures.  About 4 percent of debt balances currently are 90+ days past due in Albany,  which is twice the 2 percent delinquency rate in 2005. Although this is less  than half of the rate in New York State or the nation, this doubling of delinquencies  in the Albany area still troubles me as a sign of heightened distress for many  families here.\n\nStepping  back from the current challenges, the capital region possesses a number of  fundamental strengths. These strengths show through in some key ways:\n\nOne  of Albany’s key strengths is its higher education industry. The colleges and  universities in the capital region help stabilize the local economy during  downturns and recoveries. Indeed, the private education sector continually  added jobs before, during, and after the Great Recession, both nationally and  locally.  For example, the University at  Albany has taken a lead role in shaping the next generation of financial professionals  and regulators through its pioneering curriculums. From my perspective at the Fed, a particularly important  and timely example is the University’s innovative National Science  Foundation-supported program for instruction and research in financial market  regulation.\n\nResearch  conducted by the New York Fed has shown that colleges and universities can help  build the skills and education of their region’s workforce, which is critical  to an area’s ultimate economic success. 4 They do this in two ways. Most directly,  colleges and universities support an educated workforce by producing new  college graduates, some of whom will stay and work in the area. The University  at Albany clearly plays this role in the capital area.\n\nPerhaps  equally important in terms of promoting local economic growth, colleges and  universities can play a key role in creating jobs for skilled workers in local  businesses. Colleges and universities conduct research and development that can  have “spillover effects” into the local economy. Businesses in the region can  take advantage of being close to these innovative activities and facilities to  develop new products and technologies. This can also help draw new companies to  the region to access university resources. Thus, successful industry–higher  education partnerships can provide a quite a boost for a region’s economy.\n\nThe  local nanotech sector provides an excellent example of this type of partnership  at work. During my visit to the University’s College of Nanoscale Science and  Engineering this afternoon I look forward to seeing the facilities and hearing  more about the Center’s plans to lead the way in global nanotech research. More  broadly, I understand that our audience today includes several members of the  Regional Economic Advisory Council—including the University at Albany’s  president, George Philip and Michael Castellana, the co-chair of the  Council—who are working to advance such partnerships and the outlook for the  region.\n\nGoing  forward, the industry–higher education partnerships taking place here will be  increasingly important. I expect the strong foundation already in place will  help maintain the economic vitality of the capital region.\n\nConclusion To sum up, growth has picked  up modestly in the second half of 2011, but not enough to bring unemployment  down. While there are some bright spots in the U.S. economy and the financial  system, strong headwinds are preventing a more vigorous recovery. Inflation,  which has risen in recent months, is poised to moderate soon. The Fed is  doing—and will continue to do—everything within its power to promote jobs and  price stability.\n\nLooking  ahead, the key challenge for the Albany area will be to continue to prepare its  residents for the best jobs being created here. Expanding education and skills  will go a long way to broaden participation in the economy to all residents.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n_______________________________________ 1 Regional Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators » 2 See, for additional discussion of this topic, William C.

    "text": "Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. 1\n\nIn my remarks today, I will focus on the development and use of reference rates for financial market contracts.  This is a story of both spectacular success, and at the same time, spectacular failure.\n\nTo borrow from Charles Dickens: 2\n\n“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity.…”\n\nWhile Dickens was writing about events leading up to a political crisis, his words also are apt with respect to our recent financial crisis.\n\nOver a period of just a few decades, reference rates grew greatly in terms of their role and importance in financial markets.  For example, the use of one of the best known reference rates—the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR—has soared, so that it is now referenced by approximately $300 trillion dollars of financial contracts.  Reference rates have become a ubiquitous but largely hidden fiber in the fabric of financial markets.  They play a critical role in making financial markets more efficient by reducing information frictions, lowering transactions costs and mitigating the moral hazard.\n\nAt the same time, as recent enforcement actions and criminal investigations have made all too clear, some of these reference rates have been systematically manipulated by individuals at key financial institutions.  The assumption that the design in how these rates are constructed would be resistant to attempts at manipulation has turned out to be wrong, and the belief in the integrity of these rates has turned out to be misplaced.\n\nWhat this means should be obvious to all of us.  Reform is required if we are to restore confidence in the financial system.  In my remarks today, I will discuss the outlines of such a reform including those important steps that are already underway, and those steps that still must be taken.  As always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe most recognized and prevalent of the reference interest rates is the London Interbank Offered Rate, typically referred to as LIBOR, which measures the cost of unsecured, interbank borrowing across different currencies and tenors.  The development of LIBOR goes back to the rapid expansion of the Eurodollar market in London beginning in the 1970s.  This was a market that developed, in part, as a means of circumventing the Regulation Q deposit interest rate ceilings in the United States.  This market provided a source of funds for international banks, and securities that referenced Eurodollars were issued and became actively traded.  This growing market gave birth to a new financial market product—the interest rate swap—to help investors and borrowers to better manage the interest rate risks associated with their financial exposures.\n\nIn 1984, as part of the “Big Bang” in U.K. financial markets, the British Bankers Association (BBA) assumed responsibility for developing a set of standards for these interest rate swaps.  One of these standards was for the reference rates used to fix the settlement of the contracts—this led to the birth of LIBOR. 3 Additional standardization followed, including establishing  a fixed schedule of settlement dates for these contracts.  This further increased the liquidity in these contracts, but also significantly concentrated the timing of settlement activity.  At the same time, new reference rates were developed that extended the LIBOR-style methodology to many different currencies.\n\nHow LIBOR was designed to work\n\nLIBOR is a set of reference rates that measure large banks’ funding costs in different currencies and at different maturities.  For example, U.S. dollar LIBOR measures how expensive it is for a large bank to borrow U.S. dollars in the unsecured interbank market at different maturities.  For each currency, there is a designated panel of contributing banks that each submit an estimate of its own borrowing costs for each maturity.  For each panel, these estimates are aggregated to form LIBOR.  The LIBOR rates are then used as a basis for financial contracts ranging from adjustable rate mortgages to interest rate swaps and futures.\n\nTo make sure that the submitting banks have sufficient expertise in the funding trends in a particular currency, it is important that they be actively involved in that market.  For this reason, the contributing banks are the large banks that have been active in the London market and the panel of submitting banks varies across currencies.  The LIBOR reference rates were intended to capture on a daily basis borrowing costs along each currency-maturity combination based on the experience of the submitting banks.\n\nThe actual process for fixing LIBOR each day is quite straightforward.  Each morning the submitters from each contributing bank answer the following hypothetical question: “At what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers at a reasonable market size just prior to 11 a.m.?”  The transmitted submissions are ordered by rate for each currency and maturity pair.  The ordered rates for U.S. dollar LIBOR, for example, are then trimmed by generally dropping the top and bottom 25 percent of submissions to remove any influence of outliers.  The average of the remaining individual submissions is calculated and then posted.  Prior to the recent reforms, all submissions were immediately made public.\n\nThe aim of the LIBOR-setting process has been to create a set of reference rates that would be credible and would generate robust measures of bank funding costs across a wide range of market conditions.  The credibility was based on the borrowing experience from the submitting banks represented through their submitters—those individuals responsible for actually submitting an answer each day to the administrator.  The potential conflicts of interest between the submitters and traders within the bank were typically handled through internal policies such as the presence of information barriers that were intended to prevent sensitive information from flowing between the traders and LIBOR submitters.  The robustness to market conditions would be maintained even in periods of market stress or a lack of transactions by the reliance on the hypothetical question instead of the use of actual transaction data.  That is, even if during stressed times when trading became sporadic in a particular currency-maturity pair, all submitters could still answer the question even if their bank did not happen to engage in any trades on that particular day in that particular pairing.   This ensured a large sample size even during stressed market conditions.  The trimming of the sample helped to minimize the influence of any outlier submission, but also limited the ability for any one submitting bank to influence the posted rate.\n\nAs is clear from the hypothetical question, LIBOR is meant to capture a bank’s cost of unsecured borrowing.  This means that the reference rate will reflect not only a risk-free component, but also counterparty credit risk related to the specific borrower.  This turns out to be important for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the growing popularity and liquidity of LIBOR indexed contracts led to an expanded use of LIBOR to circumstances in which the credit risk of large banks was not clearly relevant.   For example, a speculative position about the future of short-term rates is predominately based on one’s view about the path of short-term interest rates, rather than how bank counterparty risk might change and affect borrowing costs.  Despite this shortcoming, LIBOR remained popular because the benefit of its deeper market liquidity was viewed as more important than the added complication that LIBOR included an element of counterparty risk. 4\n\nSecond, variations in LIBOR submissions across the submitting banks at a point in time for a given maturity should mainly reflect differences in the counterparty credit risk, since the risk-free component is common to all submitters.  This is important because it means that variations in submissions may be interpreted as reflecting variations in underlying counterparty risk.  This is particularly important when the LIBOR submissions process is transparent and the market is under stress, which was the case during the financial crisis.\n\nHow LIBOR worked in practice\n\nNow that I have described how LIBOR was intended to work in concept, how did it work in practice?  It turns out that unappreciated design weaknesses and incentive structures at certain large submitting banks, in combination with the phenomenal success of reference rates, undermined the system.  Conflicts and problems emerged both at the bank level and at the individual submitter level.  Investigations are on-going to determine the scale and full extent of these problems, but I would like to discuss a few of the well-documented problems.\n\nLet’s start at the level of banks that submit estimates.  The enforcement actions and investigations into potential LIBOR manipulation have shown that, at times, individual institutions faced incentives to understate their hypothetical borrowing rates in order to avoid the perception that they might have higher counterparty credit risk.  Some of the reported misdeeds occurred during the heart of the financial crisis when market participants faced considerable uncertainty about the health of particular institutions.  This uncertainty was manifest in a wide range of financial market prices for financial institutions—low and volatile equity prices, record CDS spreads and greater variation in borrowing costs across different LIBOR-submitting banks.  At that time, the BBA was publishing firm-specific contributions to LIBOR from submitting banks.  Given this publication process, some of the submitting banks reportedly became concerned about reporting a rate that would suggest that they were being treated by the market as a greater counterparty credit risk than their peers.  Accordingly, some banks were alleged to have lowered their LIBOR submission below their actual likely borrowing rate to avoid the stigma associated with posting a higher borrowing rate and the possibility that their funding costs could increase as a result.\n\nConflicts also reportedly abounded at the level of the individual submitters.  Again, these highlighted profound compliance problems at some of the submitting banks.  As I noted earlier, the intent was that the expertise of the submitter would be insulated from any internal pressures by the informational barriers within the submitting banks.  The hope was that these informational barriers separating the submitters from the traders were thick and impenetrable.  The investigations into LIBOR manipulation found that the reality was that they were often paper thin and porous.\n\nWe have learned that false reporting and manipulative behavior was pervasive across firms and over time, took many forms and was often conducted in a nonchalant manner.  This has been well-documented by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in their published findings.  For example, interest rate swap traders routinely asked colleagues to submit rates with an explicit goal to have the adjusted submission benefit the value of specific derivatives positions they held.  As an illustration, investigations discovered that one “Senior Yen Trader” directly or indirectly made at least 800 requests in writing on UBS’s email and chat systems to their submitter. 5 Requests often had a casual matter of fact nature to them.  To illustrate, an exchange in September 2007 from a trader at UBS to the submitter went as follows. 6\n\n“Hi … could really do with a low 1M [one month] over the next few days as have 17.5m [million] fixings if ok with you?”\n\nSubmitting banks often facilitated this type of behavior—in some cases derivatives traders and submitters sat on the same desk, while in others the submitters were themselves traders, both circumstances obviously representing conflicts of interest.  Other investigations documented that traders at one bank would often shout across the trading desk to fellow traders to confirm that there were no conflicting requests before they sent their requests to their submitter. 7\n\nThe investigations also found that not only were there conflicts within the submitting banks, but there were also active efforts by traders to collude across banks to affect the posted rates.  At times, the traders at the different banks might have similar positions and therefore a common interest to push the posted rate in particular direction.  In other times, cooperation could be incentivized through the use of “wash” trades that generated no profit or loss, but allowed the trader to generate commissions.\n\nWhy did this go so wrong?\n\nAs I discussed earlier, LIBOR setting involves a group of banks answering a hypothetical question.  This seemingly straightforward question actually embeds a good deal of ambiguity and room for potentially manipulative actions.  First, it is a hypothetical question—not what rate did you borrow at that morning, but what rate do you think you could borrow at.  This potential disconnect from actual borrowing activity builds in from the beginning a certain amount of judgment and room for manipulation.  Second, some of the parameters—“reasonable market size” or “just prior to 11 a.m.”—also allow for subjective interpretation.  This type of judgment is not inherently a problem, but it does open the door for improper behavior and also makes transgressions more difficult to identify.\n\nAt the same time, and partly in response to the lessons learned during the financial crisis, patterns of bank funding began to shift away from unsecured funding to secured funding markets.  Investors and other market participants grew to prefer holding specific collateral against their loans—even very short-term loans—than just trusting in the ongoing viability of the borrower.  This shift had substantive implications for money markets and the LIBOR fixing model, which was based on the assumption that there would always be regular activity in unsecured interbank funding markets.  As those markets dried up—in some cases there were essentially no transactions for longer-dated tenors—it became harder for banks to ground their LIBOR submissions in actual, observable transactions.  This put a greater premium on a submitter’s judgment, which increased the risk of further abuse and manipulation.\n\nWe have learned as well that compensation and hiring practices also helped to undermine the integrity of the reporting regime.  For example, we have seen that compensation and promotion within a bank are often tied to a trader’s market share and profitability.  In addition, traders often move between firms so having a network of external contacts and being viewed as a team player could help to support job mobility.  Consequently, one can conclude that even the loss of a job is not necessarily a permanent setback, and that market participants with allegations of improper behavior could potentially move on to other firms with the expectation that they would generate revenue and profits for their new employer.\n\nThese incentives were amplified by the structure of the markets that underlie the setting of LIBOR and those that use LIBOR.  The interbank cash borrowing market that LIBOR references is very small relative to the enormous markets that use LIBOR, for example interest rate derivatives.  The standardization of settlement dates further concentrated trading activity.  In this type of environment, relatively small changes in LIBOR submissions—either because the actual borrowing costs fluctuate or a submitting bank intentionally misreports its submissions—can have substantive effects on a trader’s profitability because the trader can hold large derivatives or futures positions that reference the cash LIBOR rate at the time these contracts settle.\n\nFinally, and I think perhaps most importantly, the questionable behavioral norms in the industry—along with the weak control environments and compliance processes—that were uncovered during the investigations, exacerbated and facilitated the misalignment of incentives that are specific to LIBOR.  It is a sad state of affairs if unethical behavior is socialized among new traders with the explanation that this is business as usual, and, if compliance and risk management are inadequate as a counterweight to prevent or identify wrong-doing.  It is untenable if people working in compliance and risk are treated as second-class citizens relative to the firms’ revenue generators.\n\nThe Official Sector Response\n\nThe international regulatory community began to address these issues when the U.K. government published the Wheatley Review 8 in September 2012.  The Review recommended a ten-point plan, subsequently accepted in full by the U.K. government, for comprehensive reform of LIBOR.  This led to many changes including the statutory regulation of the administration and submission process with respect to LIBOR, the selection of a new administrator for LIBOR, new governance and oversight regimes for the administrator and submission guidelines as well as a code of conduct for submitters.  The BBA, the former administrator for LIBOR, for example, eliminated publication of certain currency and tenor rates and delayed the publication of bank-specific submissions.  Perhaps most importantly, LIBOR-related activities are now subject to formal regulation and supervision in the U.K.\n\nI support the changes initiated by the U.K. government and believe they have substantially strengthened LIBOR.  That said, I also believe that more work remains to be done to broaden the definition of LIBOR so that it represents the reality of new funding patterns for banks, and to also tie submissions more closely and systematically to observable transactions.\n\nA second notable development was the publication of an international set of principles for financial benchmarks developed by the International Organization of Securities Commissions 9 (IOSCO) in 2013.  These principles include a set of 19 specific standards across governance, benchmark quality, methodology and accountability that have emerged as the international standard.  IOSCO has rightly focused on tying benchmarks more closely to observable, arms-length transactions.  While a pure transactions-based rate will not solve all problems for all benchmarks, this is an important step toward eliminating excessive reliance on expert judgment.\n\nAs part of the international reform efforts, the Federal Reserve played a lead role in a set of recommendations for the reform of reference interest rates produced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB).  Former Governor Jeremy Stein, followed by Governor Jay Powell, co-chaired a working group with Martin Wheatley of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  This working group was charged with reviewing existing interest rate benchmarks, and for establishing and guiding a group of market participants to identify the feasibility and viability of adopting alternative reference rates.\n\nThe FSB report 10 was released in July and Governor Powell 11 has recently described the Federal Reserve’s plans to support the two primary components of the reform of LIBOR.  First, we are considering, in cooperation with the LIBOR administrator and other members of the official sector, ways to broaden the definition of LIBOR to more adequately represent current patterns of bank funding and to anchor it more firmly in observable transactions.  Second, we believe it is important for market participants to have access to a range of appropriately created and governed reference rates that best suit their particular business needs.  For example, some activities such as interest rate derivatives might be better served with a risk-free or near risk-free reference rate, rather than one that embeds a bank credit risk component.\n\nI would like to emphasize three points in support of the FSB recommendations and our own efforts.  First, the FSB recommendations make clear that there is not one single path for all jurisdictions to achieve the common objective of more robust and resilient reference rates.  Rather, each jurisdiction must take into account its own specific institutional, legal and market practices and arrive at its own best solution.  In the U.S., I believe it is important to identify alternative reference rates that are grounded in a strong governance framework as laid out in the IOSCO principles and that are supported by market transactions.  This brings me to my second point—given a set of robust reference rates that meet IOSCO standards, the choice among these reference rates should be left to market participants who can best identify the specific rate that is most appropriate for a specific business need.  Third, the Federal Reserve is committed to working with market participants of all kinds—dealers, end users, legal and accounting experts—to help develop robust reference rates that meet the needs of all types of market participants.\n\nIn addition to these specific efforts around improving and finding alternative benchmarks, the New York Fed is sponsoring other efforts related to the reform of market practices and benchmark rates.  The Foreign Exchange Committee (FXC) and Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG), for example, are two groups of senior market practitioners sponsored by the New York Fed that are working within their markets to identify best practices for trading and behavior related to benchmark rates.  Both groups also have published broader sets of best practices for the foreign exchange markets, and for Treasury, agency debt and agency MBS markets.  I would ask all market participants to ensure that these and other best practices guide the behavior that we should expect from participants in financial markets.\n\nThis will not be easy, but I believe restoring confidence in reference rates is achievable and will greatly enhance the robustness and resilience of our financial system.  I have focused here on the reform efforts around LIBOR, which is only one reference rate, albeit one that is widely used and a core part of our financial system.  But, the need for stronger governance and more accountability spreads much further within the set of benchmark rates, and further to encompass a wide range of practices within the financial system.  For example, accusations have recently surfaced related to business practices within foreign exchange markets.  While the concerns are technically very different than the practices uncovered around LIBOR submissions, the common theme is the willingness of a small number of market participants to behave improperly and contribute to a decline in confidence in the integrity of benchmark rates specifically and of major financial institutions more generally.\n\nNext Steps\n\nI have discussed some of the observed problems in major reference rates that reflect egregious personal behavior.  Some individuals responded to poorly-designed incentives and weak controls at some of the largest financial institutions.  The regulatory community has already taken important steps to mitigate those concerns and real progress has been made.  While this has helped to restore some of the integrity of particular reference rates, such as LIBOR, more work needs to be done before confidence in these rates are put on a firmer foundation.\n\nI’ll conclude by emphasizing two of the next steps that I think are most essential for the successful reform of LIBOR.  First, the definition of LIBOR should be broadened so that it more accurately reflects the observed funding patterns of large banks and puts the rate on a broader, more stable base of observable transactions.  The LIBOR administrator is actively considering ways to do this while remaining true to the spirit of LIBOR and how it is used in financial contracts.  Accomplishing this will make markets that need a reference rate that embodies bank credit risk more robust and resilient and will strengthen the financial system.\n\nSecond, we still face the problem that the reference rate for a large stock of derivatives contracts is based on a relatively small, underlying cash market.  This means there still is a powerful incentive for individuals to attempt to manipulate the rate for their own gains.  One promising solution, outlined in Governor Powell’s recent speech on reference rates, is to work with market participants to find an alternative reference rate that is based on a deeper underlying cash market and that meets the needs of all market participants.  Of course, any rate that serves as a critical financial benchmark must meet the principles for good governance and production outlined by IOSCO.\n\nThis combination—a more robust and resilient LIBOR for transactions that require a reference rate with a bank credit risk component and the development of an alternative reference rate for transactions like interest rate derivatives that don’t—will strengthen our financial system and help undo some of the damage caused by earlier transgressions.  But this is only a necessary and not a sufficient set of conditions.  To achieve the outcome desired, financial institutions also need to have in place the appropriate incentives and controls.\n\nThank you for your attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 Lorie Logan, William Riordan, Kevin Stiroh, Joseph Tracy and Nathaniel Wuerffel assisted in preparing this speech.\n\n2 Charles Dickens.

    "text": "It’s my pleasure to welcome you  to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to participate in the 40th  anniversary of our Central Banking Seminar.   This year we have 140 participants representing 67 different countries  and institutions.  The program is  designed to provide a broad view of central banking covering the key areas of  monetary policy, supervision, payments and financial stability.  This design reflects our belief that a  well-rounded perspective can help us to be more effective in our jobs as  central bankers.  We also hope this  program provides you with an opportunity during your stay to broaden your  network of central bank colleagues.  As  always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe theme of this year’s seminar is the policy challenges we  face in an environment of sluggish economic growth and low inflation.  Central bankers will always be confronted by  challenges in carrying out their responsibilities, which will change over time.  This puts a premium on our ability to  adapt.  Consider, for example, the  contrast between the issues faced by the Federal Reserve in 1976—the inaugural  year of our seminar—and today.  In 1976,  the U.S. economy was recovering from the first oil price shock and the ensuing  recession, which had ended in March 1975.  The FOMC faced the problem of stagflation, as  both inflation and unemployment were high—inflation was running around 6  percent and the unemployment rate was nearly 8 percent.  The FOMC’s policy rate—the federal funds  rate—was about 5 percent.\n\nCompare that to today’s circumstances.  The U.S. economy has entered its eighth year  of expansion following the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  In contrast to 1976, inflation has been below  the FOMC’s desired level of 2 percent for most of this expansion.  This year, inflation is running at about 1  percent and the unemployment rate is 4.9 percent.  Monetary policy remains accommodative, with  the target range for the federal funds rate at 0.25-0.50 percent.  I doubt that a central banker in 1976 would  have viewed the current set of circumstances as even remotely plausible, or  would have ever contemplated the types of challenges that we now face.\n\nIn my remarks today, I would like to briefly touch on four  topics: (1) the efficacy of monetary policy at the zero lower bound, (2)  central bank communications, (3) cyber risk, and (4) market liquidity and  regulation.  These have particular  relevance for central banks today, and are likely to remain relevant in the  years ahead.  The speakers that you will  hear over the course of our program will elaborate on some of these topics.\n\nThe financial crisis severely impaired the global financial  system, and the resulting recession in the United States was the most severe  since the Great Depression.  Based in  part on the lessons of the Japanese experience, in which falling inflation  expectations undermined the effectiveness of monetary policy, the FOMC  responded aggressively as the economy weakened.   It began cutting the policy rate from 5.25 percent in September 2007 and  reached the effective zero lower bound in December 2008.  From that point on, the FOMC turned to  unconventional monetary policy in order to provide additional stimulus to the  economy.\n\nAcademic research indicates that recoveries following  financial crises have tended to be shallow and protracted. 2 One plausible reason for this pattern is that  a financial crisis typically results in headwinds that take time to  dissipate—for example, the deleveraging of business and household balance  sheets or the tightening of credit standards.   Even so, as the expansion failed to gather momentum and persistently  underperformed most forecasts, alternative explanations for the sluggish  economic growth―such as secular stagnation―began to receive increased  attention.  Wednesday’s session on Global  Trends and Risks will more fully explore this debate.  The insights from this debate have important  implications for the appropriate path for monetary policy and the question of  whether monetary policymakers need additional tools or greater support from the  fiscal authorities to avoid being trapped at the zero lower bound for interest  rates.\n\nBeyond these factors, the tepid pace of the expansion  reflects the fact that monetary policy was constrained by the zero lower  bound.  Monetary policy affects the  economy mainly through its influence on financial market conditions—including  long-term interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and equity  prices.  However, when the policy rate  hits zero, conventional policy is constrained in terms of providing additional  accommodation―even recognizing that some central banks have pushed short-term  rates into negative territory.  To  overcome such constraints, the FOMC used forward guidance—promising to keep rates  low for longer—and asset purchases to provide additional stimulus to the  economy.  Given the initial novelty of  unconventional monetary policy tools, central banks did not have a  well-developed body of research to draw on to design the programs and calibrate  their impact.  While it will take time to  build this body of work, research to date varies in terms of the estimated  effectiveness of unconventional policy.   Several studies indicate that the FOMC’s first asset purchase program  helped to reduce long-term interest rates, while the subsequent programs had  smaller though still significant effects on rates.  However, Professor Summers, who is  participating in our program, has recently questioned the effectiveness of the  Fed’s asset purchase programs when financial markets are well-functioning. 3\n\nThere is a related concern given that the federal funds rate  is still close to zero at this point in the expansion.  While I’m on record as saying that expansions  do not simply die of old age, 4 some economists are concerned that the risk of a recession is increasing.  As I indicated earlier, the FOMC was able to  reduce the federal funds rate by more than 5 percentage points in an effort to  offset the effects of the last recession.   If another recession were to happen in the next few years, it is likely  that the FOMC would be unable to respond with a cut of such magnitude.  In this case, the effectiveness of  unconventional monetary policy in providing accommodation would again become a  central issue, as Chair Yellen discussed in her recent Jackson Hole speech. 5 A risk management approach to monetary policy  would suggest that the more concerned one is with the effectiveness of these  policies at the zero lower bound, the more cautious one would be in the process  of removing accommodation.  So, even  though we are now slightly off the zero lower bound, an assessment of the  effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy has implications with respect  to the current stance of monetary policy.\n\nAnother important challenge for central banks is  communication with the public.  It is now  accepted that the effectiveness of monetary policy is enhanced when the public  has a clear understanding of the goals of monetary policy, and the framework  and actions that the central bank will use to attain them.  One important example is inflation  expectations, which are important to the dynamics of inflation. Effective  communication by the central bank can help to anchor inflation expectations at  its target, thereby making it easier for the central bank to attain its  inflation objective.\n\nThe use of unconventional monetary policy has also  heightened the focus on communication.   In the past, communication almost exclusively focused on the likely  short-term path for the central bank’s policy rate.  But, once the zero lower bound became a  constraint, forward guidance became an important communication tool to surmount  the problems caused by that constraint.   In addition, there are now many more dimensions to the stance of  monetary policy, including the size and composition of the central bank’s  balance sheet.  When communicating about  these various dimensions, it is important for the central bank to demonstrate  its commitment to a framework rather than to a specific policy path, since the  precise path of policy should be data dependent and the future is  uncertain.  Good communication can lead  to a clear understanding of the Fed’s framework, which will help the public to  assess the data along with the Fed and enable it to better predict how the Fed is  likely to adjust policy as the economic outlook changes.\n\nAs I indicated earlier, the challenges the FOMC faced in  1976 were very different from today’s.   In addition, advances in information technology also have changed how we  do our work.  However, these advances  come with the risk of increased exposure to cyber-attacks.  The various motivations for these attacks  include causing embarrassment to the central bank, stealing money, and  disrupting critical financial services.   The large sums of money potentially at risk mean that we need very  strong defenses to lower the probability of success by cyber attackers in order  to deter such efforts.  Attacks can have  consequences for a central bank’s reputation and the public’s confidence in it,  underscoring the importance of a sturdy set of defenses and response actions.  Protecting against cyber-attacks requires not  only investment in the right infrastructure, policies and processes, but also  vigilance from central bank employees.   Many attacks involve tricking unsuspecting employees into installing  malicious code or revealing key access information.  Since this “phishing” plays on human  weaknesses, to which we are all prone, protecting against these tactics  requires ongoing training and testing, appropriate access controls, and segregation  of duties in the context of critical infrastructures.  Central banks also need reliable channels of  communication and cooperation with those agencies that track and combat  malicious cyber activity.\n\nThe last topic that I would like to touch on is market  liquidity and regulation.  Market  liquidity is essential to the proper functioning of financial markets.  I think of it as the cost—both in expense and  time—of buying or selling an asset for cash.   Market liquidity is like engine oil, which is essential for engine parts  to move properly without generating excessive friction and heat.  Market liquidity reflects many factors,  including the expense of conducting a transaction, the price of the transaction  relative to the midpoint of the bid-ask spread, any impact of the transaction  on the market price, and the speed at which the transaction can be completed.\n\nSome argue that market liquidity has been adversely affected  by post-crisis regulation.  For example,  the higher capital and liquidity requirements for the largest securities  dealers may have impaired market liquidity by reducing the profitability of  dealer intermediation activities and raising the cost of dealer balance  sheets.  But, before considering whether  any regulatory changes would be appropriate, it is important to carefully examine  the evidence.  New York Fed staff have  been conducting an extensive analysis of empirical measures of market liquidity  and the effects certain regulations may have had on it.  The work to date finds little evidence—based  on traditional liquidity measures—of any meaningful degradation in market  liquidity across key asset classes.   However, there are important data gaps that must be filled in order to  have a more complete assessment.  For  example, the U.S. Treasury market data capture dealer-to-dealer transactions,  but not dealer-to-customer transactions that are typically conducted on an  over-the-counter basis.  Moreover, we do  see other consequences of regulation, such as the rise in the foreign exchange  swap basis and the spread between LIBOR and the federal funds rate, as well as  the decline in dealer repo financing activity.   Still, it is important to keep in mind that even if further analysis  were to identify a regulatory-related decline in market liquidity, any associated  cost would have to be weighed against the benefits of these regulations in  terms of a safer and more robust financial system.\n\nIn closing, I hope you will find our program both engaging  and challenging.  Don’t be shy—our  speakers welcome difficult and thought-provoking questions.  Absorb all you can.  Use this opportunity to network with your  colleagues.  Hopefully, this experience  will stimulate your thinking and help you be successful in your career as a central  banker.\n\n1

    "text": "If all goes according to our forecast and the U.S. economy continues to make progress towards the Fed’s dual mandate goals of maximum sustainable employment and 2 percent inflation, the Federal Reserve will likely begin to raise its federal funds rate target off the zero lower bound sometime next year.  For the United States, the start of the normalization of U.S. monetary policy will be a very welcome development.  It will indicate that the U.S. economy has made great strides in healing itself from the damage caused by the U.S. housing boom and bust, and the financial crisis.\n\nHowever, this shift in policy will undoubtedly be accompanied by some degree of market turbulence.  Moreover, it could create significant challenges for those emerging market economies (EMEs) that have been the beneficiaries of large capital inflows in recent years.  What can the Federal Reserve do to minimize these risks?   These are some of the very important issues raised by Helene Rey’s work.\n\nLet me begin by highlighting some of the key points I will be making.  As always, the thoughts I offer today are my own, and should not be interpreted as representing the position of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFirst, what we may see in terms of market strains and macroeconomic adjustment during this normalization process will not be new.  Changes in Fed policy, and especially the tightening of monetary policy, have often created challenges for countries abroad, especially in EMEs.  Second, these countries, as a group, are better equipped today to handle those challenges than at perhaps any time in the past.  This reflects the fundamental improvements and stronger policy frameworks that many EMEs have put in place over the past 15 years.  Third, given the dollar’s role as the global reserve currency, the Federal Reserve has a special responsibility to manage U.S. monetary policy in a way that helps promote global financial stability.\n\nLike other central banks, our monetary policy mandate has a domestic focus.  But, our actions often have global implications that feed back into the U.S. economy and financial markets, and we need to always keep this in mind.  For most of us, the market volatility that we saw during the so-called “taper tantrum” in the spring and summer of 2013 still remains fresh in our minds.  EME financial markets were hit hardest, with declines in equity prices, a widening in sovereign debt spreads and a sharp increase in foreign exchange rate volatility.  In the U.S., we saw a spike in Treasury yields, with the 10-year rate rising by more than 100 basis points from early May before peaking in early September.\n\nMost commentary about this period has focused on the shift in expectations with respect to U.S. monetary policy—and, in particular, to uncertainty about the timing and implications of Fed tapering—as the catalyst for these moves.  This focus seems generally right to me, although other factors also played a role. 1 From one perspective, the unconventional nature of recent U.S. monetary policy adds little that is fundamentally new to the challenges that face the EMEs.  These policies simply represent a way of easing, necessitated by our coming up against the zero lower bound.  Central bankers have managed differences across countries in cyclical positions and policy stances many times in the past.  This time should not be fundamentally different.  But, from another perspective, we have less experience operating with unconventional monetary policy, and this creates more potential uncertainties.  These uncertainties put a premium on keen listening skills on our part and continued dialogue both among central bankers as well as between central bankers and the market.  In my view, it is important to recognize that our large scale asset purchase programs affect the size of term risk premia globally.  This new set of monetary policies affects financial asset prices in a different way compared to changes in short-term interest rates, and we should be humble regarding what we claim about our understanding of the importance of this distinction. Looking ahead, it seems likely that markets will remain focused on vulnerabilities that they might have ignored prior to the taper tantrum in 2013.  The greater premium on strong fundamentals, policy coherence and predictability will likely remain.  There will be no one right answer in managing the trade-offs that come with the changed environment, and adjustment will sometimes be difficult.  Moreover, we will undoubtedly experience further bumps in the road.  The renewed volatility we saw last month is evidence enough of that.  Yet, I think we can remain generally optimistic on the outlook so long as market participants continue to appropriately discriminate across countries, rather than treating EMEs as a homogenous group. Furthermore, many EMEs generally appear to be better equipped today to handle the Fed's prospective exit from its exceptional policy accommodation than they were in past tightening cycles.  This reflects the fundamental reforms these EMEs have put in place over the past 15 years, as well as the hard lessons they learned from past periods of market stress.  Among the positives are: The absence of the pegged exchange rate regimes that often were undermined violently in the past during periods of stress; Improved debt service ratios and generally moderate external debt levels; Larger foreign exchange reserve liquidity cushions; Clearer and more coherent monetary policy frameworks, supporting what are now generally low to moderate inflation rates; Generally improved fiscal discipline; and Better capitalized banking systems, supported by strengthened regulatory and supervisory frameworks. Of course, progress has not been uniform across EMEs, and more work remains to further strengthen institutional structures in some countries.  In particular, vulnerabilities remain in several important EMEs.  Still, the fundamental improvements I’ve cited leave many EMEs better positioned than in the past to weather those times in the cycle when the external environment turns from welcoming to wary. The impact that changes in Fed policy can have beyond our borders has led to calls for us to do more to internalize those impacts, or even further, to internationally coordinate policymaking.  As I’ve already noted, Fed policies have significant effects internationally, given the central place of U.S. markets in the global financial system and the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency.  In pursuing our policy responsibilities, we seek to conduct policy transparently and based on clear principles.  We are mindful of the global effects of Fed policy.  Promoting growth and stability in the U.S., I believe, is the most important contribution we can make to growth and stability worldwide. There is, of course, the argument that Fed policy has been too accommodative for too long, creating risks for financial stability worldwide.  Here, I think it’s important to consider carefully the counterfactual.  Would countries beyond our borders really have been better off with a weaker U.S. economy?  The fundamental issue is whether U.S. monetary policy has helped support our dual objectives of stable prices and maximum sustainable growth, and whether this support is consistent with a healthy global economy. Moreover, it is far from clear that explicitly coordinated policy would produce better outcomes for the global economy generally, or the EMEs specifically.  Central banks have challenges enough in tailoring policies to their own domestic circumstances.  I believe that it would be taking on too much to attempt to collectively fashion policy in reference to global conditions.  Monetary policy meant to suit everybody is likely in the end to suit nobody.  Similar considerations underlie the widespread move in the emerging world away from fixed exchange rate regimes.  Policymakers worldwide have learned that a framework capable of responding in a disciplined but flexible manner to changing domestic conditions works best over the long run. While explicit coordination looks neither feasible nor desirable, there is more that central banks in general, and the Fed in particular, could do to be better global stewards.  As an example, recent events demonstrate the importance of effective Fed communication.  It is clear in retrospect that our attempts in the spring of 2013 to provide guidance about the potential timing and pace of tapering confused market participants.  In particular, markets seemed to conflate tapering with monetary policy tightening and raised their expected paths for policy rates.  Lately, we seem to have done better: markets now seem to understand that policy rates will likely remain exceptionally low for a considerable period of time even now that the asset purchase program has been completed. As you know, we’ve taken a number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve our communications.  This includes regular press conferences following Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings by the Fed chair; the publishing of growth and inflation forecasts of FOMC participants; and a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at to assess progress toward our mandate.  We are, though, still learning how to more effectively communicate, especially given our new and expanded set of policy instruments. A second area in which we can and must do better is safeguarding financial stability.  Simply put, we failed to act both early enough and decisively enough to stem the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  The U.S. was not alone in this shortcoming, but given our position in the global financial system, we especially should have done better.  We've taken important steps reflecting both new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory and supervisory framework.  In particular, systemically important banking organizations must now hold amounts of capital and liquidity that are better aligned with their risk profiles, compensation schemes for these institutions will be more focused on rewarding long-term results and the official sector is making progress in solving the \"too-big-to-fail\" dilemma. All of this remains very much a work in progress.  But, these efforts should help us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the recent past, and to take a more proactive stance toward mitigating potential future vulnerabilities.  Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here.  Since the recent financial crisis, central banks worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how to better fulfill their mandates. Let me close with a final thought.  The largest problems that countries create for others often emanate from getting policy wrong domestically.  Recession or instability at home is often quickly exported.  Equally important, growth and stability abroad makes all our jobs easier.  This means that there are externalities in the work we do, so that more effective fulfillment of our domestic mandates helps to bring us to a better place collectively.  Ensuring global growth and stability is and will remain our joint and common endeavor. 1 Market participants also had to evaluate the possibility that growth in China and other EMEs might be slowing even as growth in the U.S. and other advanced economies was picking up. The subsequent market movements as investors withdrew funds from EME investments were an abrupt shock for these EMEs generally, especially after the long earlier period of abundant liquidity and ample inflows.\n\nFrom one perspective, the unconventional nature of recent U.S. monetary policy adds little that is fundamentally new to the challenges that face the EMEs.  These policies simply represent a way of easing, necessitated by our coming up against the zero lower bound.  Central bankers have managed differences across countries in cyclical positions and policy stances many times in the

    "text": "Good afternoon, I am pleased to be in northern New Jersey to address the 8th Morris County Economic Development Corporation (MCEDC) Business Growth Forum—an annual event organized by the Morris County Chamber of Commerce. It is always a pleasure to speak with the business community and I thank you for inviting me here today.\n\nI get out of my office in New York City regularly to inform myself—first-hand—about economic conditions and challenges across the second Federal Reserve District. Each visit within the region helps me to strengthen relationships with the diverse people of this District and build a deeper understanding of the economic challenges that we face. Today, I want to talk a bit about the Fed—what we do and why we do it. Then I’ll provide some thoughts about the national and local economic outlook. Normally in these regional outreach speeches I say little about monetary policy. But since the Federal Reserve made some meaningful decisions last week and it is important for people to understand the reasons and motivations for our actions. I will conclude with a brief discussion of policy.\n\nAfter that, I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about what the Fed does and why, and about the economic outlook.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nWhat the New York Fed Does By way of introduction, I will briefly review what my colleagues and I do at the New York Fed. The New York Fed is one of 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks that, together with the Board of Governors in Washington D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System, our nation’s central bank.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is independent within government. By law, we are charged with managing the nation’s monetary policy—taking actions that raise or lower interest rates to promote full employment and price stability. The Federal Reserve is also charged with promoting financial stability, without which we cannot achieve our economic objectives. We play an important role in the nation’s payments and settlements system, which you might think of as the plumbing of the financial system. And we have a specific mandate to promote economic development in each of our regions.\n\nAs president of the New York Fed, I serve as the vice chair of the FOMC, the Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. The members of this committee all strive to achieve our statutory mandate. Sometimes we have different views on the specific policy choices at hand, and you should view this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions—particularly during difficult economic circumstances such as we face today.\n\nIn fact, I think we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike. But we are united in our commitment to our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability and in our belief that preserving the independence of the Federal Reserve in making monetary policy decisions is very much in the public interest. That independence allows us to make tough decisions based on data and analysis insulated from short-term political pressures.\n\nAt FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region and for the nation. In formulating these assessments, we consult with many sources—our boards of directors, regional advisory councils, community leaders and other key stakeholders. My meeting with you and others today is part of this systematic effort to understand what is going on in the grassroots of our economy. To help me gather more information about our region, I met this morning with Fox Valve, a small business in Dover that manufactures specialized, highly engineered industrial parts. After that, I had the pleasure of participating in a roundtable discussion with members of the local Mexican-American business community. After this lunch, I will travel to Picatinny Arsenal to learn about its role in the state’s economic activity. I’ll also meet with the leaders of New Jersey Community Capital to learn about their cutting-edge programs for helping distressed homeowners and then I’ll speak to the students, faculty and alumni at Montclair State University.\n\nIn addition, my colleagues and I at the New York Fed continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces indices of economic activity for New York City, New York State and New Jersey. We also track local household credit conditions, including the amount and type of personal debt and whether payments are being made in a timely way.\n\nWe also conduct a periodic poll about the credit needs of small businesses, which are an important source of new jobs in the region. In our latest poll of several hundred firms, many report that they did not apply for credit because they were \"discouraged.\" Perhaps surprisingly, many of these non-applicants have credit profiles similar to other firms who successfully sought credit. This finding suggests that the demand for credit could pick up as some \"discouraged\" firms learn that they might be able to obtain credit now.\n\nIf you, as a representative of a small business, would like to participate in our next poll, please pass your card to my colleagues, who are in the audience, or see me after the speech and we will be glad to add you as a respondent.\n\nTo promote economic development in our local communities, we publish a lot of data and analysis on the local economy, including our small business poll findings. In addition we provide education outreach initiatives to help small businesses. For example, in October, we will host a workshop in Newark to help local businesses learn about export credit facilities and new tools for marketing. At the same time, we will launch our annual financial awareness video competition aimed at helping young adults make sound personal financial decisions.\n\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as New Jersey have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some of our work specifically to low- and moderate-income groups.\n\nWe have worked hard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates. This work is informed by analysis that suggests that high levels of foreclosures affect the value of neighboring homes, the local tax base and economic vitality more broadly. We have provided housing counselors and community development groups with the latest information on mortgage conditions, via mortgage briefs, roundtables, presentations and newsletters—including an interactive tool on our website that shows monthly delinquency and foreclosure conditions at the local level. This fall we will host a conference on distressed residential real estate to share what we and leading experts have learned with senior policymakers and practitioners from across the United States.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues busy.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions So how is our region doing? Let me start by saying that New Jersey is well-positioned to prosper. New Jersey is the 11th largest state—with a population of 8.8 million and this population is well-educated. Roughly 35 percent of adults over 24 years old have a college degree, well over the national average. Here in Morris County, that figure is almost 50 percent. The state is also quite ethnically diverse: roughly 20 percent of New Jersey residents were born abroad.\n\nThe state’s economy is industrially diverse, resembling the nation. New Jersey employs many people in healthcare, professional and business services, wholesale and retail trade, and leisure and hospitality. In the northern part of the state, we see a disproportionate share of jobs in a few industries: finance, particularly in Hudson County; goods distribution, related to the ports, rail lines and trucking and warehousing activities that are prominent here; pharmaceuticals manufacturing and R&D; and private education.\n\nThe area obviously benefits from its important links to New York City. In particular, many residents of this area, including myself, commute each day to the city.\n\nSo how is the recovery proceeding here? Based on the New York Fed’s indices, economic activity in the state did not begin to recover until November 2010, more than a year after the nation and New York City. Since then, activity has recovered at a moderate pace, although we are still operating below our previous peak.\n\nEmployment in New Jersey declined substantially during the downturn. Our employers cut about 250,000 jobs. This represents a 6 percent loss—roughly on par with the loss nationwide. Less than one in four of those jobs have been recovered to date, slightly weaker than the nationwide recovery and, of course, much weaker than I would like to see. Over the past year, the private sector has seen moderate job gains led by some of the key sectors I mentioned earlier, particularly professional and business services, education and health, and leisure and hospitality. But the state continues to shed jobs in manufacturing and there has been little recovery in construction. State and local government cut back employment substantially during 2010, though there has been a modest pick up over the past year.\n\nUnemployment among New Jersey residents remains high. July’s reading of 9.8 percent puts the state’s rate well above the U.S. average.\n\nMore broadly, how are the state’s families faring financially? While the median household income among New Jersey families is the second highest in the nation—at about $69,400—roughly a tenth of residents live in families with incomes below the poverty line. Although this rate is below the national rate of 14 percent, it varies considerably by county across the state, and is particularly high in Essex, Hudson and Passaic counties. Reducing poverty is a major challenge for policymakers.\n\nThe New York Fed’s measures of regional credit conditions suggest continued financial challenges for families here. As of the second quarter of 2012, for those people with a credit report, average debt per person in New Jersey was about $63,000, roughly unchanged over the past several years. Delinquency rates on that debt are high: 8.4 percent of all debt in the state is seriously delinquent, up from 7.4 percent in 2011 and above the national rate of 6.7 percent. So, many New Jersey households are still struggling with their finances.\n\nAlthough there are some recent signs that home prices in the state are starting to firm, nevertheless, the housing crisis continues to take a toll on our homeowners. As of June, 9.3 percent of all mortgage debt in New Jersey was 90-plus days delinquent, three percentage points above the national rate. And that delinquency rate is actually a little higher here in northern New Jersey.\n\nNational Economic Conditions The performance of the U.S. economy since the end of the recession in 2009 has been disappointing. Real GDP has grown at an annual rate of just over 2 percent over this period, and it was even slower in the first half of 2012. As a result, employment gains have been modest, unemployment remains above 8 percent—an unacceptably high level—and participation in the jobs market remains depressed. Moreover, about 5 million workers have been unemployed for six months or more. This is important because long-term unemployment can cause job skills to atrophy making it more difficult for such people to find jobs in the future. While the good news is that the job-finding rates of the long-term unemployed have not yet deteriorated as many feared, we ought not to take this for granted going forward.\n\nAlthough energy prices have begun to rise again, total inflation, as measured by year-over-year changes of the Consumer Price Index, is still around 1¾ percent—less than half the rate in September of 2011. In recent months, core inflation has also slowed and it is now also under 2 percent.\n\nHigher energy and grain prices mean that headline inflation will likely edge somewhat higher for a few months before moving slightly lower again. But measures of the underlying rate of inflation are moderate, wage gains remain subdued, and longer-term inflation expectations are fully consistent with our longer run inflation objective of 2 per cent as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator. Near term, the economic outlook is that the growth pace is likely to remain disappointing. On the positive side, motor vehicle sales in August increased solidly. Nevertheless, retail sales outside of autos and gasoline were soft in August as households continue to be cautious.\n\nOne brighter spot has been the housing market. Housing starts and sales of new and existing single-family homes are trending up gradually. Nationally, home prices have stabilized and begun to rise modestly after falling roughly 30 percent from their 2006 peak. Housing market conditions still vary significantly across the country with the worst performing counties experiencing annual house price declines of 8 percent or more. This sector is just getting back on its feet, so that even strong gains in the residential investment sector from its current tiny base will provide only a modest contribution to overall GDP growth. In addition, homeowner net worth remains much below its pre-crisis level.\n\nThe near-term outlook for the business sector is particularly worrisome right now. New orders for nondefense capital goods and information on business plans for spending on new structures both suggest weakness in business fixed investment. Also, many indicators point to sluggish manufacturing activity, including the ISM manufacturing composite index, several regional manufacturing surveys, and August industrial production. Our own Empire State Manufacturing Survey fell deeper into negative territory in September. This manufacturing slowdown stems from several factors, including the slowdown in the pace of growth abroad and uncertainties about how the fiscal cliff in Washington will be resolved.\n\nSo why has the economy grown so slowly since the official end of the \"Great Recession?\" There are many reasons, but I would cite five factors as particularly important:\n\nGiven the signs of improvement in some of these areas, including the slow but steady progress in healing balance sheets and restoring the supply of credit, I anticipate that the pace of economic growth will gradually pick up, supported by very low interest rates. But heading into the FOMC meeting last week, I judged that, if we did not ease monetary policy further, the pace of improvement would be unacceptably slow.\n\nMonetary Policy Last week the FOMC took additional action to promote a more robust recovery in a context of price stability. In order to ease policy, the FOMC deployed two complementary tools: asset purchases and forward guidance on interest rates. With respect to asset purchases, the Committee said it would start buying additional mortgage-backed securities at a rate of $40 billion a month. In terms of rate guidance, the Committee said it anticipated that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate would likely be warranted \"at least through mid-2015.\"\n\nAs Chairman Bernanke explained in the press conference that followed the meeting, the Committee also took two steps to underscore its commitment to ongoing support for the recovery. First, the Committee said that if it did not see substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, it will continue the MBS purchase program, undertake additional asset purchases and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until it does. Second, the Committee emphasized that it expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.\n\nAs usual, the Committee will publish minutes of the meeting three weeks after it took place. In the interim, however, I thought it might be useful to provide my own perspective on these actions.\n\nIn my view, the decision to ease policy further is fully consistent with our dual mandate and policy framework. As I mentioned earlier, we have two goals—to promote maximum employment and price stability. We therefore seek to minimize how far employment is from its long run normal level and inflation is from our longer-run goal of 2 percent on the PCE measure. Because monetary policy works with a time lag, we base policy not just on where the economy is today but where we expect it to be in the future. To do this, we make economic forecasts, based on data and insights from a broad range of economic models. We also take into account the balance of risks around our base case outlook.\n\nLooking ahead, in the absence of further monetary easing, I concluded that growth would remain too subdued over the next several years to make big inroads into the spare capacity that remains from the Great Recession. As a result, unemployment would remain unacceptably high, with economic risks skewed to the downside. Meanwhile, with substantial slack in labor markets and inflation expectations stable, inflation was likely to remain a bit below our 2 per cent longer-run objective.\n\nIn this situation, I concluded that our policy framework means that further monetary policy easing was appropriate provided that the benefits of using the tools available outweighed the costs. In my judgment, this standard has been satisfied here. I am confident that the costs are manageable, based in part on the experience we have of using the tools these past four years and that the benefits substantially exceed the costs, recognizing, of course, that our actions are not so powerful that they will instantly transform the economic outlook.\n\nSo how do our actions support economic activity? Buying assets and extending interest rate guidance puts downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, so they are lower than they would otherwise be for any given economic outlook. This supports the price of assets such as equities and homes. Buying mortgage-backed securities has the additional effect of narrowing the interest rate spread between these assets and Treasuries, which further reduces mortgage rates. Moreover, to the extent that our actions are seen as supporting the recovery and providing some insurance against adverse shocks, confidence in the medium-term economic outlook should also increase, making businesses and households more willing to invest, hire and spend. If we are successful, long-term Treasury yields could actually rise as confidence in a sustainable recovery increases. At the same time, the expected returns on private assets should rise and risk premia decline. This matters because such shifts would provide support to the economic recovery.\n\nNow it is true that some of the channels through which monetary policy affects the economy may be partially impaired at the moment. For example, because of ongoing restrictions in the supply of mortgage credit to customers with less than perfect credit records, the impact of lower mortgage rates on housing is probably less powerful than normal. While this restraint should slowly ease as house prices stabilize, the difficulties of households with lower credit scores in obtaining mortgage credit warrants ongoing attention. However, it is also worth noting other channels through which monetary policy affects economic activity are not impaired, including the impact on spending that is generated by rising wealth, declining risk premia and improving confidence.\n\nIt is important to recognize that our tools are not all-powerful—monetary policy is not a panacea for all that ails our economy. But, at the margin, firms facing lower borrowing costs for any given economic outlook will invest and hire more. People who refinance at lower rates, or see the value of their homes and 401K pension plans go up, will spend more. I believe that a nudge in the right direction will move us closer to a self-reinforcing cycle of more hiring, more spending, more growth, and more investment. This is the type of virtuous cycle that we should seek and one that is consistent with a self-sustaining and improving economy.\n\nI believe our latest statement provides greater clarity about how we intend to use the tools we have to promote our statutory objectives. As Chairman Bernanke said at his press conference, the idea is to make it \"more explicit, more transparent to the public, make it more obvious that the Fed will do what’s needed to provide the support for the economy.\"\n\nIn particular, the amount of asset purchases that we undertake will be a function of how the economy evolves. If the economy is weaker, we’ll do more. If the economy is stronger, and we see a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market sooner, we’ll end up doing less. From my perspective, linking our purchases more closely to economic outcomes underlines our determination to generate the kind of recovery that will deliver more rapid progress toward maximum employment in the context of price stability.\n\nSo what does \"substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market\" mean to me? Note that I will be focusing on the outlook, not just the current state of labor market conditions. In that context, it wouldn’t be enough for me just to see the unemployment rate decline a bit. It would also matter why the unemployment rate is declining and whether that improvement is likely to be sustained in the future. For example, higher payroll growth that was not supported by stronger economic growth, or falling unemployment rates that were due mainly to declining participation in the labor market, would not likely meet my test. Therefore, to gauge how substantial the improvement in the outlook for the labor market is, I will be looking at a range of indicators, including the unemployment rate, payrolls, the participation rate, the employment to population ratio and job finding rates, as well as the growth momentum within the economy.\n\nAs we approach year-end, the maturity extension program in which we are increasing our holdings of long-dated Treasuries will be coming to an end. I’ll be taking stock on how we are doing with respect to our employment and inflation goals and whether it will be appropriate to continue purchasing longer-dated Treasuries when that program concludes. I think that this will depend on whether we have seen a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook in the interim and any further evidence about the costs and benefits of continuing such purchases.\n\nIn terms of our monetary policy regime, the FOMC statement noted that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy \"for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.\" This is important because in situations such as the one we find ourselves in today, when monetary policy is somewhat constrained because we cannot lower the federal funds rate below zero, one of the most powerful things a central bank can do is to provide guidance as to how it will behave in the future. In this respect, I am pleased that we have drawn a sharper distinction between what we expect the economy to look like in a few years time and how we expect to set policy based on that outlook.\n\nIn particular, when the Committee extended the period for which it anticipates keeping the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels—which I interpret to mean the current range of zero to 25 basis points—to \"at least through mid-2015,\" I don't think this was due to greater pessimism about the economic outlook. In fact, when you look at the September Summary of Economic Projections of the Committee members—the medium-term growth outlook was upgraded a bit relative to prior July projections. In my judgment, combining the statement and our projections, the proper inference is that we were acting to secure a better outcome—more rapid progress toward full employment and price stability.\n\nConclusion To sum up, too many people remain without the jobs that they need to help support their families and themselves, and while the economic expansion is continuing, we aren’t yet growing fast enough to put back to work many of the idle workers and business facilities that represent the productive potential of our economy. Meanwhile analysis of the inflation outlook suggests that price increases are likely to be close to our 2 per cent longer run objective over the coming years.\n\nNot all of the factors that are holding back growth are directly amenable to monetary policy. Our nation’s economic challenges cannot be solved and our economic fortunes restored by the Federal Reserve alone. Others—notably the next Congress and White House—will have to step up to the plate.\n\nBut I am confident that the Fed will promote maximum employment and price stability to the greatest extent our tools permit, and we will stay the course. We are setting policy to achieve a stronger recovery in the context of price stability. When that finally materializes, I’ll view it as consistent with the result we are trying to achieve, and not a reason to pull back our policies prematurely. If you’re trying to get a car moving that is stuck in the mud, you don’t stop pushing the moment the wheels start turning—you keep pushing until the car is rolling and is clearly free.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "Good morning. I am pleased to be in  Brooklyn to speak to you and meet with the leadership of New York City's most  populous borough.\n\nIn  the aftermath of the financial crisis, as we wound down our emergency meetings,  I asked my staff to develop an energetic outreach program so that I could visit  the different parts of my district. Over time, I plan to visit all parts of the  region.\n\nEach  trip gives me a chance to deepen relationships with the people whom I  represent. As you may know, the New York Fed's district includes New York  State; twelve counties of northern New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut;  Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In May, I travelled through the  mid-Hudson Valley to meet with community leaders, businesses, academics, bankers  and elected officials in Poughkeepsie, Middletown, Fishkill and Newburgh. Even  though these are large towns, Brooklyn—with over 2.5 million residents in  2010—has many more people than all four of them combined.\n\nBrooklyn  is important to me not just because it is an important part of the New York  Fed's district, but also because I have lots of personal attachments. My  grandfather served as the minister of a church on Flatbush Avenue, so my father  was raised in Brooklyn. As an adult, I lived in Brooklyn myself for six years.  We moved out to the suburbs only so that my wife—who is an only child—and I  could be helpful to her parents.\n\nOf  course, we're meeting here today not only because of my personal ties.\n\nToday  I will meet with a wide range of people to talk about what I do. I will also  hear firsthand about the economic and financial issues important to you in  Brooklyn. These conversations help me to represent all my constituents in my  work at the Fed. I also look forward to visiting the Navy Yard and meeting with  Caribbean American Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and several new  businesses.\n\nI  thank the Chamber for inviting me to speak here in Brooklyn. This morning I  will talk about economic conditions in the nation and the region, paying  particular attention to how the recession has affected the labor market here.  Looking at jobs, Brooklyn's employers have weathered the recession better than  those in many parts of the region and country. However, the unemployment rate  remains too high, as does the level of stress among some homeowners here.\n\nAs  always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of  the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as  the FOMC.\n\nIntroduction to the New York Fed By way of introduction, let me  start by summarizing what the New York Fed is, what we do, and what makes my  job so interesting.\n\nThe  New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank,  which was created by Congress in 1913 to manage the supply of money in the  economy. The Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington,  D.C.—a federal agency currently led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 regional  Reserve Banks that span the country. The New York Fed is one of these Reserve  Banks.\n\nEach  Reserve Bank is distinct, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn  from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created  the Federal Reserve made the central bank independent so that policymakers  could make decisions about monetary policy—such as whether to adjust interest  rates—in the national interest, somewhat insulated from political pressure.  However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress  has set an objective for us: To pursue the highest level of employment  consistent with price stability. This goal is often referred to as our  \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two parts: high employment, and  low, stable inflation. In order to promote this objective, we also pay close  attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is  very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation. What do the terms stable  inflation and financial stability mean? By stable inflation we mean keeping the  rate of inflation low and fairly steady over the months. By financial  stability, we mean ensuring that financial institutions have sufficient capital  and are managed responsibly, so that we need not worry that the failure of one  large firm will trigger a cascade of other firm failures with more job losses.\n\nThe  Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of the Board of Governors plus  the presidents of each of the 12 district Banks, decides how to best achieve  the objective set by Congress. We meet in Washington, D.C., eight times per  year to vote on whether to change some key interest rates and, if so, by how  much. As the current New York Fed president, I am vice chairman of the FOMC. At  these meetings, each committee member presents his or her current outlook for  the economy.\n\nFor these assessments, we augment input from our research  departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied  by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with  local stakeholders. My visit to Brooklyn  today is a part of these regional activities, in which I learn first-hand about  the economic and financial conditions important to you.\n\nOne  thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles  unique within the Fed. For example, the New York Fed is the Reserve Bank  charged with implementing monetary policy. This means that at the direction of  the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities in order to change short-term  interest rates. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we  supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate  Fedwire® the conduit for large money transfers between banks. In addition, we  provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and  governments from around the world.\n\nAt  the regional level, we continually track economic conditions in our District  with the help of a number of tools that we have created for this purpose. For  example, to fill a void in current measures of economic output, my staff  produces monthly economic indicators that are similar in concept to gross  domestic product (or GDP) measures for New York State and New York City. We  also have initiated a consumer credit panel so that we can monitor local  household credit conditions.\n\nFurthermore,  we have a new quarterly survey to track credit and financing issues for small  businesses, which create a lot of jobs. Before I go further, I want to thank  the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the Myrtle Avenue Revitalization Program, the  Fulton Business Improvement District and Kings County Hispanic Chamber of  Commerce and other members of Brooklyn's vibrant business community, who  assisted us with this survey. More than 80 businesses responded from Brooklyn.  The survey results will be published early this summer and, of course, we will  share the results with you and post them on our website. If you are not already  part of the survey, I invite you to give your business card to my staff. We  will add you to our survey universe, so that it can reflect your views, too.\n\nTo  share the information that we gather and produce about our diverse district, we  have created a rich website with localized current data and maps on conditions  in the region. I invite you to visit us at newyorkfed.org to explore the highly  detailed information on small business, credit and housing conditions that we  provide.\n\nFinally,  and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with  our colleagues in Washington and at other agencies in the United States and  abroad to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing. As  regulators, we have made progress, for instance, in crafting tougher capital  rules for the biggest banks.\n\nYet, much remains to be done and we are determined  to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis  business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of  regulators like ourselves. We must learn from the economic catastrophe of the  past few years so that the financial system is able to perform its essential role  in supporting economic activity without being a source of instability for the  economy as a whole.\n\nAll  in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal  times.\n\nNational Economic Conditions Now, what are the outlook and  risks for economic activity, employment and inflation in the nation?\n\nSince  the recession ended in 2009, the economy has grown at a modest pace. Real  GDP—that's the economic output of the country—increased 2.8 percent between the  fourth quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2010. This growth was  sufficient to lead to a modest one-half percentage point decline in the  unemployment rate over the course of 2010.\n\nHowever,  economic growth so far this year has been disappointing. Real GDP in the first  quarter of 2011 grew at a tepid 1.8 percent annual rate, and the available data  suggest that growth in the current quarter will not be much better.\n\nA  major factor behind this slowdown is that real consumption growth (that is,  spending on goods and services adjusted for price increases) has been slower  than in the last quarter of 2010. This occurred, in part, because higher  gasoline and food prices reduced the income that households could spend on  other purchases. High energy prices also contributed to lower consumer  confidence, which may have had an independent negative effect on consumer  spending.\n\nAs  noted, a number of economic indicators suggest that economic growth in the  second quarter will also be subpar. Manufacturing production fell in April.  Most business survey indicators, including the New York Fed's own Empire State  Manufacturing Survey, also have declined recently, although most continue to  signal some growth. The housing market remains very weak and home prices fell  in early 2011. After a notable improvement earlier in the year, the labor  market showed more softness recently: more workers filed for unemployment  insurance in the past few weeks, firms added fewer jobs on net in May, and  unemployment inched up in April and May.\n\nIn  part, this softness is related to factors that I expect will prove transitory.  These factors include the rapid rise in gas and food prices that I noted  earlier, supply disruptions associated with the earthquake in Japan, and severe  weather and flooding in parts of the United States. All three suggest that the  soft patch may not persist. However, we continue to monitor the data for signs  of more persistent weakness, whether related to the interaction of housing and  consumption or some other factor.\n\nAnother  reason to expect the economy to recover from this soft patch is that many  fundamentals have improved since last year. In particular:\n\nConsequently,  I anticipate that economic growth will pick up enough in the second half of  2011 to sustain a moderate economic recovery. Still, the pace of recovery  probably will be painfully slow for the many unemployed and underemployed  workers. Even if the economy added 300,000 jobs per month over the next year  and a half, we would likely still have considerable labor market slack at the  end of 2012.\n\nEven  though I expect a moderate economic recovery to be sustained, the recent  disappointing data suggest that downside risks to the outlook have increased.  Let me list some of them for you:\n\nAlthough  these issues bear watching, I still believe that they remain risks rather than  the most likely outcomes.\n\nWith  respect to inflation, after a period when inflation was lower than the Fed  would like to see, headline inflation (on a yearly basis) has risen somewhat  above desired levels. The recent rise in commodity prices is likely to push up  headline inflation further in coming months. It is noteworthy, however, that  the spike in oil and food prices over the past year has not spilled over much  to the prices of other goods and services. Furthermore, commodity prices have  dipped in the recent weeks.\n\nThus, most measures of underlying inflation  trends—including core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy  prices)—remain below levels consistent with our mandate for price stability.\n\nGoing  forward, futures markets do not signal that investors expect commodity prices  to rise rapidly from current levels. Provided these prices stop rising rapidly  (or indeed retreat further), I would expect headline inflation to decline to a  level closer to our longer-run objectives. While this process plays out,  however, it is critical that we ensure that inflation expectations do not  become unmoored. It is much harder to keep inflation in check if people begin  to raise their expectations of inflation. At this point, measures of inflation  expectations overall remain well within the range of recent years—and some  measures have moved down significantly in recent weeks.\n\nEconomists  at the New York Fed have examined inflation expectations using a unique survey  that we sponsor. As reported in a recent post on our new Liberty Street  Economics blog, they find no evidence to suggest that a wage-price inflation  spiral is getting underway. However, we continue to monitor expectations for  medium-term inflation very closely.\n\nTo  sum up, despite the recent soft patch, economic conditions have improved in the  past year. I expect a moderate recovery to continue. However, we still have a  considerable way to go to meet the Fed's dual mandate of full employment and  price stability.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions So, how is our region doing?  As I mentioned a moment ago, the New York Fed produces economic indicators to  help monitor the performance of the region. Based on these measures, the  downturn in economic activity in New York City ended in November of 2009. Since  then, New York City's economy has been on the mend, and our numbers for April  show that the recovery continues at a healthy clip.\n\nLet  me turn specifically to employment trends in the region. In particular, I want  to describe our region's experience during the recession and recovery. To put  this in context, it's important to relate our region's downturn to the nation's  experience.\n\nNationally,  the Great Recession, which began in December 2007, has been the deepest  economic downturn since World War II. When employment finally bottomed out in  February 2010—seven months after the official end of the recession—the country  had lost almost 9 million jobs—a 6 percent drop—and the unemployment rate had  more than doubled. In addition to the millions of people who lost their jobs,  many more saw their hours or income cut, and the duration of unemployment for  jobless workers reached a historical high. For many families, this distress was  compounded by losses of wealth from declining home prices. Since that low point  of employment, job creation has resumed, albeit at a slower pace than we would  like, and unemployment has fallen by about a percentage point.\n\nAs  in other parts of the country, employment in our region declined substantially  during the recession. However, employment in New York City and across much of  New York State declined less severely than the nation. Both the state and city  lost less than 4 percent of their jobs. Part of the reason for the more  moderate decline in jobs in New York during the recession was a less pronounced  boom-bust housing cycle. Indeed, as a percentage, the city lost fewer jobs  during this recession than it did during either of the last two downturns.\n\nNow,  as in the nation, a labor market recovery has begun across much of the region.  Over the past year, New York State has added roughly 100,000 private-sector  jobs. Within the state, the recovery has been somewhat uneven. New York City  has been gaining jobs for more than a year now—at roughly the same pace as the  nation—and it has recovered about half of the jobs lost during the downturn.\n\nConditions in Brooklyn Continuing  to drill down geographically, let me talk in more detail about conditions here  in Brooklyn—recognizing that Brooklyn is a big city and conditions vary  neighborhood by neighborhood.\n\nAs  you know, if Brooklyn were a city it would rank as the fourth largest in the  nation. The borough's population is also amazingly diverse. Over 36 percent of  those currently residing in the borough were born abroad—and that doesn't even  include second generation immigrants. Significant numbers of residents of the  borough were born in the Caribbean Islands, China, Mexico, Ukraine and Russia.\n\nBrooklyn  has a vibrant business community: almost a half-million jobs are located in the  borough. Almost two out of every five jobs are found in the health care and  social assistance sector, and these jobs represent a wide range of providers  including hospitals, outpatient centers, visiting nurses and child care  employees. The borough is also home to jobs in a diverse set of other  industries, including apparel manufacturing, retail trade, and professional  services, not to mention a number of public and private colleges.\n\nWhere  do Brooklyn residents work? Many Brooklynites work in businesses within the  borough, in the sectors that I just mentioned. However, the majority commute to  work, primarily in Manhattan (as I did when I lived here), but also in other  boroughs. Thus, the improving job markets in the city and the region will also  help Brooklyn residents.\n\nNow,  how did the borough fare during the recent downturn and how is the recovery  proceeding? I will answer this by looking at jobs and at housing and credit  conditions.\n\nWith  regard to jobs, the news is mixed. On the positive side, Brooklyn employers  held their own during the 2008-09 downturn and have bounced back well. From  peak to trough, the number of jobs located in Brooklyn shrank by 1 percent,  which was not nearly as steep as in New York City as a whole, and much less  severe than the national average.\n\nThe  recovery in jobs in Brooklyn is proceeding at a healthy pace. By early 2010,  employment in Brooklyn had recouped all its losses and was setting new highs.\n\nEncouragingly, job growth was brisk through the third quarter of 2010—the  latest date for which we have hard figures. By then, overall employment was up  by 5 percent from its low point in early 2009. This jobs recovery is being led  by an ongoing expansion in healthcare, which was little affected by the  downturn, as well as sizeable gains in the leisure and hospitality, retail, and  professional and business services sectors.\n\nOn  the negative side, unemployment for those who live in Brooklyn remains very  high. The seeming disconnect between the healthy jobs picture that I just  described and the high rate of joblessness is largely explained by the majority  of Brooklynites who commute to work. The severe layoffs in Manhattan and other  boroughs during the downturn cost many Brooklyn residents their jobs. Thus,  joblessness among residents of Brooklyn is still running a little over 9  percent—above the citywide average and slightly above the national rate. As in  much of the region and the nation, jobless rates have retreated somewhat but  still remain stubbornly high.\n\nAlso,  there is plenty of room for improvement when one focuses on the situation of  Brooklyn households.\n\nIn  2010, almost a fifth of families in Brooklyn had incomes below the poverty  level, about twice as high as the national rate. In addition, many  self-employed workers in areas such as real estate sustained big hits to their  income during the downturn.\n\nLike  the nation, Brooklyn experienced a housing price boom and bust. However,  Brooklyn is showing signs of quicker recovery than the nation. From 2000 to  2007, average home prices in the borough increased about 2½ times, compared  with a doubling in prices at the national level. During the housing bust,  prices here fell steeply—by 15 percent—but not as much as the 25 percent  national drop. Since then, however, local home prices have begun to recover, even  as they have fallen to new lows nationally. Nevertheless, as of March of this  year, 12 percent of Brooklyn's homeowners are seriously delinquent on their  mortgages. That is high compared with the 8 percent national rate.\n\nOf  course, unlike much of the nation, most Brooklynites rent their homes, rather  than own them. This tendency to rent may be one reason that Brooklyn's  economy—like New York City's more generally—was not hit quite as hard by the  housing downturn and ensuing recession. Yet, many renters, like owners, are  still experiencing financial stress from job and income losses.\n\nMore  broadly, how are Brooklyn's families doing in restoring their finances? During  the recession, all across the nation, debt delinquencies soared and many  families found that they needed to reduce their debt to a sustainable level. We  keep track of the credit conditions in the region—including the average debt  that people carry and whether they are current with their payments—using the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Consumer Credit Panel.\n\nIn  Brooklyn, although delinquencies remain very high, debt levels and  delinquencies continue to fall. The amount of debt carried per person with a  credit report in the borough is now down by 8 percent from its peak level in  late 2008, and is lower than average for New York State. As of the first  quarter of this year, debt per person was continuing to fall modestly.\n\nNevertheless,  the mortgage crisis has taken a heavy toll on Brooklyn's homeowners. In terms  of consumer debt, seriously delinquent debt (including mortgages) quadrupled  from 2005 to 2009, reaching nearly double the statewide rate. As of the first  quarter of 2011, this delinquency rate has declined modestly. Yet,  delinquencies in Brooklyn remain far higher than the rate in the rest of New  York State and the nation. These patterns suggest that Brooklyn's households  have made some progress on restoring their balance sheets to health, but still  are likely to have a considerable ways to go before they complete the process.\n\nThus,  Brooklyn was affected by the recession, but less so than the nation and even  somewhat less so than other parts of the city. With prospects for the national  economy improving, the outlook for Brooklyn's diverse economy and labor force,  and New York City's as a whole is brightening as well. Nevertheless, while a  jobs recovery appears underway, unemployment and poverty remain high and signs  of stress clearly remain in household finance.\n\nIn  the near-term, the regional economy, and indeed the economy of the entire  state, faces a number of challenges. Among them is the need to address the large  state budget gap. New York is not alone in having seen its tax revenue decline  as the economy weakened and, thus, faces hard choices. As I mentioned, state  and local government employment has already weakened in many areas. Going  forward, further contraction in this sector continues to pose some risks to the  recovery.\n\nDespite  these issues, in our recent survey, nearly 40 percent of Brooklyn small  businesses reported an increase in their sales during the first quarter of  2011. In addition, when asked about their business outlook, over two-thirds of  Brooklyn respondents responded positively, saying that the outlook for their  business was fair to very good. In fact, small businesses in Brooklyn were the  most optimistic among the five boroughs of New York City.\n\nLonger  term, one of the key challenges for this region is to ensure that it trains and  attracts a highly skilled workforce that can meet the needs of innovative and  rapidly changing firms. A region's human capital—that is, the skills and  education of its work force—determines a large part of its economic success and  resiliency. The education and research taking place in local colleges and  universities, such as Brooklyn College and the Polytechnic Institute of New  York, directly helps to build those skills and to sustain economic growth.\n\nConclusion To sum up, the national  economy experienced a soft patch in activity during the first quarter of 2011  that has spilled over into the beginning of the second quarter. Nevertheless,  the recovery in much of the region continued at a good pace.\n\nIt  is very encouraging that Brooklyn's employers have already added back enough  jobs to replace all those lost during the recession, and then some. The  continued expansion of employment across the nation should also support  economic activity and jobs in Brooklyn.\n\nYet  the regional recovery is still far complete. Brooklyn's households continue to  have relatively high delinquency rates on their mortgage and other debt,  suggesting continued stress for many of its residents. Furthermore, despite  recent improvements, both nationally and in Brooklyn, unemployment remains  unacceptably high.\n\nThank  you for your kind attention. I will now be happy to answer some questions.",

    "text": "Thank you for having me here today.    It is a great honor to be\n  on a panel with Peter Fisher and Bill Poole.  I am the neophyte here in\nterms of central banking experience!\n\nBefore I begin, let me emphasize that my comments represent my own views\n  and opinions and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI am going to talk today about the\n  Fed’s provision of liquidity to banks\nand dealers and to market participants more generally.\n\nI would break down our actions into three broad classes.\n\nFirst, we addressed the acute seizing up of inter-bank financing markets.  For\n  banks, we introduced the Term Auction Facility in December 2007 and for the\n  primary dealers, the Term Securities Lending Facility and Primary Dealer Credit\n  Facility in March 2008.  In addition, the Federal Reserve entered into\n  FX swap agreements with major global central banks in order to channel dollar\nliquidity to banks overseas.\n\nSecond, we expanded our provision of short term\n  financing beyond banks and dealers in order to alleviate constraints on highly\n  rated corporate borrowers.   The\n  two most noteworthy examples of this are the Commercial Paper Funding Facility,\n  which was introduced in October 2008, and the Term Asset-Backed Securities\n  Lending Facility (announced in November 2008, but not up and running until\nlast month.)\n\nThird, once\n  policy rates were near the zero-bound, we expanded the type of assets that\n  the Fed purchased.   In order to put downward pressure on general\n  longer term borrowing rates, particularly mortgage rates, the Federal Reserve\n  has purchased the  debt of the GSEs, namely, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\n  and the mortgage-backed-securities they issue, and, more recently, longer-term\nTreasuries.\n\nSo why has the Fed done so much in terms of special programs?\n\nAs I see it,\n  there are four major reasons behind the dramatic expansion of the Fed’s\n  liquidity programs:\n\nThis financial crisis has been marked by the rapid deleveraging of the non-bank\n  financial sector.  This deleveraging has been driven mainly by the collapse\n  of securitization activity, pressure on dealers to reduce leverage and the\n  spillover of these efforts on to other financial players such as hedge funds.\n\nThis deleveraging process, in turn, has put intense pressure on the balance\n  sheet capacity of the banking sector.   Not only can banks no longer securitize\n  assets as before, but assets that they thought were off their books have come\nback on.\n\nAlthough the deleveraging process is inevitable following periods when the\n  financial system has become overextended, it does matter how this deleveraging\n  process takes place.  In the current crisis, the deleveraging process\n  at times has been very violent and dangerous, with powerful reinforcing feedback\n  loops intensifying the process.  During these episodes, bystanders who\n  did not engage in excess may be trampled and fail.  This may exacerbate\n  the tightening in financial conditions, intensifying the constraint on credit\navailability and the downward pressure on economic activity.\n\nFor example, in\n  March 2008, in the run-up to Bear Stearns’ demise, the\n  deleveraging process intensified.    Market volatility increased;\n  this caused lenders to increase the haircuts they assessed against collateral\n  to secure their lending.  The higher haircuts, in turn, squeezed highly\n  leveraged investors who were forced to sell assets.  This drove down asset\n  prices and increased price volatility further, leading to still-higher haircuts.\n  This intensified the deleveraging process, which led to more mark-to-market\nlosses.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s facilities for banks and dealers have\n  been designed, in part, to slow down the deleveraging process. The TAF, the\n  TSLF and the PDCF have provided assurance to banks and dealers that they have\n  a place where they can obtain funding for their less liquid collateral. As\n  a result, they will not be forced to dump assets, further depressing market\n  prices, increasing volatility and the upward pressure on haircuts. The deleveraging\n  will still take place—and we have seen it—just not so quickly and\nviolently that it would destabilize the entire financial system.\n\nThe second\n  major intent of the liquidity facilities has been for the Fed to expand its\n  balance sheet and, by doing so, offset some of shrinkage that has been occurring\n  among non-bank financial intermediaries. The fact is the banking system is\n  capital-constrained, with insufficient capital to expand its balance sheet\n  fast enough to offset the shrinkage evident in the non-bank sector. Although\n  the Federal Reserve cannot create capital for banks, it can provide funding\n  directly to the private sector, attenuating the consequences caused by a balance-sheet-constrained\nbanking system.\n\nThe CPFF and the TALF are both important in restoring the flow\n  of credit to borrowers. The CPFF essentially jump-started the commercial paper\n  market, which had largely shut down following the failure of Lehman Brothers\nin September.\n\nThe TALF’s purpose is to restart the securitization markets, and thereby\n  lower the cost of borrowing to households and business.  The TALF does\n  this by providing term, non-recourse loans to investors against AAA-rated collateral.\n  Investor demand for these loans leads to downward pressure on AAA-rated financing\n  rates, lowering the cost of credit. Although TALF is off to a relatively slow\n  start—hurt, in part, by the reluctance of some investors to participate\n  because of worries about the potential implications for them of the TARP funding\n  that is involved in the TALF program, it has helped to restart the securitization\n  markets in the consumer asset-backed securities area and has brought down funding\ncosts for consumer ABS issuers.\n\nThe third goal of these policy interventions\n  has been to improve market function. By dramatically reducing rollover risk,\n  the Federal Reserve’s willingness\n  to serve as the lender or investor of last resort has helped improve market\n  function in a broad number of areas.  Rollover risk is the risk that a\n  borrower may not be able to obtain new funding in order to repay an investor\n  when the investor needs the funds for other uses. If rollover risk is high,\n  the investor is going to be concerned about getting its funds back and, thus,\n  may be unwilling to make the investment in the first place.  The impact\n  of the Fed’s intervention on rollover risk has been especially important\nin the triparty repo market and in the commercial paper market.\n\nThe triparty\n  repo market is a market in which investors such as money market mutual funds\n  lend funds, mostly on an overnight basis, to securities dealers, with the loans\n  collateralized by high-quality securities. During the crisis, this market became\n  less stable. As the financial condition of some of the major securities dealers\n  worsened, the clearing banks became more reluctant to return the cash that\n  the triparty repo investors had invested the prior evening. The clearing banks\n  were worried that if a dealer were to fail, they could be stuck with a large\n  obligation. The nervousness of the clearing banks, in turn, spilled back to\n  the investors. If there is some chance that I might not get my cash back and\n  instead be stuck with the collateral, do I really want to make the loan in\n  the first place? The Primary Dealer Credit Facility essentially broke this\n  dynamic by putting the Federal Reserve in the position of lender of last resort\n  in the triparty repo system. With the Federal Reserve willing to lend against\n  collateral, the clearing banks no longer have significant intraday risk exposure.\n  The triparty repo investors have been reassured that they would be paid back.\nAs a consequence, they were willing to keep investing.\n\nThe TAF and the dollar\n  facilities offered by foreign central banks provided the same antidote to rollover\n  risk in the interbank funding markets. Banks that were reluctant to lend to\n  one another because of rollover risk became willing to reengage because they\n  knew that the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks would lend against\n  high-quality collateral.\n\nBy eliminating rollover risk, the CPFF also helped to restore market function\n  in the commercial paper market.    Commercial paper investors who\n  had shunned the market returned because they were no longer worried that they\n  could get their money back.  In extremis, the Federal Reserve could purchase\n  the commercial paper from the issuer, generating the funds to repay the private\ninvestors’ commercial paper investment.\n\nThe fourth and final goal of\n  the Fed’s liquidity facilities has been\n  to ease financial conditions.  This has been particularly important in\n  the current environment because the federal funds rate cannot be pushed below\n  zero (the so-called zero-bound constraint).  This means that with the\n  federal funds rate having been effectively lowered as far as it can go, the\n  Federal Reserve has had to turn to other tools such as asset purchase programs\n  if it is to ease financial conditions further as warranted given macroeconomic\nconditions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s purchases of agency debt, agency MBS\n  and longer-term Treasuries have been implemented mainly with one goal in mind—reduce\n  longer-term private sector interest rates, and thereby provide stimulus to\nthe U.S. economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s Treasury purchase program is designed to hold\n  down the level of longer-term interest rates.   To the extent that a lower\n  level of long-term Treasury rates pulls down the level of private long-term\n  rates, then these purchases should also ease financial market conditions.\n\nSo how have the Fed’s facilities worked in practice?\n\nIn general, I\n  think the facilities have worked quite well. In those areas where the facilities\n  have been active, we generally have seen an improvement in market conditions.\n\nBut the facilities have not been a panacea for three reasons. First, the facilities\n  cannot address the fundamental problem—the shortage of\n  capital in the banking system.  The facilities can slow down the deleveraging\n  process, but until the banking system is viewed as being sufficiently well-capitalized\n  and is able to expand its lending activity significantly, the limits on credit\n  availability caused by an impaired banking system will make it more difficult\n  to generate a sustainable economic recovery.\n\nSecond, there are limits on what\n  the Fed can do legally. For example, the Fed can only lend if it is secured\n  to its satisfaction. There has to be sufficient collateral available. The Fed\n  cannot lend on an unsecured basis or provide guarantees. And the Fed cannot\n  purchase assets other than Treasuries, agencies and agency MBS, and short-dated\n  general obligations of states and municipalities.\n\nThird, the effectiveness\n  of some of the Fed facilities have been undercut by stigma—the discount\n  window is the best example of this—or by worries\n  about what other strings are or might be attached to the use of the facilities—the\n  TALF comes to mind in this respect.\n\nOne reason why the TALF has gotten off\n  to a relatively slow start is the reluctance of investors to participate. Issuers’ interest,\n  not surprisingly, dwarfs investor demand at this stage of the program. Some\n  investors are apparently reluctant not because the economics of the program\n  are unattractive, but because of worries about what participation might lead\n  to. The TARP loans to banks led to intense scrutiny of bank compensation practices\n  given that TALF loans are ultimately secured by TARP funds, investor anxiety\n  about using the program has risen.\n\nMy own view is that these fears are misplaced.\n  The TARP funds in the TALF program only come in on the backend of the program\n  when loans are put back to the Fed. The lending to investors on the front end\n  is completely a Federal Reserve program and operation. That being said, I understand\n  the reasons for the anxiety given the political discourse on this subject.\n   I think it is worth emphasizing that actions that lead investors to shun taking\n  risk, especially in this environment, are ultimately detrimental to the ability\n  of households and businesses to secure credit at reasonable borrowing rates.\n\nThe\n  Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities and asset purchase programs\n  have led to a substantial expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance\n  sheet since September 2008. Currently, the Fed’s balance sheet totals\n  about $2.2 trillion, up from about $900 billion last fall prior to Lehman’s\n  failure.\n\nIn thinking about this balance sheet expansion, I would make three broad points.\n  First, in my mind, the goal is not the expansion of the balance sheet per se,\n  but the objectives that I laid out earlier. In this respect, the expansion\n  of the balance sheet differs considerably from Japan’s experience with\n  quantitative easing.  In the current circumstance, the Federal Reserve’s\n  liquidity programs act on the asset side of the balance sheet as the Fed lends\n  funds against less liquid collateral and expands its asset holdings via purchases\n  of agency debt, agency MBS and Treasuries.  The goals are to slow down\n  the pace of deleveraging to reduce the risk of catastrophic failure, improve\n  market function and ease financial market conditions.\n\nIn contrast, the Bank\n  of Japan worked on the liability side of the balance. Their goal was to expand\n  the amount of excess reserves held by the banking system so that the banks\n  would be more willing to expand their credit provisions. Although the Fed’s\n  activities have led to a big jump in excess reserves, this increase is incidental—a\n  byproduct rather than goal of the asset-oriented programs.\n\nSecond, as a consequence\n  of this my point, the size of the balance sheet, is not a good metric for measuring\n  the impact of the Fed’s facilities or\n  the amount of stimulus that the Fed is providing via these programs.  For\n  example, consider the impact of the Fed facilities on rollover risk.  A\n  Fed facility that eliminates rollover risk might not be used at all.  There\n  might be no balance sheet impact.  Nevertheless, the facility could have\n  an important impact on market function and financial market conditions.\n\nIt\n  is not possible to mechanically map the size of the balance sheet back onto\n  the impact on financial market conditions.  That is because the balance\n  sheet size is being driven by a large number of different actions.  Is\n  a dollar of TAF lending equivalent to a dollar extended through the CPFF or\n  to a dollar of Treasury purchases?   How important is the PDCF?  It\n  backstops lots of lending, but outstanding amounts are very low.   The\n  differences between the various programs and activities mean that the balance\n  sheet size should be interpreted in light of the impact on market function\n  and financial market conditions, not by the impact on the size of the balance\n  sheet.\n\nThe size of the balance sheet is also not a good standard because the\n  use of the different facilities depends on the degree of impairment in market\n  function. If market conditions were to deteriorate, I would expect that usage\n  of the Fed’s\n  facilities would increase and the balance sheet would grow in size.    This\n  would be appropriate.  The Fed’s balance sheet would act as a shock\n  absorber, cushioning the impact of the shift in market conditions.  In\n  such circumstances, the balance sheet would act as a counter-cyclical dampening\n  mechanism.  I would view that as a desirable outcome.\n\nIn contrast, if the\n  Fed were committed to a particular balance sheet trajectory, then, as market\n  conditions improved and financial conditions eased and usage of the Fed’s\n  liquidity facilities diminished, the Fed would have to offset this by increasing\n  the scope of its liquidity facilities or by expanding its asset purchase programs.\n  It is unclear to me why the Federal Reserve would want to apply more stimulus\n  at a time when market conditions were improving. This suggests that some variability\n  in the trajectory of the Fed’s balance\n  should be expected and might even be desirable.  And, in fact, this is\n  what we have seen in practice.\n\nThird, I am not worried at all that the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet\n  expansion will generate an inflation problem.   It should be emphasized\n  that the Federal Reserve has the ability to manage down the size of its balance\n  sheet over time once financial conditions and the economy improve.  Many\n  of the liquidity facilities will shrink automatically as financial conditions\n  normalize.  With the exception of TAF loans, all of the other Fed liquidity\n  facilities charge rates that are higher than what one would expect during more\n  normal financial circumstances.  And, if we want the TAF loans to shrink,\n  we can either shrink the amounts on offer or raise the interest rate we charge,\n  or both.  The other assets such as Treasury securities and agency MBS\n  can be sold or the impact on reserves be offset by repurchase operations that\n  drain reserves from the banking system.\n\nMore importantly, the Federal Reserve\n  now has the tools to allow the conduct of monetary policy to be separated from\n  the size of the balance sheet and the amount of excess reserves in the banking\n  system. In September 2008, the Federal Reserve gained the authority to pay\n  interest on excess reserves. This provides a tool that allows Fed officials\n  to tighten monetary policy and raise private sector interest rates by raising\n  the rate paid on excess reserves.\n\nSome skeptics note that when interest on\n  excess reserves was first implemented, the federal funds rate traded somewhat\n  below the rate on excess reserves.  This has created worry in some quarters\n  that paying interest on excess reserves might not work very well as a tool\n  for controlling the federal funds rate.\n\nOn this issue, two points are warranted.\n  First, the relatively large gap between the interest rate on excess reserves\n  and the federal funds rate was due, in large part, to the impaired condition\n  of the banking system, which inhibited the willingness of banks to arbitrage\n  that gap. Because balance sheet capacity was scarce, banks were reluctant to\n  use their balance sheets to purchase federal funds at a slight discount to\n  the interest on excess reserves rate. As the banking system returns to health,\n  this arbitrage is likely to become more attractive, causing the gap between\n  the interest rate on excess reserves and the federal funds rate to narrow.\n\nSecond, the Federal Reserve could alter its monetary policy framework in order\n  to increase its control of monetary policy in a large excess reserve environment.\n  It is beyond the scope of this speech to get into the details, but we have\n  plenty of options in devising incentives for banks to hold reserves at the\n  Fed that would improve our ability to control the federal funds rate. The challenge\n  will be deciding on the best option, not in finding a workable approach.\n\nThank\n  you for your attention.\n\nI am happy to take any questions.",

    "text": "Over the past 20 months, I have been engaged in a series of outreach meetings all across my Federal Reserve District. I consider these visits just as important as my trips to Washington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy or to Switzerland to shape international bank regulation. The understanding of issues and concerns that I gain today will help ensure that my policy decisions reflect the public interest in the broadest sense.\n\nEach visit within the region helps me deepen relationships with the people I represent. As you may know, the New York Fed's District includes all of New York State; 12 counties in northern New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In August, I met with community leaders, businesses and elected officials in Newark, Patterson and Jersey City. Earlier this year I went to Brooklyn, Queens and Puerto Rico, while last year I visited several upstate cities.\n\nAlthough the Bronx is the second smallest borough, it is hardly small. It would take the combined population of three to four average U.S. cities to add up to the 1.4 million residents found here. You host world-class institutions such as the Yankees, the Bronx Zoo, the New York Botanical Garden, the Montefiore Medical Center, the Hunts Point Market and Fordham University. You also are home to the largest Dominican population in the City and sizable groups from Jamaica, Mexico, Ecuador, Ghana and Honduras. In sum, the Bronx is a major metropolitan area and economic force in its own right.\n\nWhat the New York Fed Does By way of introduction, I will briefly review what the New York Fed does and what makes my job so interesting. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nI am vice chair of the FOMC—a Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. The members of this committee all strive to set policy to advance the mandate given to us by Congress to promote the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability. Sometimes we have different views on the specific policy choice on hand, and you should view this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions, particularly at times like this, and we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike. But we are united in our commitment to our mandate and in our belief that Fed independence is essential in the public interest, because it allows us to take tough decisions insulated from short-term political pressures.\n\nAt FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region and the nation. For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical information that we learn from listening to our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and community leaders, such as you and others I'll meet on this visit. Later today I'll meet with the people at the Bronx Chamber of Commerce, Baldor Foods, Aging in America—a skilled nursing facility—and housing advocates.\n\nAt the New York Fed, we continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of economic activity for New York City, New Jersey and New York State. These indexes are essentially local measures of output—similar to gross domestic product, or GDP at the national level. We have also started a consumer panel to track local household credit conditions, including the amount and type of debt owed by an average person and whether payments are being made in a timely way.\n\nIn addition, we have a new survey about credit and financing for small businesses, which are an important source of new jobs. The survey asks firms about credit applications and reasons for not seeking credit. Almost 900 regional businesses responded to our May 2011 poll—nearly 10 percent were from the Bronx. The next survey will be in January.\n\nThis December we will also host a workshop for the New York City metro area's small businesses—to provide them with information about credit enhancements and access to loans from the Small Business Administration.\n\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as New York have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some key initiatives specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. We have worked hard to help neighborhoods, including some in the Bronx, that face high foreclosure rates. For the past three years we have provided housing advocates with the latest information on mortgage conditions, via roundtables, presentations and newsletters. Later today, I'll tour some hard-hit areas with Matthew Wambua, commissioner of New York City Housing Preservation and Development.\n\nThis year, we'll hold our second Financial Awareness Video Competition in New York City. We invite college students to produce videos that encourage young adults to make sound financial decisions. Five Bronx colleges will participate this year.\n\nTo share what we learn about our diverse District, we have a rich website. I invite you to visit newyorkfed.org to explore our highly localized, current maps and information on small business, credit and housing conditions.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington, D.C., and at other agencies to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing. Yet, much remains to be done and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues busy.\n\nNational Economic Conditions Now, let me update you on national economic conditions.\n\nPut simply, growth in 2011 has been disappointing. We entered the year with some momentum, spurred by fiscal and monetary policy stimulus. GDP—the output of the U.S. economy—grew at a 3 percent annual rate from mid-2009 through 2010. While hardly a blistering pace, this growth was sufficient to add nearly 1 million jobs and reduce the unemployment rate by a half percentage point during 2010. Then, during the first half of 2011, growth slowed abruptly to a 0.8 percent annual rate. Job growth slowed so much that the unemployment rate rose back up to 9.1 percent.\n\nGrowth slowed partly because of temporary factors. As these factors have subsided, growth has picked up. At the moment, the consensus expectation for growth of real GDP in the third quarter—the first estimate of which we'll see on Thursday morning—is for an annual rate of 2.4 percent. But this is still quite disappointing relative to what we'd like to see or what we normally might expect at this stage in the economic recovery process.\n\nLooking forward, I regard continued modest growth as the most likely outcome. This sluggishness convinces me that other, more persistent factors must also be holding back economic growth. And, given the depressed level of household and business confidence and the fragility evident in financial markets, I would also conclude that there remain significant downside risks.\n\nIt is worth taking a moment to elaborate on these points. First, what are the temporary factors that slowed growth in early 2011? Of the items noted in the published notes from our FOMC meetings, two bear special mention:\n\nThese temporary factors are now waning. Energy prices are no longer rising rapidly. Manufacturing growth has rebounded. Sales of cars and light trucks have begun to recover. In addition, business investment in new equipment and software is expanding, business investment in nonresidential buildings is recovering, and export growth remains healthy.\n\nNonetheless, the economy clearly entered the second half of 2011 with only modest forward momentum. What are the factors that are preventing a more vigorous recovery? I'll call attention to four:\n\nThus, our economy continues to face some serious headwinds.\n\nWithout robust growth, the economy is more vulnerable to negative shocks, which unfortunately seem to keep coming. It is like riding a bicycle—at a slow speed, the bicycle wobbles and the risk of falling rises. Politics here and abroad have not helped. The intense debate around raising the debt ceiling and the subsequent downgrading of the federal debt took a toll on household and business confidence. More recently, the difficulties in Europe, along with lower U.S. growth prospects made investors less inclined to take risks. So, we saw a major stock market sell-off and widening credit spreads. All these events increase the downside risks to the growth outlook.\n\nLet me turn now to the inflation outlook. As you may know, the FOMC has two charges: we are asked to promote stable prices as well as sustainable growth. This has been a tough year for both parts of our mandate. We've already discussed how unemployment is too high and the challenges in reducing it. At the same time, inflation has risen more than expected. Nevertheless, because monetary policy works with a lag, we have to make policy based not on where inflation is today, but where it is headed in the future. I believe that underlying fundamentals will help to subdue inflation over the next few quarters.\n\nAs of August, the 12-month change for a broad measure of consumer prices was 2.9 percent, almost double the 12-month change the year before. However, the bulk of that increase was due directly to the run-up of energy and other commodity prices that are very volatile, which means they bounce around a lot.\n\nMeasures of the underlying rate of inflation have moved up too, but by less and to levels broadly consistent with price stability. It is important to remember that a year ago many experts were worried that deflation—meaning a persistent, widespread decline in prices—might take hold. Deflation tends to inhibit growth because families and companies have a harder time paying down debt and tend to defer investments and purchases when prices and wages are falling. Avoiding outright deflation is a very good thing.\n\nSome non-commodity prices have increased a bit more than expected over the past months, but I expect those to subside, as well. Rising rents for housing are likely be constrained by the large supply of vacant homes. Likewise, the surge in prices of apparel and new vehicles should soon be over.\n\nThus, barring more energy price jumps, which futures markets do not anticipate, I expect the inflation rate to fall late this year and next. All the fundamentals point in that direction. Many people are out of work, so wage pressures are unlikely to rise. Corporate profit margins are quite high, likely prompting greater price competition going forward. Moreover, households' inflation expectations remain well anchored. This last point is of critical importance. It is much harder to keep inflation in check if people begin to expect higher inflation. By the same token, low and stable inflation expectations help us to deliver low and stable inflation.\n\nIn light of the current weak outlook, the FOMC issued a statement after our last meeting saying that we expect to keep short-term interest rates exceptionally low at least through mid-2013. The committee also said it would change the composition of the assets the Fed holds on its balance sheet for monetary policy purposes. We are selling some of the short-term government debt that we hold and buying longer-term debt. This exchange should provide some additional support for growth. In addition, we discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery even as we keep inflation pressures in check.\n\nJust like interest rate cuts in normal times, our monetary policy provides support through lower interest rates that encourage private-sector business investment and household spending. This policy tool should not be confused with fiscal stimulus or government spending.\n\nI believe that the actions we have taken recently will be helpful in supporting growth and jobs. However, I do not think that monetary policy is all-powerful. To get the strongest possible recovery we need reinforcing action in areas such as housing and fiscal policy.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions Now, how has the region fared during the downturn and how is the recovery proceeding? As I mentioned, the New York Fed produces indexes to help monitor the regional economic conditions. 1 Based on these measures, the downturn in the economy in New York City ended in November of 2009. Since then, New York City's economy has been on the mend, and our numbers for September show that the recovery continues at a healthy clip.\n\nThe local economy has not fared as poorly as the national economy during this recession and recovery. Citywide employment fell by nearly 4 percent during the downturn, much less than the nationwide job loss of 6.5 percent. During the recovery, New York City has already regained half of the net jobs lost during the recession. This has happened without much help from the securities industry (Wall Street), which has been a driving force behind local economic recoveries in the past. This time, the strongest contributors to job growth have been professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and—importantly for the Bronx—education and health services.\n\nWhile the Bronx is closely linked to the rest of the City, the borough has a rich history and vibrant economy of its own. The Bronx economy has evolved substantially over the past century and a half. Through much of the 1800s, Mott Iron Works produced cast stoves, pipes and many other iron products in the neighborhood we now call Mott Haven. In the early 20th century, the Bronx was a major hub of piano manufacturing. Between 1900 and 1930, as the economy here boomed, the population increased more than six-fold.\n\nOf course, from the 1950s to the late 1970s, the Bronx had its troubles. Construction of the Cross Bronx Expressway took a toll on many neighborhoods. Yet the borough persevered, and rebounded somewhat in the 1980s.\n\nToday, I note that some manufacturing remains, particularly in food, apparel and textiles. In addition, Hunts Point is reported to be the world's largest food distribution center. However, the largest sectors—health and education services—together account for nearly half of all private-sector jobs in the borough. The Bronx is home to many fine institutions of higher education, including Fordham University, Lehman College and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. In addition, the Bronx High School of Science and the High School of American Studies are among the city's finest high schools. As for health services, the Bronx has a large number of medical care facilities. Montefiore Medical Center is now the borough's largest employer.\n\nI am pleased to report that the Bronx, unlike the nation and the city as a whole, sustained almost no net job loss during the recession. While national employment remains well below its pre-recession peak, the Bronx has added 10,000 jobs since the start of the recession. Some of this resilience is due to the concentration in health and education—the only sectors that added jobs across the nation during the recession. Another factor is that the Bronx is largely a borough of renters, making it less vulnerable to the fallout from the housing crisis.\n\nThis is not to say that all is well here. Some 12 percent of the Bronx workforce—a painfully high share—is jobless and less than a fifth of its adult population holds a college degree. The seeming disconnect between the pace of job creation here and high unemployment reflects commuting patterns. Many Bronx residents work in Manhattan and other places where job trends have been less favorable. In addition, not all jobs in the Bronx are filled by borough residents.\n\nHigh unemployment and low average levels of education help explain why the per capita income here is more than a third below the national average. A quarter of the population here lives below the poverty line, more than double the nationwide rate. Reducing poverty and raising the graduation rate are clearly major challenges for policymakers here. 2 Thus, there is much room for improvement even though the Bronx, like New York City, seems headed in a promising direction.\n\nHow are families here doing in restoring their finances? During the recession, all across the nation, the number of debt delinquencies soared and many families found that they needed to reduce their debt to more sustainable levels.\n\nLet me tell you what we see in the Bronx, using the special consumer credit panel I mentioned earlier. 3 Although families here stopped adding on debt at the end of 2007, they have not yet succeeded in reducing what they owe. As of June, the average debt owed by Bronx residents with a credit report was about $27,000—about the same as three years before. This amount of debt is smaller than the New York State and national averages of about $50,000, partly because the Bronx's many renters have no mortgages. However, it worries me that in contrast to falling debt levels elsewhere, Bronx residents have not reduced their indebtedness during the last two years.\n\nAnother troubling sign is how many people here are behind on their loan payments. About 17 percent of household debt in the Bronx is seriously delinquent. That is very high: roughly double the rate in New York State and the nation, and almost three times the rate in 2006. Plus, the number of delinquencies is still climbing here, even though they are falling in the rest of the state and the nation. All of this tells me that Bronx households have a considerable way to go before they reach more comfortable debt levels.\n\nConclusion To sum up, over the first half of 2011, the slowing of economic growth in the nation and the weak labor market has been a major disappointment. Growth has picked up modestly in the second half of 2011, but not enough to bring unemployment down. While there are some bright spots in the U.S. economy and the financial system, strong headwinds are preventing a more vigorous recovery. Inflation, which has risen in recent months, is poised to slow soon. The Fed is doing—and will continue to do—everything within its power to promote jobs and price stability.\n\nHigh poverty, unemployment and delinquency rates suggest that the Bronx faces a number of challenges. However, the continued job growth in the Bronx and rest of the city should create more opportunities for Bronx residents to improve their incomes and personal finances.\n\nGoing forward, the key challenge for the Bronx will be to prepare its residents for the best jobs being created here, in the city and in the accessible areas north of the city. The Bronx must strive to build the human capital—that is, education and skills—of its workforce. A region's human capital determines a large part of its economic success. The Bronx needs to ensure that it can attract and train workers for the broad range of tasks that an advanced economy demands. In addition, expanding education and skills goes a long way to broaden participation in the economy to all residents.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n_______________________________________ 1 Regional Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators » 2 See, for additional discussion of this topic, William Dudley. 2011. \"Job Creation in the Region.\" Remarks at the Quarterly Regional Economic Press Briefing, New York City.

    "text": "Good morning.  It is a pleasure to be here with you in  Syracuse, and I want to thank Onondaga Community College for hosting us.  This is my fourth visit to Central New York  as president of the New York Fed, and I always look forward to coming back as  part of our regular visits to different parts of our district.  These trips and our meetings with  stakeholders in the region give me and my colleagues important insight into  what’s happening in the economy.\n\nToday, I will  briefly discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy and what we are seeing at the  regional level, and offer some reflections on the challenges and importance of  workforce development in the region and across the nation.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own  views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or  the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nTwo years ago, I  spoke in nearby Rochester on the topic of workforce development. 2 Since then, the need for effective workforce  development has become no less pressing, and both the New York Fed and the  Federal Reserve System have focused greater efforts on this critical  issue.  This morning, I will return to  some of the themes from that speech and look at lessons we have learned.\n\nThe  U.S. Economic Outlook\n\nAlthough the damage  wrought by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria has imposed immeasurable hardship  on many and will undoubtedly disrupt commerce for a time, these effects are  likely to be relatively short-lived in the context of the overall economic  outlook.  Natural disasters tend to  depress economic activity initially, but once the recovery and reconstruction  efforts get underway in earnest, such disasters actually serve to lift economic  activity.\n\nLooking beyond the  storm effects—which will make interpreting near-term economic data  releases more difficult—the U.S. economy remains on a trajectory of slightly  above-trend growth, which is gradually tightening the U.S. labor market.  Over time, this should support a rise in wage  growth.  The  fundamentals supporting continued expansion are generally quite favorable.  Low unemployment, sturdy job gains, and  rising wages—even at a pace below previous expansions—are lifting personal  income.  Household wealth has been  boosted by rising home and equity prices, and household debt has been growing  relatively slowly, contributing to a healthy household balance sheet.  Thus, consumer spending should continue to  advance in coming quarters.\n\nBusiness fixed investment outlays are also likely to  continue to rise.  With the supply of  labor tightening, there are greater incentives for businesses to invest in  labor-saving technologies.  Investment  spending should also benefit from a better international outlook and  improvement in U.S. trade competitiveness caused by the dollar’s recent  weakness.  The softer dollar and solid  growth abroad also suggest that the trade sector will no longer be a  significant drag on economic growth.\n\nWith a firmer  import price trend and the fading of effects from a number of temporary,  idiosyncratic factors, I expect inflation will rise and stabilize around the  FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  In response, the Federal Reserve will likely  continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually.\n\nThe  Regional Economy\n\nWhile the national  economy has been growing steadily since the end of the Great Recession, the  economies of Upstate New York have lagged behind, with job growth running at  only about half the national pace through much of the expansion.  And, over the past year, job growth in  Upstate New York has slowed considerably, particularly in Rochester and  Buffalo.\n\nHere in Syracuse,  job growth has also been disappointing through most of the expansion, with an  even slower pace of growth than many other upstate areas.  In fact, today, almost 10 years after the  Great Recession, Syracuse has still not fully recovered all of the jobs that  were lost—a benchmark most of Upstate New York passed some time ago.\n\nHowever, this slow  growth does not imply that the region is standing still.  Indeed, there is a lot of activity going on  beneath the surface.  The Syracuse  economy and labor force are evolving and becoming better positioned for the  future.  But, more needs to be done to  help workers adapt to change, a theme I will return to in a moment.\n\nAs is the case in  much of the country, Syracuse has experienced a dramatic decrease in  manufacturing jobs, reflecting the dual forces of technological change and  globalization.  These were well-paying  jobs that supported a vibrant middle class.   Now, I am a firm believer in the overall positive effect that open trade  has had on the United States, but I also recognize that its benefits and costs  are distributed unevenly, and the positive and negative consequences can be  geographically concentrated. 3 On the whole, we have not done enough to  recognize the vast consequences of these changes and to help those hurt by  technological change and globalization.\n\nThe Syracuse  economy has changed considerably from 25 years ago, when manufacturing was the  dominant source of jobs and income.  The  number of manufacturing workers has been cut in half since then, reducing the  sector’s share of employment from 15 percent to 8 percent—a share that is now  on par with the nation.  This transition  has been painful, but has resulted in a more diversified and stable regional  economy.\n\nIn manufacturing’s  place, the healthcare and education sectors have picked up the slack, and have  been a stabilizing force for the Syracuse economy.  Offsetting the 20,000 manufacturing jobs that  were lost over the past 25 years are around 25,000 jobs added in education and  healthcare.  Those two sectors now employ  almost 20 percent of the workers in the region.   Other sectors, like business services and leisure and hospitality, have  also been creating new job opportunities that differ from the ones the region  previously relied on.\n\nIn addition, jobs  are being created in innovative hot spots in the region.  For example, start-up companies rising from  the Syracuse Tech Garden, as well as a new global center for unmanned aerial  systems, are providing exciting new opportunities.  While these particular efforts are still  relatively small in scale, they have the potential to change the trajectory of  the regional economy over time.  However,  Syracuse will need workers with deep skill sets to fill such jobs.\n\nTo that end, it can  be difficult for workers to adapt to these changes, and they may need help to  get there.  Taking a broader view, the  good jobs being created in today’s economy require more education, training, and,  ultimately, skill than ever before.  The  skill requirements for virtually all jobs are increasing, and workers will need  to rise to the occasion to thrive in today’s economy.\n\nThe challenge  facing all of us is how to best help workers develop the skills necessary to land  a good job, and how to enhance those skills over time as work requirements  evolve.  Workers with years of experience  in jobs that are no longer in demand have it especially hard, as their skills  may not be sufficient or match current opportunities—an all-too-familiar story  for workers in the Syracuse area.\n\nWorkforce  Development\n\nWorkforce  development must, therefore, be a top priority for everyone involved: workers,  employers, communities, government, and educational and training  institutions.  There is no silver bullet  or one-size-fits-all solution.  This is a  complex challenge that requires a combination of strategies.  But one thing is clear: it requires a  holistic approach encompassing the “three P’s” I described two years  ago—Partnerships, Programs, and Placement—and then some.  Before delving deeper into these, let me  first explain why we, as the nation’s central bank, care about workforce  development.\n\nAs many of you  know, the Federal Reserve is tasked by Congress with a dual mandate: maximum  employment in the context of price stability.   Clearly, we cannot declare success if we have people who want to work  but lack the skills to fill available jobs.   A skilled workforce that is matched to the needs of employers is  necessary for the economy to grow and prosper, and for individuals to reach  their potential.  Monetary policy can  help labor markets recover by providing incentives for firms to invest and  grow.  However, monetary policy cannot by  itself solve skill mismatches and gaps that exist in the economy.\n\nSo, what can we  do?  The Federal Reserve provides  research and analysis, and leverages its convening ability to bring together  diverse stakeholders to better understand the issues and identify practices  that work.  For example, we run the  Leading the Way video campaign with P-TECH schools and employer  partnerships. 4 This competition  challenges teams of high school students in the Rochester area to create public  service announcements detailing skills required to work in industries that are  currently hiring.  We also participate in  the New York City Data Science Task Force to increase the number and diversity  of students in the metropolitan area prepared to enter graduate school or the  workforce with data science skills.  And,  we are finalizing the results of a survey of community colleges across New York  State that looks at their engagement with employers for the purposes of  workforce development.  I will talk a bit  more about the survey’s preliminary results shortly.\n\nIn addition, we are  working with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and our fellow regional  Reserve Banks on broader initiatives to promote investment in workforce  development and encourage partnerships, including next month’s Investing in  America’s Workforce Conference in Austin, Texas.  The conference is a joint effort by the  Federal Reserve System and several leading institutions in the field 5 intended to connect businesses, government agencies, non-profits, academics,  and philanthropic organizations. The goal is to reframe workforce development  as an investment, attract new resources, and leverage existing ones to improve  economic mobility and job opportunities for potential workers.\n\nThe  Three P’s of Workforce Development\n\nThe core of any  workforce development effort is the need to help workers build the skills  necessary to adapt to change, meet the challenges of an evolving economy, and  find good-paying jobs.  We have been  hearing from business owners across our district, on our advisory councils, and  through surveys for several years about the skills gaps they face, in areas as  diverse as engineering, long-haul trucking, welding, and metalworking.  What they all have in common is that they  require specific skills and training, whether through a certification program,  a two- or four-year degree, or a formal apprenticeship—an approach that has  been very successful in countries such as Germany and the UK, but has not been  as widely used here.\n\nThis is where the  partnership concept comes into play.   Partnerships entail cooperative efforts between local employers and  educational institutions to determine the best strategies to help workers  develop the skills employers need.  The  good news is that New York State seems to be ahead of the curve in this area.\n\nAs I mentioned, we  are in the process of completing a survey of community colleges in New York  State.  The early results are  encouraging: we have found that all community colleges in the state offer some  workforce development programming, and partnerships with employers are the  norm.  In fact, the median number of  employer-partners among community colleges is over 100, and there are  partnerships in every industry, from healthcare to utilities to  agriculture.  Such partnerships are  growing in importance and fill a need for both local workers and  employers.  This goes to my second P:  Programs.  Community colleges in New York  are becoming very adept at creating programs tailored to the current skills  required by local employers.\n\nLocally, I’d like  to highlight Onondaga Community College’s partnership with Madison County  manufacturers, which trains workers through the Apprentice Career Training  program.  This program provides paid  training for students that can lead to four-year apprenticeships in participating  businesses in advanced manufacturing, where they will develop skills necessary  for jobs that are in high demand, including maintenance mechanics, tool makers,  and machine operators.\n\nI would also like  to call attention to Work Train’s job training and industry collaboration, 6 as  well as the work of the Onondaga Citizens League to quantify the types of jobs  that are in Central New York, what job opportunities will likely exist in the  future, and other critical workforce-related questions.  I anticipate that the Citizens League’s  report on how Central New York works will serve as an important resource for  shaping workforce development programs in the area. 7\n\nHowever, while  training and skill-building are foundational, they are not enough.  Placement into good jobs—my third P—is a  critical component of effective workforce development, especially for those  currently unemployed.  Recent work by  Federal Reserve economists highlights some of the hurdles to job placement that  will need to be overcome.  This research  leveraged the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations to examine how  people find work. 8 The difference between those looking for work  while employed versus those who are unemployed is stark.  Relative to the unemployed, employed workers  spend less time searching for jobs but have three times higher contact rates  and two times as many job offers.   Furthermore, workers hired from another job do better than those who are  unemployed, receiving 28 percent higher wages and twice the level of benefits.  While we have always known how difficult it  is for recent high school or college graduates to find their first job, it  seems that those currently unemployed face an even greater hurdle, and this is  an issue that we need to address.\n\nAnother finding  from this work is the importance of networking and references for those seeking  employment.  Referrals accounted for 40  percent of total job offers, and while 60 percent of all job applications were  the result of job board searches, these accounted for only 24 percent of  offers.  This all suggests that workforce  development providers need to build relationships and trust with employers as a  way to help their job-seekers find available opportunities and successfully  apply for them.\n\nHaving covered the  three P’s, I’d like to now focus briefly on the “and then some,” which refers  to addressing a number of social and structural factors that work against even  the best workforce development efforts.\n\nIn my travels  throughout the region and my interactions with workers, business leaders,  workforce development practitioners, and others, I regularly hear how access to  transportation and childcare are preventing able and willing workers from  actually working.  People’s inability to  get to jobs relatively far from where they live—either because they can’t  afford a car or there is no viable and reliable public transportation. This is  a challenge we are seeing both in sparsely populated areas, like the North  Country, and in cities, where jobs may be available in the surrounding suburbs  and exurbs with no easy public access.   With regard to childcare, cost and access are what we hear most as  hindering people’s ability to fill jobs.   And, even for those who can afford childcare, irregular scheduling by  employers makes it very difficult to plan effectively.  Additional adverse factors include a decline  in geographic mobility—that is, people’s ability or willingness to relocate to  where the jobs are—and the opioid epidemic, which Chair Yellen recently spoke  about as having a significant negative impact on our workforce. 9\n\nWhile I am not an  expert on these subjects, I can say that the inefficiencies these impediments  create are keeping us from realizing our full potential individually and as a  country, and that addressing them as part of a comprehensive workforce  development solution is essential.\n\nI would like to  conclude by saying that Syracuse, as well as Upstate New York more generally,  has been dealing head-on with the consequences of economic change for a long  time.  Perhaps because of this, the  region has developed a deep understanding of the importance of helping its  people adapt through workforce development programs.  The issue of workforce development is a  complex one that requires a holistic approach and close collaboration among all  interested parties.  The good news is  that many great organizations in the area are trying different approaches to  discover what works best.  Our region is  in many ways leading the way, and we at the New York Fed will continue to  support these efforts.\n\nThank you for your  kind attention. I would now be happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to participate in the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s 21st Annual Financial Markets Conference.  This year’s topic, focusing on the connection between liquidity and financial stability, is an excellent one.  As the first speaker, I thought it would be useful to lay out what I see as some of the key issues.  I may raise more questions than provide answers, but, hopefully, my remarks will help to stimulate our discussion and debate over the next two days.\n\nAs I see it, in the context of our financial system there are two distinct types of liquidity.  The first is what is typically referred to as market liquidity.  I would define market liquidity as the cost—both in expense and time—of buying or selling an asset for cash.  Market liquidity reflects a number of factors, including any direct transaction expense, such as brokerage costs; the price the transaction is executed at relative to the midpoint of the bid-ask spread; how much, if at all, the transaction moves the market price; and the immediacy or speediness with which the transaction can be completed.\n\nWith respect to market liquidity, there are a number of important open questions.  Has market liquidity declined for some asset classes?  If so, what are the causes?  In particular, has the increase in the regulatory requirements imposed on systemically-important securities dealers adversely impacted market liquidity?  If this is the case, are there adjustments that could be made that might improve market liquidity without impairing financial stability?\n\nThe second important type of liquidity is funding liquidity.  By funding liquidity, I mean the ability of a financial entity to raise cash by borrowing on either an unsecured or a secured basis.  Although market and funding liquidity are often treated as distinct, they can be closely related.  This is especially the case during a financial crisis.  If funding liquidity declines because of market stress, for example, this may cause intermediaries to become less willing to provide market liquidity.  Declines in market liquidity, in turn, may further impair funding liquidity, creating a negative feedback dynamic.\n\nCapital and liquidity requirements play a role in preventing such a self-reinforcing negative dynamic.  The central bank may also have an important role to play as the lender-of-last-resort.  When and how the central bank intervenes―and what the appropriate preconditions should be to maintain market discipline and mitigate moral hazard―are important open questions.\n\nAs always what I have to say today represents my own views and not necessarily the views of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nTurning first to the issue of market liquidity, the evidence that market liquidity has diminished is mixed.  Some market liquidity metrics have not changed much in recent years.  For the U.S. Treasury market, quoted bid-ask spreads in the inter-dealer market have remained stable since 2010 at their pre-crisis levels ( Exhibit 1 ).  And, order book depth, while lower now than in 2012 and 2013, does not appear low by historical standards ( Exhibit 2 ). 2 For the corporate bond market, some evidence even suggests improving market liquidity.  For example, excluding the financial crisis period, the realized bid-ask spread calculated from TRACE data has been trending down since the early 2000s ( Exhibit 3 ). 3\n\nBut these metrics don’t tell the whole story.  In particular, we have significant data gaps that make it difficult to comprehensively measure market liquidity.  For example, in the U.S. Treasury market we have poor visibility into dealer-to-customer transactions.  In this market segment, business is conducted bilaterally on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis—typically by phone or through electronic trading platforms like Tradeweb and Bloomberg that are based on the traditional request-for-quote model.  The U.S. Treasury has issued a detailed request for information seeking public comment on the many factors that are affecting the structure and liquidity of the U.S. Treasury market, and is seeking comments on the relevant data gaps. 4 This is an important step that will help clarify what further work is needed in this area.\n\nEven in the corporate bond market where we have detailed TRACE transaction data, this still tells an incomplete story.  TRACE data show what trades have taken place, not what trades have potentially been foregone because of any possible diminution of market liquidity.  Gaining a better understanding of this phenomenon is being actively researched by my staff.\n\nIn contrast to the market liquidity metrics such as bid-ask spreads, indirect evidence on market liquidity suggests that there has been a decline.  Asset managers report that large blocks of securities are now harder to buy and sell without generating significant movements in prices.  Also, average trade sizes have decreased ( Exhibit 4 ) and there is evidence of a growing bifurcation in the corporate bond market, with greater activity and liquidity in those bonds that were issued more recently, larger in size or  brought to market by larger issuers.\n\nAlso, capital and liquidity requirements for the largest securities dealers—which have been raised significantly since the financial crisis—might have adversely impacted market liquidity.  These regulatory changes likely have affected the profitability of dealer intermediation activities and consequently the provision of market liquidity.\n\nFor the Treasury market, the most important change in regulatory requirements appears to be the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR).  The SLR limits the leverage of dealer balance sheets.  In the SLR, all assets are treated the same in terms of required regulatory capital.  Consequently, the SLR is much tougher on low-risk assets as compared to the risk-based capital measures that it complements.  This makes the economics of repo-financing much less attractive. Not surprisingly, we observe significant declines in the quantity of repo financing by dealers ( Exhibit 5 ).\n\nFor the corporate bond market, the most relevant regulatory changes appear to be the increase in the Basel risk-weighted capital ratio, the Comprehensive Capital and Analysis Review (CCAR) stress tests and the Volcker Rule—which prohibits proprietary trading for a number of asset classes such as corporate bonds, albeit not U.S. Treasuries.  We do observe significant declines in recent years in securities dealers’ holdings of corporate bonds ( Exhibit 6 ).\n\nIt would be surprising if these declines in repo and corporate bond holdings did not have some consequence for market liquidity.  However, we do not observe marked declines in dealer holdings of Treasuries, even as overall dealer assets have stagnated ( Exhibit 7 ).  The stagnation in dealer assets might indicate that inventory risk has shifted from dealers to asset managers and other buy-side participants, reflecting a shift in market-making from a “principal” to an “agency” model.\n\nWhile increases in regulatory requirements have undoubtedly played a role, I think that other non-regulatory factors are also important.  Liquidity provision is affected by changes in market structure, how trades are executed, and by competition from those operating outside of the regulatory boundaries that have been established for systemically-important financial institutions.  Similarly, the demand for liquidity is also evolving with the growth of large asset managers, mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) and principal trading firms (PTFs)—which are sometimes referred to as high-frequency trading firms.  In the U.S. Treasury market, for example, high-frequency trading firms have seized a large proportion of the inter-dealer market in recent years ( Exhibit 8 ).  In the credit market, a rapidly rising share of corporate bonds outstanding is now held by mutual funds ( Exhibit 9 ).  Because mutual funds are not natural providers of intraday liquidity, 5 their rapid growth may have contributed to the decline in secondary market trading activity.  Fixed-income market liquidity may also be declining for cyclical reasons.  Dealer inventories have historically been sensitive to changes in the size of credit risk-premia and term-premia ( Exhibit 10 ).  Finally, the effects of unconventional monetary policy on rate expectations and corporate bond issuance may also be affecting market liquidity.  This is an area in need of further study.\n\nTo reiterate, the evidence that market liquidity has diminished is mixed.  But even if one agrees with the position that market liquidity has diminished, concluding that tougher regulatory requirements are the most important factor would be premature at this stage.  The available evidence and common sense suggest that the changes in the regulatory regime are likely important, but we need to do considerably more work before we reach a definitive conclusion on their relative contribution.\n\nFurthermore, even if additional evidence supported the conclusion that market liquidity has declined due to the increase in the regulatory burden on the major securities firms, this decline would still need to be weighed against the benefits of a more resilient and robust financial system.  During the last cycle, market liquidity was plentiful prior to the financial crisis.  But, as the financial system became stressed and several large systemic firms teetered on the brink of failure, market liquidity quickly dried up.  A somewhat higher cost for the provision of market liquidity during the more benign stages of a financial cycle might be worthwhile if it were accompanied by less volatility and stress when the cycle inevitably turned down.  In fact, even if market liquidity costs are now going to be higher on average, this might be a small price to pay for a much more stable financial sector.\n\nAlso, it is important to recognize that market liquidity conditions a few years from now may be very different from the situation today.  If the cost of providing liquidity services has increased, this creates strong incentives for innovators to find better ways to match buyers and sellers.\n\nIn my view, this innovative response is already underway.  For example, in both the Treasury and corporate bond markets, firms are being established to more efficiently match buyers and sellers of less liquid bonds in order to reduce search costs and the need to carry inventory.  Furthermore, execution algorithms have been developed that divide large trades into smaller sizes, thus reducing the costs of moving large blocks of securities.  Market liquidity conditions could very well improve over time as innovation occurs in response to this new regime.\n\nLet me now turn to the topic of funding liquidity.  I think this issue deserves as much attention as market liquidity.  After all, during the financial crisis the demise of several major financial institutions resulted from their inability to finance their long-dated illiquid assets.  The deterioration in funding liquidity also increased the degree of systemic stress as firms were forced to sell assets, which depressed their prices, undermining the solvency of firms throughout the financial system.\n\nAs I noted earlier, while funding liquidity can be considered as its own distinct subject, it does have a direct link back to market liquidity.  If firms that trade and invest in securities cannot obtain funding liquidity, this will likely lead to less transactions volume, thinner markets and less overall market liquidity.  It is also likely to lead to less pricing efficiency resulting in wider and more persistent disparities in the prices of similar assets.  Without access to funding, leveraged players, such as hedge funds, will find it more difficult to react to transient dislocations in market prices by engaging in arbitrage—that is, buying the cheaper and selling the more expensive asset.  Without a reliable source of short-term funding, market functioning can become impaired, which can further disrupt funding and market liquidity.\n\nThis can be seen by looking at the relationship between the volume of dealer-funded repo backed by U.S. Treasury securities versus the size of Treasury bid-ask spreads ( Exhibit 11 ). 6 During times of financial crisis—such as in 2008—sharp deleveraging of dealers’ repo books coincides with an increase in Treasury bid-ask spreads.  However, during non-crisis periods, this correlation is quite low.  This relationship between funding and market liquidity is also evident when we examine the relationship between the dispersion of Treasury yields relative to a fitted Treasury yield curve and Treasury bid-ask spreads ( Exhibit 12 ).   Large dispersions of Treasury yields from what is implied by a fitted yield curve may indicate funding liquidity strains, as market participants find it more difficult to arbitrage relative price distortions. 7 Again, we see a strong correlation between the sizes of the yield curve errors and of bid-ask spreads during a financial crisis, but not during non-crisis periods.\n\nThe drop in the availability of dealer-funded repo financing also appears to have led to less efficient arbitrage between closely related asset pairs, such as on-the-run and off-the run Treasuries, corporate bonds and credit default swaps, and Treasuries versus interest rate swaps.  The price differences or yield spreads between the more capital intensive and less capital intensive assets have widened.\n\nFor example, we can see this in the difference between the fixed-rate paid on a 10-year interest rate swap and the secondary market yield on a 10-year Treasury note ( Exhibit 13 ). Whereas historically this spread has been positive—reflecting the fact that an interest rate swap has more credit risk than a Treasury security—the spread has been negative since September 2015.  Market participants suggest that this shift has occurred because the higher capital requirements have made it unattractive for dealers to arbitrage away this dislocation.  Similarly, dealers apparently are unwilling to provide the funding and the balance sheet capacity necessary for their leveraged clients to arbitrage away this dislocation.  The degree to which this shift in the yield spread between Treasury and interest rate swap yields is due to the differential capital requirements imposed on cash versus derivative instruments warrants more investigation.\n\nJust as market and funding liquidity are interlinked, so are funding liquidity and capital requirements.  All else equal, stronger capital requirements reduce firms’ vulnerability to runs.  This suggests that funding liquidity risk can be addressed in many different ways.  First, capital requirements can be bolstered to reduce the risk that a firm will become insolvent in particularly bad states of the world.  Second, improved reporting and transparency can reduce the degree of uncertainty about whether a firm is solvent, thus reducing the risk that investors might wrongly perceive that a firm is insolvent, when, in fact, it still has adequate capital.  Third, liquidity requirements can be increased to reduce the risk that the firm will have to engage in a fire sale of assets that might deplete its capital.  Also, a liquidity buffer gives the firm’s management time to respond to bad events without having to resort immediately to selling assets.  Fourth, a lender-of-last-resort can provide a liquidity backstop that makes funding liquidity more resilient.  Consider the case when a counterparty is uncertain about how other potential lenders view a firm’s solvency.  If there is no lender-of-last-resort backstop, this may cause firms to be unwilling to lend, not because they perceive the counterparty as insolvent, but, instead, because they are worried about what others think.  That is, I may be unwilling to lend to you, not because I perceive you as insolvent, but because I am uncertain about how others view your solvency.  If I do lend and others don’t share my view, will I be able to get my money back?  With a lender-of-last-resort added to the picture, I no longer need to know what others think.  As long as the lender-of-last-resort is available, if I am correct in my assessment that the firm is solvent, then I can be assured that I will be paid back.\n\nThis issue was particularly relevant during the financial crisis when counterparties even pulled back from firms that were widely viewed as solvent.  The Federal Reserve stepped in and created funding backstops for a wide array of assets, such as commercial paper and asset-backed securities.  This bolstered the confidence of counterparties in one another and restored market and funding liquidity.  Of course, this type of lending is only feasible to an institution that is deemed to be solvent with sufficient collateral available to pledge to the lender-of-last-resort so that it can safely secure its loan.\n\nIn practice, all of these methods are in place to address funding liquidity risk.  Capital requirements have been increased; there is much better reporting about how firms will do under significant stress tests; liquidity requirements—such as the liquidity coverage ratio—provide a buffer that allows management more time to respond to problems; and, if necessary, the central bank can act as the lender-of-last-resort to support market confidence and funding liquidity.\n\nSo, should more be done to support funding liquidity?  In my view, an important issue is to identify and address gaps in the lender-of-last-resort function.  In the U.S., some significant gaps remain.  For example, the Federal Reserve has a very limited ability to provide funding to a securities firm, even on a fully collateralized basis.  The Discount Window is only available to depository institutions, and Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act severely constrains the ability of a depository institution to pass Discount Window funding along to its securities affiliate.  Although the Federal Reserve may be able lend to a securities affiliate under its emergency lending authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, this is not a standing facility—it can only be established if “unusual and exigent” circumstances exist and the program or facility must have broad-based eligibility, among other requirements. 8\n\nIn the U.S., given the restrictions on central bank lending, if a securities firm were to lose access to funding the remaining options available would be finding a means of replenishing the firm’s capital, selling assets, or selling all or part of the securities firm’s operations.  While this might be manageable in the case of a firm-specific idiosyncratic shock, it might prove more difficult if a common shock was broadly hitting the securities industry.  In this circumstance, the failure of one firm could increase the stress on other firms that were facing similar difficulties.  If all of the requirements for Section 13(3) are met, the central bank could provide liquidity support.  However, since this is not a certainty, it is worth considering possible alternatives.  Now that all major securities firms in the U.S. are part of bank holding companies and are subject to enhanced prudential standards as well as capital and liquidity stress tests, providing these firms with access to the Discount Window might be worth exploring.  To me, this is a more reasonable proposition now than it was prior to the crisis when the major dealers weren’t subject to those safeguards.\n\nMore generally, I am happy to report that the Committee on the Global Financial System—one of the Bank for International Settlements’ central bank groups—is engaged in a project to determine what lender-of-last-resort gaps currently exist, focusing, in particular, on those that may create vulnerability in terms of financial stability.  One area that I anticipate will receive considerable attention is whether there are any gaps with respect to the activities of globally systemic firms that operate on a cross-border basis.\n\nAnother issue that still needs greater attention is the appropriate role for the home- versus host-country supervisor.  The regulatory and supervisory responses for large, systemically-important firms that operate on a cross-border basis need to be closely coordinated, especially during times of stress.  In particular, expectations about who will be the lender-of-last-resort need to be well understood in both the home and host countries.\n\nWe have made considerable progress in recent years in enhancing the safety and soundness of the U.S. financial system.  But there is more that we need to do.  In particular, we need to study and understand how market liquidity and funding liquidity conditions are changing and what factors are driving that evolution.  Conferences like this one go a long way in that regard.  They serve as an important forum for discussing ideas and improving our knowledge and understanding.  This will provide a solid foundation for any policy actions.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.

    "text": "Good morning and greetings from New York City. I sincerely thank the Chamber for giving me the opportunity to address your annual meeting. Unfortunately I am unable to be in Puerto Rico in person, because I have a broken leg and am under doctor’s orders not to fly.  The good news is that I am on the mend and that I have this opportunity to speak to you via video\n\nWe at the New York Fed are pleased that Puerto Rico is part of the Second Federal Reserve District that we represent in the Federal Reserve System. We are committed to the people of the Island and to its growth and prosperity. Our commitment is reflected in our ongoing work with our many partners on the Island.  Last spring, with the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce and other local partners, we co-sponsored a forum aimed at helping small businesses in Puerto Rico learn about export opportunities.  We have been involved with education on the Island for two decades, including by helping to set up the Alianza. Today we help promote financial literacy through a video competition in partnership with the Puerto Rican Bankers Association.\n\nOur banking supervisors work to strengthen the financial system so it can readily supply credit to families and businesses, while our research economists monitor and analyze local economic conditions.  This analysis—along with similar analyses from other regions across our nation—feeds into the decisions the Federal Reserve makes on monetary policy.\n\nIn support of this work, I and other senior officials have traveled to Puerto Rico a number of times in recent years and met with a wide range of stakeholders, including university officials, students, business leaders, entrepreneurs, bankers and government officials.\n\nWhat we learn during these engagements helps to shape our understanding of the Puerto Rican economy and our efforts to support it.  I have seen numerous examples of expansion and growth.  This gives me confidence that Puerto Rico has the capability to be an economic success story.  Nevertheless, these local engagements have also confirmed to me that conditions are not what we want them to be—in particular, growth and expansion are not happening broadly enough.  The task of putting the Island on a path of robust, sustainable and inclusive growth remains a work in progress.\n\nDuring my visit here in March 2011, a number of business and community leaders expressed their concern that the economy had loss competitiveness.  These local leaders asked if we would look at what might be holding back growth on the Island. Much high quality work has already been done on this subject by local experts. However, they thought it might be helpful for the New York Fed, as an independent third party, to evaluate what might be done to promote competitiveness and productivity on the Island.\n\nI readily agreed that we would do so. I commissioned a team of economists from our Research group and other experts from our international and outreach teams, to analyze the challenges facing Puerto Rico.  I asked them to put forward some recommendations on how to capitalize on the Island’s strengths and restore growth.\n\nThe report released today on the competitiveness of Puerto Rico’s economy, is the product of their work and extensive consultation with local, national and international experts.  I have read it closely and commend it to your attention. The report is intended as nonpartisan technical analysis and should be viewed in that vein.  Even those who do not agree with every aspect of the analysis, I hope, will acknowledge that this is a serious, good-faith effort to examine, in detail, a number of important issues that deserve attention.  Of course, many of these issues can only be considered as part of the political process.  It is for the people of Puerto Rico to judge the appropriate trade-offs involved—not me, certainly, or my staff at the New York Fed.\n\nIn a few moments Jamie McAndrews, executive vice president and director of research, will summarize the report and its recommendations. Before he does so, I would like to share with you my assessment of economic conditions on the mainland and in Puerto Rico. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNational Economic Conditions The mainland U.S. economy has continued to slowly recover from the after-effects of the housing boom and bust and the financial crisis.  But the recovery has been disappointing. Despite a monetary policy that has been extraordinarily accommodative by historical standards, the economy has grown only about 2 percent over the past year. After a brighter start to the year, economic momentum has slowed in the last few months.  (This may partly be a payback for the mild winter, which brought forward some spending.)  Employment growth remains positive, but has slowed considerably of late as the economy has lost forward momentum, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. The headwinds retarding recovery are well known. Many consumers have been deleveraging in response to the large losses in wealth generated mainly by the collapse in home prices. The supply of credit—particularly mortgage credit—to many families remains constrained, limiting the degree to which many households can fully benefit from low interest rates. Although there have been some positive signs in the housing market recently, housing activity nevertheless remains at very low levels.  The sector has been restrained by several factors including the large shadow inventory making its way through the foreclosure pipeline, tight underwriting standards for new mortgage origination, and the sharp slowdown in household formation. Although the corporate sector as a whole is now relatively healthy, there still is a significant constraint on the availability of credit to small business. Business investment continues to expand, but at a restrained pace.  I presume that this partially reflects uncertainty over the economic outlook, including the risks around the evolution of U.S. fiscal policy and the crisis in Europe. Fiscal policy has already become restrictive as state and local governments have cut expenditures in response to revenue shortfalls. Moreover, we face the so-called “fiscal cliff” at the start of next year.   At the beginning of 2013, federal fiscal policy is scheduled under current law to become sharply contractionary, with abrupt increases in taxes and cuts in spending.   Businesspeople tell me that the uncertainty about how Congress and the Administration will deal with the fiscal cliff—and our fiscal challenges more broadly—is already inhibiting hiring and investment. The fiscal cliff represents a threat to the recovery that is wholly avoidable.  But we will only avoid it if our politicians act responsibly. We need a credible strategy for bringing down the federal budget deficit over time in a manner supportive of ongoing economic recovery.   Any plan should start slowly, but build steadily over time.  It should be bipartisan in nature so that the plan is viewed as sustainable across the political cycle. Meanwhile the crisis in the eurozone has resulted in a sharp slow-down in economic growth in Europe and tighter financial conditions globally.  It has hurt U.S. consumer and business confidence and is already a material drag on U.S. growth.  Economic momentum in many other regions of the world has also slowed somewhat and this is also restraining the demand for U.S. exports. Assuming that Congress avoids the fiscal cliff and European leaders successfully manage through their challenges, there are solid grounds for expecting that growth will gradually strengthen in coming years.  U.S. banks are healthier and credit conditions, while still tight, are gradually easing, the housing sector is showing early signs of recovery, and households appear quite far along in the deleveraging process. On the inflation side, we have succeeded in delivering inflation very close to our 2 percent price stability objective. Over the past year or so, price trends have been a bit stickier than one might have anticipated given the large amount of slack in the economy. To some degree, this likely reflects earlier upward pressures on commodity prices, the anchoring exerted by stable inflation expectations, and the stickiness of nominal wages.  With gasoline prices now falling sharply and upward pressures from apparel prices now appearing likely to dissipate, I expect that inflation will decline a bit in coming months, falling somewhat further below our 2 percent objective. More generally, there are several reasons to think that inflation will remain moderate. First, the economy continues to operate with significant slack. Second, measures of underlying inflation show little upward pressure, and the growth rate of nominal labor compensation is low and stable.  Moreover, inflation expectations remain well-anchored. Taking into account all these factors along with our current stance of monetary policy, I anticipate that inflation will be slightly below our 2 percent long-run objective over the next few years. One of the challenges I face as a policymaker is how much to adjust my medium term economic forecast in response to near-term developments, particularly when there is elevated uncertainty.  Although I have made some adjustments of late, they have been relatively modest to date. That is because there are important issues—such as the outlook in Europe and the degree to which we have lost underlying momentum at home—where more information is needed before making an informed judgment. Although some of the current uncertainties will take time to resolve, I can imagine material data on a number of dimensions could become available in the coming weeks and months that could lead me to adjust my forecast further. I will be paying particularly close attention to whether domestic momentum and hiring picks up now that the pay-back for the mild winter is over, and whether financial conditions, which are heavily influenced at present by developments in Europe, ease or tighten further. I am the vice-chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed committee that sets monetary policy to promote its statutory goals of full employment and price stability. Last week, the committee reaffirmed that it currently anticipates that the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate target will remain exceptionally low—which I understand to mean at its current level—at least through late 2014. The FOMC also voted to provide additional support for economic activity by extending its maturity extension program—popularly referred to as Operation Twist—through the end of the year.  This extension means that we will be buying an additional $267 billion of longer term Treasury securities, paid for by selling or redeeming the same amount of shorter term Treasuries. This action reduces the supply of longer dated Treasury securities on the market and lowers longer term interest rates relative to where they would otherwise be in the absence of such a program. That puts downward pressure on corporate borrowing costs and mortgage rates, and supports asset prices such as housing and equities—all of which promotes growth. In addition, the FOMC adopted new language to describe its policy outlook, stating that it is “prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.”  I will let those words speak for themselves.\n\nLocal Economic Conditions Now let me turn to economic conditions in Puerto Rico.  Puerto Rico’s real, or inflation-adjusted Gross National Product has declined for the past four years and this has been accompanied by a sharp decline in the real income of Island residents. According to a monthly index of economic activity produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico, economic activity began to decline as far back as 2005.  Although the index has been stable for the past several months and this may be a signal that the economic downturn on the Island may have ended, a solid recovery has yet to take hold and conditions remain challenging.\n\nThe job market remains a trouble spot for the Island’s economy.  Total employment fell by about 13 percent or roughly 140,000 jobs, between its peak back in 2005 and mid-2010. This is nearly double the 7 percent job loss on the mainland.  For the past two years, employment has appeared to have bottomed out, but there has been little evidence of recovery.\n\nThe Island’s unemployment rate has fallen by more than a percentage point over the past year, but this is not necessarily good news.  The fall was largely the result of a fall in labor force participation. At 14.8 percent the unemployment rate remains unacceptably high.\n\nHigh unemployment and low labor force participation remain perhaps the biggest challenges to the Puerto Rico economy.  Even in relatively prosperous times, the unemployment rate on the Island has been more than double the rate on the mainland.  High unemployment and low labor force participation are especially serious problems for young workers and are perhaps the clearest evidence that Puerto Rico needs to make better economic progress.\n\nMany of the current problems facing Puerto Rico relate not just to cyclical weakness but to deeper structural challenges. This brings us to the subject of the report we issued today. I do not presume that this report is the last word on these important questions. We do not presume to claim that we have all the answers.  Rather, I hope that it is the start of a constructive and bipartisan debate that will advance good public policy and a better future for the people of Puerto Rico. I also hope that it will be read and considered beyond the business and government community, across the society at large.  The goal we seek is not simply business success and expansion, but broad-based prosperity with rising standards of living and greater opportunities for all Puerto Ricans.\n\nI want to thank you again for the opportunity to address the Chamber. Jamie McAndrews, executive vice president and director of research, will now talk about the report we released and lay out its findings and recommendations. _____________________________________________________\n\n* Remarks were delivered by Krishna Guha, executive vice president, on Mr. Dudley's behalf.",

    "text": "Good morning and welcome once again to the New York Fed’s Regional Economic Press Briefing.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak with you—and, through you, to the people in our District.  I am going to discuss conditions in the national economy and then on conditions in our region, with a focus on private, for-profit institutions, which have become more visible in the U.S. higher education market.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nLet me begin by taking stock of where we are at the moment. Then I will address my expectations for the performance of the economy in 2014 and 2015.\n\nSince the end of what is now called the Great Recession in mid-2009, the U.S. economy has experienced 17 consecutive calendar quarters of positive growth of real GDP (gross domestic product). However, the compound annual rate of growth over that period has only been around 2¼ percent, close to prevailing estimates of the economy’s potential growth rate. Thus, we have made limited progress in closing the substantial output gap that was created during the recession.\n\nA similar conclusion is drawn from an assessment of labor market conditions. Although the unemployment rate has declined by about 2 ¾ percentage points since peaking at 10 percent in October of 2009, a significant portion of that decline reflects the substantial decline of the labor force participation rate over that period. It should also be noted that since the previous business cycle peak at the end of 2007, the decline of the labor force participation rate has been more than accounted for by a decline in participation of people in the prime working age of 25 to 54.\n\nThe inflation data are also consistent with this overall picture of an economy operating well below its full potential. Total inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, has been quite volatile in recent years due to sharp fluctuations in energy prices. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components and thereby may be a better guide as to underlying inflation, slowed from around 2 percent in early 2012 to just above 1 percent in mid-2013. In recent months it has shown signs of stabilizing, but remains well below the FOMC’s expressed goal of 2 percent for total inflation. Fortunately, inflation expectations remain relatively stable at levels somewhat above the current inflation rate. This stability should help prevent an undesirable further drop in inflation relative to our 2 percent objective.\n\nThat said, there are some nascent signs that the economy may be doing better.  For example, based on the first estimate, which is subject to revision, real GDP increased at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2013, above the trend of the past four years.  And the most recent payroll employment report showed a pickup in the monthly pace of job gains.  The 3-month moving average rose back above a 200,000 pace after slowing to about 150,000 as of July of this year.  I hope that this marks a turning point for the economy.\n\nBut before we rush to this conclusion, a few more cautionary comments are appropriate.   With respect to GDP growth, it turns out that inventory investment contributed ¾ of a percentage point to that overall growth rate. Thus, because this impetus from inventories will likely reverse this quarter, the real GDP growth rate is likely to slow to around a 2 percent annual rate or a bit less in the fourth quarter. With respect to payroll employment, we have seen such bursts in payroll growth before over the past few years and have been disappointed when the pickups proved temporary and did not lead to a rise in the overall growth rate.\n\nBut, I have to admit that I am getting more hopeful.  Not only do we have some better data in hand, but also the fiscal drag, which has been holding the economy back, is likely to abate considerably over the next few years at the same time that the fundamental underpinnings of the economy are improving.\n\nThe first thing to note is that federal fiscal policy in 2013 has been unusually contractionary.  At the beginning of the year the payroll tax cut expired while tax rates on higher income households were raised, a series of taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act took effect, and spending was reduced due to the sequester and the gradual winding down of foreign military operations.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the cyclically-adjusted or full-employment budget balance increased by roughly 1 ¾ percentage points of GDP in fiscal year 2013. Over the past 50 years there have been only two other episodes of fiscal contraction of this order of magnitude, and both of those occurred when the unemployment rate was substantially lower than it has been of late.  Under current law, the amount of federal fiscal restraint will decline in 2014 and then decline further in 2015.  At the same time, the sustained contraction in spending and employment by state and local governments appears to be over.\n\nThe fact that the U.S. economy has continued to grow at around a 2 percent pace in 2013 despite this quite intense fiscal restraint provides evidence to the second key point, which is that the private sector of the economy has largely completed its healing process and is now poised to ramp up its level of activity. Key measures of household leverage have declined and are now near the lowest levels they have been in well over a decade. Household net worth, expressed as a percent of disposable income, has increased back to its average of the previous decade, reflecting rising equity and home prices and declining debt. Recently, banks have eased credit standards somewhat after a prolonged period of tightness. As a result, we are now experiencing a fairly typical cyclical recovery of consumer spending on durable goods. For example, sales of light-weight motor vehicles have increased steadily over the past four years, reaching an annual rate of 15.7 million in the third quarter of 2013, though sales in September and October have been somewhat below that average.\n\nSimilarly, after five years in which housing production was well below what is consistent with underlying demographic trends and the replacement demand for houses, it now appears that we have worked off the excess supply of housing built up during the boom years of the last decade. Housing market activity has begun to recover, and a widely followed national home price index is up 12 percent over the 12 months ending in September. 1 Anecdotal reports suggest that this higher-than-expected increase in home prices is due to a relatively low number of homes for sale.  Due to this shortness of supply, there is reason to expect increases in starts going forward.\n\nYet another bright spot on the horizon is the fact that growth prospects among our major trading partners have improved following a few years of lackluster performance which induced a sharp slowing of growth of U.S. exports. In particular, the euro area appears to have emerged from a protracted recession and is experiencing modest but positive growth.\n\nTo summarize, while growth in 2013 has been disappointing, I believe a good case can be made that the pace of growth will pick up some in 2014 and then somewhat more in 2015. The private sector of the economy should continue to heal, while the amount of fiscal drag should subside. Despite near-term concerns, growth prospects among our major trading partners will improve further next year. This combination of events is likely to create an environment in which business investment spending will strengthen. As growth picks up, I expect to see more substantial improvement in labor market conditions and a gradual updrift in inflation back towards the FOMC’s target rate.\n\nHowever, the notion that the economy will grow more swiftly remains a forecast rather than a reality at this point. As is always the case, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding this forecast. Moreover, there is always the possibility of some unforeseen shock. Thus, we will continue to monitor U.S. and global economic conditions very carefully and will adjust our views on the likely path for growth, inflation and the unemployment rate accordingly.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nLet me turn now to the regional economy. A year has passed since Superstorm Sandy devastated the tri-state region. And even today, many of the hardest-hit places are still struggling to recover and rebuild from the storm. In fact, reminders of the storm’s damage remain visible in neighborhoods across Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island, as well as along the coasts of Long Island and New Jersey. On a more encouraging note, however, the broader regional economy has proven to be remarkably resilient. After a brief dip following the storm, the regional economy quickly rebounded and has continued to add jobs at a reasonably good pace. Moreover, the region’s housing markets have continued to show steady improvement throughout the year.\n\nTo help monitor the performance of the regional economy more generally, the New York Fed produces economic activity indexes for New York State, New York City and New Jersey. Based on these measures, New York City’s economy has continued to grow strongly throughout the year, and both New York State and New Jersey have seen some pickup in growth in recent months. As a result, a growing number of places in the region have either recovered or are close to recovering the jobs that were lost during the Great Recession.\n\nMore troubling, however, is that Puerto Rico’s economy remains exceptionally weak; activity and employment on the Island continue to decline.  Our economists will elaborate on these trends this morning.\n\nPrivate For Profit Institutions in the Higher Education Landscape\n\nThe important role of post-secondary education is undeniable given the key role that human capital plays in economic growth.   However, the higher education landscape comprises different types of post-secondary institutions that provide different educational experiences. One such group of institutions—private for-profit institutions—have progressively become more visible in the U.S. higher education market.  For-profit institutions and their growth in the market for student loans and federal need-based aid is the subject of the special topic in today’s briefing.\n\nAnalysis done here at the New York Fed reveals that enrollment in for-profit colleges showed explosive growth nationally during, and for some time after, the Great Recession. Interestingly, this growth in enrollment has leveled off perceptibly as the economic recovery has taken hold.  These patterns suggest that workers who were displaced from their jobs during the Great Recession chose to enroll in two-year and less-than-two-year colleges, mostly in for-profits but also in public community colleges. Now, with improved labor market conditions, individuals have less reason to get a short-term degree or may have returned to the labor force.\n\nStark patterns are also observed in the market for student loans.  Both the incidence of student loans and average loan size are by far greater in for-profit institutions than in comparable public colleges. Given the importance of post-secondary education in our nation’s future, and the key role that human capital plays in our nation’s growth, we at the New York Fed will continue to analyze the growth of the private for-profits in particular, and post-secondary institutions in general, in our region and the nation.\n\nI will now ask Jaison Abel to discuss economic conditions in our region.\n\n1 Based on the CoreLogic home price index including distressed sales.",

    "text": "Good morning, I am pleased to be here in Syracuse at the Center for Economic Development.  It is always a pleasure to speak with business and community leaders because of the important role you play in helping to shape the economy of the region.  I thank you all for inviting me here today. I try to get out of my office in New York City as much as I can to get a sense of regional economic conditions across the second Federal Reserve District.   I was last here in Syracuse in 2010 and, more recently, I traveled to West Point and the Capital region and Long Island. These visits are just as important as any trip I might take to Washington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy, or to Switzerland, to help shape international bank regulation.  Each visit within the region helps me to deepen the relationships with the people I represent.  I believe that the understanding of issues and concerns that I gain today will help ensure that the Fed’s policy decisions reflect the public interest. Today, I want to talk a bit about the Fed—what we do and why we do it.  Then I’ll provide some thoughts about the economic outlook nationally and locally.  After that, I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about what the Fed does and why, and about the economic outlook. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC. What the New York Fed Does By way of introduction, I will briefly review what my colleagues and I do at the New York Fed on behalf of the Second District. I have the great fortune to serve as the vice chair of the FOMC that meets eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy.  The members of this committee all strive to set policy to advance the mandate given to us by Congress to promote the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability.  Sometimes we have different views on the specific policy choice at hand, and you should view this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions—particularly during difficult economic circumstances such as we face today.  In fact, I think we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike.  But we are united in our commitment to our dual mandate and in our belief that Fed independence is essential to the public interest.  That independence allows us to make tough decisions insulated from short-term political pressures. At FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region and the nation.  For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical information that we learn from listening to our boards of directors, regional advisory councils, community leaders and other key stakeholders, such as you and others I'll meet on this visit.  For example, last month members of our small business advisory council told us that for the first time in several years, employees were leaving for other jobs and that they would need to replace those who left for better opportunities elsewhere.  The fact that some people with jobs felt confident enough to seek and take other job opportunities was another signal to us that the job market may be improving—although, to be sure, we read such signals cautiously. To help me gather more information about the region, I will be meeting this morning with PathStone, a community development and human service organization serving farmers and low-income families and communities, then meeting with students and faculty at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, and then having lunch with faculty of the Maxwell School and the university officials who manage the tech transfer process.  This afternoon, I will drive to Skaneateles Falls to tour Welch Allyn, a manufacturer of diagnostic equipment, and meet with the president and CEO, Dr. Julie Shimer.  Dr. Shimer also recently became the chair of the Empire State Development Corporation and I am looking forward to our discussion about the challenges and opportunities for economic development in Upstate New York. Tomorrow, I will address the Buffalo-Niagara Partnership at their Movers & Shakers Breakfast, speak with staff of the Empire Justice Center, meet with Lt. Governor Bob Duffy, convene a meeting of our Upstate Advisory Board, whose members are major leaders in the upstate economy, and visit the Roswell Park Cancer Institute to learn about their role in economic development in western New York and in the broader world arena. My colleagues and I at the New York Fed continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for that purpose.  For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of economic activity for New York City, the state of New York and New Jersey.  These indexes are essentially measures of local output—similar to gross domestic product, or GDP, at the national level.  The measures provide a more complete gauge of activity than the employment report, which is another important metric at the state and regional levels.  We have also constructed a consumer credit panel to track local household credit conditions at the county and even the zip code level, including the amount and type of personal debt and whether payments are being made in a timely way. In addition, we conduct a periodic poll about the credit needs of small businesses in the region, which are an important source of new jobs.  We are just launching our latest poll that also includes questions about the skill needs of small businesses and whether the right kinds of skilled labor are available.  Almost 900 businesses responded to our last poll, some of which were from this area.  If you, as a representative of a small business, would like to participate in our current poll, please pass your card to my colleagues, who are in the audience, or see me after the speech and we will be glad to add you as a respondent. Results from our prior polls stressed the problem of access to capital.  In response we held two workshops at the Bank in December.  In the first workshop, senior officers from the Export-Import Bank, the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce described the various loan programs available to small businesses from their agencies, as well as programs to help identify markets.  The second workshop reviewed the business plans of 40 small businesses and matched them with potential lenders.  We plan to hold a similar workshop in Upstate New York this year. As you know, even states that are wealthier, such as New York, have large pockets of poverty.  So, we target some of our work specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. We have worked hard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates, although much remains to be done.  We have provided housing advocates with the latest information on mortgage conditions, via mortgage briefs, roundtables, presentations and newsletters.  We have developed an interactive online tool that shows monthly delinquency and foreclosure conditions, which we believe will aid the work of housing counselors and other parties seeking to help these communities.  It is available on our website along with data and information useful to policymakers, business people and the public. We use our website to share what we learn about our diverse District, and you will find extensive detailed information about the region at the site.  I invite you to visit newyorkfed.org to explore our highly localized maps and information on small business, credit and housing conditions, and even the latest job openings at the New York Fed. Finally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington, D.C., and at other agencies to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing.   Our supervisors are working hard to ensure that our District’s banks are operating safely and soundly.  Although much has been done, we are not finished and are determined to keep at it.  I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves. All in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues busy. National Economic Conditions Now I’d like to turn to the national and regional economy.  The incoming data on the U.S. economy generally has been a bit more upbeat over the past few months, suggesting that the recovery may be finally establishing a somewhat firmer footing.  Real GDP expanded at a 3.0 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2011, the fastest growth since the first half of 2010.  The average monthly job gain was 212,000 in the first quarter of 2012, up from 164,000 in the fourth quarter.  Sales of light-weight motor vehicles were about 14 ½ million at an annual rate in the first quarter, the best quarter in four years.  Survey measures of business activity have rebounded from their dips in the middle of last year and are now at levels that typically indicate solid overall growth.  Even housing starts have firmed somewhat in the last few months, although they remain at depressed levels. While these developments are certainly encouraging, it is still too soon to conclude that we are out of the woods, as underlined by the March labor market release.  To begin with, the economic data looked brighter at this point in 2010 and again in 2011, only to fade later in those years. Moreover, the United States experienced unusually mild weather over the first quarter, with the number of heating degree days more than 20 percent below the average of the preceding five years, which may have pulled forward some economic activity and hiring. In this regard, the somewhat softer March labor market report that was released last Friday may reflect the earlier positive influence of the mild weather on job creation in January and February, although other less sanguine interpretations are also plausible.  We thus will need to see more data to determine the extent to which the March data represent a transitory weather-related setback.\n\nRegardless of the importance of the mild winter in distorting the recent economic data, real economic activity has yet to be strong enough on a sustained basis to make a big dent in the overall amount of slack in the U.S. economy.  While growth was stronger in the fourth quarter, most of it was due to inventory accumulation.  Growth of final sales remained quite weak.  Historically, quarters in which inventory investment makes significant growth contributions are typically followed by quarters in which that growth contribution is modest or even negative.  That appears to be what is shaping up for the first quarter of this year.\n\nBased on available data, our current expectations are that real GDP will expand at around a 2 ¼ percent annual rate during the first quarter of 2012.  Even with the robust increase of light vehicle sales, overall consumer spending in the first quarter appears to be rising at a similar moderate rate.  At the same time, real disposable income has been flat over the past three months, and the large increase of gasoline prices is likely further sapping consumers’ real purchasing power.  And growth of business investment spending, which softened in the fourth quarter of 2011, may have been even a little softer in the first quarter of this year.\n\nTo put the recent pace of growth into perspective, we believe that the economy’s long-run sustainable growth rate—what economists call the potential growth rate—is around a 2 ¼ percent annual rate.  We need sustained growth above that rate to absorb the still substantial amount of unused productive capacity.  Thus, our recent growth rates are barely keeping up with our potential.\n\nEven though the unemployment rate has declined sharply from 9 percent last September to 8.2 percent in March, it is still unacceptably high.  In addition, many other measures of the labor market remain weak.  The labor force participation rate, the percentage of people employed, and the total number of hours worked in the economy all dropped sharply during the recession and remain well below their pre-recession levels, even taking into account the impact of demographic shifts.  Also, it appears that productivity growth has slumped recently.  Although that means that a given amount of growth translates into bigger employment gains, it certainly is not an unmitigated positive development.\n\nAlso, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the economy still faces significant headwinds and that there are some meaningful downside risks.  In the headwinds department, I would include the run-up in gasoline prices mentioned earlier because that will sap purchasing power, the continued impediments to a strong recovery from ongoing weakness in the housing sector, and fiscal drag at the federal and state and local levels.  In terms of downside risks, these include the risk that growth abroad disappoints and the risk of further disruptions to the supply of oil and higher oil prices.\n\nOn the inflation front, the overall rate of increase of consumer prices, as measured by the 12-month change of the price index for personal consumption expenditures slowed to 2.3 percent in February from a recent peak of 2.9 percent last September.  Even though the recent rise of gasoline prices mentioned above could interrupt this pattern, we expect this moderation of overall inflation to resume later this year.\n\nWhile the underlying core inflation rate, that strips out volatile food and energy prices, has been somewhat higher than expected a few months back, it appears that the annual rate of core inflation 1 has peaked and we expect it to begin to decline later this year. 2 Finally, inflation expectations, which play an important role in the inflation process, remain well anchored.  By this I mean that people expect that the rate of inflation will continue to be relatively low for some time to come.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nSo how is the recovery proceeding in the state and region?  As I mentioned, the New York Fed produces indexes that help us track economic activity in the region.  Based on these measures, the economic recovery that began in New York State in late 2009 has continued through early 2012, and even gained some momentum.\n\nAcross Upstate New York, broadly speaking, the cycle of recession and recovery has been much less pronounced than in the nation, and even the state as a whole. This pattern has been true in Syracuse, as well. Employment fell by a little over 4 percent during the downturn—a steep drop, to be sure—but only about two-thirds of the decline that occurred nationally.  This is quite a change from the region’s past recessions, which have tended to be longer and deeper than the nation’s.\n\nOne reason why Upstate New York weathered the economic storm a bit better than the nation is the resiliency of its housing markets.  Like much of Upstate New York, Syracuse’s housing market has been relatively stable and did not experience a boom-bust cycle like much of the rest of the nation.  In fact, since the peak of the national housing market in early 2006, home prices in Syracuse have increased by close to 10 percent, compared with a decline of more than 30 percent nationally.\n\nAs a result, the drop off in economic activity that is connected, directly and indirectly, to the performance of the housing sector has not been as severe here as it was in many other places.  This stability is underscored by our latest quarterly consumer credit panel data, which shows that total household debt burdens have remained relatively low by national standards and that mortgage delinquency rates are lower in the Syracuse region than in other parts of the state and nation.\n\nHowever, while the national recovery has started to gain some momentum in recent months, job growth in Syracuse has remained somewhat weak.  To date, the region has regained only about a third of the roughly 13,000 jobs that were lost during the downturn.  So the recovery has been disappointing thus far.\n\nDespite the weak overall job growth, the region continues to undergo substantial economic restructuring.  And, in fact, many parts of the economy are growing.  Most prominently, the business services sector has added about 2,000 jobs since the recession ended, and the leisure and hospitality sector has also expanded.\n\nAs a result of the economic restructuring in Syracuse, health and education are now among the most important industries in the region, employing roughly a fifth of all workers.  While the “eds and meds ” sector experienced some job losses last year, it is generally less susceptible to downturns than other sectors of the economy, and expanded before, during and after the Great Recession. No doubt, the area’s many local colleges and universities play an important role in this regard.\n\nSyracuse’s colleges and universities deserve special attention because they are important regional assets that can help Syracuse continue to actively participate in the knowledge economy.  Our own research at the New York Fed has shown that higher- education institutions can help to build their local area’s skilled workforce, which is critical to the long-run economic success of any region.  These institutions produce highly skilled labor and help their regions innovate by creating new knowledge and inventions through academic research and development.  It can be especially beneficial for local businesses to take advantage of the research facilities available at local colleges and universities.\n\nPartnerships between private industry and higher-education institutions are an important ingredient in this regard.  Going forward, I believe these partnerships will become more important than ever—particularly for places like Syracuse that continue to experience economic restructuring.  Fortunately, this region already has a strong higher education industry in place. Conclusion To sum up, the incoming data on the U.S. economy has been a bit more upbeat of late, suggesting that the recovery may be getting better established.  But, while these developments are certainly encouraging, it is far too soon to conclude that we are out of the woods in terms of generating a strong, sustainable recovery.  On the inflation front, the year-over-year rate of consumer price inflation has slowed in recent months, and despite the recent rise of gasoline prices, we expect inflation to moderate further in 2012. Here in Syracuse, while the recovery to date has not been as strong as we would like, the region’s vibrant health and education sector provides a solid base for longer-term growth. Thank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "Good morning and welcome to the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Economic Press Briefing.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to  speak with you today about the economic outlook, with a focus on the household  sector.  As always, what I have to say  reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nAccording  to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the current expansion began in  July 2009, making it nearly seven years old.   If we gathered this expansion and the 11 prior post-WWII expansions  together for a family photograph, arranging them by age from youngest in front  to oldest in back, this expansion would be standing third from the rear.  The only two that lasted longer were the  expansion that began in February of 1961, which lasted for nearly nine years,  and the one that began in March of 1991, which lasted for ten years.  Thus, the current expansion is already an  elder statesman in the family of post-war U.S. expansions.  This raises the question of whether this  expansion has already entered its twilight years, with the risk of recession  edging higher with each passing month.\n\nAs I have said before,  expansions do not simply die of old age. 2 Rather, expansions end either because a  significant inflation risk emerges that requires a sharp tightening of monetary  policy, or the economy is adversely impacted by a large shock that cannot be  offset by monetary policy in a timely manner.   While the sample of post-war U.S. expansions is still too small for  reliable statistical analysis, the evidence suggests that after an expansion’s  first few years its likelihood of ending is mostly independent of age, and  depends mainly instead on the level of inflation.  Since the possibility is low that a  significant inflation risk would emerge over the near term, this means that the  main danger facing the current expansion is the risk of large, adverse shocks.\n\nGiven that the labor market  still appears to have some excess slack and inflation is below the Federal  Reserve’s objective, monetary policy is appropriately still quite accommodative  despite the advancing age of the expansion.   While this limits to an extent the degree to which monetary policy can  aggressively respond to any adverse events, the good news is that the economy  is more resilient to any shocks.  Key  sectors of the U.S. economy, such as the household sector, seem to be in good  shape.  The financial system is also  clearly much stronger, with the banking system much better capitalized and with  much larger liquidity buffers than in the years preceding the financial  crisis.\n\nIn today’s briefing, we will be  focusing on the household sector.  Given  the importance of consumption to U.S. economic growth, the health of the  household sector is critical for an assessment of risks to the outlook.  Over the last several years we have devoted  significant resources to better understanding the state of the household  sector, and one outcome of this attention is our now well-known Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit .  This report, and the data  that underlie it, give us direct insight into the health of the household  balance sheet.  The assets and  liabilities that families hold is a crucial determinant of the household  sector’s ability to help immunize the economy from shocks.  We learned during the Great Recession the  importance of household liabilities—in particular, mortgages, which make up  more than two-thirds of the sector’s total liabilities.\n\nAs you know, the early part of  the 2000s witnessed a very substantial expansion in borrowing by  households.  This borrowing took many  forms, but was particularly notable in mortgages and home equity lines of  credit, and reflected the very high and unsustainable expectations of house price  appreciation.  Household debts peaked in  2008, at which point the sector’s balance sheet was weak.  Households were highly-leveraged, with many  underwater on their mortgages.  This was  particularly the case for younger and lower- and middle-income households who,  besides being more leveraged, were disproportionally affected by job loss and  other income shocks, and had little experience managing debts―especially in  times of stress.  Consequently,  delinquency, foreclosure and bankruptcy rates reached very high levels.\n\nBeginning in 2008, households  began a new phase to repair their balance sheets by paying down outstanding  debt.  During this “Great Deleveraging,”  which lasted five years, households reduced their overall liabilities by 12  percent or $1.5 trillion.  House prices  began to rise again in earnest in 2012, and by mid-2013 household deleveraging  appeared to have come to an end.  Net  household borrowing resumed, and household debt has risen over 8 percent during  the last couple of years.  But, this  recent period of credit expansion looks very different from the early 2000s,  and I believe that the household sector today is in much better health.  There are several reasons for my confidence.\n\nLet me begin with the situation  in the residential mortgage market, which plays such a dominant role in  household finance and was such a problem the last time around.  Currently, house price growth is running  nationally at around 5 percent per year.   But this time, households appear to be much more cautious in how they  are responding to the rise in home values.   Rather than borrowing against the rising equity in their homes, mortgage  balances have instead essentially stabilized and remain well below their  previous levels.  As my colleagues will  describe in more detail shortly, this stabilization reflects an increase in  debt paydown due to a combination of lower interest rates, shorter loan terms  and aging of mortgages.  This trend is  reflected in increased household saving and growing home equity, and we expect  these trends to continue to help households rebuild their balance sheets over  the near term, thereby further increasing the household sector’s resiliency to  shocks.\n\nLow interest rates have also  been important in driving the household debt service ratio to the lowest levels  observed in our data.  This means that  households have more capacity with which to absorb any temporary adverse income  shocks.  One clear reflection of these  improvements is the very significant decline in delinquency rates.  At this point, the great majority of the bad  debt from the boom years has been charged off and new foreclosures are at the  lowest level we’ve seen in our data.  The  combination of charge-offs and tight mortgage underwriting standards over the  last several years has shifted the stock of outstanding mortgage balances  toward lower-risk borrowers, who are typically older with more stable incomes.\n\nFor all these reasons, the  household sector looks much better positioned today than in 2008 to absorb  shocks and continue to contribute to the economic expansion.\n\nNow, before asking my colleagues  to discuss some of these trends in more detail, let me note that my positive  overview of the household sector comes with some caveats.  First, these aggregate statistics can mask  some important variations, and there are some local markets where, as in the  prior boom, both house prices and mortgage growth are quite strong.  Similarly, there exist substantial  differences across households in their financial situation and their ability to  improve their balance sheets.  Borrowers  with little equity, low credit scores and slow income growth face difficulties  refinancing into low rate mortgages.  As  a result, this subset of the population has been less able to deleverage and  still faces relatively high debt service costs, which constrains their  consumption, investment and saving behavior.   So, even within what looks to be a stable overall mortgage market, there  are some things that we must continue to monitor.  Second, there are other difficult challenges  that many households face, particularly with respect to a subject we’ve  discussed on previous occasions―student loans.   On balance, though, households are in a much better position today than  they were in 2008.  Now, I'd like to turn  things over to our economists, beginning with Andrew Haughwout, who will  provide a more detailed discussion of household sector finances.\n\n1 Domenico Giannone, Andrew Haughwout,  Joseph Tracy and Wilbert van der Klaauw assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 See William C.

    "text": "This panel is entitled Monetary Policy and Banking. 1 That takes in a lot of territory.  Rather than try to cover the waterfront, I am going to start with a single premise: Financial stability is a necessary prerequisite for an effective monetary policy.  There is a critical chain of linkages from monetary policy to banking and onwards to the real economy.  Financial stability is a necessary condition for those linkages to operate effectively.  Thus, it is a necessary condition for monetary policy to be able to achieve its economic objectives.\n\nI will then outline briefly what I see as some of the major implications that stem from that premise.  These include that the central bank has a major role to play in ensuring financial stability and should evaluate the stance of monetary policy in light of problems in the financial system that may impair the monetary policy transmission mechanism. 2\n\nIn my mind, the biggest lesson of the financial crisis has been that monetary policy cannot work properly when there is financial instability.  When financial instability occurs, it disturbs market functioning and can also impair bank balance sheets.  The result can be disruption to the financial intermediation function with resulting constraints on the availability of credit for households and businesses.  This, in turn, can lead to further reductions in aggregate demand that put additional stress on the weakened financial system.  Obviously, this is not a favorable dynamic.\n\nFinancial instability can impact the conduct of  monetary policy via three major channels.  First, financial instability can generate a sufficiently large shock to aggregate demand that the central bank may encounter the zero lower bound constraint—the constraint that the monetary policy instrument, for example, the federal funds rate—cannot easily be pushed below zero. In such circumstances, it may not be easy to fully offset the shock through the pursuit of a more stimulative monetary policy. At the zero bound, the central bank is not powerless, and may turn to other monetary policy tools such as forward guidance and large scale asset purchases.  But these tools may not be as effective as lowering the short-term rate instrument.  In particular, the central bank may not be willing to use these nonconventional tools to the full extent necessary to provide the same degree of stimulus as it would provide if it could set interest rates at negative levels.  That might be because of uncertainty about how nonconventional tools will work or because of the potential costs associated with the use of such tools in terms of market functioning and the risks of future financial instability.\n\nSecond, financial instability can impair the linkage between monetary policy and financial conditions.  The central bank may move to a much more accommodative monetary policy stance, but this may not lead to much improvement in financial conditions. We see this clearly in spreads and risk premia during periods of financial stress. Depletion of capital in the banking system or the interaction of frictions and market failures may also lead to constraints on the availability of credit following a financial shock.  As a recent U.S. example of the second issue, households with lower FICO scores have had difficulties in refinancing their mortgages or in obtaining new mortgages to purchase a home.  This stems from worries by lenders about put back risk—that such mortgages might be put back to them by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac should the mortgages become nonperforming.  For any given reduction in mortgage rates relative to normal levels, this reduces the support for the housing sector and consumption.   Thus, another lesson of the crisis is that monetary policymakers need to be more attuned to how the condition of the financial system influences how monetary policy changes affect financial conditions.\n\nThird, the linkage between financial conditions and aggregate demand may also be impaired.  For example, if an asset bubble has caused a buildup of debt that now needs to be reduced significantly, then lower interest rates that ease financial conditions may not stimulate aggregate demand very much.  Separately, in a protracted zero bound episode, the monetary policy impulse may become attenuated over time.  Lower interest rates may make financial conditions easier, lifting wealth, and encouraging households to shift spending from the future to the present.  But when the future arrives, spending may then be lower as a consequence.  The linkage between financial conditions and economic activity may vary depending on how long the accommodative monetary policy regime has been in place.\n\nSo what are the implications that stem from the fact that financial instability can impair the efficacy of monetary policy?   I think there are at least three major implications:\n\nLet me now consider each of these implications in turn.  The first implication, that the central bank has a strong stake in preventing financial instability, has several elements.  The central bank needs to be willing to respond to limit financial market bubbles from developing in the first place. This includes not just paying attention to asset price bubbles, but also to related excesses in leverage and in short-term funding markets.  As I noted in a speech a few years ago, this is difficult to do in practice. 3 After all, bubbles are difficult to identify in real time and the central bank’s policy toolkit to deal with bubbles may be limited.  However, this difficulty cannot be an excuse for inaction.  Using the bully pulpit, implementing macroprudential measures, or adjusting monetary policy can generate superior results compared to inaction.\n\nThe central bank also has to ensure that the financial system is sufficiently robust and resilient so that if there are financial market shocks, the banking system can absorb any shocks and continue to perform its credit intermediation function.  This has many elements including tough capital and liquidity requirements for banks and strong financial market infrastructures.  It also includes taking action to eliminate sources of vulnerabilities whenever they may arise—for example, strengthening the triparty repo system, reducing the vulnerability of money market mutual funds to runs, or forcing derivatives contracts to be standardized and centrally cleared. These actions should be undertaken during “peacetime” rather than when a crisis is already underway.\n\nFinally, the central bank needs to look over the horizon and identify market practices and processes that could make the financial system more vulnerable to shocks or that could amplify such shocks. As an example, a tougher response to the poor mortgage underwriting practices evident during the U.S. housing bubble would have been appropriate in my opinion.  Or more attention to bank compensation practices could have mitigated the incentives for excessive risk-taking.\n\nThe second implication is that when financial instability does occur, the central bank needs to respond forcefully to mitigate such instability.  This includes ensuring that appropriate liquidity backstops are available.  This is necessary in order to reassure counterparties that solvent institutions will have access to liquidity so that they can repay their obligations regardless of the degree of illiquidity or stress in the financial system.  As we saw in the fall of 2008, without appropriate backstops, markets can seize up completely even when counterparties are perceived as solvent.  That is because market participants tend to hoard liquidity during times of stress and because counterparties may not engage with one another when they are uncertain whether others will do so.  Central bank liquidity backstops act as a coordinating device, solving the collective action problem faced by private market participants.\n\nHowever, in the most serious stress episodes, credible liquidity backstops alone will not always prove sufficient.  It is also necessary to take steps to restore the banking system to health as soon as possible.  This means forcing banks to cut their capital distributions early and to raise new capital in a timely way even if such capital-raising results in the forced dilution of existing shareholders.\n\nWith respect to bank capital, we saw two unwelcome behaviors during the crisis that central banks and other banking regulators need to lean against.  Banks were reluctant to cut their capital distributions because of worries that this would signal weakness.  Of course, these capital distributions just made the banks and the banking system weaker.\n\nAlso, we saw that banks were reluctant to raise capital to guard against particularly bad states of the world because they thought this might unnecessarily dilute their shareholders should such bad states of the world not materialize.  Of course, the collective action of banks to not raise this additional capital made the banking system weaker than it would otherwise have been. This in turn made the possibility of the particularly bad states of the world more likely. In such circumstances—which the U.S. faced in 2009 and arguably the Eurozone faces today—it is essential for the authorities to force sufficient capital into the system. The subtlety here is that in a time of stress it is necessary to overcapitalize the banking system relative to the base case scenario in order to ensure financial stability and an ongoing supply of credit to the real economy in a stress scenario. Doing this makes the bad scenario less likely to materialize and the improvement in credit supply helps to engineer a stronger recovery than would otherwise materialize. 4\n\nThe third implication is that the stance of monetary policy needs to be assessed based on the state of the financial system and the real economy.  How the monetary policy impulse is transmitted to the real economy is not immutable but changes depending on how monetary policy affects financial conditions and how financial conditions affect economic activity.\n\nDuring and following financial crises, problems in the financial system can impair the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy.  When this happens, policy may need to be more accommodative than otherwise in order to achieve its objectives.\n\nThe experiences of both Japan and United States are cases in point. 5 In retrospect, we know that following the collapse of the property bubble and the investment boom in Japan in the 1990s, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) did not follow a sufficiently accommodative monetary policy to prevent deflation.  Although the BoJ response was appropriate relative to the economic forecasts that prevailed at the time, those forecasts proved much too optimistic. Thus, policy was insufficiently accommodative with the benefit of hindsight.  To a lesser degree, the same critique also applies to the United States.  Despite an aggressive shift towards greater monetary policy accommodation in 2008 and 2009, and ongoing subsequent easing—which has supported a return to growth and helped to facilitate needed adjustments in housing and household balance sheets—the economic recovery has been consistently weaker  than forecast.   As a result, the Federal Reserve has fallen short of meeting its employment and inflation objectives.  This suggests that with the benefit of hindsight, U.S. monetary policy, though aggressive by historic standards, was not sufficiently accommodative relative to the state of the economy.\n\nIn this regard, I would caution against the mechanical use of monetary policy rules following a financial crisis.  In the United States, the so-called Taylor Rule receives considerable attention as a guide to policy.  But there are a number of reasons to believe that using it mechanically would result in too tight of a monetary policy setting. While discussing the shortcomings of the Taylor Rule is beyond the scope of my remarks today, let me make one simple point.  If the transmission channels of monetary policy are impaired, then the equilibrium real rate associated with monetary policy neutrality is likely to be considerably lower than the 2.25 percent real rate assumption embodied in the typical Taylor Rule formulation.  Monetary policy needs to take this onboard, even before considering other issues such as risk-management at the zero bound.\n\nI have argued today that the central bank needs to have a major role in ensuring that the financial system is sound.  Without this, the central bank cannot ensure that monetary policy will be effective in achieving its objectives. This is the important linkage of monetary policy to banking.\n\nNow some express concern that involvement in banking regulation and supervision may lead a central bank to bias the setting of monetary policy to try to help troubled banks or other institutions. This fear is misplaced. Problems in the financial sector are taken into account for monetary policy purposes only to the extent that they affect the transmission of policy to the real economy. There is a separate tool kit to address problems at the level of the banks themselves.\n\nOthers will argue that having the central bank involved in the oversight and regulation of the financial system puts too much power in the hands of one authority. Another concern is that such a consolidation of responsibilities is dangerous for the central bank because it could threaten the central bank’s independence with respect to monetary policy.  I think these are legitimate issues.  But the bigger risks, in my view, are a monetary policy that fails to accomplish its economic objectives because of financial instability, and difficulties that stem from the inevitably imperfect coordination that takes place between multiple agencies with divided responsibilities during a crisis.  In those cases, not only will the central bank own that bad outcome with the resulting negative consequences for its ongoing credibility and effectiveness, but also the economic consequences will be severe for its citizens.\n\nTo address concerns about central bank power, the best approach is to ensure accountability.  This means appropriate oversight by the legislature and ongoing transparency by the central bank about the motivations for its actions, what it can reasonably expect to accomplish, and an honest assessment of its successes and failures.\n\nThank you very much for your kind attention.\n\n1 Krishna Guha, Marc Saidenberg and others on my staff contributed to these remarks\n\n2 As always, what I have to say here today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\n3 See “ Asset Bubbles and the Implications for Central Bank Policy ”, Economic Club of New York, April 7, 2010.\n\n4 Ideally, as was the case in the U.S. in 2009, the authorities should require banks to meet their stress scenario capital ratio standards by adding equity capital, with no credit given for reducing assets. This leans against the incentive to deleverage to meet higher capital ratio requirements.\n\n5 See my recent speech “ Lessons at the Zero Bound: The Japanese and U.S. Experience ”, Japan Society, May 21, 2013.",

    "text": "Good morning.  I’m happy to welcome you to the New York Fed for this workshop that is intended to increase our understanding of student debt and how it affects individuals, their families and the economy.  I am delighted to see such widespread and growing interest in this important topic.  Making continued progress on understanding these issues will depend critically on efforts to identify and address existing data gaps that hamper its study.  I am particularly happy to welcome Deputy Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin, who has spoken frequently and eloquently in the past about the need for improvements in student loan servicing and debt collection, the macroeconomic consequences of increased student debt, and the need for better data and analysis.  I look forward to her remarks today.\n\nBefore I make some specific comments on student debt, let me take a step back and say a few words on household finance more generally.  As always, what I say represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThere are several reasons the New York Fed has increased its focus on household finance.  First, the financial crisis made it obvious that an ability to understand and anticipate what is happening in the household sector is essential to gauging the strength and resiliency of the U.S. economy.  Second, our policy actions are intended to change the incentives facing households, so it is important to be able to gauge how our policies are transmitted into household financial decisions.  Good information on household borrowing, for example, allows us to see how monetary policy affects outcomes such as auto loan originations.  Third, better household finance research helps support our community outreach and development missions.\n\nA major challenge to achieving these goals is that household finances have traditionally been poorly documented.  We have lots of information about corporate sector debt and equity, but comparable basic facts about the household sector are much harder to come by.  For example, the lack of timely, comprehensive data made it more difficult to understand how vulnerable the household sector’s financial position had become by 2007.\n\nI’m happy to say that we’ve made progress in beginning to close this data gap.  At the New York Fed, we’ve been able to develop products that support a much better understanding of the household sector’s borrowing behavior, ranging from loan-level mortgage information to credit card utilization and borrowing limits.  This has greatly improved our knowledge of household debt burdens, new borrowing activity, debt repayment as well as delinquencies.  We’ve made a point of passing along these insights to the public through our Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, various blog posts and interactive online maps of mortgage delinquencies.  It has required a substantial commitment of resources to obtain the data and extract the information from them, but I’m convinced that it’s been the right course of action.\n\nWhich brings me to the subject of today’s workshop: student loans.\n\nAs you know, student debt is an increasingly important form of credit both for households and for the economy.  In 2010, aggregate outstanding student loan balances surpassed credit card indebtedness, and in 2013 eclipsed a trillion dollars.  During the historic household deleveraging that took place between 2008 and 2013, student debt bucked the trend, and was the only form of household credit that continued to increase each year.\n\nThere are many reasons for this growth, some of which are well-documented—including increasing numbers of individuals who are pursuing post-secondary education, increasing durations in school and higher tuitions.  A less well-known contributor to the growing student debt balances was highlighted recently by a team of New York Fed economists. 2 Using credit bureau data that track the quarterly balance and payment status of student loans, they have shown that the overall rate of repayment of outstanding student loans is very low, with many borrowers being delinquent on their loans.\n\nNow, it’s probably fair to say that each form of household debt has distinctive features.  A researcher must understand these differences in order to understand the role that a particular kind of debt plays in household decision-making.  But student debt is perhaps the most distinctive form.  Let me explain what I mean.\n\nUnlike virtually all other forms of credit, student loans are generally not underwritten: they are frequently offered to young borrowers who have little or no credit history and little to no current income.  The amount of credit extended, on average, runs in the tens of thousands of dollars.  These loans are also not collateralized, nor are the interest rates risk-based.  However, lenders (now primarily the taxpayers), are given additional security in that student loans, unlike other forms of debt, are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  This also means that delinquent student loans tend to remain on a borrower’s credit record long after the borrower has stopped making payments, thus leading to very high measured rates of delinquency.  In addition, many special programs exist to allow borrowers to postpone repayment on their student loans to an extent not available for other kinds of household lending.  New York Fed economists have shown that for the 2009 cohort of graduates, only 17 percent of their original debt had been paid down after five years. 3 More than 20 percent of high-balance student borrowers owe more now than when they graduated in 2009.  For the 2005 cohort of graduates, only 38 percent of their original student debt had been paid down, on average, nearly ten years after graduation.\n\nThese loans are used to finance human capital investment projects with returns that are highly uncertain.  It’s true that virtually every study finds that the returns on college degrees are high, on average, relative to their cost.  But some people who take out student loans don’t end up with these high average returns.  The net returns for some may, in fact, be negative.  For example, many who have pursued vocational training may be less remunerated in the market.  Similarly, some students attend certain for-profit universities with track records that indicate that their graduates have lower lifetime earnings than other types of educational institutions.  While others drop out before receiving a degree—just 59 percent of the 2006 cohort had received their four-year degree by 2012.  Of course, uncertain returns are a feature of most investments, but for other loan types this uncertainty is generally managed more effectively through credit underwriting, collateralization and risk-based interest rates.\n\nWe are fairly confident in the aggregate statistics—over a trillion dollars in loan balances outstanding, 43 million borrowers and the highest delinquency rates of any form of household debt.  But we know a lot less about the precise causes and consequences of the heterogeneity in the net returns to educational investments that I just described.  What we know so far, based on very imperfect data, suggests that this heterogeneity is likely to be very important.  We have gained an increasing understanding that how we finance post-secondary education has significant effects on a variety of critical economic outcomes, including economic growth and inequality.  For example, our research suggests that higher student debt and delinquencies reduce household formation and depress homeownership.\n\nBut there are many important questions still left unanswered.  What is the relationship between the amount and type of educational investment that people make and their outcomes?  What attributes are associated with borrowers who are more successful at repaying their student loans?  Are there particular types of degrees that are associated with better performance with respect to student debt repayment or with better living standards earlier in life?  What are the best interventions to help borrowers avoid the consequences of delinquency and default, and to limit any default costs to taxpayers?  Do borrowers who use programs like income-based repayment eventually succeed in paying off their debts?  How do income-based repayment programs affect important decisions such as labor supply, consumption and household formation?\n\nThese are important questions for the nation, as the human capital of our citizens is far and away our most important asset, and student loans are an important mechanism for financing needed investments in that asset.  But it is very hard to answer these questions with existing data.  We need to link information on borrower decisions about the kind and amount of education they receive to long-run outcomes for them and for the overall economy.\n\nSo I commend to you the work before you—finding new ways to get the information that policymakers need to answer important questions about how we finance higher education.  I look forward to your insights and recommendations.\n\n1 Andrew Haughwout, Joseph Tracy and Wilbert van der Klaauw assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 , 3 Payback Time?

    "text": "Thank you for having me here  today. It is a pleasure being back to  speak at the Council. In the past, my  Federal Reserve colleague, Governor Daniel Tarullo, gathered panels of Wall  Street economists here at the Council to talk about economic issues. When he invited me to participate, it was  challenging work because Dan always asked us about our economic forecasts! And he remembered and recounted our past  mistakes (and our much rarer, more prescient forecasts)!\n\nBefore I begin, let me emphasize  that my comments represent my own views and opinions and do not necessarily  reflect the views of the Federal Open Market Committee or of the Federal  Reserve System.\n\nWhat has happened to the global  financial system is momentous. We have  seen—despite extraordinary actions by central banks and governments around the  world—a severe impairment of the intermediation process between borrowers and  savers. We have seen a massive  deleveraging of the non-bank financial sector. We have seen a tightening in financial market conditions even as the Federal  Reserve has pushed the federal funds rate down close to zero. The result has been a severe loss of  confidence among consumers and business and a global recession.\n\nToday I would like to talk a bit  about what went wrong, where we are today, some new initiatives that are  underway, what lessons we should take from the crisis and some steps we need to  take so this doesn’t happen again.\n\nIt is well-recognized that one  important catalyst for this financial crisis was the easy credit and loose  underwriting practices that fueled the boom in the U.S. housing sector. The ability of virtually anyone to  get a loan to buy a house pushed up home prices significantly faster than  incomes. To keep the boom going, underwriting standards were progressively  relaxed, but even with that support to demand, inevitably the boom proved  unsustainable.\n\nAs the boom reversed and housing  prices began to fall, the bad underwriting practices and the mispricing of risk  became readily apparent. When prices are  rising no one needs to default, they always have the option of refinancing or  selling the house at the now higher price. But when prices are dropping, there  is no easy way out. The result has been a  sharp rise in delinquencies and foreclosures as the bust has played out.\n\nThe fact that these poorly  underwritten loans were used in the construction of very complex collateralized  debt obligations or CDOs, with risks that were not well understood and grossly  mispriced—made a bad situation even worse. Investors who thought they had purchased safe  AAA-rated assets found that these assets were very vulnerable to a housing bust  and that the ratings were unreliable predictors of the risk of loss.\n\nThe poor performance of these  securities, in turn, made investors much less willing to invest in  structured-finance products more generally. Secondary market liquidity evaporated, which exacerbated the difficulty  in valuing the securities. This made the  market even less attractive, causing risk premia to widen further, which only worsened  the valuation problems.\n\nAs this process unfolded, the  result was a virtual shutdown of the securitization market for residential  mortgage assets not backed by the federal government directly (Ginnie Mae) or  implicitly (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). The subprime and the Alt-A mortgage markets, which relied heavily on the  securitization process dried up. Of  course, this just reinforced the downward pressure on housing prices, which, in  turn, led to increased delinquencies and foreclosures. This deterioration undermined the value of  the securities further. It was a vicious  feedback loop in action. The poor performance of highly-rated mortgage  securities caused investors to begin to shun securitizations more  generally.\n\nThe shutdown of the securitization  markets led to significant pressure on bank balance sheets. Banks could no longer securitize  non-conforming mortgages or the collateralized loan obligations associated with  leveraged buyouts and other private equity activity that they had  financed. Moreover, bank backstop  liquidity lines were triggered as SIVs and conduits could no longer issue asset-backed commercial paper. Finally,  banks took large mark-to-market losses on their trading books and had to  increase their loan loss provisions.\n\nAs the crisis continued into 2008,  the squeeze on bank balance sheets intensified. This was driven by several important developments. First, the demise of Bear Stearns increased  the pressure on the other broker dealers to deleverage. They did this, of course, by becoming less  willing to lend funds to their counterparties, such as hedge funds, and by shrinking  their trading books. In the week leading  up to Bear’s demise a nasty feedback loop ensued: forced asset sales increased price  volatility. This led to higher haircuts  by dealers on their counterparties, which led to more forced asset sales and  still higher volatility.\n\nSecond, the failure of Lehman in  September accelerated the pace of this deleveraging process. Major bank intermediaries were frightened by  what had happened and were unwilling to engage with each other. Prime money market mutual funds suffered  large outflows. Investors fled as the  news came out that the Reserve Fund had “broken the buck” because of large  losses generated by its holdings of Lehman paper.\n\nBy late September we were in a very  bad spot. Banks weren’t willing to lend  to each other even at very short term maturities. LIBOR—the London Interbank Offered Rate, which is the  rate that banks offer to lend to each other—soared even as the Federal Reserve  continued to lower its federal funds rate target and injected extra reserves  into the banking system. Merrill Lynch agreed to merge with Bank of America. The equity prices of the two remaining  independent investment banks—Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley—weakened, their  credit default swap spreads widened and this began to undermine their ability  to obtain funding. In response, Goldman  Sachs and Morgan Stanley jumped over the regulatory wall and became bank  holding companies.\n\nHedge funds were forced to  liquidate assets as financing terms tightened. As a group, their performance deteriorated sharply beginning in late  summer. This provoked investor  redemptions—further accelerating the speed and scope of the deleveraging cycle.\n\nAlthough housing and housing  finance may have been at the epicenter of the crisis, it is important, however,  to recognize that the crisis goes much deeper. In part, it was rooted in the  overconfidence of investors and borrowers that paid little attention to  liquidity and rollover risk and seemed blind to the risk of a global downturn. It was also rooted in the gaps in supervision  and regulation that allowed a whole range of financial intermediaries and  businesses to become more leveraged, in many cases funding long-term illiquid  assets with short-term borrowing.\n\nTo some extent, what has happened  can be tied to changes in the nature of the business cycle and how those  changes influenced expectations. Put  simply, when business cycles become more damped and recessions less frequent  and less severe, this will cause financial market participants to take on more  risk. This will not appear to be  problematic during the expansion stage. But it will make the financial system much more vulnerable when the bust  does occur. Occurring with less frequency,  the bust will be a bigger surprise to market participants. They will be less well-prepared with the  capital buffers and liquidity cushions needed to traverse an adverse economic  environment.\n\nThe complete breakdown in trust across  markets has been remarkable. Essentially, it has gone like this: Even if I think you are a good credit, I am not going to lend to you,  because others may not share the same opinion. The problem is if no one else thinks you are good, I may not be able to  get my money back if I need it. Conversely,  others are not willing to lend to you, even though they think you are a good  credit, because they are not convinced that I will do so. The result is that no one lends, financial  conditions tighten and this exacerbates the downward pressure on the economy. As economic conditions deteriorate, this undermines  the financial strength of the major financial institutions, further reinforcing  the downward spiral in confidence.\n\nAnother bad dynamic that  exacerbated the crisis has been the reluctance of some banks to raise the  additional capital they might need should the economic outlook deteriorate  sharply. Repeatedly over the past 18  months we have heard—from the GSEs, from the investment banks, from the  commercial banks—now is not a good time to raise capital. This desire to postpone capital raising  stems, in part, to the fact that bank executives often do not want to dilute  the existing shareholders (which, of course, include themselves).\n\nI believe that the management  calculus has often gone like this: In  good states of the world, I have enough capital. In bad states of the world, perhaps I  don’t. But to raise enough capital to guarantee  I can endure all the potential bad states of the world, I will have to  massively dilute my existing shareholders now. So the self-interested thing to do is to avoid the dilution and hope for  a good state of the world.\n\nThis does not always work well in  practice. Once capital preservation becomes  paramount, deleveraging intensifies and counterparties grow more wary about  engaging. This dynamic, in turn, makes a  bad state of the world more likely. What  may be sensible for each institution individually, may collectively be a bad  idea. That is because each firm does not  internalize the cost that their decision not to raise capital has on the  overall financial system.\n\nA healthy banking system is always  essential. But never has that been more  true right now given what has happened to the securitization markets and the  broad “shadow” banking system.\n\nSo where are we now?\n\nIn my view, the deleveraging  process is still far from complete. Hedge  fund redemptions have soared. It would  not be surprising that when we’re done, hedge fund assets (before leverage)  will have fallen in half or more from their peak of about $2 trillion. Of course, the Madoff scandal and other  episodes of misappropriated funds have further undermined confidence, reinforcing  the redemption pressure.\n\nMost importantly, the pressure on  the financial system has been exacerbated by the deterioration in the economic outlook  following the Lehman failure. Before last  fall, the causality ran mostly from the turmoil in the financial system to the  real economy. Since then, the real  economy has contracted sharply and this has reinforced the balance sheet  pressure on banks and the forced deleveraging process.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nWell fortunately, it is not all bad  news—there are a number of programs that have been enacted that have already  made a difference. And several new  initiatives are being enacted now that should help to support and bolster the  financial system.\n\nThose areas where the Federal  Reserve and the Federal government have responded in force are doing somewhat  better. Banks and dealers have plenty of  access to liquidity. The Term Auction  Facility or TAF—in which funds are auctioned off to banks—and the Term  Securities Lending Facility or TSLF—in which auctions are held to borrow  Treasuries from the Federal Reserve—have recently been undersubscribed,  indicating that the facilities have been sufficiently sized to meet the demand  for liquidity.  The FDIC has also  guaranteed bank and bank holding company funding through its Temporary  Guarantee Liquidity Program. As a  result, bank term funding spreads have narrowed a bit this quarter.\n\nHowever, while the Federal Reserve  can provide liquidity to the banks and dealers and the FDIC can reduce  counterparty concerns via its guarantee program, these steps cannot force banks  and dealers to on lend these funds to their customers.\n\nThis is where several new initiatives  may show the way forward.\n\nFirst, the Federal Reserve has  begun to bypass the banks and dealers, which are balance sheet constrained, and  instead has begun to provide liquidity directly to borrowers. One of  these programs, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility or CPFF has been up and  running since late October.\n\nUnder the terms of the CPFF, the  Federal Reserve offered to purchase A1-P1 rated commercial paper at 84-day  maturity from issuers. Although A1-P1 rated  paper is the highest quality stuff, it makes up almost all of the CP market. The only catch is that the CPFF will only buy  at rates that are quite high compared to the rates one would expect in the  market during normal times. The Fed has to charge a high rate and up-front fees  to provide some equity in the fund to offset potential credit losses.\n\nThis facility has worked extremely  well in restoring market function in the commercial paper market. Initially, there was a surge of issuance into  the facility. Commercial paper rates in  the market were high and the issuers wanted to extend the maturity of their  obligations. But since that time,  purchases have slowed sharply. Following  the introduction of the CPFF, commercial paper rates in the marketplace dropped  below the rates charged by the CPFF.  As  a result, issuance into the program has collapsed because many issuers can now  raise funds more cheaply in the private market. About half of the maturing paper in the CPFF has not been rolled  over.  As a result, the amount of CPFF  holdings, which peaked at around $350 billion in mid-January, has fallen by  over $100 billion, to below $250 billion.  To date at least, the CPFF has worked as planned and has been very successful  in rehabilitating the commercial paper market.\n\nSecond, the Term Asset-Backed  Security Loan Facility or TALF will provide balance sheet capacity directly to  investors beyond the banking and dealer community. This program is designed to restart the  securitization markets.\n\nThe TALF is being rolled out in two  stages. In the first stage, which I’ll  call TALF Version 1.0, the Federal Reserve will provide non-recourse loans to  investors against AAA-rated consumer asset-backed securities collateral. Primary  dealers will serve as the contact point with these investors to make it easier  for the Fed to interface with potentially hundreds of investors.\n\nThe AAA-rated securities eligible as  collateral for this non-recourse lending program are used to fund a wide  variety of consumer and business loans, including student , credit card, auto  and small business administration loans. The market for these securities had dried up because the traditional  investors in these securities—SIVs, bank-related conduits and securities  lenders—have either disappeared or are balance sheet constrained. This has reduced the availability of credit  for consumers and led to higher borrowing costs.\n\nThe first subscriptions for  financing under TALF Version 1.0 will occur on March 17. The first batch of new securitizations will  be funded on March 25.\n\nTALF Version 2.0 will follow. This will broaden the TALF into new asset  classes such as Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities. Development of this phase is still in its  early days. But it anticipated that the  size and scope of TALF will expand sharply in the months ahead.\n\nSo how will the TALF restart  securitization activity and provide balance sheet capacity to the private sector? By providing leverage and 3-year term, non-recourse  financing to investors, the TALF should increase the demand for AAA-rated  securitizations. Yields of LIBOR + 400  basis points may not be sufficiently attractive on an unleveraged basis, but at  10 times leverage the returns become very attractive.\n\nThe non-recourse nature of the  loans is also important. If the price of  the security falls considerably, the investor just loses an amount equal to size  of the haircut. For example, if the haircut was 10% and the value of the  security was $100, the most the investor could lose would be $10. Thus, the facility eliminates much of the downside  risk that would arise from a very deep recession or the fire sales of assets  that could cause prices to drop sharply temporarily.\n\nThis is a very exciting program  because it provides balance sheet capacity to risk capital that cannot  currently get leverage.  It goes beyond  current programs. Just as important, once  it is up and running it can be scaled up and out in many different dimensions.  In principle, it could be applied to other  distressed asset classes, it could move down the credit spectrum to lower-rated  tranches, and it could be used to fund older vintage assets.\n\nTwo other important initiatives are  also in train that deserve note.\n\nLast week the Treasury and the  major banking supervisors announced the details of a capital stress assessment process  for all bank holding companies with assets in excess of $100 billion. This process is designed to ensure that the  banking system has sufficient, high-quality capital to be able to absorb the  losses that would likely be generated by an economic scenario considerably worse  than generally expected. The stress  assessment assumes an adverse economic environment. For example, under this scenario, the  unemployment rate is anticipated to average more than 10% in 2010, considerably  higher than the consensus economic forecast.\n\nThe stress assessment will unfold  in three steps.   First, each bank  holding company will be asked to evaluate the credit losses that are likely to  occur under an adverse economic environment. These losses would then be evaluated  relative to the bank holding company’s ability to absorb those losses. Second, if this analysis indicated  that the banking organization was likely to fall short of well-capitalized in  the stress environment, the bank holding company would be able to obtain additional capital via mandatory convertible preferred stock  purchased by the Treasury.\n\nThird, if the stress scenario were  actually to occur, generating losses that depleted common equity capital below what  is deemed adequate, then the mandatory convertible preferred would be available  to be converted into common equity. The government’s mandatory convertible  preferred investment is, in some sense, contingent capital that is available to  be converted into common equity only as needed.\n\nI believe this program is very  important if we are to break the adverse dynamic that I outlined early. As I mentioned earlier, many bank holding  companies don’t have an incentive to raise sufficient capital to ensure that  they can handle a very bad outcome. That  is because such capital-raising would severely dilute existing  shareholders. This implies that, left to  their own devices, banks might end up being undercapitalized in a stress  environment. The risk of this outcome  makes these banks (and their counterparties) very cautious in terms of their  behavior. This cautiousness, which is  rational for each bank and counterparty individually, is bad for the system  because it constrains the supply of credit and results in tighter financial  conditions. This, in turn, makes the bad  economic outcome more likely.\n\nThe stress assessment regime that  is being implemented should help to break this dynamic. Banking institutions will end up with sufficient  capital to withstand even an adverse environment. This should reassure banks and investors that  the banking system will remain resilient. With more capital in place, more lending should take place. This, in turn, should reduce the likelihood  that the bad economic scenario will, in fact, be realized. The result: a virtuous rather than a vicious circle!\n\nThe point of the stress assessment  is not to pick winners or losers, but instead to ensure that the banking system  and all the major banks have sufficient capital to withstand a very adverse  environment. Following the conclusion of  the stress assessment process, the government is committed to supplying  whatever amount of capital is needed to ensure that all the major banks will  remain viable.\n\nThe second major initiative that  deserves mention is the PPIF or Public-Private Investment Fund. This facility, which would be underpinned by  TARP capital and private capital, would purchase illiquid, legacy assets. Although the terms and conditions of the PPIF  have not yet been announced, this facility should help put a floor under the  prices of lower-quality assets and provide a means for banks to shed such  assets from their balance sheets. Despite all these efforts, I don’t want to give you the  impression that all will be well soon—that seems unlikely. It will take time for the deleveraging  process to come to an end and, as the recent employment data have underscored,  the economy has considerable momentum to the downside. But the Federal Reserve is prepared to do  whatever it takes, within the bounds of its legal authority, to keep markets  working and credit available and affordable.\n\nFinally, what are  the lessons to be learned from this crisis? What do we need to fix in order to make our financial system more robust  and our economy less vulnerable?  Let me  offer up a short list of seven areas that we might focus on—recognizing that  this list is by no means complete or exhaustive.\n\nThis list is just a hint of the  agenda that lies ahead. We need to put  our financial system into the repair shop for intensive reconstruction. We need to do this in order to rebuild  confidence and to ensure that we do not repeat the type of financial boom and  bust that has characterized this cycle.\n\nThank you very much for your kind attention,  I would be happy to take questions.",

    "text": "As way of background, the U.S. experience conducting stress tests across an array of large banks came out of earlier work doing horizontal supervisory evaluations of banks. We found these exercises useful in identifying best practices and to determine where particular banks were deficient. In talking about stress tests in the United States, there are three distinct sets of stress tests to consider: Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), completed in May 2009; stress tests conducted as part of the larger Comprehensive Capital Assessment Review (CCAR), completed in April 2011; and the Dodd—Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated stress tests, which we have yet to implement. SCAP was a supervisory stress test, meaning that regulators specified the adverse scenario and determined the resulting loss and revenue estimates on a standardized basis drawing on information submitted by each firm. The CCAR process centered on bank-run stress tests in which regulators specified the scenario but required each bank to model the stress event itself. Dodd-Frank mandates both supervisory stress tests and bank-run stress tests. We are still working out how we will do each of these types, but I expect that the SCAP and CCAR exercises will serve as models. Today I will focus on the SCAP and CCAR exercises. The first important point to make is that the purposes of the SCAP and CCAR are very different. Thus, these processes are conducted in very distinct ways. Turning first to the SCAP, its purpose was to restore confidence in large U.S. banks. The SCAP was designed to accomplish this mission by measuring how much capital these banks would need in a stress macroeconomic environment and then forcing these banks to either raise this capital from private sources or take mandatory convertible preferred equity from the U.S. Treasury. The key attributes of the SCAP include: A common stress scenario was applied to each of 19 large bank holding companies (BHCs). This stress scenario was applied in a consistent manner across these banks. The test was applied at the detailed trading book and banking book level, with the expected loss experiences based upon the particular characteristics of the portfolio being examined. So, for example, evaluation of a residential mortgage portfolio might include detailed factors such as FICO scores and geographic distribution of the mortgages. This means that estimated potential losses under the stress scenario vary across banks not just because of differences in overall portfolio composition, but also because of differences in asset quality within particular asset classes. A minimum capital standard was applied after two years of stress and with appropriate reserves at the end of the two-year period. The minimum capital standard was set at 4 percent of Tier I common and 6 percent of Tier I capital. Estimated potential losses were compared with the starting capital level and the estimated resources expected to be generated by the ongoing business—referred to as pre-provision net revenue (PPNR)—in order to determine the capital needed to meet the minimum capital standard. Details of the test were disclosed on a bank-by-bank basis using a template that the Federal Reserve established. This common template ensured comparability across the 19 BHCs and ensured that the Federal Reserve controlled the message, not the banks. In contrast, while CCAR had an embedded stress test, the key attributes of the CCAR are quite different: The purpose was to assess the BHCs' capital planning processes to ensure that the BHCs have good capital plans in place. Stress tests were applied by individual banks as part of this exercise. We set the main scenario that the banks must use, and the banks were required to apply the stress test in the manner they deemed appropriate in assessing their capital adequacy. Supervisors used independent quantitative techniques both as a check on firm estimates and to assist in their evaluation of the firms' tools and processes. We evaluated their efforts in terms of: 1) how the stress test is applied, 2) what this implies in terms of capital adequacy, and 3) their capital plans and requests to pay dividends and/or conduct share repurchase programs. Our evaluation of their capital planning processes and their requests to make capital disbursements was based mainly on three factors: 1) capital adequacy, 2) the quality of the capital planning process, and 3) the credibility of their plans to meet the Basel III capital requirements. Elements of a good planning process include: 1) description of risk appetite and capital targets, 2) robust internal controls, 3) incorporation of stress testing and stress-test results into the decisionmaking process, 4) good governance with respect to the role of senior management and the board of directors, and 5) well-articulated capital distribution policies that describe how decisions are made relative to the expectations of future outcomes. Some outside observers ask why supervisors would ever want to use bank-run stress tests rather than supervisory stress tests. The answer is that they serve different purposes. A bank-run stress test allows supervisors to evaluate how good each individual bank—and the banking system in general—is at assessing the risks it faces in a stress scenario and translating this into an appropriate amount of capital to set aside against these risks. Crucially, supervisors do not simply accept the results the banks produce in these tests—they evaluate both the adequacy of the numbers the banks produce and the processes they use to get there. If all we ever did was run supervisory stress tests in which we instruct banks in detail how to perform the test, we would be in the position of a parent who shows his child how to solve each problem in her homework—and never discovers whether the child can do the work on her own or not. The CCAR process differs from the SCAP in several key respects. First, in the CCAR there was no disclosure by the Fed of the stress test results. In CCAR, the focus was on assessing the sensitivity of the firms' own projections of capital under the baseline and stress scenarios to alternate assumptions and estimates. The results do not lend themselves to direct, apples-to-apples comparisons like the results in the SCAP. Second, the emphasis was on the capital planning process, not forcing the banks to raise capital to withstand a stress environment. Third, the CCAR was conducted at a different stage of the economic cycle. The issue was not capital raising as in the SCAP, but instead how fast should they continue to build their capital. What's prudent? This translated into an evaluation about the amount of capital that they could prudently pay out via dividends and/or share buybacks. Fourth, with respect to the distribution requests, we were not calculating the amount of capital that the banks can distribute. Instead, we were making an \"up\" or \"down\" decision per their requests. Either we \"objected\" or we \"did not object.\" We want banks to have good capital planning processes and make intelligent decisions with respect to capital. We don't want to determine their capital actions or what their distributions should be. They need to be able to do this. Fifth, with respect to disclosure, this decision was left to individual firms. In some cases, banks disclosed whether we objected or not to their plans for distributions, while in other cases they simply announced their intention with regard to future capital distributions. So what have been the lessons from our stress test exercises? One key issue during the financial crisis was the unwillingness of banks to proactively raise capital so they would be better prepared to withstand a \"bad state of the world\" scenario should that transpire. Banks didn't want to do this for two reasons. First, capital raises might signal that they were, in fact, weak. Second, the capital raises would be dilutive. In particular, in many cases the expected share price would be higher without dilution even admitting the possibility of a \"bad state of the world\" scenario. The problem with this approach was that each individual bank's decision not to raise capital to protect against the \"bad state of the world\" scenario increased the likelihood of the \"bad state of the world\" scenario. There was an important externality. If a bank raises additional capital, it doesn't just make its own bank stronger, it also makes the entire banking system more stable. Yet it reaps only a portion of these benefits. This was the collective action problem that the SCAP was designed to remedy. Perhaps, I can best illustrate the problem via two figures. In Figure 1 , banks have sufficient capital. The mean value of capital is well above zero, the distribution is narrow, and none of the distribution falls below zero—everyone believes the bank is solvent. In Figure 2 , losses push the distribution of capital to the left and uncertainty about the value of the assets widens the distribution. Thus, unlike the case in Figure 1, a portion of the distribution falls below zero. The bank may be insolvent. Thus, the bank is likely to encounter funding difficulties. The point of the SCAP was to push the probability distribution back to the right by adding capital—and to narrow it by creating more certainty about how much capital the banks need. By moving the banking industry collectively back to Figure 1 from Figure 2, the \"bad state of the world\" becomes less likely. In the SCAP, we had to make a number of important decisions. These included: The appropriate capital target. We focused on the Tier I common ratio because we believed that this was the most credible form of capital. This put much greater emphasis on common equity than previously. The severity of the stress test. We assumed a stress scenario with an unemployment rate 1.5 percentage points higher than the baseline scenario, and further home price declines of about 29 percent compared with 18 percent in the base case. We were aiming for a stress test scenario that had about a 5 percent to 10 percent probability of being realized. The capital target at the end of 2010 and the stress test severity were both important in terms of the credibility of the SCAP. Going in, we were worried that with our capital goal, the BHCs' needs might turn out to be higher than the available resources from the private sector and the U.S. Treasury. We decided not to compromise the credibility of the stress test to save on needed capital resources. We were fortunate that the need turned out to not be that great: $185 billion of capital needed prior to capital actions already implemented and revenue generated during the first quarter of 2010; $75 billion of capital needed after these first quarter actions. We decided to apply the stress scenario on a consistent basis across all 19 banks. This entailed economists and bank supervisors working together to do analysis on both a top-down and bottom-up basis. This allowed us to generate aggregate estimates that made sense on an economywide basis. If we had just used the initial estimates supplied by the banks—we would have had a Lake Wobegon outcome—the banks would all have said that they were above average. We specified the capital need in terms of dollars rather than in terms of a capital ratio. In other words, we did not allow banks the option of shrinking their risk-weighted assets in order to push up their capital ratios. We didn't want banks to shrink to minimize the amount of capital needed because such behavior might have damaged the macroeconomy. I think this was an important macroprudential element of the SCAP. Disclosure. This was hotly debated. There was no precedent for the disclosure of supervisory information. However, senior policymakers—including myself—thought disclosure was essential for the SCAP to be credible and we resolved to disclose extensive information. Disclosure allowed private-sector analysts to kick the tires and this was important. The day after the results were published, I remember that Bridgewater Associates—which had said the banks needed considerably more resources—published a paper evaluating the SCAP results. The banner headline was: \"We Agree.\" So this was important. However, I would note that it is important not to draw too strong a conclusion from just one episode. In the SCAP process, I also think it is important that we had some good luck. First, the banks' needs were not that great. What people didn't appreciate going in was that U.S. banks have strong revenue-generation capabilities: the banks had already set aside a large amount of reserves and taken large mark-to-market losses, and the banks had already bolstered their capital resources via capital raises and the sale of ancillary businesses. Second, the economy started to look a bit better in May at the time the SCAP results were released. This made the stress scenario more credible. Third, the capital markets were open to the banks. This was important because, as we saw, private capital was viewed as very much superior to Treasury mandatory convertible preferred shares. Fourth, although we made the correct decision to disclose, this was a difficult and close call. The fact that the loss experiences for the different asset classes varied across the banks helped to bolster the credibility of the results. Going into the spring of 2009, there was a prevailing view that several of the largest banks would have to be nationalized. The problem was that on a mark-to-market basis, some of these banks were viewed as potentially insolvent. But the mark-to-market price declines overstated the problem because a significant portion of the decline in prices did not reflect expected losses but instead was due to a huge increase in the illiquidity premium. This was due to the fact that risky assets could no longer be financed easily on a leveraged basis. As long as banks could hold onto the assets, losses would shrink once the illiquidity premium narrowed back to a more typical level. To sum up, I believe that the SCAP was an important turning point in the financial crisis. Confidence improved as banks raised capital mainly in the private markets. So what were the lessons from the CCAR? I think here the lessons were mostly for the banks. There were negative consequences for banks that had inadequate capital planning capabilities or asked to make distributions that were too large relative to expected capital resources. From the CCAR, we concluded that all banks could and should be required to improve their capital planning processes, even those that received a decision of \"no objection\" to their proposed distributions. A detailed letter went to each firm outlining areas for improvement and we will be tracking the banks progress. CCAR is not a one-off event. It will be an ongoing process. It is designed to push banks to continue to upgrade their risk management and capital assessment processes. So what are the implications of the U.S. experience? The context and purpose of any stress test should dictate the form it takes. Both the SCAP and CCAR models likely have some lessons for other such exercises, but in circumstances of market stress, the SCAP model is more relevant than the CCAR model. In such episodes, our experience suggests: First, the stress scenario needs to be severe to be credible. Second, disclosure of the results is needed at a sufficiently granular level so that private analysts can make their own independent assessment. Third, the results need to be credible in terms of expected losses. Fourth, there needs to be a credible capital backstop so that market participants can be sure banks will be able to raise the capital that they need under a stress environment, one way or another. One tricky issue is how to treat sovereign debt exposures. This was not an issue in the U.S. SCAP exercise. This is difficult because there is a complex interaction between fiscal soundness and bank soundness, which is very hard to model. This illustrates a wider point—that all situations are importantly distinct and that while we can all learn from each others' experiences in this field, there is no one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nAs way of background, the U.S. experience conducting stress tests across an array of large banks came out of earlier work doing horizontal supervisory evaluations of banks.

    "text": "Good morning and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Economic Press Briefing.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak with you today about economic conditions in our District.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTracking economic conditions in our region is an important part of our work here at the New York Fed.  We need to understand how the diverse economies in our District are performing—from the metropolis of New York City and its surrounding areas, to rural communities in upstate New York and the tropical island of Puerto Rico.  I take all of this to the table when the FOMC discusses business and economic conditions and trends.  In addition, we provide our regional analysis to the public so that everyone can benefit from our work.  At today's briefing, we will share some of this work with you.\n\nAs president of the New York Fed, I believe it is essential to listen firsthand to a broad set of businesses and people in the communities we serve to get as comprehensive a picture as possible of how our region is doing.  To accomplish this, we have a team dedicated to going out into the region to gather economic intelligence and to help our communities develop programs to support local economic development.  Let me speak a little further about our work analyzing local economic conditions and how we use this work to help our stakeholders.\n\nWe have developed a number of analytical tools to track the regional economy.  To get the most up-to-date read on economic conditions in our District as possible, we conduct two monthly business surveys.  Our Empire State Manufacturing Survey gives a real-time read on manufacturing conditions in New York State, while our Business Leaders Survey allows us to track economic activity across the tri-state region in the broader services sector.  We also conduct regular polls of small businesses in our area to better understand their evolving situation and needs.  In addition, we publish monthly indexes of economic activity for New York State, New York City and New Jersey.  We also monitor the financial health of households through our quarterly Household Debt and Credit Report and track the state of school finances in our region.\n\nBut economic data can only tell you so much. It is also imperative that we engage with people in our region to see the broader picture behind the facts and figures.  To this end, I regularly travel to various parts of our District to hear firsthand about local economic conditions and to get a sense of the issues and concerns facing businesses and residents.  Just two weeks ago I visited Rochester and Buffalo. One thing I tend to focus on in my meetings, more generally, is what hurdles businesses and households are facing that might be holding back growth.  When we identify issues of concern, we factor those in to our decision-making and explore what we can do proactively to address these issues.  This might include providing data and information that can assist others in tackling the underlying problems, or in convening stakeholders to discuss potential solutions and the best way forward.\n\nRecently, two themes have emerged from our community visits that warrant special attention.  The first is in the arena of workforce development.  Employers often have difficulty finding potential employees with the specific skills they need, and workers often lack the specific skills employers are looking for.  Workforce development aims to bridge this gap.  Good jobs increasingly require higher levels of skill and education, and a skilled workforce that is matched to the needs of employers is also necessary for an economy to grow and prosper.  That is why I believe workforce development is so important for the long-term health of the economy.\n\nOur outreach group regularly engages with community leaders to help them take action to address workforce development needs and skill gaps.  In fact, in Rochester, our team is partnering with several educational and community organizations to promote local workforce development programs.  As in many places around the region, employers in Rochester are having difficulty finding workers to fill a number of middle-skill jobs, like nurses, automotive technicians and computer-controlled machine operators.  Out of this partnership, we launched a pilot project challenging college students to create a short video profiling middle-skill jobs that are available in the area in order to drum up interest in opportunities many people may not even know exist.\n\nAccess to credit for small businesses is another important issue we've focused on in recent years.  Our outreach group conducts a bi-annual poll of small businesses in our region to better understand their credit needs and access to credit.  The results consistently show that gaining access to credit is one of the top growth challenges for small businesses.  In my visits across the District, I have heard small business owners voice similar concerns.\n\nIn response, we've helped bring small businesses together with lenders to help smooth access to credit.  Over the past year we have conducted ten access-to-credit events—workshops, clinics and conferences—for companies interested in learning about traditional and alternative sources of financing.  We partnered with local and national government agencies, small business development centers and local nonprofit organizations to hold these events throughout the District.\n\nOne such workshop was held recently in Queens.  The Queens Economic Development Corporation and the Queens Chamber of Commerce, with support from the New York Fed's Asian Professional Network Alliance, co-sponsored a resource clinic for small businesses.  The clinic offered an opportunity for attendees to receive one-on-one advice from several non-profit organizations on a wide range of topics, including which types of financing are most appropriate for their needs, what lenders look for in potential borrowers, alternatives to traditional bank loans and tips on improving their chances for success.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the activities that reflect the Bank's commitment to the region. Let me turn now to the subject matter of today's briefing: the economic outlook for the regional economy.\n\nThere is a lot of good news to share.  Many parts of the region have bounced back quite well from the Great Recession, and now have more jobs than before the downturn.  New York City really stands out in this regard.  While the Great Recession was the deepest and longest recession in modern history for the nation as a whole, New York City bucked that trend to a surprising degree, and did it with little help from Wall Street.  As we will discuss later in the briefing, one of New York City's strongest sectors has been technology.  In this recovery, employment in the city's tech sector has added nearly 50,000 jobs, many of which pay well.  The growth of the so-called Silicon Alley has not only helped the city bounce back from the recession, but, I believe, is a key for the city moving forward.  When I visited Brooklyn late last year, I saw firsthand how technology is spurring economic activity, directly and indirectly.   For example, Etsy, the popular e-commerce website, which in many ways resembles a retail company, relies on technology to underpin its business model.\n\nBut it's not just New York City that is growing nicely.  Employment levels on Long Island and in parts of upstate New York—most notably the Albany, Buffalo and Rochester metro areas—have also climbed and are at or near record highs.  During my recent trip to upstate New York, I saw first-hand some of the positive developments in Rochester and Buffalo.  After undergoing a prolonged period of economic transformation and reinvention, Rochester's economy is now more diverse and dynamic than ever before.  Meanwhile, the growth in Buffalo was striking.  The numbers show a dramatic uptick in construction employment, and the visual evidence of development was widespread.  I was especially impressed with the downtown and waterfront areas, as well as the new SolarCity factory—all of which looked dramatically different than when I visited the area less than two years ago.  Both of these places are well positioned for future success.\n\nOn the other hand, the employment recovery has been slow to take hold in both Northern New Jersey and the Lower Hudson Valley, where jobs are still not back to their pre-recession peak despite employment growing steadily.  For Northern New Jersey, this lag is due, in part, to a stall in the growth of jobs in professional and business services.  But the education and health sectors continue to add jobs, and construction employment is seeing a rebound.   I also saw a number of bright spots on my visit to the area a few months ago.  One was Jersey City, which is leveraging its proximity to New York City to attract residents and jobs.  Another was Newark, where I saw signs of downtown development, including Teacher's Village, a mixed-use community of teachers with new schools, housing and retail businesses.\n\nBut pockets of weakness remain.  For example, in upstate New York, Binghamton has had no meaningful rebound in employment.  Although the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico remain in a deep economic slump, employment appears to have steadied in both places in recent months.  However, Puerto Rico's weak economy coupled with a fiscal crisis means its economic outlook remains uncertain as it struggles to address its unique set of problems.\n\nNow, I'd like to turn things over to one of our regional economists, Jim Orr, who will provide a more detailed presentation of economic conditions across our region.",

    "text": "Thank you for having me here to speak today.  It is a real pleasure to have this  opportunity to discuss the challenges ahead in making our banking and financial  system more resilient and robust. We have learned a great deal  over the past two years about our financial system and its vulnerabilities.  The challenge ahead is to put these lessons  to good use. Regulators and market participants failed to fully  appreciate the degree to which the various aspects of our financial system are  interconnected, and to foresee what those tight linkages would mean for market  function when even one reasonably large institution—let alone many—became  distressed. We also did not fully appreciate  the strength   of the amplifying mechanisms that were built into our financial system; the  consequence of which was to exacerbate the  boom on the way up and worsen the bust  on the way down. Contributing  to these pro-cyclical dynamics were inadequate incentives for firms to curb their  risk-taking and to more effectively manage the risks they did face.  The inadequate level of transparency and  disclosure, particularly in the market for structured products,  were also important in making  the financial system more fragile and vulnerable to crisis   and in increasing  the degree of uncertainty and contagion  once the crisis was underway.  Only by fully understanding these shortcomings  can we construct solutions that will strengthen our financial system and make  it more robust. The initiatives underway to strengthen our financial system span  a wide range of supervisory and regulatory policy areas, including ongoing efforts  to improve standards for both the capital and liquidity held by financial  institutions, efforts to improve the risk management practices at financial  institutions  and efforts to  strengthen the resiliency of market infrastructures.  Today, I am going to focus mainly on the need  to improve the capital standards for large,  systemically important financial institutions. For initiatives in this area to be effective, we need to  make progress on three distinct, but related fronts:\n\nAs always, my remarks reflect my own views and opinions and  not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal  Reserve System. Interconnectedness This financial crisis has exposed how important the  interconnections are among the banking system, capital markets, and payment and  settlement systems.   For example, the recent disruption in the  functioning of the securitization markets caused by the poor performance of  highly-rated debt securities, led to significant problems for major financial  institutions.  Banks had to take assets  back on their books; backstop lines of credit were triggered; and banks could  no longer securitize loans, increasing the pressure on their balance sheets. This reduced credit  availability, which increased the downward pressure on economic activity, which  caused asset values to decline further, increasing the degree of stress in the  financial system. This  interconnectedness implies  that regulation and risk management practices that  focus only on  individual  parts  of the system will inevitably fail to address  important vulnerabilities elsewhere.  Thus,  we  have to make widespread changes in how we approach supervision and regulation,  particularly in the context of our most systemically important financial institutions. First, although supervision cannot lose its vertical  perspective, looking firm by firm or region by region, it also must  place more emphasis than before on gaining a horizontal perspective—looking  broadly across banks, securities firms and other  types of  financial institutions, and across markets and geographies. Second, the supervision of our financial institutions and the  regulation of markets need to be risk focused, coordinated and  multi-disciplinary.  In thinking about  the best way to introduce these practices into our system, we should not kid  ourselves about how difficult this will be to execute.  It will take the right people, with the right  skill sets, operating in a system with the right culture, tools and legal  framework. The governance process surrounding   systemic  risk regulation will have to be extremely flexible and dynamic, able to  identify important vulnerabilities as they emerge and able to act on those  concerns in a timely manner. System Dynamics Over the course of this crisis, it has become evident that our  system has some powerful reinforcing mechanisms built into it.  This suggests that one important focus of  regulation should be on how to change the system in order to  eliminate or at least mitigate those destructive  dynamics.   Let me give you a few examples. In  times of  stress,  banks may have  incentives to continue to pay dividends to show they are strong even when they  are not.  This  behavior depletes  the  bank’s capital and makes the bank  weaker.  To correct this shortcoming in our system, we  should craft policies that  either incent  or  require weak  and vulnerable firms to cut dividends quickly in order to conserve capital.  This would introduce a dampening mechanism  into our system. Another example of a reinforcing mechanism is a situation in  which firms have incentives to structure activities to minimize regulatory  capital or other requirements without transferring risk.  Creation of off-balance sheet funding  vehicles, structured products and complex corporate structures to minimize  regulatory requirements  and tax obligations   reduces transparency, introduces new risks and limits the  effectiveness of resolution regimes. Other examples of reinforcing mechanisms in our system are:\n\nAlthough some of these practices might  appear sensible from the narrow perspective of an individual firm or market, this  crisis has shown us that when all firms or market participants simultaneously  take an action that appears to be in their immediate, narrow interest, the  collective impact on the system as a whole can be disastrous. We  need to find ways to weaken or eliminate these reinforcing mechanisms and we  need to introduce new dampening mechanisms into the financial system. Incentives Some of the pro-cyclical dynamics embedded in our financial system  occur because market participants  do not always have the  incentive to behave in ways that will be good for the system as a whole.  This occurs, in part, because market  participants often do not  have to  bear the full costs of their actions.  For  example, the incentive to take on more risk without regard for the broader implications  of those actions arises from a number of factors, including  poorly constructed compensation schemes, ineffective risk management   and gaps in regulatory oversight and risk capture. One problem evident during the crisis has been the reluctance  of banking organizations to raise sufficient capital to be able to credibly  have the resources to withstand particularly adverse  economic  conditions.  This reluctance  stemmed, in part, from concerns about what a capital raise would signal about  the firm’s strength, but it also stemmed from an unwillingness to unnecessarily  dilute shareholders.  The reluctance led  to more uncertainty about the adequacy of banks’ capital positions, which, in  turn increased concerns about counterparty credit risk.  These worries led to a further deterioration  in market liquidity.  These dynamics  tightened financial market and credit conditions, increasing the downward  pressure on economic activity and  on the financial  system. The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) exercise  that we undertook in the United States leaned against this.  By forcing all  of the banks that participated in the SCAP to  have sufficient capital to help them withstand a stress environment, this process  improved confidence  and increased the willingness of banks to  engage with each other.  It also made it  easier for the banks to be able to tap the capital markets.  The SCAP exercise made a bad state of the  world less likely, helping to create a virtuous circle rather than a vicious  one. The SCAP exercise was developed and conducted in response to  the crisis and a specific need.  Now, we  need to figure out how to conduct these types of exercises on a systematic  basis.  Such exercises may even need to  be hardwired into the supervisory oversight of the financial system.\n\nTransparency In  some critical segments of our  financial markets, both before  and during the crisis, limited or ineffective disclosure undermined market  discipline and this contributed to the accumulation of risk. In  the years leading up to the crisis, the lack of transparency contributed to increased  risk and leverage in off-balance sheet vehicles, structured credit products and  in over-the-counter securities such as asset-backed securities (ABS),  commercial  mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), residential  mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and collateralized  debt obligations (CDOs) and their associated derivatives.  Once the crisis was underway, the opacity of  many of these vehicles, structures and securities contributed to the concerns  about counterparty credit risk.  This  uncertainty exacerbated the erosion in market liquidity conditions and further  intensified the crisis. This lack of transparency was present in a number of  different places:\n\nRegulatory Reform These four strands—understanding interconnectedness,  mitigating  pro-cyclical system dynamics, improving  incentives   and  increasing transparency—should be  critical areas of focus in our efforts to enhance the resiliency of the banking  and financial system. We will do this through several  channels, including international regulatory reform,  enhanced  capital requirements, the introduction of common liquidity standards and clear expectations  for compensation practices.  Today I am  going to spend some time talking about how we might take account of these  strands to ensure that our regulatory capital regime helps to facilitate a more  robust and stable financial system. In my view, the regulatory  capital framework would benefit from four changes:",

    "text": "Good morning.  It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to  speak at this year’s gathering of the National Retail Federation.  Retail activity plays a key role in the U.S. economy,  with consumption comprising about two-thirds of total gross domestic product.  As such, understanding what is happening in  your sector is critical in assessing the economic outlook—and, with that, the  outlook for employment, inflation and interest rates.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own  views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the  Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThis morning, I  will be focusing on retail spending—an important element of household consumption.  But, I will do so in a way that’s perhaps somewhat  different from the usual approach, focusing in particular on the connections between  housing and retail sales.  I will argue  that there have been some dramatic changes that have taken place in the way  that households finance their consumption.  I believe—and   hope to convince you—that changes in the housing and mortgage markets  have affected the willingness and ability of households to borrow, and that this,  in turn, has had important consequences for the dynamics of consumption over  the last decade.  It is an important  reason why the economic recovery and expansion have been weaker than we would  like, despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve to stimulate economic  activity.  It also matters as we look  forward.  The good news is that, while  the current expansion is quite old in chronological terms, it is still  relatively young in terms of the health of household finances.  Later in my remarks, I will talk a bit about  the outlook for consumer spending in 2017 and beyond.\n\nIt’s worth  starting off with some background in order to develop the linkage between  housing wealth and retail spending.  Household  incomes tend to increase as individuals grow older and become more skilled in  their work and better matched to their employers.  This tends to continue until they approach retirement  age.  This means that incomes are much  higher later in life than when people first enter the workforce.  Ideally, households would like to be able to even  out their consumption based on their lifetime incomes, raising consumption in  their early adulthood years.  In general,  this would mean that young people would consume a relatively high share of  their incomes, while older people would save more. Indeed, young people might even wish to borrow  against some of their future income so that they can enjoy some of those  benefits earlier in their lifetimes.\n\nHowever, there are  limits on the ability to shift consumption to earlier in life through  borrowing.  One problem is that lenders  don’t have a reliable way to compel repayment of such debts.  Consequently, the young may not have access to  the credit they need to even out consumption to the extent they would like.  A pledge of assets—collateral—can help to solve  this problem, since it can be claimed by the lender in the event of a loan  default.\n\nFor most  households, the main form of wealth is human capital—the value of the wages  that the household members can earn over the course of their lifetimes.  But human capital cannot always be credibly  pledged as collateral.  For funding of educational investments,  government intervention in the form of the federally-guaranteed student loan  program helps address this problem.  While  private student loans exist, they typically require a co-signer with a strong  credit record.  Moreover, these borrowing  sources are broadly restricted to education-related spending only.\n\nThe second most  important asset on the balance sheet of many households is housing equity.  So, in addition to being a source of shelter,  housing can be a major form of collateral for borrowing for many households.  In fact, for those households that have  collateral available to secure loans, housing equity is by far the most  important form of collateral.\n\nWhat this tells us  is that the performance of the housing and mortgage markets are important to the  retail business.  When home prices are rising  and housing equity can easily be converted into cash, we can expect to see  relatively high levels of consumption, all else equal.  Conversely, when home prices are flat or  declining, or mortgage credit is tight, this will put a damper on retail  spending.  Events of the last decade have  driven this point home in a very clear way.\n\nIt is well known  that beginning in the mid-1990s and intensifying in the early 2000s, there was a  massive U.S. housing boom that dramatically increased the value of residential  real estate in the United States.  Over  the period from 1995 to 2006, the aggregate value of real estate owned by  households and nonprofits nearly tripled, rising from $8.6 trillion to nearly  $25 trillion.\n\nA remarkable, yet  not widely-known, fact about this boom period is that while home values were rising  very quickly, borrowing was growing almost exactly as fast.  Rather than saving the extra wealth that was  being generated by the housing boom, households were diverting a large share of  it to other purposes.  Indeed, the  fraction of every additional dollar of households’ housing wealth that was  consumed seems to have been higher than that for financial wealth—such as  investments in equities and bonds—suggesting that they viewed the increase in  home prices as permanent.\n\nIn order to be  able to assess the evolution of household finances more precisely, we worked  with Equifax—a major credit bureau—to create a new database that tracks the  credit files of a random sample of households over time.  From this consumer credit panel data, we  conclude that between 2004 and 2006, households were increasing their cash flow  by over $200 billion a year by borrowing against their housing equity  collateral.  They supplemented that with  another $185 billion through non-mortgage borrowing.  So, at the height of the boom, annual consumption  was being supplemented by around $400 billion in cash flow from debt, much of  it collateralized by housing.\n\nAs we now know, homeowners  were mistaken in viewing the home price increases during the boom as permanent.   Things turned quickly as housing supply  increased, home prices softened and mortgage underwriting standards tightened  sharply as credit losses on residential mortgage lending climbed.  The rise and fall of mortgage securitization  activity marked by tranching mortgage cash flows into collateralized debt  obligations (CDOs) exacerbated the downturn.   Home values began to fall in mid-2006.  By 2008, we saw a massive reversal in the way  people used their housing equity to finance consumption.  People went from borrowing hundreds of  billions of dollars per year and increasing their mortgage debt, to paying back  hundreds of billions dollars and reducing their mortgage debt.  Households deleveraged even apart from the  decline in household debt associated with the charge-offs from foreclosures.  Instead of $400 billion in net cash flow from increased  borrowing, this net cash flow sharply reversed to negative $150 billion by 2010,  with increased residential mortgage debt pay-down being the main source.  This rapid swing—a reduction of more than $500  billion on an annual basis—in the resources available for household consumption  was associated with a sharp and prolonged slump in personal consumption  expenditures during the Great Recession.  Typically, consumption growth slows but  remains positive during a recession.  In  contrast, consumption actually contracted by over $300 billion during the Great  Recession.\n\nBetween 2009 and  2012, households continued paying down debt of all kinds—with the exception of  student loans, which behave differently from most other forms of consumer  borrowing.  Ultimately, housing prices  stabilized and began to increase again in 2012.\n\nHowever, since  that turning point in home prices over five years ago, something surprising has  happened.  Nationally, home values have  risen over 40 percent since 2012, and are now very close to their pre-crisis  levels on average—just 4 percent below their all-time peak reached in early  2006.  Most other kinds of debt—first auto,  and now, credit card debt—have joined student debt by starting to rise again,  resuming their traditional role in financing consumption.  The surprising development is that housing  debt has stayed virtually flat.  The previous  behavior of using housing debt to finance other kinds of consumption seems to  have completely disappeared.  Instead,  people are apparently leaving the wealth generated by rising home prices “locked  up” in their homes.\n\nThe implications  of this development have been quite significant for the retail sector.  As I noted earlier, housing debt during the  boom was rising at essentially the same pace as home values, leaving household leverage  ratios more or less constant.  If housing  debt had risen apace with home prices since 2012—rather than staying flat as it  has—then we would once again be seeing housing debt producing cash flows  available for consumption of about $200 billion a year.  Instead, households continue to divert about  $200 billion annually to paying down their housing debt.  That’s a difference of roughly $400 billion  per year, or about 3 percent of total consumption.  Relative to historical patterns the household  saving rate currently seems quite high, given the ratio of household net worth  to disposable income.\n\nSo, why has  household behavior with respect to housing debt apparently changed so much?  As always, the data reflect the result of the  interaction between the demand and supply sides of the credit market.  One obvious demand-side candidate is that consumers  may have become more cautious about housing’s value as a financial investment,  or its value as collateral for borrowing to finance consumption.  That is, households may have come to view  housing wealth as more similar to financial wealth in that changes can be  transitory rather than permanent.  Consequently,  it may be viewed as prudent not to spend too much out of increases in these  sources of wealth.  Additionally, the  deep job losses that occurred during the Great Recession may have also impressed  on households the need for precautionary savings against adverse income shocks.\n\nIn fact, the  lessons from the housing boom and bust may have been even more traumatic.  There are many versions of this story, and most  have a word like “scarring” in them.  Perhaps  some potential homeowners, having seen the wild gyrations in home prices during  the 2000s, have soured on homeownership altogether.  This would result in a reduced homeownership  rate due to a loss of confidence in housing as a good financial investment.  Data indicate that homeownership has declined,  especially among younger workers.  However,  households in our Survey of Consumer  Expectations continue to report that they believe that housing is a sound  financial investment.  So, the  explanation for our declining homeownership rate doesn’t appear to be that  homeownership has lost its luster as an investment.  And, reduced homeownership doesn’t explain  why people who still own homes have become less likely to tap their available  equity to finance consumption.\n\nOther households may  have been scarred by the experience of seeing their neighbors who borrowed heavily  during the boom lose their homes and have their credit ratings badly damaged. Observing  these consequences may dissuade current homeowners from making themselves  vulnerable to foreclosure by borrowing against rising home values.  This would lead to an increase in a  household’s precautionary demand for savings in the form of higher housing  equity.  This increased equity cushion  would guard against the risk that the household could find itself in a negative  equity position in the event of a future decline in home prices.  With an equity cushion, even if the household  were to experience a job loss during a future housing downturn, they would be  able to sell their home, pay off the mortgage and avoid any damage to their  credit.\n\nHomeowners’ desire  to finance consumption by borrowing against housing equity might also be  diminished by their desire to retain their ability to move easily.  The decline in home prices during the bust  eliminated many households’ home equity, which is traditionally the source of  down payments for households that wish to move and remain homeowners.  This mobility might be associated with a change  of labor markets or an upgrade of your home or residential location.  It is possible that households have saved their  newly recovered equity in order to rebuild the capacity to make future down payments  and therefore restore this option to move.  It is certainly the case that mobility has  declined since the housing bust, a fact consistent with this hypothesis.\n\nMany homeowners also  took advantage of the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy stance to  refinance into very low fixed-rate mortgages.  As mortgage rates rise, there is a higher financial  cost to extracting housing equity through a cash-out refinancing.  The pace of cash-out refinancing has indeed  been very low even as housing equity has risen, consistent with this  hypothesis.  But, owners have other ways  of tapping equity, like taking out a second mortgage or a home equity line of credit  (HELOC).  Interestingly, these forms of housing  debt have been paid down even more aggressively than first mortgages.  So, the fluctuation in the level of mortgage rates  also does not explain the change in household behavior. A final factor that  may be reducing the demand for home equity extraction is a change in the  distribution of housing equity in the population.  Even though aggregate home equity is back to  pre-crisis levels, the data indicate that the growth in equity since 2012 has  gone disproportionately to older, wealthier households.  Presumably, these households have less demand  for credit to fund their consumption plans.  In contrast, those who would like to convert  housing wealth into retail purchases have not yet seen their housing equity  restored to its earlier levels—reflecting, in part, slower rates of mortgage  balance paydown.  In addition, younger  and less credit-worthy households also experienced higher relative declines in  homeownership rates. While some of  these demand-side factors seem to be playing a role in reducing home equity  extraction, there is undoubtedly a strong supply-side effect in operation as  well.  Our consumer credit data indicate  that lenders’ adoption of minimum credit scores for mortgage lending and their  considerably more rigorous underwriting standards for HELOCs have played a very  important role in limiting consumers’ ability to convert home equity into new  consumption.  The drivers of this change  in lender behavior are complex, but are likely to include a combination of more  regulation and stress testing of banks’ portfolios, more conservative practices  by the government sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—which tend  to dictate underwriting practices for a large part of the market—and banks’ own  experience from the crisis period, when so many lenders faced extreme stress  and residential real estate seemed to be the main culprit. The fact that  housing prices declined so much and that the foreclosure process was so often drawn  out may also have caused lenders to reassess how much to rely on the housing  collateral as security for their loans.  In  response, lenders may have shifted their underwriting to put more weight on the  creditworthiness of the borrower rather than relying mainly on the value of the  collateral.  This is consistent with the  fact that mortgage credit is now much harder to get for lower credit-rated  borrowers than during the housing boom. So, what’s next? When  and to what extent will households again start tapping home equity to fund  their consumption?  Answers to these  questions will determine the degree to which housing equity growth will add to  income growth as a fundamental driver of consumption.  We do not want to repeat the experience from  the housing boom, but there are prudent ways for households to access their  housing equity. It is hard to  predict when the recent trends might change, given that some milestones have  passed that could have reignited lenders’ and borrowers’ appetite for home  lending.  First, home prices stopped  falling in 2010, which could have been taken as a signal that a complete  collapse was not imminent and that the worst was behind us, yet mortgage  borrowers continued to divert cash to paying down their debts.  Second, home prices—and home equity—resumed their  growth in 2012, indicating that the market was recovering.  Yet, far from extracting this equity,  borrowers continued to pay down their mortgages thereby reinforcing the effect  of the home price increases in terms of rebuilding housing equity.  Aggregate home prices and home equity have almost  reached their previous peaks. Time will tell if  there is a renewed appetite, on both lenders’ and borrowers’ parts, to convert  housing wealth into consumption.  Perhaps,  we will soon see a recovery in cash-out refinancing and in HELOC borrowing as a  means for households to expand their consumption.  In this case, the household saving rate will  begin to decline.  Or, we may need to  wait longer for households to feel confident enough to extract some of their  home equity, and for lenders to decide that expanding such lending is safe  enough for their balance sheets.  Whatever  the timing, a return to a reasonable pattern of home equity extraction would be  a positive development for retailers, and would provide a boost to aggregate  growth.  In the meantime, consumption  growth will largely be determined by income growth, the trajectory of wages and  the strength of the labor market. The U.S. expansion  is now in its eighth year.  By historical  standards, it is long in the tooth.   Despite this, I am optimistic that the economic expansion will continue  over the next few years.  First, it is  important to note that economic expansions don’t simply die of old age.  Usually, they end either because inflation  climbs and the Federal Reserve responds by shifting to a much tighter stance  for monetary policy, or because the economy gets hit with a large unanticipated  shock that the Fed and the fiscal authorities cannot respond to quickly enough,  or with sufficient force, to prevent an economic downturn.  While economic shocks are, by their very  nature, difficult to forecast, the risk that the Fed will snuff out the  expansion anytime soon seems quite low because inflation is simply not a  problem.  Not only are underlying  inflation trends very subdued—for example, the core personal consumption  expenditures deflator has risen at only a 1. 7 percent annual rate over the  past year—but the economy is not growing much above its sustainable long-term  pace.  Thus, while pressures on labor  resources have been increasing, but quite slowly.  Finally, the recent strengthening of the dollar  will put downward pressure on import prices and limit the ability of domestic  producers to raise their prices. Second, the  household sector’s financial condition is in unusually good shape for this  point in the economic cycle.  Household  indebtedness is relatively low, debt service burdens relative to household  income have fallen to levels not seen since at least the early 1980s.  Moreover, household incomes are rising at a  moderate pace, supported by continued job gains and some modest strengthening  of wage compensation trends.  If  households and lenders again become comfortable with financing consumption with  debt in addition to income, this will provide additional support to household  spending and to the current economic expansion. The challenges in  the retail space over the near term, therefore, are not likely to be a shortfall  of aggregate demand from households.   Instead, it seems to me the challenges lie more in how to satisfy  households’ changing demands for goods and services, and the medium through  which these demands are satisfied—whether it be brick and mortar or  online.   Also, there is the important issue of how to retain brand loyalty in a  world where information is ubiquitous and always near at hand, and it is easy  to shift purchases among participants in the retail marketplace. Thank you for your kind  attention. 1 Andrew Haughwout, Joseph Tracy and Wilbert van der Klaauw assisted in preparing  these remarks.\n\nA final factor that  may be reducing the demand for home equity extraction is a change in the  distribution of housing equity in the population.  Even though aggregate home equity is back to  pre-crisis levels, the data indicate that the growth in equity since 2012 has  gone disproportionately to older, wealthier households.  Presumably, these households have less demand  for credit to fund their consumption plans.  In contrast, those who would like to convert  housing wealth into retail purchases have not yet seen their housing equity  restored to its earlier levels—reflecting, in part, slower rates of mortgage  balance paydown.  In addition, younger  and less credit-worthy households also experienced higher relative declines in  homeownership rates.\n\nWhile some of  these demand-side factors seem to be playing a role in reducing home equity  extraction, there is undoubtedly a strong supply-side effect in operation as  well.  Our consumer credit data indicate  that lenders’ adoption of minimum credit scores for mortgage lending and their  considerably more rigorous underwriting standards for HELOCs have played a very  important role in limiting consumers’ ability to convert home equity into new  consumption.  The drivers of this change  in lender behavior are complex, but are likely to include a combination of more  regulation and stress testing of banks’ portfolios, more conservative practices  by the government sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—which tend  to dictate underwriting practices for a large part of the market—and banks’ own  experience from the crisis period, when so many lenders faced extreme stress  and residential real estate seemed to be the main culprit.\n\nThe fact that  housing prices declined so much and that the foreclosure process was so often drawn  out may also have caused lenders to reassess how much to rely on the housing  collateral as security for their loans.  In  response, lenders may have shifted their underwriting to put more weight on the  creditworthiness of the borrower rather than relying mainly on the value of the  collateral.  This is consistent with the  fact that mortgage credit is now much harder to get for lower credit-rated  borrowers than during the housing boom.\n\nSo, what’s next? When  and to what extent will households again start tapping home equity to fund  their consumption?  Answers to these  questions will determine the degree to which housing equity growth will add to  income growth as a fundamental driver of consumption.  We do not want to repeat the experience from  the housing boom, but there are prudent ways for households to access their  housing equity.\n\nIt is hard to  predict when the recent trends might change, given that some milestones have  passed that could have reignited lenders’ and borrowers’ appetite for home  lending.  First, home prices stopped  falling in 2010, which could have been taken as a signal that a complete  collapse was not imminent and that the worst was behind us, yet mortgage  borrowers continued to divert cash to paying down their debts.  Second, home prices—and home equity—resumed their  growth in 2012, indicating that the market was recovering.  Yet, far from extracting this equity,  borrowers continued to pay down their mortgages thereby reinforcing the effect  of the home price increases in terms of rebuilding housing equity.  Aggregate home prices and home equity have almost  reached their previous peaks.\n\nTime will tell if  there is a renewed appetite, on both lenders’ and borrowers’ parts, to convert  housing wealth into consumption.  Perhaps,  we will soon see a recovery in cash-out refinancing and in HELOC borrowing as a  means for households to expand their consumption.  In this case, the household saving rate will  begin to decline.  Or, we may need to  wait longer for households to feel confident enough to extract some of their  home equity, and for lenders to decide that expanding such lending is safe  enough for their balance sheets.  Whatever  the timing, a return to a reasonable pattern of home equity extraction would be  a positive development for retailers, and would provide a boost to aggregate  growth.  In the meantime, consumption  growth will largely be determined by income growth, the trajectory of wages and  the strength of the labor market.\n\nThe U.S. expansion  is now in its eighth year.  By historical  standards, it is long in the tooth.   Despite this, I am optimistic that the economic expansion will continue  over the next few years.  First, it is  important to note that economic expansions don’t simply die of old age.  Usually, they end either because inflation  climbs and the Federal Reserve responds by shifting to a much tighter stance  for monetary policy, or because the economy gets hit with a large unanticipated  shock that the Fed and the fiscal authorities cannot respond to quickly enough,  or with sufficient force, to prevent an economic downturn.  While economic shocks are, by their very  nature, difficult to forecast, the risk that the Fed will snuff out the  expansion anytime soon seems quite low because inflation is simply not a  problem.  Not only are underlying  inflation trends very subdued—for example, the core personal consumption  expenditures deflator has risen at only a 1. 7 percent annual rate over the  past year—but the economy is not growing much above its sustainable long-term  pace.  Thus, while pressures on labor  resources have been increasing, but quite slowly.  Finally, the recent strengthening of the dollar  will put downward pressure on import prices and limit the ability of domestic  producers to raise their prices.\n\nSecond, the  household sector’s financial condition is in unusually good shape for this  point in the economic cycle.  Household  indebtedness is relatively low, debt service burdens relative to household  income have fallen to levels not seen since at least the early 1980s.  Moreover, household incomes are rising at a  moderate pace, supported by continued job gains and some modest strengthening  of wage compensation trends.  If  households and lenders again become comfortable with financing consumption with  debt in addition to income, this will provide additional support to household  spending and to the current economic expansion.\n\nThe challenges in  the retail space over the near term, therefore, are not likely to be a shortfall  of aggregate demand from households.   Instead, it seems to me the challenges lie more in how to satisfy  households’ changing demands for goods and services, and the medium through  which these demands are satisfied—whether it be brick and mortar or  online.   Also, there is the important issue of how to retain brand loyalty in a  world where information is ubiquitous and always near at hand, and it is easy  to shift purchases among participants in the retail marketplace.\n\nThank you for your kind  attention.\n\n1 Andrew Haughwout, Joseph Tracy and Wilbert van der Klaauw assisted in preparing  these remarks.",

    "text": "Thanks,  Ashish, and thanks to the U.S.-India Business Council, the Confederation of  Indian Industry, and the Bombay Stock Exchange for organizing this event.  As  always, what I have to say reflects my views and not necessarily those of the  Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nIt  is a pleasure to have the opportunity today to talk about the issue of  globalization.  Although the debate about  the benefits and challenges of globalization is not new, it has recently come  into sharper focus.  This debate is  important to all of us, and I think it is particularly relevant to India given  its growing role in the global economy.\n\nGlobalization  means different things to different people.   In my remarks today, I will focus on the role of globalization as a  force for international economic integration and economic development.  I will highlight three themes:\n\nFirst,  the important role that trade plays in promoting higher standards of living  globally.\n\nSecond,  how changes in trade can create challenges for industries that become less  competitive.  We have not adequately  considered and remedied the very large costs this can impose on certain communities  and households.\n\nThird,  the answer to those challenges is not greater protectionism.  Instead, we need to provide greater support  to displaced workers so they can obtain the skills needed to find new well-paying  jobs.  We need to do better in preparing  workers to deal with the challenges of globalization and technological change.\n\nThese  issues are important to me as a central banker, as they affect the long-term  health and productivity of the economy, and the economic opportunities  available to our people.\n\nThe  debate around globalization, particularly in advanced economies, reflects a  range of factors.  Undoubtedly, the  global financial crisis and subsequent slow recovery have been significant.  But, just as important have been longer-term  trends, such as growing income inequality, the loss of middle-income jobs, and  the rise of large emerging market economies such as China and India.\n\nAlthough  the debate about globalization is not new, I believe we are at a particularly  important juncture.  If support for  liberalized trade and an integrated global economy were to suffer a significant  setback, the consequence could be slower economic growth and lower living  standards around the world.\n\nWhile  considerable effort has gone into liberalizing trade and developing the existing  set of trade agreements, that does not mean they cannot be improved upon.  I have no doubt some trade agreements could be  enhanced or updated.  Some may not  adequately address recent changes in the global economy—such as the rise of  digital trade—and may need to be refreshed.  And, important trade barriers still remain and  should be addressed.  In particular, from  a U.S. perspective, the access of U.S. firms to some foreign markets and the  protection of intellectual property rights are issues that deserve close  attention.  But, in addressing these  issues, we should take care to preserve the vital benefits of trade to higher  standards of living in both advanced and emerging market economies.  Our focus should be on further strengthening  an open trade regime, and, as appropriate, amending and improving these  agreements.\n\nThe  Pace of Globalization\n\nTo  begin, let me briefly describe the pace of globalization as a reminder of what  is at stake.  Global economic integration  has increased dramatically in recent decades.   Trade, for example, has grown from nearly 40 percent of global GDP in  1990 to 57 percent in 2015.  Over the  same period, the stock of foreign direct investment has increased from roughly  10 percent of global GDP to 34 percent.  Ultimately,  economies have become more integrated and interdependent. 2\n\nThis  rapid growth in trade reflects falling trade barriers, declining transport  costs, and improved information and communication technology.  These trends have enabled the development of  complex global supply chains that allow companies to manage their production more  efficiently.\n\nEmerging  market economies now make up a much larger share of global trade, the global economy  and global growth.  As an illustration,  emerging market economies have accounted for 70 percent of global output growth  since the crisis—double their share from two decades ago. 3 This growth has provided much-needed support  to world economic activity, as advanced economies have recovered slowly from  the crisis.\n\nRising  economic integration is also very evident when we examine the trade  relationship between India and the United States.  Bilateral trade flows have risen tenfold,  from $11 billion in 1995 to almost $110 billion in 2015.  In particular, half of U.S. imports of  computer services are now sourced from India.   In 2015, the stock of bilateral foreign direct investment in both  countries was $37 billion, up from $4 billion in 2002. 4 The potential for further increases has been  reinforced by the liberalization measures India announced last year to  encourage greater foreign direct investment.\n\nBenefits  of Open Trade\n\nIncreased  trade, through its longer-term impact on productivity, has been a key  contributor to global growth and prosperity since the Second World War.  Openness to trade brings many benefits to the  supply side of the economy.  These  include:\n\nCollectively,  these forces lead to a more efficient allocation of a country’s scarce  resources—one that is more closely aligned to its international comparative  advantage.\n\nAs  a consequence, consumers can benefit from lower prices, higher real incomes,  and greater variety and quality of goods and services.  Increased openness may also reduce wasteful  rent-seeking behavior on the part of protected industries and the related costs  of corruption.\n\nThese  benefits from open trade are very evident in India.  Academic research has found substantial gains  for India following its dramatic trade reforms in the 1990s, which benefited consumers via  lower prices and firms via higher markups.   These higher profit margins spurred innovation and provided funds for  the development of new products. Looking ahead, the upcoming implementation of  the goods and services tax in India—which will create a common market  internally—is expected to provide many of the same benefits as trade  liberalization does internationally.\n\nOpenness  to trade has certainly played a large role in the economic ascent of Asia.  Following the rise of Japan, Korea, Taiwan  and others, fast growth in China and India has lifted hundreds of millions of  people out of extreme poverty—an unprecedented feat in human history.  The benefits of economic integration and  other reforms are exemplified in India’s higher growth rate since the  introduction of market reforms in 1991.   Growth has averaged 6.5 percent annually in the post-reform period,  compared to about 4 percent annually over the prior 40 years.  Indeed, India is the fastest-growing major  economy in the world today.  Reflecting  these gains, a number of emerging market countries have been strong supporters  of open trade, a sign of how much the world has changed in recent years.\n\nA  few examples can help to illustrate some of the benefits of globalization. India’s green revolution—which helped to  greatly increase its agricultural productivity and food security—was  facilitated by U.S. technology and scientists working with their Indian  counterparts.  Similarly, as is well  known, Indian engineers and entrepreneurs have played a key role in the  technology sector’s tremendous achievements in recent decades and now lead some  of America’s largest companies, including Google and Microsoft.  This success, in turn, has had important  benefits for India as well, including increased foreign investment flows and  employment opportunities that have helped develop a vibrant information  technology ecosystem.\n\nBut,  increased openness to trade is not a panacea in and of itself.  Actual benefits depend on a range of other  critical factors, including macroeconomic policy, the business and regulatory  environment, the legal regime, the quality of infrastructure, and the quality  of public services, including education.   While the gains from a liberalized trade regime are not guaranteed, the  alternative of trying to achieve a high standard of living by following a  policy of economic isolationism will fail.   Trade has played a key role in nearly all of the high-growth success  stories since  the middle of the last century.\n\nChallenges  of Open Trade\n\nIt  is important to recognize that while trade and international integration tend  to increase the overall economic pie, the distribution of the larger pie may be  very uneven.  In fact, slices for  individual groups may shrink.  Some  workers—particularly those in industries that are less able to compete and  whose skills have become less relevant—can be hurt and find it difficult to  adjust.  This often requires individuals  to change industries and to relocate to different regions.  So, while trade is almost always a win for a  country’s economy, not everyone within that economy will be a winner.  This is especially the case where there are  no policies to cushion the negative consequences of trade and to facilitate  adjustment.\n\nEffects  are also country- and industry-specific, and depend on initial endowments and  conditions.  Low-income workers in  emerging markets, for example, may find it more difficult to adapt given weaker  safety nets and less financial resources available to deal with adverse  economic shocks.  The bigger the  adjustment process, the more the gains from trade will tend to be eroded.\n\nWhile  the rise in the skill premium from trade liberalization has been well  established for both developed and developing countries, determining the  aggregate impact of trade on jobs has been more challenging.  To date, the evidence has been mixed.  We need further research in this area to  determine with more confidence a reasonable range of estimates for these  employment effects.  Although evidence on  the extent to which jobs have been lost due to global trade is inconclusive,  job losses that are attributed to trade tend to be viewed differently.  That is, they are seen as having been “lost  to foreigners” and are often viewed as a consequence of the policy decision to  liberalize trade in the first place.\n\nHaving  said that, the challenge of adjusting to open trade is a serious issue that has  not received the degree of attention it fully deserves.  This may partly reflect the fact that the  burden has been borne unequally and spread out over a long time period.  It also may reflect the fact that the winners  from trade have often tended to have a stronger voice than those who have been  the losers.\n\nResearch  has documented that the effects on individuals of job dislocation—including  those resulting from trade—can be significant and long lasting.  Older workers tend to suffer larger earnings  losses, and may face larger transition costs.   Displaced workers may not have the appropriate skills to find good jobs  in other areas of the economy, including in growing export sectors.  When the affected industry represents a large  share of the local economy, the damage is often magnified.  In this case, the burden is more widespread  because wages across the community are likely to be hit as well.  And, this doesn’t begin to capture the full  human toll—including the impact on workers who have lost confidence in the  future and the poorer health outcomes that occur because of increased  stress.  For too many individuals in the  United States, for instance, the American dream has been put at risk, with  parents increasingly pessimistic about whether their children will have the  opportunity to do better than they did.\n\nWe should find better ways to help communities that  are struggling because of the effects of free trade.  In the United States, we have historically  experienced a high degree of geographic labor mobility—much higher than in  other advanced economies.  The ability to  move in search of better opportunities, when possible, has helped to mitigate  some of the adverse effects of trade.   But, mobility has declined in the United States in recent years,  implying that the adjustment costs to trade may have increased.\n\nProtectionism  Is Not the Answer\n\nGiven  these costs of global integration and more liberalized trade, what is the best  path forward?  Protectionism can have a  siren-like appeal.  Viewed narrowly, it  may be potentially rewarding to particular segments of the economy in the short  term.  Viewed more broadly, it would  almost certainly be destructive to the economy overall in the long term.\n\nCountries  need to compete better, not compete less.   Trade barriers are a very expensive way to preserve jobs in less  competitive or declining industries.  They blunt opportunities in export industries  and they reduce the affordability of goods and services to households.  Indeed, such measures often backfire,  resulting in harm to workers and diminished growth.\n\nA  better course is to learn from our experience.   From a U.S. standpoint, we should work to reduce remaining foreign trade  restrictions that impair our ability to capitalize on our comparative  advantages.  For example, market access  restrictions can mean that certain U.S. industries cannot realize their full potential.  Similarly, weaknesses in the protection of  intellectual property rights limit the ability of U.S. producers to realize the  full returns from their investments.   This lowers profits and diminishes incentives to grow the business and  employ more workers.\n\nIf  we are going to enhance the benefits of free trade and better manage its costs,  it is critical that we continue to strengthen the global rules-based  system.  On the positive side, I would  point to the WTO’s recent Trade Facilitation Agreement, which addresses customs  procedures and could reduce global trade costs by almost 15 percent.  But, at a broader level, the momentum behind global  trade reform has clearly waned in recent years.   This has occurred notwithstanding the fact that there are substantial  areas in need of further reform, such as agriculture, services and non-tariff  barriers.  That momentum needs to be  rekindled and reaffirmed.  Although  advanced economies historically have tended to lead the way, it is important  that large emerging market countries now play a greater role.  This is appropriate given their growing  prominence in the global economy.\n\nThere  are many approaches to dealing with the costs of globalization, but  protectionism is a dead end.  Trade  restrictions address the symptoms and not the underlying problems, and they  introduce other costs and distortions.  While  such measures might generate temporary boosts to growth from greater domestic  production and consumption, these would likely be offset by a range of other  costs.  Over time, such measures would  retard productivity growth and thereby shrink the economic pie.  As an illustration, import substitution  models that were pursued by many emerging market economies following the Second  World War eventually led to lower long-term growth outcomes.  This was the experience in India, which helped  trigger the reforms of the early 1990s.\n\nIn  assessing the benefits and costs of trade, it is important to understand that a  nation’s trade balance reflects much more than its trade policy.  Just as important are the country’s saving  and investment spending proclivities, which are affected by many factors,  including tax and fiscal policies.  For  example, in the United States, we have a chronic trade deficit because domestic  investment spending exceeds our domestic saving.  Foreign capital inflows make up the gap.  In this process, the foreign exchange value  of the dollar plays an important equilibrating mechanism.  If the domestic saving/investment imbalance  is unchanged, then any reduction in the trade balance from higher trade  barriers will be offset by lower exports.   The domestic currency will appreciate to cause the trade deficit to  widen to accommodate the desired capital inflows.  Thus, trade restrictions affect the composition  of trade but not the gap between exports and imports, which is determined by  the difference between domestic savings and investment.  At the end of the day, the protectionist  country would produce more goods in sectors protected by higher trade barriers  but also fewer goods for export.\n\nThe  expectation that higher trade barriers would save jobs ignores these critical  second-round effects.  Moreover, the  story may not end there.  What happens if  another country that now faces higher trade barriers responds by raising its  own barriers?  That would push production  even further out of high-value-added exports that are now deterred by the  higher foreign trade barriers and into those exports that face lower trade  barriers, or into the goods protected by the higher domestic trade  barriers.  Raising trade barriers would  risk setting off a trade war, which could damage economic growth prospects  around the world.\n\nMeasures  that raise trade barriers typically would protect lower-wage, import-competing  jobs, but would also weigh on the prospects for jobs in the more efficient  export sector, which tend to be higher-paying.   The outcome would be countries producing more where they have a competitive  disadvantage, and less where they have a competitive advantage—the exact  opposite of what we should be aiming for.   For example, in the United States, one of our largest manufacturing  exports is aerospace parts (which requires skilled labor) and one of our  largest imports is apparel (which requires less skilled labor).\n\nThese  second-round effects would also likely hurt productivity growth.  Scarce resources would be used less  efficiently and trade protection would likely lessen the level of competitive  pressure that helps drive innovation.  Moreover,  lower productivity growth would likely lead to a slower improvement in a  nation’s living standards over time.\n\nThis  negative consequence of higher trade barriers can be illustrated most starkly  by the estimates of the costs per job saved through protectionist  measures.  Researchers that have studied  this closely estimate that the costs per job saved from protectionist measures  in the United States typically run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars  per year.  To illustrate, consider the  case of import restrictions on Chinese tires.  The cost of a job saved was estimated at  $900,000 per year while the measures were in place, or more than 20 times the  average worker’s compensation. 5\n\nBetter  Approaches to Deal With Globalization\n\nRather  than protectionism, a better policy would be to help domestic workers and  companies compete more effectively, rather than compete less.  We need additional mechanisms that allow us  to more fully capture the benefits from liberalized trade and to more  proactively mitigate its costs.  Ideally,  policy should also better address job losses and income inequality from  automation and other technological advances.\n\nHow  we respond should depend on regional and industry circumstances.  These include the nature of trade impacts,  the skill sets and location of the workers that have been affected, and the  amount of resources that can be mobilized to facilitate adjustment.\n\nIncreasing  specialization brings real economic benefits, but can also leave workers more  exposed to shifts in demand for their services, potentially on short  notice.  These issues are not going away,  especially as emerging market economies take on a larger role in the global  economy and automation continues apace.   If we are to maintain a more open trade regime, globalization must be  socially and politically sustainable.   For that to be the case, we have to provide greater support to those who  are hurt by trade.\n\nPolicies  should include more assistance with job retraining, help with job search and  mobility, and broader unemployment support.  We need to do more research into what measures  have been effective in economies around the world, and we should encourage  greater experimentation with new approaches.  Getting the balance right between providing  assistance and making sure that individuals hurt by trade can get back on their  feet and achieve their earning potential will be a challenge, and we need a  better understanding of what actually works.\n\nMore  generally, we need to do a better job positioning our workforce to cope with  globalization and technological change.   This will involve improvements across a range of areas, including not  only education and training, but also the business regulatory environment and  infrastructure investment that could support greater worker mobility.  These measures would also promote higher  productivity growth.  While the scope and  scale of issues differ substantially by country, many of these policy areas may  also be relevant in India.\n\nLastly,  there are various measures available in current trade agreements, such as  antidumping measures and countervailing duties for dealing with “unfair” trade,  as well as escape clauses that provide safeguards for industries that face a  sudden surge of imports.  Again, the  challenge is to ensure that such measures are effective, that they help  facilitate rather than retard adjustment, and that they are not abused so as to  avoid foreign competition.  But, both  sanctions and temporary relief have been provided for in global trade  rules.  We should be willing to use them  when their use would lead to more equitable outcomes and would help sustain  political support for a more open trade regime.\n\nConclusion\n\nFree  trade is a concept that remains compelling but periodically will be tested by  economic change.  That is an inescapable  fact of life and is a good thing because it requires the economics profession  to articulate anew the value of a liberalized world trade regime.  While the value from trade is very high, the  associated adjustment costs can be significant and will require greater  attention if globalization is to work for all of us.\n\nThank  you for your time. I would be happy to take some questions.",

    "text": "Thank you for  your kind welcome.\n\nI am grateful to  the Banking Standards Board for organizing this meeting.  For several years, the Federal Reserve Bank  of New York and the Banking Standards Board have each worked to improve culture  within the financial services industry in the world’s two most important  financial centers.  I would like to  especially thank Sir Richard Lambert, Dame Colette Bowe, Alison Cottrell, and  the members of their team—all of whom have traveled several times to New York  to attend meetings and conferences on this issue of culture.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to  reciprocate and to join you today in London.   As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily  those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThis morning, I  would like to highlight three issues that are critical to improving culture  within the financial services industry:\n\nI will then  conclude by offering some thoughts on why good culture is critical to success  in financial services.\n\nLet us start  with purpose because it is a prerequisite for the other two.  Baroness Onora O’Neill, a member of the  Banking Standards Board, was the keynote speaker at the New York Fed’s third  culture conference, held in October 2016.   Her message to the audience of senior bankers and regulators was a  challenge to think about the purpose of their organizations.  Namely, what are you for? 2\n\nI believe the  question “what are you for” can be a litmus test for a firm confronted with  challenges.  Let me give you just one  example, from the Salz Review in 2013.   Employees in the eight divisions of Barclays were asked to state their  core values.  Three of the eight  divisions did not rank “customer service” as a core value.  Two of these divisions were retail lines—UK  retail banks and the Barclays credit card.   The third was the firm’s African subsidiary, which also offered retail  banking services. 3\n\nMy intent here  is not to pick on Barclays. Indeed, the firm should be commended for first  commissioning and then publishing the Salz Review—Sir David Walker set an  example of leadership in his candor and transparency.  Instead, my purpose is to make the point: If  you cannot answer the question “what are you for,” or if your answers do not  make sense in light of your business, then it is time to re-examine your  purpose.\n\nFor any bank, a  statement of purpose should emphasize sustainable success, not short-run  profit.  This is because of the many  important roles that banks play in the economy.   They are critical intermediaries between savers and borrowers; they  provide essential infrastructure; they support well-functioning financial  markets; and they act as custodians of our wealth.  These functions require long-term commitment.  They should not be erratic or ephemeral.  The economy needs a steady supply of  competent, honest, and reliable banking services in order to function.  That is why any bank should emphasize the  long term over the short term.\n\nAfter purpose  comes measurement.  In the context of  culture, however, calculating particular metrics is less important than the  goals of such measurement.  The first  goal is to assess how you are doing compared to what you have set out to  do.  In other words, are you fulfilling  your purpose?  The second goal is to  assess how you stack up against your peers.   In both ways, measurement provides critical benchmarking, without which  firms and the industry cannot assess whether they are making progress.\n\nSince the  beginning of our work on culture, my colleagues and I have recognized that  measurement is indispensable to improving bank culture.  We have not been alone in this view.\n\nAt the New York  Fed’s first conference on cultural reform, in October 2014, Sir David Walker  encouraged banking leaders to measure behavior within their firms in order to  promote accountability.  Pursuing this  theme, several panelists addressed the use of measurement as a corporate  governance tool.  They argued that  standardized metrics could help quantify the judgment and behavior of  individual employees, making the behavioral components of annual performance  reviews more objective.  The same  information could also aid a firm’s senior leaders in assessing the  effectiveness of their communications about how the firm conducts its  business.  For my part, I encouraged the  industry to collaborate on a common culture survey that could serve as a  benchmark for behavior.  I also agreed  with Sir David that measurement and accountability should not be decoupled. 4\n\nLast week, the  BSB published the results of its industry-wide benchmarking survey on  culture.  This is a critical step forward  in the industry’s effort to get better data on how firms are doing on cultural  issues, to identify areas for improvement, and to demonstrate a public  commitment to improvement.  Several  facets of the BSB’s report struck me as particularly significant.\n\nFirst, in  addition to creating a benchmarking survey—which generated approximately 28,000  responses—the BSB conducted focus groups with junior employees and interviews  with senior leaders to add depth to what the survey results indicated.  That represents a significant investment of  time by the BSB and those who participated in the qualitative review.  That commitment is essential for  understanding the context and meaning of responses within individual firms.\n\nSecond, the  survey asked respondents to agree or disagree with a number of statements.  Those statements were direct and cut to the  core of cultural issues in banking.  Some  of the standouts, in my view, included:\n\nThird, the results  suggest that the respondents did not pull their punches.  Nearly 30 percent answered that they would be  worried about negative consequences if they raised concerns at work.  That shows, perhaps more than any other  finding, that there is still a long way to go in creating a culture for  long-term success in banking.  In  addition, approximately one quarter of employees did not affirmatively agree  that their organization puts customers at the center of business decisions.  That is also of concern if we want an  industry that is sustainable over the long term.\n\nI encourage you  to read the BSB’s report, if you haven’t already.  And let me emphasize that the report is not  intended as a cudgel or to assign blame.   Rather, as I see it, the report gives the industry an opportunity to  improve against a benchmark.  Again, I  want to acknowledge the BSB’s contribution and thank them for all their work.\n\nNow the burden  shifts from the BSB to you, the industry.   What will you do with these results?   We all want to see progress on culture and behavior.  How will you—both within firms and  collectively—move the needle on culture and behavior over the next few  years?\n\nI suggest that  if you want next year’s results to be better than this year’s, you might start  by focusing on incentives.\n\nAs I have argued  before, incentives shape behavior, and behavior drives culture.  If you want a culture that will support your  long-term business strategy, you need to align incentives with the behaviors  that will sustain your business over the long haul. 6\n\nIncentives—compensation  and promotion, in particular—are powerful tools for communicating the conduct  and culture you desire for your firm.  Of  course, the cultures of firms can and should vary.  But, the culture of every bank should share a  common theme: stewardship—a word that implies professional care, exercised year  after year for the benefit of the firm and its stakeholders.  A commitment to the long term must be at the  core of banking.  Incentives within a  firm should support that goal, not undermine it.\n\nMy emphasis on  incentives is not new, but it bears repeating.   Bad incentives were a key contributing factor in the financial  crisis.  In the United States, the  Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that “Compensation  systems—designed in an environment of cheap money, intense competition, and  light regulation—too often rewarded the quick deal, the short-term gain—without  proper consideration of long-term consequences.” 7 This theme applied to all levels of banking  organizations.  One notable example was  mortgage brokers, who were paid based on the volume of loans they generated,  not their quality. 8\n\nThe financial  crisis came to a head in the fall of 2008.   Fast forward eight years to the fall of 2016.  Wells Fargo’s chairman and CEO resigned after  regulators uncovered what appeared to be widespread fraud in the retail  bank.  Compensation, once again, seems to  be at the center of a scandal.   Neighborhood bankers were paid based on the volume of new accounts opened,  apparently with utter disregard for whether customers wanted them or even knew  about them.  And, like mortgage brokers  in the early 2000s, it appears that job security depended almost exclusively on  meeting targets, regardless of how those targets were met.  There was a serious mismatch between the  values Wells Fargo espoused and the incentives that Wells Fargo employed. 9\n\nInvestigations  into what happened at Wells Fargo are continuing, so I will wait before drawing  more definitive conclusions.  For now,  though, it is sufficient to note the powerful role—for good or for bad—that  incentives can play in an organization.   I understand that making progress on culture is difficult.  But, if you want the next round of metrics to  look better than the last, use a powerful lever—use incentives.\n\nToday’s  discussions—here at Mansion House and later at the Bank of England—are evidence  that the issue of culture is important to the private and public sectors  alike.  We have to keep working on this.  The public sector must continue to shine a  spotlight on the issue, and the industry must continue to demonstrate that it  is taking responsibility for its culture.   And, culture cannot be a subject that only receives attention because  bad conduct has occurred in the recent past.\n\nI am convinced  that a good or ethical culture that is reflected in your firm’s strategy,  decision-making processes, and products is also in your economic best interest,  for a number of reasons:\n\nGood culture is,  in short, a necessary condition for the long-term success of individual  firms.  Therefore, members of the  industry must be good stewards and should seek to make progress on reforming  culture in the near term.\n\nThank you for  your kind attention, and thank you again to the Banking Standards Board for  inviting me to speak and to the Lord Mayor for hosting.  I would be happy to answer your questions.",

    "text": "Good morning. I'm William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I would like to welcome all of you to the Bank and thank you for participating in today's workshop. My colleague Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and I asked our staffs to organize this workshop because the topic of the primary-secondary mortgage rate spread is important for current efforts by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to foster faster economic growth.\n\nAs I have said on a number of occasions, while the U.S. economy has expanded since mid-2009, the pace of the economic recovery has been too slow to make rapid inroads into the spare capacity left over from the recession.  As a result the unemployment rate remains unacceptably high. To support a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability, the FOMC took action at its September meeting to provide additional monetary accommodation.  This included a new program to purchase an additional $40 billion a month of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  The FOMC reiterated in October that it will continue its purchases of agency MBS, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other tools as appropriate until there is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.\n\nMonetary policy works in large part through its effect on financial markets and financial conditions. The impact on economic activity depends on the extent to which policy actions are effectively transmitted to key sectors of the economy.  While actions such as MBS purchases help ease financial conditions more broadly, a key channel through which monetary policy affects the economy is through the housing and mortgage markets.  An easing of policy lowers the secondary market rate at which mortgage-backed securities trade, which puts downward pressure on the primary mortgage interest rate.  A lower primary mortgage rate enables borrowers to refinance their existing loans at lower rates, and increases demand for home purchases, supporting house prices and household wealth, which in turn may increase household access to credit.\n\nWe have seen this channel in operation since the September FOMC meeting.  Yields on newly issued agency MBS have declined about 45 basis points and the Freddie Mac survey 30-year primary rate has declined 23 basis points to 3.32 percent.  These declines have been even larger if measured from the release of the minutes of the previous FOMC meeting in August, after which market expectations of easing in September increased.  This is solid evidence that our policy has been and continues to be effective—though it is certainly not all-powerful in current circumstances.\n\nHowever, the impact of monetary easing on the economy through housing and mortgage finance has been impeded to some degree by two factors.  First, not enough people can take advantage of today’s low primary mortgage rates.  Mortgage underwriting standards have tightened quite dramatically and the share of new mortgages going to households with better credit metrics has risen.  While it is difficult to disentangle how much of this is due to supply versus demand factors, it appears likely that credit standards for home purchase loans have not just tightened since the housing bust but overcorrected.\n\nIn addition, many homeowners find it difficult to refinance their existing mortgage because they have little equity in their homes, or are outright “underwater” with mortgage balances that exceed the current appraised value of their property.  In a speech earlier this year, I called for measures to ease refinancing and tackle other frictions and market failures that lead to economically inefficient outcomes in housing.  Some useful steps have been taken. But, more could be done, and these issues warrant ongoing focus by policymakers.\n\nToday, though, we are focusing on a second impediment to the impact of monetary policy on the economy through housing and mortgage finance: the significant widening of the spread between yields on mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market and primary mortgage rates. Actions taken by the FOMC such as its MBS purchase program operate principally on the secondary rate. For these actions to achieve their full impact, reductions in the secondary rate need to also pass through to the primary rate.  To the extent that the primary-secondary rate spread widens the reduction in pass-through limits the full impact of the policy actions.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s the primary-secondary spread was in the range of 30 to 50 basis points.  In recent years and over the past 18 months in particular, the spread has increased substantially.  Following the September FOMC meeting it rose above 150 basis points.  A spike in the spread following a decision to ease monetary policy is not surprising because the primary market may be slower to react.  The spread has since retraced to its pre-September FOMC meeting level of about 120 basis points.  However, the spread remains elevated by historic standards.\n\nAn important objective of this workshop is to gain a deeper and clearer understanding of the determinants of the primary-secondary spread and its dynamics over time.  This spread is influenced by a number of elements, such as the valuation attached to the right to service the mortgages underlying the security, and the annual guarantee fee that is paid to cover the credit guarantee provided by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).\n\nThe observed widening of the primary-secondary spread likely reflects many factors.  Part of this widening is due to higher annual agency guarantee fees which are a necessary and overdue re-pricing of the credit guarantee provided to investors.  While these guarantee fees differ by mortgage and by seller, the average effective guarantee fee has increased from 20 to 25 basis points to around 50 basis points today. But this still leaves a significant part of the spread left to be explained by other factors such as changes in originators’ costs and profits.\n\nAs you all know, the primary-secondary spread is a technically imperfect measure of the pass-through from primary rates to secondary rates.  A new study 1 , by authors including New York Fed staff, adjusts for these factors to come up with a measure of originator 2 profits and unmeasured costs, or OPUCs.  The basic picture remains the same, with OPUCs at historically elevated levels.\n\nThe paper evaluates a number of potential factors that could help explain this increase. These include the decline in the value of mortgage servicing rights, credit losses and other costs associated with put-back risk, possible changes in pipeline hedging costs and other loan production expenses.  It finds a potentially material role for the decline in the value of mortgage servicing rights in particular, but concludes that the increase in the aggregate measure of profits and unmeasured costs is “not likely to be driven exclusively or even mostly by increase in costs.”\n\nThis suggests that originator profits may have increased.  The study examines a number of potential explanations.  These include capacity constraints, market concentration, pricing power over Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) refinance loans and pricing power on other loans. It finds that capacity constraints play a role and that there is evidence to suggest that originators enjoy pricing power and elevated profits on HARP and other refinancings.\n\nI encourage everyone to take a look at this paper.  It represents a good starting point for today’s discussion.  However, as the authors are the first to acknowledge, the increase in the primary-secondary spread and the underlying changes in originator costs and profits remain something of a puzzle.  I hope today’s discussion will further deepen our collective understanding of this important issue.\n\nTo sum up, for monetary policy to be as effective as possible in supporting economic recovery in a context of price stability it is imperative that the key channels of the monetary policy transmission mechanism are operating as effectively as possible.  The financial crisis and the housing bust created headwinds to the recovery in part through adverse impacts on the mechanisms of monetary policy transmission.  The topic of today’s workshop is important for understanding how to gauge and potentially improve the transmission of monetary policy to the household sector. It is important that we correctly identify and to the greatest extent possible quantify the forces that have been acting on the primary-secondary spread.  This requires bringing a broad range of informed perspectives to the table, perspectives that many of you have.  For this workshop to succeed, we need for you to be as open, frank and precise in your discussions today as possible.  President Rosengren and I thank you for your participation in this effort and we look forward to the key findings from the workshop.\n\n1 The Rising Gap Between Primary and Secondary Mortgage Rates\n\n2 We interpret originator to include all actors involved in originating and servicing mortgages.",

    "text": "As always, my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith respect to what went wrong, it is important to recognize that the financial crisis occurred for a host of reasons and, thus, there is no single silver bullet to avoid such crises in the future. At the heart of the crisis was a tremendous buildup in leverage, which our regulatory framework failed to prevent. Large amounts of opaque, illiquid, long-term assets were financed by short-term liabilities, and much of this financing occurred in the shadow banking system. When the housing bubble burst, financial asset prices fell and exposed the deep linkages and overall fragility of our system. Interbank funding markets seized up, the shadow banking system crumpled and several major financial firms—banks and nonbanks alike—collapsed or approached the brink of collapse. Extraordinary interventions of governments and central banks around the world were necessary to prevent a complete collapse of the financial system and the broader economy.\n\nAs a general matter, regulators did not appreciate beforehand how vulnerable the system was to shocks. In particular, there was a failure to appreciate the important interconnections among the banking system, capital markets, and payment and settlement system. For example, the disruption of the securitization markets caused by the poor performance of highly rated debt securities led to significant problems for major financial institutions. These banks had to take assets back on their books, backstop lines of credit were triggered, and banks could no longer securitize loans, thus increasing the pressure on their balance sheets. This reduced credit availability, which increased the downward pressure on economic activity, which caused asset values to decline further, and in turn, increased the degree of stress in the financial system.\n\nMoreover, regulators did not adequately understand how the dynamics of the system tended to exacerbate shocks, rather than dampen their impact. For example, with respect to capital, firms under stress had incentives to continue to pay dividends to show that they were strong. These dividend payments actually depleted capital, making the firms weaker and vulnerable to credit rating downgrades. When credit ratings were indeed cut, that increased collateral calls, which intensified the pressure on scarce liquidity resources.\n\nRegulatory gaps were another important factor in causing the crisis. American International Group, Inc. (AIG) is a case in point. AIG Financial Products, a subsidiary of the AIG parent company, provided guarantees against default on complex collateralized debt obligations, leveraging the AAA rating of the AIG parent company in the process. This activity was conducted with inadequate regulatory oversight, poor risk management and insufficient capital.\n\nFinally, many of the incentives built into the system ultimately undermined its stability. The problems with incentives were evident in a number of areas, including faulty compensation schemes and risk management that was too narrowly focused on one business area without regard for the broader entity. These incentives created important externalities in which participants did not bear the full costs of their actions.\n\nTurning to where we are now, the U.S. financial system is in much better shape today than it was a year ago. The capital markets are generally open for business—with the important exception of some securitization markets—and the major securities dealers that survived the crisis have seen a sharp recovery in profitability. The largest U.S. bank holding companies, which went through the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program exercise, have more and better quality capital, having raised more than $100 billion of common equity over the past year in the capital markets and generated nearly as much common equity via preferred stock conversions and from gains on asset sales.\n\nHowever, many smaller and medium-sized banks remain under significant pressure. This reflects several factors. First, such institutions hold assets that are carried mainly on the books on an accrual basis. Compared with mark-to-market assets, such assets adjust much more slowly to changes in market conditions and the economic environment. Second, many of these banks have a much more concentrated exposure to commercial real estate, a sector that remains under considerable pressure. Not only have capitalization rates risen sharply—meaning the investors will pay much less for a dollar of rental income than before—but the rental income streams on these properties also have declined as the performance of the U.S. economy has declined. Together, these two factors have pushed U.S. commercial real estate prices down by about 40 percent to 50 percent from the peak reached in 2006. Loan losses in commercial real estate and consumer and mortgage loans seem likely to continue to pressure smaller banks for some time to come. This in turn means that credit availability to households and small businesses will still be curtailed.\n\nThe improvement in the overall health of the financial system and in market function has allowed the Federal Reserve to phase out many of the special liquidity facilities that were enacted in response to the crisis. These facilities were generally successful in achieving their objectives—helping to restore confidence and rebuild market liquidity in a way that safeguarded the taxpayers' interests. When a full accounting of the special liquidity facilities is complete, it seems likely that the facilities will have generated substantial incremental earnings that the Federal Reserve will remit to the Treasury. Although these incremental earnings were not the objective of these facilities, they are a pleasant outcome relative to the alternative.\n\nAs the crisis has abated, our attention has shifted to what we need to do to prevent another crisis in the future. We need to take the necessary steps to build a strong and resilient financial system. In my opinion, three broad sets of actions are needed:\n\nMacroprudential supervision is essential for two reasons. First, it addresses the problem of gaps in the regulatory regime and the regulatory arbitrage that such gaps can encourage. Second, macroprudential supervision is needed because the financial system is interconnected. Siloed regulatory oversight is not sufficient. Supervisory practices must be revamped so that supervision is also horizontal—looking broadly across banks, nonbanks, markets and geographies. This also means that regulatory standards need to be harmonized across different regions. Without harmonization, there will inevitably be a \"race to the bottom\" and regulatory arbitrage will be encouraged, rather than inhibited.\n\nMany steps are needed to make financial institutions and infrastructure more robust. For example, we need to strengthen bank capital requirements, improve liquidity buffers and make financial market infrastructures more resilient to shocks when individual firms get into trouble.\n\nIn terms of capital requirements, many changes are needed, including global capital standards that put more emphasis on common equity, establish an overall leverage limit and better capture all of the sources of risk in the capital assessment process. Improved risk capture, for example, includes the trading accounts of banks. Some institutions had clearly not set aside adequate levels of capital given the risks that were embedded in their trading positions.\n\nIt would also be very desirable to develop a mechanism to bolster the amount of common equity available to absorb losses in adverse economic environments. This might be done most efficiently by allowing the issuance of debt instruments that would automatically convert to common equity in stress environments, under certain pre-specified conditions. Such \"contingent capital\" instruments might have proven very helpful had they been in place before and during this crisis. Investors would have anticipated that common equity would be replenished automatically if a firm came under stress, and this knowledge might have tempered anxieties about counterparty risk. At a minimum, contingent capital instruments might have enabled common equity buffers at the weaker firms to be replenished earlier and automatically, thereby reducing uncertainty and the risk of failure.\n\nOn the liquidity front, there are a host of initiatives underway. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is working on establishing international standards for liquidity requirements. There are two parts to this. The first is a requirement for a short-term liquidity buffer of sufficient size so that an institution that was shut out of the market for several weeks would still have sufficient liquidity to continue its operations unimpaired. The second is a liquidity standard that limits the degree of permissible maturity transformation—that is, the amount of short-term borrowing allowed to be used in the funding of long-term illiquid assets. Under these standards, a firm's holdings of illiquid long-term assets would need to be funded mainly by equity or long-term debt.\n\nWith respect to financial market infrastructures, the Federal Reserve is working with a broad range of private-sector participants, including dealers, clearing banks and tri-party repo investors to dramatically reduce the structural instability of the tri-party repo system. Similarly, over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives clearance activity is being pushed toward central counterparties and exchanges. In addition, the Federal Reserve and others are evaluating how greater transparency with respect to OTC derivatives prices would improve financial stability. The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions are doing a review of standards for payment, clearing and settlement systems. This work will inform the efforts of the Financial Stability Board to strengthen such standards.\n\nThere is also work underway on the problem of how to ensure that financial institutions have compensation structures that curb rather than encourage excessive risk-taking.\n\nFinally, it is critical that we ensure that no firm is too big to fail. This is about both fairness and having proper incentives in the financial system. Having some firms that are too big to fail creates moral hazard. These firms are able to obtain funding on more attractive terms because debt holders expect that the government will intervene rather than allow failure. In addition, too big to fail creates perverse incentives. In a too-big-to-fail regime, firms have an incentive to get large, not because it facilitates greater efficiency, but instead because the implicit government backstop enables the too-big-to-fail firm to achieve lower funding costs.\n\nTo solve the too-big-to fail problem, we need to do two things. First, we need to develop a truly robust resolution mechanism that allows for the orderly wind-down of a failing institution and that limits the contagion to the broader financial system. This will require not only domestic legislation, but also intensive work internationally to address a range of legal issues involved in winding down a major global firm.\n\nSecond, we need to reduce the likelihood that systemically important institutions will come close to failure in the first place. This can be done by mandating higher capital requirements, improving the risk capture of those requirements and by requiring greater liquidity buffers for such firms.\n\nAlthough the raging crisis appears to be over, our work is not close to being complete. Making sure this work keeps moving forward and is coordinated internationally is hugely important. Differences in views across countries and regions should not divert the international community from the more important prize—taking the actions collectively that will ensure a robust and resilient financial system.",

    "text": "Good afternoon.  I thank you for the opportunity to address your association.  It is always a pleasure to speak with the different communities that make up the Second Federal Reserve District and it is especially gratifying to be here in Puerto Rico.\n\nAs with other parts of our District, the New York Fed is dedicated to the people of Puerto Rico and to their future growth and prosperity.  Our commitment is reflected in our ongoing work with our many partners in Puerto Rico.  Over the past several years we have held three forums (cosponsored with the local Small Business Administration office, the Puerto Rico Small Business Development and Technology Center and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), which provided technical assistance to help small businesses access capital, procure government contracts, and export their products and services. We also continue to promote financial literacy through our ongoing partnership with the Puerto Rico Bankers Association, and we have cosponsored the Financial Awareness Video Festival working with students at local colleges to produce short videos highlighting aspects of financial literacy.  Let me just pause for a moment to say congratulations to this year’s winner: Pontificia de Ponce.\n\nIn addition to this work, our commitment is reflected in our research on issues of concern to the Island.  Our economists monitor and analyze local economic conditions.  A complement to our internal research is the outreach that I and other senior bank staff undertake to meet with our stakeholders—the leaders in the business community, members of professional organizations like yourselves, academics, students, elected officials and leaders of nonprofits—to hear firsthand about the issues and problems facing the people in our district. What we learn during these engagements also helps to shape our understanding of the issues facing the Puerto Rico economy and inform our efforts to support it.  Earlier on this trip I met with leading business owners from many different sectors of the economy, elected officials and several agency heads.  And from what I have learned so far, there are many important initiatives underway to effect change and to address what are clearly large and complex issues.\n\nOn my last visit to the Island in 2011, I saw examples of expansion and growth.  This gave me confidence that Puerto Rico has the capability to be an economic success story. However, my discussions with a range of stakeholders confirmed to me that conditions were not what we want them to be—in particular, growth and expansion were not happening either fast enough or broadly enough.  At the urging of several business and community leaders, I commissioned a team at the New York Fed to analyze the challenges facing the Puerto Rico economy and to put forth recommendations on how to capitalize on the Island’s strengths and restore growth.  Informed by consultations with local, national and international experts and stakeholders on the Island, we released that report in 2012. 1\n\nWe presented five recommendations:  (1) reduce barriers to labor force participation and job creation; (2) reform the energy industry, particularly, improve the efficiency of the electric utility’s operations; (3) lower the costs of doing business; (4) foster partnerships between industry and higher education; and (5) promote independent policy evaluation.  These recommendations were not presented as simple quick fixes, but rather as important steps to help improve the Island’s competitiveness over time.\n\nSince that report was issued, positive steps toward reform have been made in some areas.  The recent bill reforming the energy sector and related efforts to expand the use of alternative energy sources should over time help to reduce the Island’s high costs of electricity.  Additionally, the Commonwealth’s economic development strategy is seeking to capitalize on the strong pharmaceutical presence on the Island, to promote knowledge-based services and, importantly, to improve the general business environment on the Island.\n\nMore recently, though, serious fiscal challenges have surfaced that are closely interrelated with the Island’s ongoing weak economic performance.  Persistent deficits in the Commonwealth’s fiscal accounts as well as mounting deficits in the operation of the several major public corporations have substantially raised the Island’s overall level of public debt and led to serious concerns about whether the Island’s fiscal position is sustainable.\n\nIn light of the fiscal pressures Puerto Rico now faces, the New York Fed is undertaking an update to our earlier report. In this new report, we plan to focus on Puerto Rico’s fiscal health.  We will examine the factors leading to the sizeable buildup of public debt on the Island and the key variables that will determine its future trend.  In some ways, the data on Puerto Rico’s public debt clearly define the fiscal problems the Island faces.  But meeting with a variety of stakeholders, as I have on this visit, will help to inform our analysis and will provide us with concrete evidence of how these issues are playing out across the Puerto Rico economy.\n\nThe clear challenge going forward will be for the Commonwealth government to continue to make progress on its efforts to raise its economic growth rate while at the same time to take credible steps to constrain the buildup of debt.  The demanding choices Puerto Rico makes today will affect its long-run economic prospects and the future livelihood of its residents.\n\nNow I would like to review recent developments in the Puerto Rico economy and then outline for consideration and discussion several steps to help put the Island on a path toward fiscal health.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Puerto Rico Let me turn to economic conditions in Puerto Rico.  As you are well aware, the news has not been good.  Puerto Rico’s economy has been in a slump for nearly a decade. After declining for five straight years, real (inflation-adjusted) gross national product (GNP) rose 0.9 percent in fiscal year 2012 and only 0.3 percent in 2013, rates considerably below the respective U.S. mainland growth rates . A monthly index produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico paints a similar picture of an economy that has stabilized but at a depressed level.  We are finally beginning to see some signs of improvement in economic activity on the Island, though there is little evidence to suggest that the strong recovery that we seek has yet taken hold.\n\nPuerto Rico’s labor market remains weak.  Overall payroll employment fell by about 10 percent between 2006 and 2010 and has leveled off since then.  Employment in the private sector has been increasing modestly, with some notable pockets of relatively brisk job creation in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services and private education and health services—employment in each of these sectors now far exceeds its prerecession levels. Cutbacks in government employment, however, have largely offset the private-sector gains realized over the past few years.\n\nLow labor force participation rates and high unemployment rates remain perhaps the biggest challenges to the Puerto Rico economy.   Our earlier report cited low labor force participation among younger and less educated workers as one important factor limiting the Island’s competitiveness.  Since that report, overall labor force participation has continued to decline. The unemployment rate on the Island has consistently exceeded the rate on the mainland by several percentage points.  Although the rate has fallen by more than a full percentage point year to date, the gap with the mainland remains wide.  Moreover, poor labor market opportunities for many workers have contributed to a significant increase in the rate of out-migration of Puerto Rico’s residents, accelerating the Island’s population decline.\n\nThe prolonged period of weak economic growth has compounded Puerto Rico’s fiscal problems:  Puerto Rico’s public sector debt has been on an upward trend for a decade.  The stagnation of the economy and persistent fiscal deficits underlie this debt buildup.  The level of outstanding debt as a percentage of the Island’s annual GNP, a ratio used by many fiscal analysts, rose from about 60 percent in 2000 to more than 100 percent in 2013.   Debt ratios in this range can inhibit economic growth in that they generally lead to higher financing costs, which in turn, can lead to constraints on access to further financing.  The recent downgrading of Puerto Rico’s public debt to non-investment grade was a clear signal that the current fiscal situation poses serious risks to the Island’s economic future.\n\nSteps toward Fiscal Sustainability\n\nNext, I will discuss the buildup of Puerto Rico’s public debt and then provide some thoughts on ways to improve the Island’s fiscal health.  To open this discussion, it is worth noting some key features of Puerto Rico’s fiscal institutional environment.  The Commonwealth has a close relationship with the U.S. government which, in many ways, is analogous to that of a mainland state.  Puerto Rico shares a common market and a common currency with the U.S. mainland leading to strong economic interdependencies.   Federal aid is a major source of revenue for the Commonwealth and Puerto Rican residents participate in large U.S. social insurance programs such as Social Security and Medicare.  In addition, Puerto Rican debt trades as a municipal security in the U.S. capital markets, and much of the interest earned on this debt is exempt from local, state and federal income taxes, regardless of where in the U.S. the investor lives.   And like all but one state, Vermont, Puerto Rico has a self-imposed requirement to balance its budget.\n\nIn many ways, however, the Commonwealth operates more independently than other jurisdictions on the mainland.  Residents of Puerto Rico, unlike those of the states, do not pay U.S. personal income taxes unless they are employed by the U.S. government.  The many large public corporations on the Commonwealth’s balance sheet also distinguish it from many states, although some states—New York is an example—also house a number of public corporations and authorities.  Finally, a notable difference from other mainland jurisdictions is that Puerto Rico’s balanced budget requirement, while found in the constitution and relatively stringent in form, appears not to have been effective in constraining the growth of the Commonwealth’s debt.\n\nThe debt buildup reflects, in part, some of these unique features of Puerto Rico’s fiscal institutions, policies and practices.  In particular, the public sector in Puerto Rico comprises not only the Commonwealth government but also the municipal governments and a number of public corporations.  Prominent among these public corporations are the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority (PRHTA), and the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA).  The public corporations are especially important both for the role they have played in issuing debt as well as the scale of the public services they provide to the Island’s population.  Currently, they account for almost 40 percent of the Island’s total debt and have been responsible for much of the debt buildup—of the roughly 43 percentage point increase in the debt-to-GNP ratio between 2000 and 2013, the public corporations accounted for almost 85 percent of that increase.\n\nSeveral measures put the Island’s weak fiscal condition into perspective.  Total public debt in Puerto Rico is quite high—roughly 100 percent of GNP.  This is far higher than in any U.S. mainland state; among the states, the highest ratio is New York at 29 percent. 2\n\nHowever, since most Puerto Ricans do not pay federal income taxes, the large federal debt burden could arguably be considered not to be a burden to Puerto Rico, in contrast to the mainland states.  Ranking the states and Puerto Rico with the federal debt burden added for the mainland states, but excluded for Puerto Rico, pushes Puerto Rico down to 14 th in the rankings.  However, even with this adjustment Puerto Rico still has a high debt burden.\n\nIn addition to the growing stock of publicly issued debt, Puerto Rico faces large future contingent liabilities via unfunded pension system liabilities. While the Commonwealth has a variety of options for managing these liabilities, they are nonetheless obligations that are relevant in assessing the Commonwealth’s overall balance sheet.\n\nIt seems likely that any country in a similar debt situation to Puerto Rico would have faced difficulty in continuing to raise money in the bond market and would have faced questions about the sustainability of its debt level.  Debt sustainability is generally defined as a condition where government debt is at a reasonable level—one with acceptable risks to market confidence and long-term economic growth—and is not on a path to increase indefinitely relative to some measure of national income.  Stabilizing Puerto Rico’s debt as a share of the Island’s income and then reducing its debt to more sustainable levels should be a key goal of the Island’s fiscal and economic policy.  While the precise path toward lower debt burden is uncertain, the trend is largely determined by the interaction of three factors:  the government’s fiscal policy, the growth rate of the economy and the interest rate on the public debt.\n\nRegarding the buildup of new public debt, the Commonwealth government has stated its intention that the general fund budget will be balanced in fiscal year 2015.  This intention, together with the stance of not using deficit financing to support public corporations, should greatly limit the issuance of new debt.  The measures put in place during this year have already had some success in cutting the projected budget gap for the current fiscal year.\n\nBut what other steps can be taken to move the Island toward fiscal health?  Let me start by saying that Puerto Rico is not alone in facing fiscal problems like these. Governments frequently find that public sector management becomes especially challenging when their economies are undergoing major transitions of the sort that have been taking place in Puerto Rico in the last decade. In the mainland U.S., cities like New York, Washington and Philadelphia experienced major fiscal stresses as they adjusted to the transition from manufacturing to service-based economies. Those cities faced market pressures not unlike those facing the Commonwealth today, and when their leadership tackled the issues head-on, the cities emerged stronger.  The problems that these cities faced required the government and the private sector to work together to find solutions.  In all cases that required important changes and sacrifices.  This was most effective when the necessary adjustments were shared broadly rather than concentrated on a single group.\n\nIn the spirit of assisting the Commonwealth in this endeavor, I want to preview how these issues appear to me, and to suggest some steps for improving fiscal outcomes on the Island.  I present these ideas in order to solicit your input, based on your deeper understanding of the situation. I present them not as quick fixes—as there are no quick fixes to these fiscal situations—but as changes to financial practices that over the next several years can help to restore fiscal health to the Island.\n\nThe first step would be for the Commonwealth government to reinvigorate its efforts to raise economic growth.  While Puerto Rico has a number of features that make it a potentially strong economy, economic growth on the Island has been weak for almost a decade.  To restore growth and raise living standards, it is critically important for policymakers to expand efforts to marshal the Island’s considerable strengths—a bilingual and well-educated adult population, an open economy occupying a central position in the Caribbean, a wide experience as a host to multinational corporations, and close ties to the U.S. mainland economy.\n\nWhile the challenges to restoring growth are clearly complex, I want to highlight some key areas where policies to support efficiency and growth might be strengthened.  First, barriers to job creation and active participation in the labor market should be reduced.  The current structure of labor market incentives could be examined to ensure that firms do not face significant hurdles in creating jobs and workers are not discouraged from entering the labor force.  Second, policymakers should continue their efforts to create a more dynamic business environment, including the elimination of unnecessary costs of setting up and operating a business, particularly with respect to energy costs.  Third, economic development efforts should consider a more proactive approach to utilizing the Island’s educated workforce and well-established higher education system.  One possibility is to look for ways to expand the support for the formation of partnerships between higher education and industry, which have proven to be effective ways for regions to promote innovation, entrepreneurship and economic growth.   Puerto Rico has many of the ingredients in place to harness the benefits of these industry-education partnerships and policymakers should begin to look for promising opportunities for mutually beneficial collaboration.\n\nA second step is to comprehensively reform the Commonwealth’s tax system, which is heavily dependent on income taxes and tends to levy high rates on narrow bases. When rates are high, it increases incentives for activities to be shielded from taxes, perhaps by moving activity to the informal sector, or perhaps by halting the activity altogether. Either way, collecting the necessary revenue requires rates to be even higher on activities that remain in the base, reinforcing the problem. Typically, comprehensive reform is necessary to break the cycle by simultaneously broadening the tax base and reducing rates across a range of taxes. Such a reform would likely produce a significant bonus in terms of faster economic growth, particularly in the formal sector.\n\nA third step would be to improve the Commonwealth’s financial reporting.  Puerto Rico’s unique status means that it is one of few jurisdictions whose finances are not regularly surveyed by a public agency. The U.S. Census Bureau reports annually on mainland state finances and the International Monetary Fund generally reports on the finances of nations. These surveys provide significant transparency into the finances of those entities, which is invaluable for policymakers and citizens wishing to understand, monitor and exert control and discipline over the fiscal policies of their governments. They may also serve the purpose of increasing investor understanding of how the Commonwealth’s finances compare to other governments.\n\nNew York City’s experience in the 1970s shows the value of better financial reporting.  Prior to the City’s fiscal crisis in 1975 through 1977, New York had relatively poor financial reporting practices. As part of its recovery from that crisis, and a condition of accessing credit, the City’s reporting improved dramatically and has since won several awards. Along with those improvements, the City’s access to credit markets steadily improved.  Economic research indicates that more transparent budgets are associated with lower public sector funding costs.\n\nA fourth step would be to look for ways to strengthen the performance of public corporations.  A major difference between Puerto Rico’s balance sheet and those of the states is the presence of large, heavily indebted, corporate-like entities that continue to lose money and increase borrowing. For any financial reform agenda to be successful, it must confront this issue head on. Key elements of a successful reform strategy might include strengthening the public corporations’ financial standing and controlling the future flow of liabilities.\n\nPuerto Rico could also seek out the opportunity to benefit from outside management expertise, including the wide experiences of U.S. mainland states.  An independent regulator for utilities is the norm throughout mainland states.  By leveraging the expertise and reputation of existing independent regulatory agencies, Puerto Rico may improve the efficiency of its public corporations while reassuring investors.\n\nAs a fifth step, the Commonwealth could benefit from adopting fiscal institutions more like mainland states.  Balanced budget rules are far from perfect, but by following the states’ model—splitting the budget into an operating piece that must be balanced and a capital piece that can be financed with debt—Puerto Rico could better align financing methods with its spending priorities.\n\nA sixth step is for the Commonwealth to implement a framework to help ensure that budget targets are met.  A key aspect of such a framework would require that the authorities implement multi-year budgeting, in which revenue and expenditure plans are articulated over a three to five year horizon.  Such a framework should also incorporate a review of the central government’s macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts by a non-partisan independent entity, the views and analysis of which could be published in coordination with the Commonwealth’s proposed budget for any given fiscal year.  New York City, for instance, uses this type of framework.\n\nThe steps should be viewed as potential ways to improve Puerto Rico’s finances over time and I present them to you for consideration and discussion.  The decisions are obviously up to you.  Other countries, U.S. mainland states and municipalities facing similar fiscal issues have been able to overcome them.  I believe the Island can develop a strategy that will enable a return to fiscal health.\n\nThank you for your kind attention and I will now be happy to take some questions.\n\n1 Report on the Competitiveness of Puerto Rico’s Economy , Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 2012.  Available in English at /regional/puertorico/index.html and in Spanish at /regional/puertorico/spanish.html .\n\n2 The debt figures reported for the U.S. mainland states refer to debt held by the public and exclude debt held by government agencies.  Most Puerto Rico debt is held by the public.",

    "text": "Good morning.  I would like to welcome you to this  conference on the Evolution of Work.   Today, we will explore how the nature of work is evolving, including the  role of technology, shifts in employee work arrangements and employer-employee  relationships, and the effects of these changes on workforce development  strategies.  We are pleased to host this  conference with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the  Freelancers Union.  We welcome all the  leaders from across academia, government, industry, labor and the nonprofit  sector assembled here to explore the transformation of the workforce, and the  impact this has had on communities and the economy more broadly.  As always, what I have to say today reflects  my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or  the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nAs you  know, the Federal Reserve monitors the labor market closely, given that maximum  sustainable employment is one goal of the Fed’s dual mandate.  The evolving nature of the workplace—and the  speed with which it is changing—are therefore important developments that we  must continue to monitor.  Traditional  nine-to-five jobs are becoming less common, and people are increasingly  employed in less traditional work arrangements.   Measuring the creation and destruction of these new jobs is of utmost  importance to gain a better assessment of the health of the labor market.  We also need to understand how this evolution  is affecting job security and earnings stability.  While these jobs might provide workers with  more flexibility, they might also come with increased income volatility and  financial vulnerability.  In today’s  gathering, we will discuss the measurement challenges we face to better  understand this growing segment of the labor market, and we will facilitate a  dialogue aimed at developing a workforce aligned with the evolving nature of  work.\n\nThe Fed’s  efforts to understand labor markets include analyzing the comprehensive data  that exist now.  But, in an ever-changing  workplace, it is critical that we hear from external stakeholders to understand  their views on these changes and to ensure we incorporate them in our  assessments.  This is an important part  of our discussion.  As technological  changes persist, it is inevitable that the nature of our jobs will continue to  evolve.  We may not readily recall the  days when there was little job flexibility and we did not have today’s  technology to assist us in our work.   While technological transformation allows for further growth in productivity  and innovation, we must also think through how these changes affect the  workforce overall.  We must realign our  workforce development strategies with these changes.\n\nToday, we will also focus on what  this evolution means for low- and moderate-income households.  One session will explore on-the-ground  community development and labor models, with a focus on the implications for  low- and moderate-income earners.  This  will be an important discussion on how to help workers build the skills  necessary to adapt to change—a conversation that should ultimately include  workers, their employers, their communities and the public sector, working  together.  We all need to share in the  responsibility of helping people increase and maintain the skills relevant to  contributing valued work.  Again, I wish  you a fruitful dialogue, and I commend you for coming together to discuss such  important issues and the trends affecting the U.S. workforce.\n\n1 Nora  Fitzpatrick, Laura Pilossoph, Anika Pratt and Aysegul Sahin assisted in  preparing these remarks.",

    "text": "Thank  you for joining us today for our 16th Annual Community Bankers  Conference.  This is my last opportunity  to address this fine group of community bank leaders in my role as president of  the New York Fed.  As always, what I have  to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nSince  becoming head of the New York Fed in 2009, I have had the opportunity to watch the  evolution of community banking up close.  I observed the resilience of community banks at  the height of the financial crisis and how your organizations managed during those  turbulent times.  I also have had the  privilege of meeting with many of you during my regional visits, and I remain  impressed with how small banks remain important pillars of economic support for  their communities.\n\nThe  past decade has seen significant change for your industry.  There has been significant consolidation  among institutions and the remaining community banks are much healthier.  Back in 2009, there were 191 community banks  in the Second District with an aggregate of $223 billion in total assets.  In contrast, there are 135 community banks  today.  Despite this contraction in  number, the remaining firms have continued to grow and thrive, and now have  assets totaling $291 billion, which is an increase of about 30 percent.  Community banks are much stronger financially  today.  In 2009, troubled assets were 26  percent of capital, primarily reflecting a large volume of construction  lending.  That ratio has declined  significantly, to 8.5 percent today—demonstrating that community bank leaders  have the capacity to take action, effectively work out troubled assets, and generate  capital.  These data tell a welcome story  regarding your ability to successfully conduct business through the economic  recovery.\n\nSo,  where does the industry go from here and what challenges lie ahead?  That is the theme of today’s conference, and I  expect a robust and enlightening series of discussions from both panelists and  presenters.  From my perspective, there  are two challenges that I would highlight: ongoing advances in technology, and  interest rate risk.\n\nFirst,  major technological changes are compelling banks to embrace technology to  better meet the needs of their customers.   Today’s customer expects increased digital access, and a bank’s failure  to advance technologically would be very damaging for its franchise value. But,  the use of new technology comes with its own risks that require significant  investment and attention—especially around cybersecurity.\n\nSecond,  in today’s low interest rate environment, we have observed that some community  banks have taken on more interest rate risk by increasing the maturity of their  assets and the average duration of their loan portfolios.  In the last rate tightening cycle, we observed  that banks with larger concentrations of long-term earning assets experienced  lower margins.  It will be important for  community banks that are very sensitive to interest rate risk to evaluate the  risk management of their loan portfolios.\n\nFinally,  when I meet with community bankers, I am often asked the following question: “When  will we see regulatory relief?” My simple answer is soon, I hope.\n\nThere  is wide ranging consensus—across party lines and among regulators, the Federal  Reserve included—that we need to reform the regulatory requirements for small  banks.  As I have said, I favor  regulatory relief for smaller banking organizations. 2 Their size and complexity do not pose a significant  risk to the system, and they lack the scale to absorb large compliance and  other regulatory costs.  Given broad  agreement on this issue, I am hopeful that relief will be forthcoming.\n\nLet  me conclude by saying that we continue to recognize the important role community  banks play in our economy.  According to  a study by our colleagues at the Kansas City Fed, the U.S. banking system is  unique because of its balance between a small number of large banks and  thousands of community banks. 3 That balance helps serve the needs of a large  and diverse U.S. economy that includes businesses of all sizes and consumers  with different needs and preferences.  As  the U.S. economy continues to grow and expand—as I expect it will—your  personalized customer service, commitment to relationship banking, and  adaptability to technological advances will serve you and your communities well.\n\nI  will miss many aspects of my role at the New York Fed, particularly the  opportunities I’ve had to interact with the community bankers in our district.  Please enjoy today’s conference, and thank you  for coming.",

    "text": "My meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy.  We plan these trips so I can meet with a diverse array of stakeholders in the region.  This allows me to get a comprehensive picture of economic conditions in the region and a fuller understanding of the major issues and concerns.  This is our first regional trip for 2015 and the third time we have visited northern New Jersey in the past four years.\n\nI begin my day here at NJPAC and following this visit, I will take a tour of the Teachers Village, which is a new mixed-use community here in downtown Newark, attend a roundtable lunch meeting with members of the Statewide Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of New Jersey in Union City, and hear about the economic and community development activity in Jersey City from Mayor Steven Fulop.  I will then meet with nonprofit small business lenders to hear about lending conditions, and I’ll end the day at Stevens Institute of Technology where I will learn how they have partnered with NBC Universal to create a new minor in media engineering to address a skills gap issue in the region.\n\nThese trips are one of the many ways in which we engage with people and businesses in our region.  We track the health of household balance sheets at the state and local level using data from the New York Fed’s Consumer Credit Panel.  These data show debt balances and delinquency trends across all forms of consumer debt, including mortgages, student loans, auto loans and credit cards.  Later this month we will release a Regional Household Debt and Credit Snapshot that will provide an overview of the household debt trends in metropolitan areas within New Jersey.  We also conduct a biannual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and availability.  Based on the poll results, we have developed an ongoing series of clinics for small businesses to help them take the next step to access capital and identify new sources of funding.  We also get important input from our Small Business and Agricultural Advisory Council, whose members help us understand key economic and financial issues affecting regional businesses and communities.  This year we tapped two New Jersey business leaders to join the Advisory Council: Adenah Bayoh, co-founder of Kapwood, LLC, and Ranjini Poddar, founder of Artech Information Systems, LLC.\n\nLet me now review recent developments in the national and regional economy, and at the end of my talk, I will be happy to answer questions you may have about the economic outlook.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). 1\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nAfter growing at just a 2 percent annual rate from 2010 through 2012, real GDP expanded more quickly in 2013 and 2014, rising at a 2.7 percent annual rate.  This was sufficient to push the unemployment rate down by more than two percentage points over this period.  This firming in growth reflected several important developments that, in my view, are likely to continue through 2015.  The data we follow suggest that the household deleveraging process has largely run its course and the imbalances in the housing market have been mostly worked off.  Federal fiscal consolidation appears to be over for now, and employment and spending are increasing at the state and local government level.\n\nThat said, economic performance in this cycle has been disappointing compared to historical patterns.  Even though household wealth relative to disposable income is nearly at its pre-financial crisis level and conditions in labor markets are substantially improved, consumer spending growth has been slower and the personal saving rate higher than what we would have expected based on past historical relationships.  Similarly, even with low mortgage rates, single-family housing construction has been surprisingly sluggish.  And, despite very accommodative financial conditions and record corporate profits, growth of business fixed investment has been tepid.\n\nLooking forward, my outlook for 2015 is that economic growth will be close to the pace of the past two years, supported by continued solid fundamentals and accommodative financial conditions.  If I am correct, then this would lead to a further reduction of labor market slack, with the unemployment rate approaching 5 percent by the second half of the year.\n\nAn important element of this forecast is continued strength in household spending.  This strength is supported by the restored health of household balance sheets, improved household income prospects and the benefit of significantly lower energy prices.  The data for the second half of 2014 reflect these positive forces: real personal consumption expenditures grew at a 3.2 annualized rate in the third quarter and a 4.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter.  This strength in consumption was accompanied by solid income growth, as real disposable income increased at a 3.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, reflecting the stronger labor market.\n\nThe pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed in recent months from the strong pace at the end of last year. Nonfarm payroll employment increased in the first quarter by about 200,000 per month, well below the pace of the fourth quarter. This slowdown was broad-based, with job growth slowing in both the goods-producing and the service-providing sectors.\n\nThe unemployment rate was 5.5 percent in March: analysis by my staff suggests that the unemployment rate is nearing the point where we may begin to see a pickup in the pace of real wage gains. If this proves correct and unemployment continues to decline as I expect, then these stronger wage gains could help support solid income growth even if the pace of employment growth slows.  However, it will be important to monitor developments to determine whether the softness in the March labor market report evident on Friday foreshadows a more substantial slowing in the labor market than I currently anticipate.\n\nThe March labor market report is another indicator that the first quarter is likely to be quite weak.  Our current projection is that the economy will grow at about a 1 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2015.  This softer performance is suggested by a wide range of recent indicators that have surprised to the downside over the past couple of months.  Examples of such indicators include retail sales, the ISM manufacturing index, manufacturing production and orders, and single-family housing starts.\n\nOverall, I view these downside surprises as reflecting temporary factors to a significant degree.  For example, some of the recent softness is likely due to yet another harsh winter in the Northeast and the Midwest.  My staff’s analysis of a measure of both the amount of snow and the population affected indicates that January and February weather was 20 to 25 percent more severe than the five-year average.  Such large deviations appear to have meaningful negative impacts on a number of economic indicators.\n\nEven so, there are some downside risks to the growth outlook.  In particular, the steep decline in crude oil prices is likely to lead to a further sharp drop in U.S. oil and gas investment.  Additionally, the significant rise in the value of the dollar is likely to lead to weaker U.S. trade performance.\n\nLet me discuss each of these in more detail. Energy prices have declined sharply since mid-2014.  In recent weeks, the benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price has been hovering in a range of $45 to $50 per barrel, less than half the price in June of last year.  This creates both positives and negatives for the U.S. economy.  Starting with the positives, since the U.S. is still a net importer of petroleum, this development has provided substantial benefits, with our oil import bill down by about a ½ percentage point of GDP.  As I indicated earlier, that represents a significant boost to real disposable income for households.  How much this energy windfall boosts consumption will depend, though, on how much is spent versus saved.\n\nTurning to the negatives, the support to growth from rapidly rising U.S. oil production almost certainly will fade away.  U.S. oil production has been rising rapidly for several years, due largely to new technology that has expanded the amount of oil that can be recovered from existing wells and that has facilitated shale oil production by fracking.  Now, with prices dramatically lower, U.S. oil exploration and drilling activity is falling off very sharply. This will exert a meaningful drag on economic activity.\n\nAnother significant shock is the nearly 15 percent appreciation of the exchange value of the dollar since mid-2014.  Such an appreciation makes U.S. exports more expensive and imports more competitive.  My staff’s analysis concludes that an appreciation of this magnitude would, all else equal, reduce real GDP growth by about 0.6 percentage point over this year.\n\nTurning to inflation, the data continue to come in below the FOMC’s objective of a 2 percent annualized rate for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator.  The twelve-month change of the total PCE deflator was 0.3 percent in February, with the core PCE deflator at 1.4 percent.  Despite this, my expectation is that inflation will begin to firm later this year.  In particular, most of the impact from the decline in energy prices that has weighed down overall inflation is likely over.  Although the appreciation of the dollar is likely to cause some further softness in import prices, the continued decline in resource slack as the economy expands should push in the opposite direction.  In addition, longer-term household inflation expectations have been well maintained through this period of very low inflation, as indicated by our Survey of Consumer Expectations .  The combination of stable expectations and declining slack should push inflation slowly back towards the FOMC’s objective.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nAs the FOMC has consistently communicated, the timing of lift-off will depend on how the economic outlook evolves.  As I have discussed, the labor market has improved substantially and I expect to see inflation begin to firm later this year.  If this labor market improvement continues and the FOMC is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium-term, then it would be appropriate to begin to normalize interest rates.  At the March meeting, the FOMC removed language from the statement that indicated that we would be patient in beginning the process of normalizing monetary policy.  But, as Chair Yellen remarked in her most recent press conference, removal of “patient” from the statement does not indicate that we will be “impatient” to begin to normalize monetary policy.  Rather, the timing of normalization will be data dependent and remains uncertain because the future evolution of the economy cannot be fully anticipated.\n\nWhenever the data support a decision to lift off, I think it is important to recognize what this would signify.  It does not mean that monetary policy will be tight.  We will simply be moving from an extremely accommodative monetary policy to one that is slightly less so.  It also will be a positive signal about the progress we have made in restoring the economy to health.  In my view, it would be a cause for celebration, because it would signal that the FOMC believes that slightly higher short-term interest rates are consistent with its objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  Near-zero short-term interest rates and a larger Federal Reserve balance sheet were designed to be a temporary extraordinary treatment to help the economy regain its vitality, and not a permanent palliative.\n\nI remain confident that when the FOMC does decide to begin to remove policy accommodation that we have the requisite tools to effectively support this decision.  We have tested numerous tools including overnight reverse repurchase operations, term reverse repurchase operations, and term deposit facilities to ensure that, when the time comes, lift-off can be managed smoothly.  The primary tool will be interest on excess reserves (IOER), with overnight reverse repurchases as a supplemental tool to be used as needed to ensure a firm floor under short-term interest rates.\n\nFor financial markets, the likely path of short-term rates after lift-off is just as important as the timing of lift-off.  Here, I anticipate that the path will be relatively shallow.  Headwinds in the aftermath of the financial crisis are still in evidence, particularly the diminished availability and tougher terms for residential mortgage credit.\n\nHow fast the normalization process will proceed depends mainly on two factors: how the economy evolves and how financial market conditions respond to movements in the federal funds rate.  If financial market conditions do not tighten much in response to higher short-term interest rates, we might have to move more quickly.  After all, the point of raising short-term interest rates is to exert some restraint on financial market conditions.  In contrast, if financial conditions tighten unduly, then this will likely cause us to go much more slowly or even to pause for a while.  At the end of the day, we will move short-term interest rates to generate the set of financial market conditions that we deem is most consistent with our employment and inflation objectives.\n\nHow high will short-term rates ultimately need to go?  I think this issue is very difficult to judge for a number of reasons.  First, it depends on how financial market conditions evolve in response to our monetary policy adjustments.  Second, it depends on other factors, such as real potential GDP growth, which, in turn, depends on the growth rates of the labor force and of productivity.  My current thinking is that the long-run nominal federal funds rate consistent with 2 percent inflation is somewhat lower than in the past.  My point estimate is 3½ percent, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on this.  I have considerable uncertainty about this estimate.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nNow let’s turn to the New Jersey economy.  One feature of the state’s economy is its industrial diversity.  A sizeable number of jobs in the state are in the healthcare, professional and business services, wholesale and retail trade, and leisure and hospitality categories.  When we look at the northern part of the state, we see a greater concentration of jobs in finance, particularly in Hudson County. Also prominent are goods distribution jobs related to the ports, rail lines, trucking and warehousing.  Other large sectors include pharmaceuticals manufacturing and research and development, as well as private education.\n\nLooking at recent trends in northern New Jersey, the recovery in the economy in general—and in employment in particular—is lagging the nation and is not going as well as we would like.  The Garden State’s economy lost a quarter of a million jobs during the recession, and employment didn’t begin to recover until 2011, and even then it was slow getting started.  However, the latest annual employment revisions—released just a few weeks ago—show job gains in 2013 and 2014 were a bit stronger than previously reported.  Nevertheless, four years into the recovery, employment has recovered less than two-thirds of the job losses from the recession.  This contrasts notably with both New York State and the U.S. as a whole, where employment has far surpassed its earlier peaks.  Moreover, here in Essex County, there has yet to be any significant upturn in jobs, although neighboring Hudson County has seen a fairly strong rebound.\n\nThat’s not to say that there aren’t any strong industry sectors here in New Jersey: job growth has been quite robust in health services, transportation and warehousing, construction and a number of business service industries.  There has also been steady job creation in retail trade and leisure and hospitality, though these tend to be low-paying sectors.  On the other hand, employment remains depressed in other industries such as finance, publishing, telecommunications and manufacturing.\n\nSo why is New Jersey not keeping pace with New York in terms of job growth?  Well, much of the strength in New York State has been driven by New York City; other parts of the state have seen similar, if not weaker, job growth than New Jersey.  Of course, this raises the question: why has New York City’s economy been so much stronger?  In fact, there is a body of research suggesting that the long-term drift of economic activity and jobs from cities to suburbs has subsided, and that there is a growing trend toward re-urbanization—a preference for both people and businesses to locate in cities, like New York.\n\nYet there is also a strong tendency for persistent strength in an urban hub to gradually spill over into nearby areas.  With both commercial and residential rents, not to mention sales prices, high and rising in Manhattan, northern New Jersey has an opportunity to capitalize on its widening cost advantage by attracting companies and residents that value an urban location, but find New York City to be too pricey.  And if preferences are indeed in the midst of a long-term shift toward urbanization, this bodes particularly well for New Jersey’s own cities.  With a major international airport and seaport, a 20-30 minute train ride from most of Manhattan—but much cheaper rents—as well as a number of universities and a solid infrastructure, Newark has strong potential to develop its prominence as a major local business, economic and cultural hub.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nTo conclude, I would like to say a few words concerning proposals to reform the Federal Reserve System.  First, I concur with Chair Yellen that the Federal Reserve already is very transparent and accountable to Congress and to the public. I share her strong belief that the independence of the central bank to make appropriate policy decisions consistent with its legislated mandates is essential to a nation’s economic well-being.\n\nWith regard to the structure of the Federal Reserve System and the role of the regional banks, including the New York Fed, I also agree with Chair Yellen that the system is working well, and I do not see a need for any substantive changes.  I believe that the System has been designed appropriately so that a wide range of regional views are represented.  At the same time, I believe that the Federal Reserve System’s monetary policy responsibilities are allocated appropriately by the Federal Open Market Committee, with New York playing an important role to ensure that monetary policy is executed effectively even during periods of duress.  Of course, the Federal Reserve System and the New York Fed are not perfect institutions.  That is why we always must strive, in an open and transparent manner, to improve what we do and how we do it, for the benefit of the American people.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would now be happy to take some questions.\n\n1 Jason Bram, Chelsea Cruz, Tony Davis, Jonathan McCarthy, James Orr, Richard Peach, Paolo Pesenti and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.",

    "text": "In my opinion, this crisis demonstrated that a systemic risk oversight framework is needed to foster financial stability. The financial system is simply too complex for siloed regulators to see the entire field of play, to prevent the movement of financial activity to areas where there are regulatory gaps, and, when there are difficulties, to communicate and coordinate all responses in a timely and effective manner.\n\nEffective systemic oversight requires two elements. First, the financial system needs to be evaluated in its entirety because, as we have seen, developments in one area can often have devastating consequences elsewhere. In particular, three broad areas of the financial system need to be continuously evaluated: large systemically important financial institutions, payments and settlement systems and the capital markets. The linkages between each must be understood and monitored on a real-time basis. Second, effective systemic risk oversight will require a broad range of expertise. This requires the right people, with experience operating in all the important areas of the financial system.\n\nIn this regard, I believe that the Federal Reserve has an essential role to play. The Federal Reserve has experience and expertise in all three areas—it now oversees most of the largest U.S. financial institutions; it operates a major payments system and oversees several others; and it operates in the capital markets every day in managing its own portfolio and as an agent conducting Treasury securities auctions. Also, as the central bank, it backstops the financial system in its lender-of-last-resort role.\n\nCompared with where we were in late 2008 and early 2009, financial markets have stabilized, and the prospect of a collapse of the financial system and a second Great Depression now seems extremely remote. Even with this progress, however, credit remains tight, especially for small businesses and households. Economic growth has resumed, but unemployment has climbed to punishing levels. So while circumstances have improved, they are still very far from where we want them to be. We have no cause for celebration when the challenges facing so many businesses and households remain so daunting.\n\nAggressive and extraordinary official interventions were imperative to bring about this nascent stabilization of our financial markets and economic recovery. The Federal Reserve has been at the center of many of these interventions. For example, its efforts over the past two years to promote market functioning and minimize contagion were critical in preventing the strains in our financial markets from resulting in even more severe damage to the economy. These “lender of last resort” interventions on the part of the Fed, including facilities such as the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), as well as programs such as the foreign exchange reciprocal currency agreements, are examples of the rapid and responsive application of basic central bank tenants to the unique challenges we faced as this crisis evolved. Indeed, in many ways, the crisis has underscored why the Federal Reserve was created almost a century ago: to provide a backstop for a banking system prone to runs and financial panics.\n\nWhere it proved necessary and feasible to do so, the Fed also used its emergency lending authority to forestall the disorderly failure of systemically important institutions. These actions truly were extraordinary —well outside the scope of our normal operations, but our judgment was that not taking those actions would have risked a broader collapse of the financial system and a significantly deeper and more protracted recession. Faced with the choice between these otherwise unpalatable actions and a broader systemic collapse, the Fed, with the full support of the Treasury, invoked its emergency lending authority and prevented the collapse of certain institutions previously considered to have been outside the safety net.\n\nThe fact that the Fed needed to take those actions provides a stark illustration of the significant gaps in our regulatory structure, gaps that must be eliminated. Among those holes was the absence of effective consolidated oversight of certain large and deeply interconnected firms; the collective failure of regulators—including the Federal Reserve—to appreciate the linkages and amplification mechanisms embedded in our financial system; and the absence of a resolution process that would allow even the largest and most complex of financial institutions to fail without imperiling the flow of credit to the economy more broadly. Addressing these shortcomings will require important reforms in our country's regulatory architecture.\n\nWe entered the crisis with an obsolete regulatory system. For one, our regulatory system was not structured for a world in which an increasingly large amount of credit intermediation was occurring in nonbank financial institutions. As a result, little attention was paid to the systemic implications of the actions of a large number of increasingly important financial institutions—including securities firms, insurance conglomerates and monolines. In addition, many large financial organizations were funding themselves through market-based mechanisms such as tri-party repo. This made the system as a whole much more fragile and vulnerable to runs when confidence faltered.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the Fed and other regulators, here and abroad, did not sufficiently understand the importance of some of these changes in our financial system. We did not see some of the critical vulnerabilities these changes had created, including the large number of self-amplifying mechanisms that were embedded in the system. Nor were all the ramifications of the growth in the intermediation of credit by the nonbank or “shadow banking” system appreciated and their linkages back to regulated financial institutions understood until after the crisis began.\n\nWith hindsight, the regulatory community undoubtedly should have raised the alarm sooner and done more to address the vulnerabilities facing our banks and our entire financial system. But this was difficult because our country didn’t have truly systemic oversight—oversight that would be better suited to the new world in which markets and nonbank financial institutions had become much more important in how credit was intermediated. Without a truly systemic perspective, it was unlikely that any regulator would have been able to understand how the risks were building up in our contemporary, market-based system. The problem was that both banking and nonbank organizations played an important role in credit intermediation but were subject to differing degrees of regulation and supervision by different regulatory authorities.\n\nAlthough these gaps had existed for years, their consequences were not apparent until the crisis. Difficulties in one part of the system quickly exposed hidden vulnerabilities in other parts of the system, in a way that our patchwork regulatory system had not been designed to detect or readily address. In the same way, the crisis revealed the critical deficiencies in the toolkits available to the regulators to deal with nonbank institutions in duress. Emergency lending by the Fed might be enough to forestall the disorderly failure of a systemically important institution and all the wider damage such a failure might cause, but it was a blunt and messy solution, employed as a stopgap measure because better alternatives were not available. What is needed—what our country still lacks—is a large-firm resolution process that would allow for the orderly failure even of a systemically important institution.\n\nThus, in the fall of 2008, regulators and policymakers found themselves facing the prospect of the total collapse of a complex and interconnected system . It was these circumstances, and the prospect they created for an even deeper and more protracted downturn in real economic activity and employment, that required truly extraordinary actions on the part of the Federal Reserve, as well as the Treasury and many other agencies. This is a situation in which the United States must never again find itself.\n\nFor its part, the Federal Reserve is hard at work on developing and implementing new regulations and policy guidance that take on broad lessons of the recent crisis. We are working with other banking regulators in the United States and overseas to strengthen bank capital standards, both by raising the required level of capital where appropriate and improving the risk capture of our standards. We are issuing new guidelines on compensation practices so that financial sector employees are rewarded for long-term performance and discouraged from excessive risk-taking. And we are working with foreign regulators to develop more robust international standards for bank liquidity. We are working to make the tri-party repo system more robust and reducing settlement risk by facilitating the settlement of over-the-counter derivatives trades on central counterparties (CCPs). But more needs to be done and much of this requires action by Congress.\n\nCongress is now considering several proposals for comprehensive regulatory reform, proposals that merit careful study and debate. Let me offer some general thoughts on the principles that should guide how we approach reform.\n\nFirst, it's important to take a clear-eyed and comprehensive view of the financial system we have today. As I've already suggested, if there is one overriding lesson to be drawn from the events of the past 18 months, it is that the financial system is just that: a system, and a very complex one at that . The operational, liquidity and credit interdependencies that characterize contemporary financial markets and institutions mean that the well-being of any one segment of the system is inextricably linked to the well-being of the system as a whole. Because of this, our approach to reform must be guided by a coherent sense of the system as a whole, not merely by a focus on some of its component parts, as important as they may be.\n\nWe need a new regulatory structure that provides for comprehensive and consistent oversight of all elements of the financial system. This includes effective consolidated oversight of all our largest and interconnected financial institutions and oversight of payment and settlement systems. We must make sure that the people doing the regulation have the power and expertise to ferret out and bring to heel regulatory evasion as it occurs to prevent abuse and excess from building up in the financial system. In the end, the gaps, not the overlaps, have been the main shortcoming of our existing regulatory framework.\n\nA second fundamental point is that regulatory reform has to ensure that the financial system will be robust and resilient even when it comes under stress so that it will not fail in its critical role in supporting economic activity. No economy can prosper without a well-functioning financial system—one that efficiently channels savings to the businesses that can make the most productive use of those savings, and to consumers that need credit to buy a home and support a family. The fact that our financial system isn't functioning well right now is part and parcel of our current economic difficulties. This critical link between the “real” and the “financial” is why we care so much about the systemic risks inherent in banking and finance.\n\nOne critical element of systemic risk is what is known as the “too big to fail” problem. Without sufficiently high capital and liquidity standards, and, as a backstop, a resolution mechanism that is credible, regulators are faced with a Hobson’s Choice when a large, systemically important financial firm encounters difficulties. On the one hand, if authorities step in to respond to prevent failure, contagion and collapse of the broader system, that action rewards the imprudent and can create moral hazard—that is, encouraging others to act irresponsibly or recklessly in the future in the belief that they will also be rescued or “bailed out.” On the other hand, if authorities do nothing and let market discipline run its course, they run the risk that the problem will spread and unleash a chain reaction of collapse, with severe and lasting damage to markets, to households and to businesses.\n\nSo what can we do about the “too big to fail” problem? It is clear that we must develop a truly robust resolution mechanism that allows for the orderly wind-down of a failing institution and that limits the contagion to the broader financial system. This will require not only legislative action domestically but intensive work internationally to address a range of legal issues involved in winding down a major global firm. Second, we need to ensure that the payments and settlement systems are robust and resilient. By strengthening financial market infrastructures, we can reduce the risk that shocks in one part of the system will spread elsewhere. Third, we need to reduce the likelihood that systemically important institutions will come close to failure in the first place. This can be done by mandating more robust capital requirements and greater liquidity buffers, as well as aligning compensation with the risks that are taken by the firm’s employees. In addition, instruments such as contingent capital–debt that would automatically convert to equity in adverse environments–need to be considered. Such instruments would enable equity capital to be replenished automatically during stress environments, dampening shocks rather than exacerbating them.\n\nI would now like to take some time to discuss some of the proposals that Congress is debating regarding regulatory reform. As Congress and the Administration consider what legislative changes are warranted, the Federal Reserve's actions before and during the crisis have been getting close inspection. Given the Federal Reserve's key role in our financial system, and the scale of the damage caused by the financial crisis, this careful scrutiny is necessary, appropriate and welcome.\n\nNot surprisingly, there are legislative proposals that would significantly alter the Federal Reserve's powers and responsibilities, particularly with respect to supervision of bank holding companies. Again, that's entirely within Congress's purview: the Federal Reserve only has the powers and responsibilities that Congress has entrusted to us. But in drawing up new legislation, it's important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater—we should preserve what has worked and fix what hasn’t. A dispassionate analysis of what is needed will almost certainly lead to better decisions and a more effective regulatory framework.\n\nThe legislative proposals concerning the Federal Reserve are not limited to the Federal Reserve’s role in supervision. Consider, for example, one proposal that calls for what it terms \"audits\" of the Federal Reserve by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), an arm of Congress. These wouldn't be audits at all in the commonly understood sense of the term. The Federal Reserve's financial books and transactions are already audited by wide range of professionals internal and external to the institution. Rather, these new audits would involve ex-post review of Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions , a potential first step toward the politicization of a process that Congress has carefully sought to insulate from political pressures.\n\nThe notion that the Federal Reserve's financial dealings are somehow kept hidden from the public is a surprisingly widely held view—and it is simply incorrect. An independent outside audit of the Federal Reserve's books is conducted annually. You can find the results online, including a detailed accounting of the Federal Reserve's income and operating expenses in its annual report. The financial books of the regional Federal Reserve Banks also undergo independent outside audits, also available online. In addition, the GAO is empowered to review almost all Federal Reserve activities other than the conduct of monetary policy, including the Federal Reserve's financial operations, which the GAO has done so frequently. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet is posted online weekly, with considerable detail, in what's called the H.4.1 report. Finally, an additional accounting of the Federal Reserve's emergency lending programs created over the last two years is available online in a monthly report.\n\nBut my objection that GAO oversight would be broadened to include a review of monetary policy decisions is not based just on the fact that the Fed is already subject to considerable oversight. My principal concern is the damage that could potentially result to the Fed’s ability to achieve its mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. The effectiveness of monetary policy depends most of all on the Federal Reserve’s credibility with market participants and investors. In particular, both groups need to know that the Fed will always act to keep inflation in check. That's why Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin famously joked that the Fed would sometimes need \"to take the punchbowl away just as the party gets going.\" As you can well imagine, this may not always enhance our popularity, especially among those who were enjoying the party. But, the fact that markets know that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy when needed helps keep inflation expectations in check. This, in turn, helps keep inflation low since inflation expectations affect actual inflation. The consequence is credibility with respect to the conduct of monetary policy. This gives the Fed more latitude not to tighten when inflation rises for transient reasons—say, due to a short-lived spike in oil prices—and more scope to ease credit to support the economy during economic downturns.\n\nRecognizing these benefits, Congress wisely acted many years ago to exempt monetary policy decisions from the GAO's wide powers to review Federal Reserve activities. Congress' decision to bolster the Fed's monetary policy independence has been followed by similar actions around the world—substantial independence for the central bank in the conduct of monetary policy is now widely regarded as international best practice. Policy independence does not absolve the Federal Reserve from accountability for its monetary policy decisions and the need to clearly explain why they were taken. But it avoids the politicization of monetary policy decision-making. And this is good because politicized central banks generally do not have enviable records with regard to inflation, economic growth or currency stability. Risk premia on financial assets are typically much higher in countries with politicized central banks.\n\nOf course, a reversal of Congress's earlier decision would not amount to legislative control over monetary policy decisions. That's not the issue. The issue is that a reversal of Congress’ earlier decision could create the appearance that the legislature seeks to influence monetary policy decisions by establishing a mechanism to publicly second guess those decisions. Such a move would blur what has been a careful separation of monetary policy from politics. Market confidence here and abroad in the Federal Reserve would be undermined. Asset prices could quickly build in an added risk premium, which might lead to tighter credit conditions. These unintended consequences would undermine the legislation’s intent.\n\nI’m also concerned about those proposals under consideration that would move the regulatory and supervisory functions now held by the Federal Reserve to other agencies, new or existing. At present, the Federal Reserve is the consolidated supervisor for bank holding companies, a group that has expanded recently as investment banks and other companies formerly outside the Federal Reserve's purview have been brought under Federal Reserve oversight. In my view, further disaggregation or fragmentation of regulatory oversight responsibility is not the appropriate response to our increasingly interconnected, interdependent financial system. Funneling information streams into diverse institutional silos leads to communication breakdowns and too often to failure to \"connect the dots.\"\n\nIn addition, there are clear synergies between the supervisory process and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and financial stability missions. The information we collect as part of the supervisory process gives us a front-line, real-time view of the state of the financial industry and broader economy. Monetary policy is more informed as a result. Only with this knowledge can a central bank understand how the monetary policy impulse will be propagated through the financial system and affect the real economy.\n\nSimilarly, involvement in the supervisory process gives us critical information in fulfilling our lender-of-last-resort responsibilities. Information sharing with other agencies is simply not as good as the intimate knowledge and understanding of markets and institutions that is gathered from first-hand supervision. Indeed, many institutions at the center of the crisis and arguably the most troubled—Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, AIG and the GSEs—were not supervised by the Federal Reserve. Consequently, when those institutions came under stress, the Federal Reserve had poorer quality and far less timely information about the condition of these institutions than would have been the case if we had had the benefit of direct supervisory oversight.\n\nIn fact, some of the hardest choices the Federal Reserve had to make during the most chaotic weeks of the crisis concerned systemically important firms we did not regulate. It is not surprising that, in the wake of the crisis, some countries that had separated bank supervision from the central bank monetary policy role are now reconsidering that division of labor. That is mainly because coordination problems created difficulties in responding quickly and effectively in the crisis. Separation made it more difficult to communicate in a timely way and to understand the broader implications of what was transpiring. It is critical that we not introduce new inefficiencies and impediments. No matter what steps are taken to improve our regulatory system and strengthen market discipline, history tells us that there will inevitably be circumstances in which an informed and effective lender of last resort will play a critical role in preventing shocks and strains in financial markets and institutions from generating  a broader collapse of the financial system.\n\nOf course, there are legitimate questions as to how broad the Federal Reserve's regulatory and supervisory responsibilities should be. That question is up to Congress, and should be decided on the merits. What is fundamentally at issue here is not “turf,” but rather how we as a nation can best ensure that we never again re-live the events of the past few years—that the legitimate public interests associated with a safe, efficient and impartial banking and financial system are well served.\n\nIn the end, it is critical that financial reform be decided on the basis of the merits. If objective and careful policymaking prevails, we will all be the better off for it. In contrast, if we fail in this endeavor, that would truly be tragic. We must act informed by the important lessons that we have learned from this crisis.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.",

    "text": "Good afternoon. I am pleased to be here today at Syracuse University.  It is always a pleasure to speak with the different communities that make up our region, and it is especially gratifying to have the opportunity to speak with you, our future leaders. So thank you for inviting me.\n\nMy meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy. Earlier on this trip, I met with government and business leaders in Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse to learn about some of the challenges the region faces as well as the collaborative efforts being taken to further economic development. The agenda for these visits is always packed, but that’s part of the point—to meet with a diverse array of representatives in order to get a comprehensive picture of economic conditions in the region and a fuller understanding of the major issues and concerns.  This is our fourth trip to Upstate New York in the past few years and recent trips have also taken us to Northern New Jersey, the boroughs of New York City, Long Island, and Fairfield County, Connecticut.\n\nMy outreach trips complement the ongoing efforts of the New York Fed to assess conditions in the upstate New York economy and throughout our District.  We monitor economic performance on a monthly basis through our indexes of economic activity and our survey of New York State manufacturers.  We also get important input on economic conditions from meetings with our Upstate Advisory Board, whose members are major leaders in the upstate economy.  We have constructed a consumer credit panel that allows us to better understand the financial condition of homeowners and students, and conduct a bi-annual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and availability.  The results of the latter have helped inform a series of clinics that we have conducted to help small businesses take the next step to access capital and identify new sources of funding.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are always eager to engage with students, and our commitment to our region includes a series of educational programs worth highlighting. First, Math x Economics , which encourages students attending Title 1 schools to consider preparing for a career in finance or economics.  And, second, our yearly Fed Challenge competitions, in which teams of students from high schools and colleges in the District take on the roles of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and debate what is the appropriate next step for U.S. monetary policy.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues fully engaged with the communities we represent.\n\nNext, I’ll review recent developments in the national and regional economy, and at the end of my talk will be happy to answer any questions you have about the economic outlook.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nLet me begin by taking stock of where we are at the moment.  Then I will address my expectations for the performance of the economy over the remainder of 2013 and into 2014.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Economic Research, which determines the timing of economic recessions and expansions, the current expansion began in mid-2009, more than four years ago.  However, the expansion has been subdued so far, as the average annual growth rate of real GDP has been just 2.2 percent over the past four years.  While that growth rate is near most FOMC participants’ estimates of the U.S. economy’s longer-run growth rate as well as those of many outside analysts, a more rapid pace of growth likely is necessary to reduce meaningfully the significant economic slack that developed during the Great Recession.\n\nConsistent with the modest pace of economic growth, improvement in labor market conditions has been slow.  Even though the unemployment rate has declined by 2.7 percentage points from its peak of 10 percent in October of 2009, there are still many people that want jobs but are not counted as unemployed because they are not actively looking for work.  An alternative measure of labor market conditions, the employment to population ratio, which is not influenced by changes in the number of these workers, has shown limited improvement.  Job loss rates have fallen, but hiring rates remain depressed at low levels.  Taken together, the labor market still cannot be regarded as healthy.  Numerous indicators, including the behavior of labor compensation, are all consistent with the view that there remains a great deal of slack in labor markets.\n\nNevertheless, as I have stated in earlier speeches, I see persuasive evidence of improving underlying fundamentals for much of the private sector of the U.S. economy.  Key measures of household leverage have declined and are now near the lowest levels they have been in well over a decade.  Household net worth, expressed as a percent of disposable income, has increased back to its average of the previous decade, reflecting rising equity and home prices and declining debt.  Banks have eased credit standards somewhat recently after a prolonged period of tightness.  As a result, we are now experiencing a fairly typical cyclical recovery of consumer spending on durable goods.  For example, light-weight motor vehicles sold at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of nearly 16.1 million in August, close to the number sold in 2007.\n\nSimilarly, after five years in which housing production was well below what is consistent with underlying demographic trends, it now appears that we have worked off the excess supply of housing built up during the boom years of the last decade.  Existing home sales remain on an upward trend, and a widely followed national home price index is up around 12 percent over the 12 months ending in July. 1 Indeed, anecdotal reports suggest that this higher-than-expected increase in home prices is due to a lack of homes for sale.\n\nHowever, a number of risks to the outlook are evident.  Long-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, have risen significantly since early May.  Since then, we have seen a sharp drop in refinancing mortgage applications, a more moderate but significant decline in purchase mortgage applications and fairly flat housing starts and new home sales.  Although I do not anticipate that the rise in long-term rates will lead to a downturn in housing, these developments do suggest that higher mortgage rates have cut into the upward momentum of the housing sector.  We will need to monitor upcoming data closely to assess more fully the impact of higher rates on the housing recovery.\n\nAnother risk is that federal fiscal policy could exert further restraint on the economy during the rest of this year and in 2014.  It is difficult to assess how much of the contractionary effects from sequestration, for example, have already occurred, or still remain ahead.  A related issue is the high degree of uncertainty about fiscal policy.  In coming weeks, Congress will be considering how to fund the government for the next fiscal year and will also be debating what to do about the debt limit.   This creates uncertainty about the fiscal outlook and may exert a restraining influence on household and business spending.\n\nOne other risk to highlight is the global economic outlook.  Even though the euro area appears to have begun to grow again after a protracted recession, growth in that area is still expected to be fairly weak at best.  In addition, growth in many of the largest emerging economies has slowed, and some of the countries with large trade and current account imbalances have seen their financial markets and currencies come under pressure.  If growth abroad were to slow, this could impede the growth of U.S. exports and this could result in less strength in manufacturing production and employment in the U.S.\n\nThus, returning to an analogy I have used in previous speeches, I see the economy in a tug-of-war between these headwinds and underlying fundamental improvement, with a great deal of uncertainty over when the improvement in the underlying fundamentals will prevail.\n\nIn the end, my best guess is that growth for all of 2013, measured on a Q4/Q4 basis, will be near the post-recession average. But I believe a good case can be made that the pace of growth will pick up some in 2014.  The private sector of the economy should continue to heal, while the amount of fiscal drag should subside.  I also expect that, despite the near-term concerns, growth prospects among our major trading partners will improve next year.  And this combination of events is likely to create an environment in which business investment spending will strengthen.  However, the notion that the economy will grow more swiftly remains a forecast rather than a reality at this point.\n\nTurning to the inflation outlook, total inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, has fluctuated recently with short-term movements in energy prices, but it continues to run below the FOMC’s expressed goal of 2 percent.   Core inflation, that is, excluding food and energy, slowed in late 2012 and early 2013 to well below 2 percent, although it has shown signs of stabilizing in the last couple of months.\n\nA decomposition of core inflation reveals that the most recent slowing of inflation has been largely confined to core goods, whereas the rate of increase of core services has been relatively steady.  Such was not the case in 2010—the previous instance of a significant slowing of inflation.  In addition, inflation expectations so far have remained relatively stable at levels somewhat above the current inflation rate. This should help prevent an undesirable further drop in inflation relative to our 2 percent objective.  Thus, I anticipate that inflation will firm further in the months ahead and move toward the FOMC’s longer-run objective.  Still, the FOMC recognizes that inflation persistently below 2 percent could pose risks to economic performance.\n\nAs is always the case, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding this forecast. Moreover, there is always the possibility of some unforeseen shock. Thus, we will be monitoring U.S. and global economic conditions very carefully and will adjust our views on the likely path for growth, inflation and the unemployment rate accordingly in response to new information.\n\nSo what does this all portend for monetary policy?  As you are aware, at last week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee we made no changes to our monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided to continue purchasing long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at a monthly pace of $45 billion and $40 billion, respectively.  The FOMC statement reaffirmed the Committee’s intention to “continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.” 2\n\nWe also reaffirmed our forward guidance with respect to the federal funds rate.  The statement notes that the Committee “decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.” 3\n\nOne noteworthy question that emerged following the meeting was why the Committee did not begin to reduce the pace of asset purchases. Although I can’t speak for the Committee, I can provide some reasons for my own decision.\n\nTo begin to taper, I have two tests that must be passed: (1) evidence that the labor market has shown improvement, and (2) information about the economy’s forward momentum that makes me confident that labor market improvement will continue in the future. So far, I think we have made progress with respect to these metrics, but have not yet achieved success.\n\nWith respect to the first metric, we have seen labor market improvement since the program began last September. Over this time period, the unemployment rate has declined to 7.3 percent from 8.1 percent.  However, at the same time, this decline in the unemployment rate overstates the degree of improvement. Other metrics of labor market conditions, such as the hiring, job-openings, job-finding rate, quits rate and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, collectively indicate a much more modest improvement in labor market conditions compared to that suggested by the decline in the unemployment rate. In particular, it is still hard for those who are unemployed to find jobs. Currently, there are three unemployed workers per job opening, as opposed to an average of two during the period from 2003 to 2007.\n\nWith respect to the second metric—confidence that the economic recovery is strong enough to generate sustained labor market improvement—I don’t think we have yet passed that test. The economy has not picked up forward momentum and a 2 percent growth rate—even if sustained—might not be sufficient to generate further improvement in labor market conditions. Moreover, as I noted earlier, fiscal uncertainties loom very large right now as Congress considers the issues of funding the government and raising the debt limit ceiling.  Assuming no change in my assessment of the efficacy and costs associated with the purchase program, I’d like to see economic news that makes me more confident that we will see continued improvement in the labor market. Then I would feel comfortable that the time had come to cut the pace of asset purchases. 4\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nLet me now turn to economic conditions in the region. The upstate New York economy is continuing to grow, but at a pace somewhat slower than the national economy. In part, this reflects the fact that the U.S. economy is recovering from a much deeper and more severe recession than Upstate New York. As the national economy continues to heal, places like Upstate New York, which didn’t see a huge boom and bust in housing and their economies before the Great Recession, don’t have as much ground to make up.\n\nBut the region’s slow economic growth during the recovery also reflects the reemergence of historical trends—Upstate New York hasn’t tended to perform as well as the rest of the country during economic expansions. Like many economies in the Northeast, Upstate has tended to grow slowly in recent decades, as the population has shifted to other parts of the country and the once dominant manufacturing industry has shrunk considerably.\n\nThese same trends are playing out in the Syracuse area. Like Upstate New York more generally, the recession in Syracuse was not as deep as the nation’s.  However, the Syracuse area experienced a deeper recession than Upstate as a whole, losing about 13,000 jobs during the downturn.  The area’s recovery has lagged behind Upstate.  So far, Syracuse has gained back less than half of the jobs that it lost.\n\nRecent job growth has been led by the region’s education and health sectors. Together, these sectors have added stability to the local economy and provided a foundation for growth. Over the past several years, during both recession and recovery, these sectors have added about 1,000 jobs each year to the local economy. The leisure and hospitality sector, as well as the retail sector, has also been a solid source of job growth for the area. However, as you probably well know, job losses in the region’s manufacturing industry have weighed against these gains. About 9,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since the start of the Great Recession. And, while a slow jobs recovery began in the nation’s manufacturing sector in 2010, Syracuse has continued to lose these jobs in recent years—a painful process for the area to continue to endure to be sure.\n\nNonetheless, these trends have resulted in a more diversified economy. In fact, the share of workers employed in the metro area’s manufacturing sector is now just 8 percent, just below the nation’s 9 percent share. The private education and health sectors have emerged as the largest industries, and now employ one in five workers. So, the face of the local economy has changed dramatically through a somewhat painful restructuring process. But I believe this process is reaching its conclusion, and the resulting more diversified local economy is providing a strong foundation on which Syracuse can build going forward.\n\nHence my interest in the collaborative efforts of the business, academic and health sectors to further economic growth. These efforts capitalize on the strengths of the region and may well be a good way to further economic development not only in Syracuse but in Buffalo and Rochester as well. Each metro area has a strong university, a strong health sector and a business community all eager to find ways to leverage local assets and boost economic development.\n\nLooking forward, I believe that the colleges and universities in Syracuse will help drive the region’s economy in the years to come. Syracuse can build on these assets by continuing to make partnerships between industry and higher education a high priority. When companies and universities work together, they can become a powerful engine for innovation and economic growth. These collaborations are a key ingredient to helping improve the competitiveness of local businesses, the universities themselves, and their regions, and we should take every opportunity to exploit these partnerships as much as possible to unleash their full potential.\n\nCollege graduates finding jobs\n\nLet me finish off by saying a few words about the value of education.  There is no doubt that the Great Recession and sluggish recovery that followed has made it difficult for many people to find jobs. I’m sure many of you here today are worried about finding a good job after you graduate, and you may be wondering whether going to college will turn out to have been a good investment.\n\nLet me reassure you, despite the weak labor market conditions that have prevailed since the Great Recession, the benefits of a college degree remain significant. Research we have undertaken at the New York Fed clearly shows that young people with a college degree are more likely to have a job and they tend to earn higher wages than those without degrees—and this is true even for those who may be underemployed initially when they first enter the labor market after graduation. In fact, our research finds that to some extent, it has always proved challenging for college graduates to transition into the labor market, even during economic expansions, but as time passes, and the graduate’s experience grows, the transition generally gets accomplished successfully. Although it is true that the labor market has been more difficult for college graduates in recent years, I am confident that most will find work and transition into higher-skilled jobs as they gain experience and as the labor market improves.\n\nThank you for your kind attention and I will now be happy to take some questions.\n\n1 Based on the CoreLogic home price index including distressed sales.\n\n2 Federal Open Market Committee statement , September 18, 2013\n\n3 Federal Open Market Committee statement , September 18, 2013\n\n4 For more thoughts on the monetary policy outlook, I refer you to the speech made earlier this week: Reflections on the Economic Outlook and the Implications for Monetary Policy .",

    "text": "Good  afternoon.  It is a pleasure to have the  opportunity to speak at this Council for Economic Education (CEE) event,  marking the CEE’s 56th Annual Financial Literacy and Economic  Education Conference.  Given the hard  lessons of the financial crisis—and the economic challenges still facing many  Americans—there are few goals more worthy than promoting greater financial and  economic literacy.  As always, what I  have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nPersonal Educational Experience\n\nBefore  discussing the economic outlook and the role of education in income mobility, I  will offer a few remarks on my own educational experience.  While it may not be surprising that I have a  Ph.D. in economics, the path that led me to the University of California, Berkeley,  is a bit unusual.\n\nI  started college in the 1970s at Columbia University.  On the positive side, the professors were  engaging, and I had the opportunity to read the great books of the university’s  core contemporary civilization curriculum.   But, I was troubled by the emphasis on grades and test taking.  I wanted something that was more  free-form.  The idea was to find an  environment that fostered learning for learning’s sake.  So, in a small act of rebellion—after all, it  was the early 1970s and I was a teenager—I decided to transfer to New College in  Sarasota, Florida.  New College provided  a strong liberal arts, cross-disciplinary, and flexible education program that  relied—as it does today—on an unstructured format of evaluations, study  programs with individual professors, and contracts rather than grades.  I like to call it “graduate school for  undergraduates,” because it really is a place that encourages students to  engage intellectually, read and think critically, and communicate effectively.\n\nThis  experience made me a strong advocate of a liberal arts education, which I believe  is now more valuable than ever, given the greater importance of synthesizing  and evaluating the vast array of information we have at our fingertips.  The cross-disciplinary approach of a liberal  arts program is also vital to understanding and solving complex problems.  I believe that training—combined with the  excellent education in economics I got at Berkeley—helped me to better diagnose  what was going wrong in 2007 and 2008, and how the Federal Reserve could be  most effective in our response to the crisis.\n\nEconomic and Monetary Policy Outlook\n\nTurning  to the economic outlook, the damage wrought by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  Maria has imposed immeasurable hardship on many.  And, the damage will undoubtedly disrupt  commerce for some time.  However, these  effects are likely to be relatively modest in the context of the national  economy.  Natural disasters tend to depress  economic activity initially, but once the recovery and reconstruction efforts  get underway in earnest, such disasters actually serve to lift economic  activity.\n\nLooking  beyond the storm effects—which will make interpreting near-term economic data  releases more difficult—the economy remains on a trajectory of slightly  above-trend growth at about 2 percent, and the fundamentals supporting  continued expansion are generally quite favorable.  Low unemployment, sturdy job gains (recognizing the near-term negative impact of the storms), and rising wages (even at a pace below previous expansions) are lifting personal income.  Household wealth has been  boosted by rising home and equity prices, and household debt has been growing  relatively slowly, contributing to a healthy household balance sheet.  Thus, consumer spending should continue to  advance in coming quarters.\n\nBusiness  fixed investment outlays are also likely to continue to rise.  With the supply of labor tightening, there  are greater incentives for businesses to invest in labor-saving  technologies.  Investment spending should  also benefit from a better international outlook and the improvement in U.S.  trade competitiveness caused by the dollar’s recent weakness.  The softer dollar and solid growth abroad  also suggest that the trade sector will no longer be a significant drag on  economic growth.\n\nTurning  to the outlook for inflation, I have been surprised by the persistence of the  shortfall from the FOMC’s 2 percent long-run objective.  While some of this year’s shortfall can be  explained by one-off factors—such as the sharp fall in prices for cellular  phone service—its persistence suggests that more fundamental structural changes  may also be playing a role.  These  include the increased ability of prospective buyers to compare prices across  different sellers quickly and easily, the shift in retail sales to online  channels of distribution from traditional brick-and-mortar stores, and the  consequences of these changes on brand loyalty and business pricing power.\n\nOver  the coming months, I hope that we will be better able to differentiate between  these competing explanations.  If it  turns out that structural changes have played a significant role, I would  generally view this as a positive, rather than negative, development.  It would imply that the U.S. economy could  operate at a higher level of labor resource utilization without generating a  troublesome large rise in inflation.   More people could be put to work on a sustainable basis, enabling them  to gain opportunities not just to earn greater income, but also to develop  their skills and grow their human capital.\n\nSlightly  above-trend growth is gradually tightening the U.S. labor market, which should  support a rise in wage growth over time.   When combined with a firmer import price trend—partly reflecting recent  depreciation of the dollar—and the fading of effects from a number of  temporary, idiosyncratic factors, I expect inflation will rise and stabilize  around the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Thus, even though inflation is currently  somewhat below our longer-run objective, I judge that it is still appropriate  to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually.  This judgment is supported by the fact that  financial conditions have eased, rather than tightened, even as the FOMC has  raised its short-term interest rate target range by 75 basis points since last  December.\n\nBut,  the upward trajectory of the policy rate path should continue to be shallow, in  part because the level of short-term interest rates consistent with keeping the  economy on a sustainable long-run growth path is likely to be considerably  lower than it was in prior business cycles.\n\nThe  FOMC recently launched the process of balance sheet normalization—in which an  increasing proportion of maturing Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed  securities (MBS) repayments are allowed to run off the Federal Reserve’s  balance sheet.  While this process also should  exert some monetary policy restraint over time, I believe the impact will be  quite modest.  Not only was this shift in  policy widely anticipated, but we also have seen that the impact on the level  of long-term interest rates has been small as expectations have adjusted.\n\nThe  economy has made great strides in recovering from the Great Recession, as the  unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent to 4.2 percent, aided by  accommodative monetary policy.  Measures  of underemployment have also improved considerably and are near pre-crisis  levels.  Stronger labor market conditions  are perhaps the best means to improve the economic well-being of most  Americans, particularly those who have been struggling and are most vulnerable  to economic downturns.\n\nAnd,  as discussed in the Federal Reserve’s July Monetary Policy Report and in Chair  Yellen’s accompanying testimony before Congress, it is encouraging that  unemployment rates continue to fall for most demographic groups, including  African-Americans and Hispanics. 2 At the same time, we should remain concerned that  the jobless rates for those groups remain above the unemployment rate for the  nation.\n\nRecent  U.S. Census Bureau estimates of household income growth also provide some  reason for optimism.  Median real  household income rose 3.2 percent in 2016, after strong gains the prior  year.  Gains were particularly notable  among African-American and Hispanic households, and the poverty rate fell to  near pre-crisis levels.  While this is  good news, I think we can all agree that we have a long way to go to improve  income inequality and mobility in the United States.  As I see it, these are among the most important  issues we face as a nation.\n\nIncome Mobility and Education\n\nNow,  it is clearly the case that, given differences in individuals’ abilities, a free-market  society will generate some level of inequality.  However, there are persistent trends toward growing  inequality and diminished economic mobility—and in my view, these are problematic. 3 First, income inequality has widened notably  since about 1980. 4 Second, and more distressing, is a  relatively low rate of economic mobility, or the degree to which individuals or  families can move up or down in the income distribution over time.  For example, the fraction of children who earn  more than their parents has fallen from 90  percent to 50 percent over the past half century, and only 37 percent of  parents believe that their children will be better off financially than they  are, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. 5\n\nHigh  inequality combined with a low rate of mobility is particularly problematic in  a democratic society. In short, it means that being born into a low-income  family is likely to severely limit an individual’s opportunities and well-being  over his or her lifetime.  The United States  fares notably weaker on both dimensions relative to its OECD peers. 6 That is concerning, and something we should  be working to address.\n\nOne  significant initiative we have taken within the Federal Reserve System is the  establishment of the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute at the  Minneapolis Fed, which conducts research and makes recommendations on the  structural barriers to economic advancement in the nation.  The New York Fed has been, and will continue  to be, an active participant and supporter of this initiative.\n\nLet  me now turn to the primary routes of economic mobility and the impediments that  too often block them.  The primary avenue  to higher incomes for most people is investment in their human capital, namely  through education.  Indeed, the income  returns on education are very high, and they continue to rise in spite of very  significant increases in the supply of highly educated workers during much of  the 20th century.  Since the  1980s, however, increases in the supply of well-educated workers in the United States  have slowed, while demand for these workers has accelerated due to  technological change.  These forces have  been a major contributor to the increase in the college wage premium. 7 While college graduation rates in the U.S.  have stagnated, those in many other OECD countries have continued to rise.  As a result, only one-quarter of those in the  25-to-34 age bracket in the United States have more education than their  parents, compared with an OECD average of one-third. 8 This represents a dramatic decline in college  education’s influence as an engine of upward mobility.  So, part of a solution to the increase in  inequality and the reduction in social mobility is to increase the level of educational  attainment in the population.\n\nThere  are many barriers to expanding post-secondary education, however.  From the potential student’s perspective, a  lack of information, low college preparedness, and high costs are all substantial  barriers to college attendance and completion, and these barriers restrict  social mobility.  Let me discuss each of  these in turn.\n\nBy  lack of information, I mean the recognition that in spite of its high price  tag, a college degree typically offers an even larger payoff in terms of future  earnings.  Many aspects of the college  attendance decision are complex and hard to predict, especially for students  from families without much experience with higher education.  For example, research indicates that decisions  about college attendance are highly correlated with an understanding of the future  payoffs from attendance and particular majors. 9 New York Fed research shows evidence of  systematic underestimation of the average benefits—and overestimation of the costs—of  a college education, with larger biases among lower-income and non-college  households. 10 Families may not realize that listed  tuition prices may not be what a particular student actually pays.  Moreover, misperceptions about the net return from  a college degree can be consequential, influencing parents’ expectations and  intentions for their children’s college attendance.\n\nImportantly,  however, these expectations are not hardwired.   Evidence from an information experiment indicates that students do  respond to new information by revising their expectations and their education  choices. 11 This suggests that making information about  higher education decisions more available to families—particularly those with  less experience with higher education—is a promising way to expand economic  mobility.  I was fortunate as a child  that I didn’t face this problem.  Both my  parents went to college and there was no doubt among us about the payoff from  higher education.\n\nAnother  concern is the lack of college preparedness among new college entrants.  Nearly seven out of 10 students entering  public two-year institutions and four out of 10 students entering four-year  public institutions take remedial courses in college. 12 Generally, these are courses they should have  taken in high school. The costs of taking these courses in college are high, especially  because they do not count for college credit.  Low readiness contributes to persistently low  college completion rates, with only 55 percent of first-time undergraduates  completing a degree within six years. 13 College dropout rates are especially high  among lower-income, part-time, and nontraditional students, with high costs,  low perceived ability to pay, and a lack of information about the returns to  degree completion also contributing to the high dropout rate.\n\nThe  importance of college readiness underscores the value of high-quality K-12  schooling.  But, research indicates that  fewer than half of five-year-olds from low-income families possess the math and  reading skills, behaviors, and overall health required for learning success,  compared to 75 percent of children from middle- and high-income families. 14 These differences are important because they  have long-lasting effects on academic achievement and future careers.  A substantial body of evidence, including  research by economists at the Minneapolis Fed, points to very large economic  returns to high-quality preschool and early-childhood development programs. 15 Clearly, such programs can play an important  role in improving economic mobility.\n\nI  benefited from nursery school and kindergarten and a mother who taught me to  read before I entered elementary school.   And, when my junior high school tried to move me out of an accelerated  math program, my mom intervened and got me back in.\n\nPaying  for college is another major impediment to college attendance and completion.  While college is generally a good investment,  it has become increasingly expensive over the last several decades to attend a  four-year program, as costs have risen considerably faster than wages—especially  wages for all but the very top of the income distribution.  This means that college has become  increasingly unaffordable for those families who need it most, if we are to  increase social and economic mobility.   Of course, one result of the increasing unaffordability of college  education is that fewer people get a college degree, which could help account  for the slowdown in the growth rate of the college-educated workforce that I  discussed earlier.  However, recent  research by my colleagues at the New York Fed shows that young Americans have mostly  adjusted to rising tuition and fees not by foregoing college education, but rather  by amassing more debt.\n\nOver  the past few decades, funding for higher education has shifted from state and  local sources to students and their families. While the federal student loan  program has helped ease that transition, the result has been that more students  are leaving college with significantly higher amounts of debt.  In fact, student loan debt has grown 170  percent over the last decade and now totals over $1.3 trillion. 16\n\nTo  be clear, I don’t want to downplay the importance of student loans. When  accompanied by college completion, they allow students to make what generally  turns out to be a very worthwhile investment.  I personally benefited from student loans while  at Berkeley.  But, compared to  alternative ways of financing higher education—such as greater government support  for public universities and increased federal education grants—student loans can  have adverse consequences.  This is especially  true when loans are taken on by those who don’t complete their education.  For borrowers with large student loan balances,  such consequences include slow or late repayment, serious delinquency, and  default. 17 New York Fed researchers have shown that  such unfavorable outcomes are related to family background.  Thus, at times, student loans can have the  perverse effect of limiting social mobility.\n\nIn  addition, our research indicates that, for any given level of educational  attainment, workers who have student debts are less likely to own homes than  those who got their education without incurring debts.  Certainly, for those who have difficulty  repaying their student loans, the resulting damage to credit scores will make obtaining  a mortgage very difficult, especially under today’s lending standards.  A student loan default, which is unhappily  common, means that borrowing to buy a home is essentially impossible.  And, we know that these factors—slow  repayment, delinquency, and default—are most prevalent among those from modest  family circumstances.\n\nThis  connection between rising college costs, increased student borrowing, and  reduced homeownership is important for inequality and social mobility because,  for the great majority of American families, increasing home equity is the  major form of wealth accumulation. 18 Thus, changes over the last few decades in the  way that college is financed mean higher education is less able to lift people  from poverty into the middle class.\n\nI  should note here that economic education has an important role to play in  mitigating these challenges, which increasingly arise as debt becomes a more  common part of the college experience.  For  example, financial literacy and the skills taught by educators have been  demonstrated to better prepare young people for the management of their  finances, enhancing their well-being.  Financial  literacy allows people to better understand the terms of student loans and the  consequences of missed payments, and how to accumulate wealth. 19 I strongly support the CEE’s efforts to bring economic  knowledge to young people, as I believe that it is increasingly vital for  everyone, and has an especially important role in fostering social and economic  mobility.\n\nOther  factors that can foster or inhibit social mobility are the practices of  universities themselves.  In some very  recent work, Raj Chetty and his co-authors have documented the role that  different universities play in fostering economic mobility. 20 From my perspective, the most important  findings are that access to the best universities is very closely related to  parent income—children from wealthier families are more likely to go to Ivy  League schools, for example.  Yet, those  students from poorer families who actually are admitted to the best  universities do just as well in their future earnings as those from more  advantaged backgrounds.\n\nPart  of the problem, aside from cost, is the legacy admission policies of elite  schools—where children of alumni receive preferential access.  This is patently unfair, and scrapping such  policies would help increase economic mobility. 21 I really don’t see how our best universities  can continue to justify this practice.   Yes, fund-raising might suffer slightly over time—but I suspect the  impact would be very small.  More  importantly, do we really want to encourage what is essentially a “donate to  admit” policy at our major universities?   Such an approach only preserves the status quo and constrains economic  mobility.\n\nThe  research shows that upward mobility differs substantially across colleges.  Ivy League schools are good at producing top  earners, but, as I noted, they accept very few lower-income students, so their  impact on income mobility is small.  Meanwhile,  other schools with economically diverse student bodies produce few high earners,  and their impact is likewise small. Then there are certain schools—some of  which can be found in the CUNY and California state systems—that manage to produce  a large number of high earners from economically diverse student bodies.  Learning exactly how they do it and how it  can be replicated strikes me as a first-order question for further study.\n\nWhile  I am distressed by the high and increasing levels of inequality and diminished  mobility that our economy has delivered over the last several decades, I remain  optimistic about the future.  There is  more attention now to inequality and low intergenerational mobility than I can  recall at any time during my professional life.  Organizations like the CEE and the National Association  of Economic Educators exist to improve awareness of economic concepts.  This enhances the ability of young people to  make better financial decisions and helps to close the gaps in knowledge that contribute  to inequality.  Top-tier researchers in  both academia and the Federal Reserve System are focusing their attention on  the causes, consequences, and solutions of this social problem, using better  data, methods, and means of communicating their results.  Even more importantly, policymakers are also  paying close attention.  Ultimately, I  believe we will identify and implement policies that can make the dream of a  better life a reality for more of our fellow citizens.\n\nThank  you again for your kind attention. I would be happy to take your questions.",

    "text": "Maureen O’Hara : Bill,  let me start off with kind of the low-hanging fruit. The post-Trump economy has  been confusing, with low Q4 growth, yet record-setting stock market levels. So  let me just throw you an easy one here. What does the Fed see as the outlook  for the next year?\n\nPresident Dudley : For  the near-term I think more of the same. I mean, we think the economy is going  to continue to grow, a little bit above-trend. That's going to generate job  gains that put, you know, more pressure on the labor market, and as a  consequence of that, we think inflation's going to move back towards our 2%  objective.\n\nSo,  you know, we could be completely wrong, but that – the data that's come out  over the last couple of months, is very consistent with that pattern.\n\nA  lot of uncertainty in the outlook. I mean we don't know what's going to happen  with the whole host of policy choices: healthcare reform, immigration policy,  trade policy, tax policy, fiscal policy. So, how that, how those policy  questions get answered will also be an important aspect in terms of how the  forecast actually falls.\n\nBut  the baseline forecast is pretty similar in 2017 to 2016, slowly above trend  growth, a little bit more pressure on the labor market, gradual rise in  inflation, back towards our 2% objective. And if that happens, if we stay on  that trajectory, I think as Chair Yellen said yesterday and today, we would  expect to gradually remove further monetary policy accommodation, snug up  interest rates a little further in the months ahead.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Well  I think that's somewhat encouraging, isn't it?\n\nPresident Dudley : But  the uncertainty around that forecast is pretty high.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Is  pretty high.  Although, you know, it's  interesting, think about the U.S., um, you know, our situation in the last  couple of years has clearly been improving. What's been interesting is seeing  the news out of Japan, that, you know, Japan seems to be able to keep out of  deflation, which they haven't for a long time. Even Europe seems to be eeking  some growth out.\n\nDo  – do you think everybody's going to be doing better or is this just a blip?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well,  I think that – a couple of things. Just let me touch on the U.S. first. One thing  that's interesting is post-election you've seen a pretty big improvement in  household and business confidence, especially business confidence among smaller  businesses.\n\nNow  it's hard to say how much weight to put on that because historically consumer  confidence goes up and down, and it doesn't just necessarily feed into consumer  spending. But the increase in business confidence is quite striking, especially  for smaller businesses. And so one of the big open questions that we're going  to be assessing over the next few months is: is that improvement in animal  spirits, so to speak, going to actually feed through and lead to more spending?\n\nSo,  I think where a year or two ago, I think our anxieties were more about the  risks to growth to the downside, so as that – well, a year ago, we were worried  about events in China, we were worried about uncertainties about Europe. I think  now the balance of risk is gradually shifting, where the possibility is that  growth could actually be stronger than expected, rather than weaker than  expected.\n\nThe  markets expect fiscal stimulus out of this Administration. That's another  factor that probably will over time tilt the equation more to the upside.\n\nBut  on fiscal policy, it's really hard to factor into your forecast at this point  because we don't know what it is, how big it is, or when it will happen. Other  than that, we have it completely nailed down.\n\nSo,  it's really hard to sort of put that into your forecast. And so the way I think  about the fiscal policy outlook is that we're probably going to get some fiscal  stimulus at some point.  And so that's  just another factor that maybe tilts the risk to the economy a little bit to  the upside.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : So,  Bill, how about we think a little bit more broadly. You talked about where – it  looks like interest rates are going up, at least that's what, you know…\n\nPresident Dudley : Gradually,  right.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : What  Janet Yellen indicated would happen. There's this interesting question, though,  about will interest rates over the next year go to quote normal levels, or is  there a new normal, right? I mean we've struggled through how many years now of  zero interest rates, and the distributional consequences those have had, is  there a \"new\" normal?  Do we  have an idea what that \"new normal\" is going to be?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well  I think if you look at what the FOMC publishes, the so-called Summary of  Economic Projections, one of the things that they forecast, we forecast, is the  long-run federal funds rate, where we think the federal funds rate is going to  end up in the long-run. So think five, six, seven years out. And that estimate  has come down over the last few years. So what that's telling you is that  people on the FOMC think that the normal federal funds rate is lower now than  it's been in the past.\n\nAnd  the idea behind that is a very simple one. One, there's probably still some  residual headwinds left over from the financial crisis that are going to  persist for some time. Think about how difficult it is to get a mortgage if  you're a lower credit-rated borrower today compared to 2005, 2006. And two,  productivity growth in the economy has been very anemic, and I think generally,  most economists think there's a relationship between productivity growth and  the inflation-adjusted level of interest rates in the economy.\n\nSo,  productivity growth is strong, you tend to have high real rates. At 2%  inflation you get a relatively high federal funds rate. If productivity growth  is weak, you have low real rates. Add 2% inflation, you get a little bit lower  level of interest rates.\n\nSo  generally, if you look at the FOMC projections, people think that the federal funds  rate in the medium term is going to more like 3% rather than the 4% that might  have been attained historically.\n\nNow  there's one little problem with this. Economists are terrible at actually forecasting  productivity growth. So just because productivity growth has been weak over the  last few years doesn't mean it will necessarily be weak over the next five  years.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Well,  it's a tricky one. Here's one that's tricky, too. Are there issues connected  with financial market valuations that concern you? And that's kind of the  grown-up question. Here's the one we all want to know. Any predictions on the Dow  reaching 30,000 this year?\n\nPresident Dudley :\n\nNo  way.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Oh,  quick, call your brokers.\n\nPresident Dudley : Let's  put it this way, if it did reach 30,000, I would be concerned about the stock  market valuation. I think one of the things that's interesting post the election  is, I think the uncertainty level about policy has gone up enormously, yet  markets have actually performed very well, especially the equity market.\n\nAnd  that's actually pretty unusual. Usually markets don't like uncertainty. And so,  one thing to ask yourself the question is, why are markets going up even though  the uncertainty level has climbed so much?\n\nI  think one of the reasons, perhaps, is the notion that political deadlock in  Washington is going to ease. Another thing is maybe fiscal policy is going to  ride in and provide some support for the economy. But it's an unusual  environment, where uncertainty level goes up and the stock market goes up.  There's a little tension there between those two things.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : The  VIX which is –\n\nPresident Dudley : Well,  that's the other thing. Volatility in the market is extraordinarily low. So,  that's another thing that doesn't quite fit. You would think if uncertainty was  high, you'd have a little bit more volatility. If I was going to write  something down as a prediction, I guess I would think volatility will go up. At  some point.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Well,  it is a confusing structure right now. I think it's hard for anyone to kind of  predict this economy. But that kind of makes it fun. Let's talk about something  else that is somewhat hard to fathom. What are your thoughts on the election?  Let me make it a little more – are there lessons from the election that you  think are particularly important for the economy going forward?\n\nPresident Dudley :\n\nWell,  obviously, the Federal Reserve is completely apolitical, so we don't take sides  in terms of elections, and whether the Democrats or Republicans win. But I do  think there is an interesting lesson in the election in the sense of support  around the country and around the world for globalization, and why that support  did not seem to manifest itself in terms of our election outcome.\n\nYou  know, I think that globalization has lifted literally hundreds of millions of  people out of poverty over the last decade or two. And so I think net-net from  my perspective it's been a good thing. But people have been left behind from  globalization. I think a lot of people in the United States didn't put enough  weight on those people. You look at income distribution in the United States it’s  become a lot more skewed. You look at income mobility in the U.S., it's not  very good.\n\nI  think those are things that we really need to work on is the country.  I think we really want to make it so that globalization  lifts all boats rather than just some boats because if you don't have that,  you're not going to have support for globalization. You're not going to have  support for free trade. And if you don't have that, then I think that has its own  set of consequences.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Yes,  well, I think you've raised a great point, that there are both positive and  negative consequences of globalization. Let me raise something that may have  similar negative and positive, and that's the impact of technology. I think  we're all beginning to see a brave new world in which technology is entering  ways that even 10 years ago were hard to fathom. And you know, I think that  just as globalization seems to have made people nervous about the future, so  has technology.\n\nNow,  what are your thoughts on that? Is technology going to be the bigger influence  over the next decade? Is that what's going to change our economy and the  ability of people to make that leap-up that you just talked about?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well  I think technology is always challenging. I think it's been challenging for  decades, even centuries. My mom for many years lived in Westville, Massachusetts,  and if I have this right, it was the buggy whip capital of the world at one  point.\n\nWell,  Westville had to make the transition from being the buggy whip capital of the  world to other things. And I think – so, I don't think this is new. I don't  think this is a new story about technology.\n\nWhat  I think is what's new is we have to do a better job in terms of retraining  people, getting people the mobility they need so they can actually feel that  they have a place in the new economy.\n\nI  was thinking about this question about technology and you think about the U.S.  farm sector. You think about how many people in the United States worked on  farms in 1900 and how few people work on farms today. Same kind of tech, same  science and process of technological transition, but the good news is we were  able to find things for those people to do.\n\nPeople  always have for many, many years, talked about how technology is going to put  everyone out of work, and everyone's just going to have a lot of leisure. That  has not panned out up to now at all, and so I'm just a little bit skeptical  that now we're at that critical turning point. I could be wrong. This time  could be different. But if you think about how long we've had these  conversations about technology obsoleting everyone's skills and leading to  massive unemployment, this has been a conversation that we've been having for  hundreds of years, literally.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : It's  tricky now, though, isn't it? I mean in the past, I think you used to think  about technology as taking away some of the lower-skilled jobs, and yet now  we're seeing it kind of marching its way up. I think it'll be awhile before it  gets to Fed presidents. But I know…\n\nPresident Dudley : Well,  there are some people in Washington that would like to make us conduct monetary  policy by a rule.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : And  there you go, a robot can do it.\n\nPresident Dudley : We  don't think that's such a good idea, by the way. Maureen O’Hara\n\nIt's  an interesting challenging, and particularly here I saw some numbers the other  day that the high school graduation rate in New York state is somewhere in the  70 percentage points. And again, as you think about the technology creating  winners and losers, you know, obviously we’re in education, all of us are  committed to education, you know. Is that kind of crucial to the technology  solution? What do we do with the people who don't?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well,  I think – I mean look, I think education is absolutely essential. Giving people  the skills they need to sort of navigate in the 21st century  economy.\n\nAnd  the second thing we need to do a better job is actually retraining people so that  the only education you get shouldn't just be when you're 18 to 22 years old or  25 years old. We need to have a better system where people can sort of retool  themselves.\n\nI  think a third thing we can do is a better job of matching the skills that  people get in universities to the business needs. One of the things that we've  been talking about for a long time is that the New York Fed has tried to have  better partnerships between businesses and education, so that the skills that  people are getting when they go to the university match the opportunities when  they actually graduate.\n\nAnd  I think we've made a lot of progress on that, but that's something that I think  we could even do better on going forward.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Can  you turn us back to monetary policy again for a minute because, you know, one  could argue that one of the major forces that helped us get through the crisis  was monetary policy, with its expansive, you know, quantitative easing with the  role that the central bank took up and really helped keep the financial markets  from collapsing, and now also keeping the economy from collapsing.\n\nNow  we have, as you mentioned earlier, the prospect for more fiscal stimulus, which  in some ways makes it a little better…\n\nPresident Dudley : Potentially.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Because  it's not just monetary policy, we’ll have fiscal policy. But we also have a  variety of other factors that may influence monetary policy. One of which is  the possibility that we as a country are going to become more isolationist. And  that has implications, doesn't it?  For  your monetary policy and how you implement it?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well,  I think we – as I said before, I think we have a lot of uncertainty about  what's going to happen on immigration and trade. Most economists – the  overwhelming number of economists – think that open and free trade is a good  thing, comparative advantage, you want to produce the goods and services that  you're best at producing and let other people produce the goods and services  that they're best at producing, and that actually generates gains for both  sides. That's really the theory of trade.\n\nSo  I think that’s – so I think we don't want to lose sight of that. Obviously, to  the extent that we – I think it's very – it's way too soon to sort of see how this  is going to evolve. It could evolve in the direction where we negotiate hard  and we get somewhat better trade deals for the U.S. and trade barriers around  the world don't go up very much at all, if at all. That's probably not a bad  outcome for the U.S., and I don't think it's a bad outcome for the world. Or  you could go down the path that was quite a bit more pessimistic than that.\n\nSo,  I think it's just too soon to sort of see which direction. You know, the Federal  Reserve is going to obviously take the world as it is. I mean we – our objectives  are set by Congress. Very clearly, maximum sustainable employment in the  context of price stability. So we have two goals: employment and inflation.\n\nAnd  if the world is a really good place, it maybe makes it a little easier to  achieve those goals. And if the world is at a more difficult place, maybe it  makes it a little harder to achieve those goals. But it doesn't change our  goals, and it doesn't change our monetary policy mission.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Let  me turn that, our focus, just a tiny bit. You've been a leading critic of  culture in the banking industry, and I kind of have a two-part question here.  Do you think the era of bad behavior in banking is behind us? And here's the  second part of the question:  some people  would argue that the behavior wasn't really that bad but instead the  regulators…\n\nPresident Dudley : Who  are those people?\n\nMaureen O’Hara : There  was Elizabeth Warren, I'll say that, I think she’s convinced. But some people  would argue that the regulators used the opportunity to extract excessive fines  from banks for behavior that maybe wasn't ideal but wasn't so horrible. There's  two different perspectives. I think no matter how we look at it, some of the  behavior of the banks was sort of unacceptable. Are we past that, do you think?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well,  first thing I would say is a lot of the behavior was just totally egregious,  totally unacceptable. Not in the gray area. You know people talk about, well,  it's hard to know where to operate in a gray area, I think a lot of the  behavior was way over the line.\n\nWhen  people are getting together in chat rooms trying to talk about how they can  collude to rig a market, that's not in the gray area. That's way over the line.\n\nWhen  people are consciously doing things to evade any money laundering rules and  sanctions, that's not in a gray area, that's way over the line.\n\nSo  I feel that most of the things that have resulted in fines can be tied to things  that are not in a gray area. They're just way over the line. Now  the question of whether the fines are excessive – I mean it's hard to know how  you take the behavior and then map it back onto the fine. I think the important  thing, though, is to make the fines big enough so that the senior management of  these institutions doesn't just say, \"Well, I can just write a check,  accept the bad behavior, and move on.\"\n\nIf  the fines are substantial, then it actually gets some senior management’s  attention, and I think that's one of the reasons why banks are working harder  on the issues of culture in their institutions.\n\nI've  actually been very – you know, you asked me the question, is bank bad behavior  over? I expect not because I think there's always people that test the limits  of the law and regulation and are always trying to see where they can go. And there  are obviously going to be bad apples in any really large organization.\n\nWhat  I hope is that, one, the banks will sustain their effort to improve their cultures.  Banks really are working on this. I spoke at a bank industry conference about a  month ago, where they brought in all their very high potential mid-level people  to talk about culture, and it was really them talking about bank culture and I  came in for a very short period. I think I was the only person from the  official sector that spoke there.\n\nAnd  I thought the fact that they were taking all these people that are  high-performers and spending a day trying to inculcate them with the importance  of culture maybe suggests that we've passed a tipping point. So, that's  important.\n\nI  think the other thing that I'm hoping to see is the banks start to cooperate a  little bit more with each other and share best practices on bank culture. Up to  now it's been most banks working sort of on their own thing alone. I think if  they actually shared best practices, shared survey results, to see how they  were doing relative to their peers, that would also help them perform.\n\nAnd  the last thing I would say on culture, I think we've got to continue to work on  incentives. I have a very simple mantra. Incentives drive behavior. Behavior  sets social norms. And those social norms define culture. So if you have the  wrong incentives, you're probably going to have bad culture. If you have the  right incentives, you're probably going to have a much better culture.\n\nOne  thing that Preet Bharara said when he came to a conference we had at the New  York Fed, he said one of the big challenges that he sees is that people don't  speak up early enough when they see something wrong going on. He said that if  people spoke up early, a lot of these big things would never have been big  things. They would have been little things.\n\nAnd  so, the important thing also is to really educate people that it's okay if you  see something that bothers you, that you're not comfortable with, raise your  hand. You're not doing anybody a favor by keeping silent, hoping it will go  away. You're not doing anybody a favor by thinking, well, if I raise my hand,  I'm sort of tattling on my colleagues. That is not the right way to think about  it.\n\nBad  behavior is not good for you, it's not good for the institution. And so, if you  do see bad behavior, or something that you're not really sure whether it's bad  behavior or not, raise your hand and raise it to your manager, and have a conversation  about it.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Well,  I think, I hope you're right that we're reaching a new awareness of the fact  that some behaviors just can't be accepted. You know, I don't care whether  they're legal or not. They're over any kind of ethical lines. And we shall see,  it's a new world, isn't it?\n\nPresident Dudley : Yeah.  It's very important that people understand that the idea is not to just perform  to the regulation and the legal law. And one of the things we have, because we  have a very legalistic system with lots of regulations with banks – people  sometimes feel like, \"Oh, well, given that, I can do anything within those  parameters.\"\n\nWell,  the world changes faster than the regulations and law can sort of keep up. And  so, using that as your guide in terms of what's good behavior, permissible  behavior, I think is a very bad, bad guide.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Well  let me turn to one last question, and then we'll open it up to all of you. Would  repeal of parts of Dodd-Frank, the Volcker Rule, be a good thing for the  financial system? Any predictions about what's going to happen with financial  regulation going forward?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well,  I think that it's certainly going to be looked at, and obviously we'll have to  see how it makes its way through the House of Representatives and the U.S.  Senate. I'm perfectly – I think it makes sense to look at the Dodd-Frank Act,  to see which parts are working and which parts are not working so well.\n\nI  mean, when I sort of think about the Dodd-Frank Act, I think there's really two  things that we're trying to accomplish here. Number one, we're trying to make  the probability of failure of large complex financial institutions a lot lower  than it was before. So that means more capital, more liquidity, better  governance, better risk management. And we want to keep all those things.\n\nAnd  the second thing we're trying to do is that if a firm does get into trouble, we  can actually allow it to fail without it threatening to take down the rest of  the financial system. So that means you need good resolution regimes, and you  need a financial system where you don't have a lot of vulnerabilities.\n\nYou  know, one thing, for example, that we've accomplished over the last year is  we've had money market fund reform. Money market funds were one of the  accelerants of the crisis after Lehman Brothers failed.\n\nSo,  fixing the financial system to address some of those structural weaknesses is  also important. So I think keeping that part of Dodd-Frank, central clearing of  derivatives, I think is something that makes the financial system more robust.  Keeping all those parts I think makes a lot of sense.\n\nVolcker  Rule? You could probably do the Volcker Rule in a more efficient way to achieve  the same objectives without the burden of regulation that you have right now.  You know, right now, if you're an equity trading desk and the equity market  falls very violently, you really aren't supposed to go in and buy equities  unless you actually have customer orders. So, you actually have this crazy  situation where the equity desk can't actually buy equities to support the  market. So,  I'd like to see the Volcker Rule looked at to see if there's a way of doing it  in a way that – if you're a client-facing business, and you're trading your own  asset class, you have a little bit more freedom to buy and sell when markets  are volatile and maybe provide actually a little liquidity support in the  market. But also make it a lot easier, I think, to enforce the Volcker Rule.\n\nThe  other thing I would say is relief for smaller banking institutions. The  financial crisis was not about small banking institutions. It was about large  banking institutions and particularly it was about large broker-dealers. And so  I think the Dodd-Frank Act imposed a lot of compliance and regulatory costs on  smaller banking institutions.\n\nAnd  I think – we have about 6,500 smaller banks in the United States plus a lot of  credit unions and other financial intermediaries. Relief for those guys I think  would be really, really valuable because the burden on them, they feel that  burden disproportionately because they don't have as big an asset base to  spread all those compliance costs across. And I think it has more of a real  consequence because a lot of these institutions support small business lending,  which I think is really important to have a vibrant economy.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : So  given the two goals you said that there were for the Dodd-Frank Act, it does  make you wonder how the Congo Minerals Relief Act ever got into the Dodd-Frank.  But maybe we'll leave the Congo Minerals for another night. Well, I think the  issues we've talked about here have covered a wide range of areas, and let me  turn it open to the audience here and see if we can come up with some other  questions. How about you? Yes.\n\nAudience Member :\n\nYou  alluded to China and the concerns we had about it last year that have now gone  away. Why do you think the narrative changed on that, why do you think China is  doing better? Also, you know, we're seeing more about rising inflation, so is  this really about rising inflation or is it about the end of the  disinflationary-deflationary scare? Thank you.\n\nPresident Dudley : Well  I think last January, early February, the markets were under a lot of distress.  There was a big flight to risk aversion and markets went down pretty hard  around the globe. I think part of the story was China, but I think part of the  story was also worries about the slowdown in China leading to a big commodity  bust, and that commodity bust then putting a lot of pressure on especially  emerging market economies that were actually selling a lot of the products to  China.\n\nChina's  been on a much more sort of stable growth path this year. They've also  clarified what their foreign exchange rate regime is. So I think people are a  lot more comfortable in terms of how they're managing the renminbi.\n\nI  think there are still challenges in China and they're still trying to reorient  their economy from investment-led growth to consumption-led growth. They're  still an economy that I think that credit is growing quite rapidly and so you  sort of worry about how sustainable that is over the long-run.\n\nBut  I think it's much less of a focus of the markets today than it was a year ago,  and I think the anxiety about the emerging market economies is much more  focused on individual countries rather than sort of broad like it was a year  ago.\n\nI  mean financial conditions really, if you look at the financial markets post-election,  we've seen stocks up, we've seen the dollar a little bit firmer. We've seen  credit spreads narrow quite a bit, and we've seen bond yields up a little bit. But  net-net, financial conditions haven't actually changed very much post-election.  That was very different a year ago. Financial conditions were actually tightening  quite sharply a year ago. And it wasn't really clear how far that was actually  going to run.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : There  we go, question?\n\nAudience Member :\n\nCan  you talk a little bit about balance sheet normalization, how you think about  that in the context of monetary policy? In the September FOMC, you guys talked  about thinking about balance sheet normalization in terms of when your rate  hikes are well under way. What does \"well under way\" mean, how are  you thinking about that?\n\nPresident Dudley : I'm  sure \"well under way\" means different things with different people. I  think the -- we made it pretty clear in terms of our statements that we sort of  want the active tool of policy to be short-term interest rates. And the balance  sheet to be sort of in the background. We've also said that we wanted to get  some room off the zero bound before we actually start to normalize the balance  sheet, to end the reinvestment.\n\nNow  I think my own personal view is, how soon you want that process to start  depends not just about how much margin you have between the current federal funds  rate and zero, but also how confident you are that you're actually not going to  need to reduce the federal funds rate in the near-term.\n\nSo,  to the extent that we become more confident, if we become more confident about  the economic outlook, that the recovery will be sustained, then I think that  for me – speaking for myself, and only myself – that might make me a little bit  more comfortable to proceed with balance sheet normalization a little bit more  quickly.\n\nI  think the important thing here is that when balance sheet normalization occurs  and we start to end the reinvestment, don't think of it as an active tool of  policy. Think of it as a passive tool, number one. And number two, to the  extent that we then do decide at some point in the future to taper or end the  reinvestment, that will also be a way of removing accommodation. And so that  would be a bit of a substitute for raising short-term interest rates.\n\nSo,  I would guess, my own personal view, is if we move to balance sheet  normalization, that might actually stretch out the process of raising  short-term interest rates a little bit because the two are substitutes for one  another in terms of removing monetary policy accommodation.\n\nThe  Chair said in her testimony that this is something we're going to be looking at  over the coming meetings. We want to make sure that we know exactly what we  want to do long before we have to do it, and so obviously the discussion and  contemplation of what the right strategy is here needs to start relatively  early, so it can be done absolutely as soon as you actually might want to do  something.\n\nPeople  sometimes think that when we start talking about something in the minutes that  that means that we're going to do something momentarily. Usually it takes a  while for us to develop those themes and issues, and reach a consensus.\n\nSo,  I wouldn't take a lot of signals just because it was in the minutes last time  and something here is imminent.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Well,  you'll have a few openings, too, in the FOMC that have to get filled in before  you'll get full strength. So again, a slightly different Federal Reserve Board  going forward, too.\n\nPresident Dudley : Yes.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : An  excellent point, an excellent point. What have we got?  Here we go.\n\nAudience Member :\n\nIf  the new Administration continues with this isolationist policy, is able to  successfully put tariffs on imports, would that have an inflationary impact and  would the Fed have to address that?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well,  again, I don't think that's – I don't really think that's the professed goal of  the Administration. I think the Administration wants better trade deals and not  – I think the question is whether they'll get better trade deals without  actually having to put, you know, higher trade barriers in place.\n\nObviously  to the extent that trade barriers go up and that would tend to raise import  prices, that would feed into price level in terms of inflation, and so  obviously, we had to take that into consideration in terms of how we do  monetary policy.\n\nBut  going to be happening in a dynamic world where a lot of other things are going  on. So, I wouldn't want to take one thing and say, “Oh, if that happens, we're  going to do X,” because it really depends on, one, it’s highly speculative what's  going to happen on trade policy, and two, even if it happened, it would depend  on magnitude and it would depend on a lot of other things that are going on.\n\nSo  I think it's really hard to speculate about something like that.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Okay,  I see some hands way back there. So if you can hand the microphone to someone  who's got their hand up, way back there, that'd be great.\n\nAudience Member :\n\nRecently,  it's been speculated that the Trump trade policy actually will evolve into a  border tax. It's been in the works in the Republican Party for the last several  years. This would simply entail an increase across-the-board in taxation on  imports and an equal proportional across-the-board decrease on all exports.\n\nFirst  question would be, what do you think of this type of proposal? And second, if  this were implemented, what do you forecast the impact to be?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well,  there's been a lot of discussion in Washington about this border tax  adjustment. If you were starting with a corporate tax code from scratch, it  would be, I think, quite attractive in a lot of ways because it basically  eliminates a lot of the incentives to engage in games of transfer pricing. It  reduces a lot of the incentives to book your intellectual property abroad.\n\nSo,  it actually has a lot of attractive features. I think the challenge is that  it's very different than the current tax regime, and so there really would be  some pretty significant adjustment costs and frictions of moving from the  current regime to that new regime.\n\nAnd  so, I think the question is really going to be: do people think those  adjustment costs are a price worth paying for what I would agree is probably a  better corporate tax regime. Certainly, a much better tax regime than the one  we have today.\n\nBut  you know, there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be worried  about how that adjustment is going to affect their particular industry. If  you're an importer, you're going to be worried that your price of imports is  going to go up. Some  people argue that the dollar will move proportionately with the size of the  import tax, so the import prices won't go up at all in dollar terms.\n\nBut,  you know, that's theory, and people worry about how it will actually work in  practice. So, I think this is just going to be a very heavily debated topic in  Washington in the coming weeks and months.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : I  think we have time for maybe one or two more. Let's let some people in the back  again.\n\nAudience Member :\n\nHi,  Mr. Dudley, nice to hear from you. I've got lots of questions, but I guess  everyone gets to only ask one.\n\nPresident Dudley : You  can ask more than one, but I'll only answer one.\n\nAudience Member :\n\nOkay,  so, I was going to ask some sort of structuralist post-Ricardian question, but  I'll set that one aside.\n\nPresident Dudley : Thank  you.\n\nAudience Member :\n\nOn  a similar vein, to what degree do you think that this challenging of facts and  these threats about what is truth and, you know, journalistic integrity, to  what degree did this affect the financial system and to what degree did this  confidence in what the Wall Street Journal might say or the New York Times  might say as a fact can affect confidence in financial institutions? And what  remedies do you have, or does the Fed have, to combat that?\n\nPresident Dudley : I  don't think I have any good real answers to that. I'll just have to say that  I'm fact-based. New York Fed is fact-based. And I hope we stay that way.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : Do  you have alternative facts? Just checking, just checking.\n\nPresident Dudley : Look,  I think a healthy debate is a good thing about what facts matter and how the  world works. You know, people can have different models about how the world  works and what's important, and what's not. But I think that they have to be  based on real evidence. So, I'm going to continue to live in my world, which is  very much fact-based.\n\nMaureen O’Hara : I  think we have time for one more question, and we have someone back there who's  got a mike.\n\nAudience Member :\n\nYeah,  Mr. Dudley, I have a question. You mentioned that there was some nefarious  behavior by banks. I heard you mention that there was some nefarious behavior  going on by banks during the financial crisis.\n\nPresident Dudley : Well,  the employees of banks.\n\nAudience Member :\n\nOk,  employees of banks. My question is, there was – some of the big banks,  including J.P. Morgan and Bank of America, basically bailing out the government  and the FDIC, buying institutions like Countrywide, Merrill Lynch, Washington  Mutual.\n\nIn  some of these cases, they were given winks and nods by the government that they  were not going to be held accountable for let's say the sins of these  institutions that they took over.\n\nBut  then what happened, they did this, and then later on, these institutions were  fined billions of dollars by the government. And I guess my question is would  you call this nefarious behavior on the part of the government to do this to  these companies that basically helped out the government and the FDIC, in  taking over these insolvent institutions?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well,  I wasn't part of any of those conversations, so I don't know what winks or nods  were actually exchanged.\n\nLook,  I think the banks are, people are, managers are big boys and girls. And I think  when they were making these transactions, they had the ability to negotiate  whatever terms and conditions that they wanted to negotiate.\n\nNow,  I understand that there's some bad feelings after the fact, to the extent that  the sins of the institutions that were acquired went along with those entities.  But it'd be a little bit sad if you can have institutions do lots of bad things  and then have them acquired and then have their sins sort of automatically  forgiven because they were acquired by another institution. That would be a  sort of \"get out of jail free\" card. And so I'm not sure that's  necessarily the right approach either.\n\n[END  OF SESSION]",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to be able to comment on this year’s U.S. Monetary Policy Forum paper.  As always, what I have to say here today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nTo say that I was interested in this year’s topic is an understatement.  The use of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has been an important element of U.S. monetary policy over the past decade.  The start of the reversal of that expansion—the so-called process of balance sheet normalization—has been a key focus of the FOMC’s monetary policy deliberations over the past year.  I am pleased that the start of this process—in contrast to the bond market taper tantrum of 2013—has been non-disruptive.  The normalization process is now running in the background, essentially on autopilot, with short-term interest rates serving as the primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy.\n\nLet me start with my main point: Although I agree with many of the authors’ findings in this year’s paper, I would take a much less skeptical view of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as a tool of monetary policy.  While additional study of the effects of large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs should be encouraged—as it furthers our understanding of the use of these unconventional monetary policy tools—the paper’s findings do not, in my mind, invalidate the use of LSAPs when the Federal Reserve is operating at or close to the zero lower bound for short-term interest rates.  That is the key issue—not the magnitude of the effects of LSAPs or whether short-term interest rates should be the primary tool of monetary policy.  On the latter point, which is consistent with the FOMC’s statements about policy normalization, I see broad agreement.\n\nConcluding that LSAPs are less powerful than suggested by some of the estimates from the event study literature does not imply that there is no role for LSAPs at the zero lower bound.  In such circumstances, LSAPs can be used to provide additional monetary accommodation by depressing bond term premia and the spread between agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and Treasury securities, as well as by strengthening the credibility of forward guidance on the path of short-term interest rates.  This can provide support to asset values more generally and make financial conditions more accommodative.  Thus, discarding such a tool or ruling out its use seems counterproductive for two reasons.  First, to the extent that such a tool can provide accommodation, ruling out its use would raise the risks of insufficient monetary policy accommodation when interest rates are pinned at the zero lower bound.  Second, expectations matter.  If households and businesses believe that the Fed has run out of tools to provide monetary policy accommodation or is unwilling to use certain tools for that purpose, the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored to the downside would increase, which would make it even more difficult for the central bank to achieve its goals.  For these reasons, LSAPs should be viewed as a viable tool in our arsenal to be used when the zero lower bound is a relevant policy concern.\n\nIn terms of calibration, if LSAPs are not as powerful as some of the event studies imply, the answer is not to simply discard the tool, but instead to look for ways to enhance its efficacy and use it more aggressively.  In this respect, I believe that LSAPs work best when they are open-ended.  In such circumstances, the use of the tool is likely to be helpful in reducing tail risks and making the bad states of the world less likely rather than signaling to market participants a significant deterioration in the Federal Reserve’s outlook.  LSAPs may also be a useful means of making forward guidance more credible.  If the monetary authority were to commit to a program of asset purchases until some economic objective is reached and, at the same time, were to make it clear that the policy rate would not begin to rise until the asset purchase program were completed, these steps might help anchor expectations about the likely path of short-term rates more effectively.  The Federal Reserve’s third round of LSAPs, which was open-ended, was an important innovation of policy that the paper might have discussed in greater detail.\n\nI also don’t agree with the paper’s conclusions about agency MBS purchases.  Such purchases do not represent “credit easing” as argued in the paper.  The government’s interventions to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have made it clear that there is no credit risk in the Federal Reserve’s purchase of such obligations.  Also, the authors don’t acknowledge that the ability to purchase agency MBS has two benefits.  First, it enables the Federal Reserve to purchase longer-duration assets at a faster pace without disrupting market functioning.  This facilitates larger LSAP programs, when a larger program is viewed as necessary.  Second, it opens up another channel by which asset purchases can provide stimulus—by narrowing the spread between agency MBS and Treasuries, the Federal Reserve can drive down long-term mortgage rates and provide support to the housing sector and to home prices.  When monetary policy is constrained at the zero lower bound for interest rates, being able to purchase agency MBS seems like a good tool to have available.\n\nI am also a bit baffled by the conclusion that the Fed should “consider larger and looser caps, possibly specified in terms of quarterly rather than monthly changes, with caps perhaps removed completely by 2019.”  It seems to me that the current process of balance sheet normalization is proceeding very smoothly.  We placed caps on redemptions because we wanted to limit the potential for market disruption that might occur if the amount of securities that had to be absorbed by private markets fluctuated unduly.  The cost of the caps in terms of delaying the shrinkage of the balance sheet is very low.  Even if the caps were to be removed completely at the end of 2018, it would most likely pull forward the timing of normalizing the balance sheet size by only two quarters.  The delay due to the caps is small because, when they are fully phased in, they are likely to be binding only for Treasuries and then only in the middle month of each quarter.\n\nWhile I don’t agree with some of the broader conclusions of the paper, I do agree that a healthy skepticism about event studies is warranted.  The major theme of the paper is that event studies that have sought to measure the impact of the Federal Reserve’s three major LSAP programs are flawed for a number of reasons.  These include potential selection bias of the events chosen and the fact that event studies may not capture all the factors that influence how market prices respond to LSAP announcements.\n\nThe first problem with event studies, of course, is the issue of how much new information is revealed by the actual policy announcement.  I would argue that LSAPs were always a possibility, so the probability of their use never went from 0% to 100%, even for the first LSAP program.  This suggests that event studies could lead to downwardly biased estimates of the impact of LSAPs.  In fact, if the announcement indicated that the program was smaller than expected, then bond yields could rise on the program’s announcement.  This scenario could occur even though the overall program—including its anticipation—was effective in reducing yields.  This makes interpreting the direction of changes in bond yields on the day of an announcement difficult.\n\nThe second problem with event studies is that there are always other things going on.  When the Fed announces an LSAP program, long-term rates might drop because of the announcement, or because market participants were revising downward their views about the state of the economy and the economic outlook in light of the Fed’s actions.  Or, conversely, long-term yields could conceivably even rise as market participants became more confident that the policy actions would be sufficient to push the economy toward the central bank’s goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.\n\nThe third problem with event studies is the difficulty in disentangling the various factors behind the moves in long-term yields.  If an open-ended LSAP program pushes back the perceived timing of short-term rate hikes, it will be difficult to apportion the impact on long-term yields between LSAPs and an expectation of a flatter path for short-term rates.\n\nThese conclusions argue for putting less reliance on event studies to measure the impact of LSAPs, rather than more.  In this regard, I would advocate taking a different tack: rely more on an evaluation of bond term premia to assess the potential impact of LSAPs.  Bond term premia currently are unusually low, and I suspect that LSAP programs here and abroad have been an important factor.  Evaluating the factors that have been affecting bond term premia over time might be a good alternative way of estimating the impact of LSAPs.\n\nTo sum up, while the impact of LSAPs on long-term bond yields is likely lower than what is implied by some of the event study literature, this does not mean that LSAPs aren’t a useful tool when the FOMC is constrained by the zero lower bound.  LSAPs can not only narrow bond term premia, but also make forward guidance more credible.  Thus, LSAPs remain useful to have in the toolkit for those times when the short-term interest rate tool may not be available.",

    "text": "Over the past few years, I have been engaged in a series of outreach meetings all across my Federal Reserve District. For example, in 2010 I visited several upstate cities. Early last year I made visits to various parts of the city—Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens—and to Puerto Rico. In August, I met with community and business leaders and elected officials in Newark, Patterson and Jersey City. In November, I went to West Point and the Capital region.\n\nI consider these visits just as important as my trips to Washington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy or to Switzerland to help shape international bank regulation. Each visit within the region helps me to deepen the relationships with the people I represent. I believe that the understanding of issues and concerns that I gain today will help ensure that the Fed's policy decisions reflect the public interest in the broadest sense.\n\nToday, I want to talk with you first about the Fed—what we do and why we do it. Then I'll provide some thoughts about the economic outlook nationally and locally. How the economy performs is important in many ways. At the personal level, for example, it affects your family's finances and students' job prospects at graduation time. Collectively, it affects the potential of our nation to confront and deal with the many challenges we face.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nWhat the New York Fed Does By way of introduction, I will briefly review what the New York Fed does and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nI am vice chair of the FOMC, which meets eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. The members of this committee all strive to set policy to advance the mandate given to us by Congress to promote the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability. Sometimes we have different views on the specific policy choice at hand, and you should view this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions— particularly at times like this. In fact, I think we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike. But we are united in our commitment to our dual mandate and in our belief that Fed independence is essential to the public interest, because it allows us to make tough decisions insulated from short-term political pressures.\n\nAt FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region and the nation. For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical information that we learn from listening to our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and community leaders, such as you and others I'll meet on this visit. This trip includes a meeting with the Long Island Housing Partnership—and a visit to some distressed neighborhoods, a tour of the D'Addario string factory and lunch with its workers; and concludes with a tour and meeting at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.\n\nAt the New York Fed, we continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of economic activity for New York City, the entire state of New York, and New Jersey. These indexes are essentially measures of local output—similar to gross domestic product, or GDP, at the national level. These measures provide a more complete gauge of activity than the employment report, which is another important metric at the state level. We have also constructed a consumer credit panel to track local household credit conditions, including the amount and type of personal debt and whether payments are being made in a timely way.\n\nIn addition, we have a periodic poll about the credit needs of small businesses, which are an important source of new jobs. We are just launching our latest survey that also includes questions about the skill needs of small businesses and if the right kinds of skilled labor are available. Almost 900 regional businesses responded to our last poll, of which roughly 5 percent were from Long Island. If you, as part of a small business, would like to participate in our current poll, please pass your card to my colleagues, who are in the audience, or see me after the speech and we will be glad to add you as a respondent.\n\nIn December, we hosted a workshop for small businesses in the New York City metro area to provide information about how they can export their products and services. The Export-Import Bank, the Small Business Administration and the U.S. Department of Commerce were on hand to tell participants how to tap demand in the global marketplace and what government programs are available to enhance credit and to increase lines of working capital. In 2012, we're further developing our small business program. We hope to partner with many of you to support the small business sector.\n\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as New York have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some key initiatives specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. Here on Long Island there are pockets that suffered greatly in the recession. In Nassau County, communities in Hempstead, Baldwin, Roosevelt and New Hyde Park have a foreclosure rate over four times the national average. * The same holds true for parts of Brentwood, Central Islip and Patchogue, in Suffolk County.\n\nWe have worked hard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates. Over the past three years, my staff has come to Long Island to meet with housing counselors and legal services practitioners. We have provided housing advocates with the latest information on mortgage conditions, via mortgage briefs, roundtables, presentations and newsletters. We have now developed an online resource that shows delinquency and foreclosure conditions in neighborhoods each month. We believe that this site will be a useful complement, aiding the work of housing counselors and other parties seeking to help these communities.\n\nTo share what we learn about our diverse District, we have a website, with detailed information about the region. I invite you to visit newyorkfed.org to explore our highly localized maps and information on small business, credit and housing conditions and even the latest job openings at the New York Fed.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington, D.C., and at other agencies to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing. Much has been done, yet much remains to be done and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues busy.\n\nNational Economic Conditions The incoming data on the U.S. economy has been a bit more upbeat of late, suggesting that the recovery may be finally establishing a somewhat firmer footing. Real GDP expanded at a 3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2011, the fastest growth since the first half of 2010. The average monthly gain in nonfarm payroll employment moved up to 256,000 in January and February from 164,000 in the fourth quarter. Sales of light-weight motor vehicles rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.1 million in February, the highest since early 2008. The ISM nonmanufacturing index rose for the third consecutive month in February and now stands at its highest level in a year. Even the housing starts data have firmed somewhat, although from quite depressed levels.\n\nWhile these developments are certainly encouraging, it is far too soon to conclude that we are out of the woods. To begin with, the economic data looked brighter at this point in 2010 and again in 2011, only to fade as we got into the second and third quarters of those years. 1 Moreover, the United States has experienced unusually mild weather over the past few months, with the number of heating degree days in January and February about 17 percent below the average of the preceding five years. While this reduces the amount that households and businesses must spend for heating, I suspect that it temporarily boosts economic activity overall. For example, the mild weather is certainly conducive to higher than normal levels of construction activity, and we did see a surge in hours worked in that sector over the past few months.\n\nMore importantly, real economic activity has yet to be strong enough on a sustained basis to make a big dent in the overall amount of slack in the U.S. economy. While it is true that growth was stronger in the fourth quarter, most of that growth was due to inventory accumulation. Growth of final sales was actually quite weak. Historically, a quarter in which inventory investment makes a significant growth contribution is typically followed by a quarter in which that growth contribution is modest or even negative. That appears to be what is shaping up for the first quarter of this year.\n\nBased on available data, current expectations are that real GDP will expand at around a 2 percent annual rate during the first quarter of 2012. Despite the increase of light vehicle sales, overall consumer spending has been sluggish. While growth of retail sales in February was reasonably strong in nominal terms, it was considerably less impressive when the large increase of gasoline prices that occurred that month is taken into account. Based on data for the first half of March, gasoline prices are continuing to move higher which will further sap consumers' real purchasing power. And growth of business investment spending, which was quite strong in the second and third quarters of 2011, entered the new year with little forward momentum.\n\nTo put the recent pace of growth into perspective, we believe that the economy's long-run sustainable growth rate (what economists call the potential growth rate) is around a 2 1/4 percent annual rate. We need sustained growth above that rate to absorb the substantial amount of unused productive capacity. Thus, our recent growth rates are barely keeping up with our potential.\n\nAlthough the sharp decline in the unemployment from 9 percent last September to 8.3 percent in February suggests we are doing better than that, it is important to recognize that about half of that decline was due to a declining labor force participation rate. In fact, had the labor force participation rate not declined from around 66 percent in mid-2008 to under 64 percent in February, the unemployment rate would still be over 10 percent. Also, it appears that productivity growth has slumped recently. Although that means that a given amount of growth translates into bigger employment gains, it certainly is not an unmitigated good development.\n\nAlso, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the economy still faces significant headwinds and there are some meaningful downside risks. In the headwinds department, I would include the run-up in gasoline prices mentioned earlier because that will sap purchasing power, the continued impediments to a strong recovery of the housing sector, and fiscal drag at the federal and state and local levels. In terms of downside risks, these include the risk that growth abroad disappoints and the risk of further disruptions to the supply of oil and higher oil prices.\n\nOn the inflation front, the overall rate of increase of consumer prices, as measured by the 12-month change of the consumer price index slowed to 2.9 percent in February from a recent peak of 3.9 percent last September. Despite the recent rise of gasoline prices mentioned above that may interrupt this pattern, we expect this moderation in the growth rate of consumer prices to resume later this year. While the underlying core inflation rate, that strips out volatile food and energy prices, has been somewhat higher than expected a few months back, it appears that the annual rate of core inflation 2 has peaked and we expect it to begin to decline later this year. 3 Finally, inflation expectations, which play an important role in the inflation process, remain well anchored. By this I mean that people expect that the rate of inflation will continue to be relatively low for some time to come.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions So how is the recovery proceeding in the state and the region? As I mentioned, the New York Fed produces indexes that help us track economic activity in the region. Based on these measures, the economic recovery got underway in both New York State and New York City in late 2009, and economic activity has continued to expand through early 2012.\n\nThe New York Fed also conducts the monthly Empire State Manufacturing Survey to monitor conditions for regional manufacturers. The most recent survey, for which a number of Long Island firms participated, points to continued expansion in manufacturing activity throughout the first quarter of 2012 and heightened optimism about the general business outlook.\n\nRecently released employment revisions indicate that the economic recovery has taken hold on Long Island. But there still is a long way to go. Employment on the island declined by a little over 4 percent in the downturn—a steep drop, to be sure, but only about two-thirds of the decline that occurred nationally. Since bottoming out in late 2009, employment here on the island has rebounded by almost 2 1/2 percent. So we've come a bit more than halfway back to the early 2008 peak.\n\nMoreover, these job gains have come despite ongoing job cuts in local government. While other parts of the region sustained job losses in local government starting in 2010, Long Island's just started in the spring of last year, creating a drag on the labor market overall. Nevertheless, the private sector has picked up the slack. This is most pronounced in professional and business services, finance, leisure and hospitality, and health care. Even the island's manufacturing sector has added jobs over the past year.\n\nAnother sign that a recovery is taking hold on Long Island is that banks that were created just before or just after the financial crisis—while only a small portion of the local market—are starting to show signs of growth.\n\nLong Island's labor market has also been aided by its proximity to New York City. With a large portion of the island's workforce commuting to New York City, especially from Nassau County, the brisk job creation we've seen in the city has helped matters here as well. Unemployment here on the island topped out at 7.6 percent back in late 2009, and it has hovered around 7 percent for most of the past year—a high rate to be sure, but well below both the national and state levels.\n\nTurning to the housing market—there matters are more dreary. After more than doubling between 2000 and 2006, home prices on Long Island are down more than 20 percent from their peak and prices have yet to show any strong signs of bottoming out. This weakness is underscored by our latest quarterly consumer credit panel data. This dataset shows that mortgage delinquency rates on the island are much higher than in other parts of the state and continued to edge higher in the fourth quarter of last year. 4\n\nThe housing crisis also has also put pressure on local school finances. Historically, the island has been heavily dependent on local sources for its school funding, and the housing debacle has generated a sharp drop in local property tax revenue. State aid has been generally insufficient to make up for these losses and school administrators have been forced to cut both instructional and non-instructional spending.\n\nDespite some of these ongoing problems, I believe that the long-term outlook for Long Island's economic growth is quite positive. The island's workforce is particularly well educated, with well over a third of adults holding a college degree. It has a sizeable industrial base, which is concentrated in high-tech manufacturing. Moreover, Brookhaven Labs and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, as well as a fine array of academic institutions, provide a strong foundation for the island's tech sector and business sector more broadly. The recent move to create stronger ties between the business community, research labs and SUNY (State University of New York) is a welcome development. It has the potential to help leverage the island's existing assets to enhance the prospects for economic development.\n\nConclusion To sum up, the incoming data on the U.S. economy has been a bit more upbeat of late, suggesting that the recovery may be getting better established. But, while these developments are certainly encouraging, it is far too soon to conclude that we are out of the woods in terms of generating a strong, sustainable recovery. On the inflation front, the year-over-year rate of consumer price inflation has slowed in recent months, and despite the recent rise of gasoline prices, we expect inflation to moderate further in 2012.\n\nLooking ahead, the key challenge for the Long Island economy will be to continue to prepare its residents for the best jobs being created here. Expanding educational access and opportunity and the skills that go along with it will go a long way to broadening participation in the economy to all residents and bolstering Long Island in the future.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________ 1 This recurring pattern has led some economists to question whether the depth and duration of the Great Recession has distorted the usual patterns of seasonal adjustment. 2 As measured by the 12-month change in core CPI. 3 See for instance, the behavior of the three- and six-month core CPI. 4 For more information, see the New York Fed's consumer credit panel.\n\n* The foreclosure rate reference for these communities was calculated with a partial subset of active loans. While communities in Hempstead, Baldwin and Roosevelt have foreclosure rates far higher than the national average, analysis of a larger pool of loans reveals that New Hype Park’s foreclosure rate is in line with the national average. Visit the New York Fed’s Regional Mortgage Conditions webpage for additional information.",

    "text": "I thank you for this opportunity to speak to you today about what we at the\n  Federal Reserve have been doing to improve market function and credit market\n  access.   Since August of 2007, the Fed has introduced a wide range\n  of special facilities designed to improve market functioning, increase the\n  availability of credit and bring down borrowing costs for households and businesses.\n\nToday, I am going to focus my comments on the Term Asset-Backed Securities\n  Loan Facility (TALF), which in my view is one of our most innovative programs.  This\n  facility is a complement to the Public-Private Investment Program efforts being\n  undertaken by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Treasury, which\n  are the primary focus of today’s conference.\n\nIn what follows, I would remind you that my comments reflect my own views\n  and opinions and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee\n  or the Federal Reserve System.  I will discuss how the securitization\n  markets broke down last fall creating the need for TALF, how the TALF works\n  and what it already has accomplished, where we see it evolving going forward,\n  and finally, some preliminary thoughts on the future of securitization markets.\n\nAs you know, one of the origins of this crisis was the poor lending standards\n  and lax risk controls that led to significant losses among many of the firms\n  that dominate the financial industry.  As the magnitude and widespread\n  nature of these problems became evident in the early part of 2007, there was\n  an abrupt loss of confidence and a sharp and sustained increase in risk aversion\n  among investors.   Liquidity in short-term funding markets seized\n  up as concerns over the viability of many bank and non-bank financial institutions\n  increased.   Many of the Federal Reserve’s early efforts—including\n  the Term Auction Facility, Term Securities Lending Facility and the Primary\n  Dealer Credit Facility—were directly aimed at restoring the ability of\n  financial firms to obtain access to liquidity. And while it is still too\n  soon to declare victory on this front, there have been significant improvements\n  in interbank financing markets.\n\nThe next leg of policy intervention focused more directly on shoring up the\n  strength of our financial institutions with programs such as the Treasury’s\n  Capital Purchase Program and the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee\n  Program, and here too there has been progress in a number of dimensions.   Most\n  notably, perhaps, is that in the wake of the release of the results of the\n  recent stress test, the largest U.S. bank holding companies have shown an increased\n  ability to raise capital and issue debt without government support.   The\n  major securities firms have deleveraged and have built up significant liquidity\n  buffers.\n\nAlthough conditions in interbank funding markets and capital markets more\n  broadly have shown signs of improvement, securitization markets are still significantly\n  impaired.  This is particularly true of the asset-backed securities markets,\n  in which much of household and business credit is intermediated between borrowers\n  and investors.\n\nWhat has transpired in the asset-backed securities market over the past two\n  years has been dramatic.   Prior to August 2007, as much as 60% of\n  private credit creation in the U.S. was not held on the books of depository\n  institutions but was instead distributed onwards through the ABS markets into\n  the so-called “shadow banking system.”   Through the\n  use of ABS, banks were able to package consumer loans, credit card receivables,\n  student loans, residential and commercial mortgages, as well as other types\n  of loans into securities that were then sold to investors.\n\nHowever, since August 2007, the ABS market collapsed in a series of stages—first\n  subprime mortgages, then alt-A mortgages and non-agency Residential Mortgage\n  Backed Securities, and finally consumer ABS and Commercial Mortgage Backed\n  Securities or CMBS.  The collapse spanned every area outside of the agency\n  mortgage-backed securities market, which is supported by the government-sponsored\n  enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nThe final\n  stage of collapse of the ABS markets occurred following the failure of Lehman\n  Brothers last fall, when the yields on outstanding ABS issues soared and new\n  originations virtually disappeared.  This increase in yields did not solely\n  reflect an increase in credit risk; it also reflected a genuine loss of confidence\n  and an accompanying increase in risk aversion.   Yield spreads on\n  even the very safest ABS obligations soared hundreds of basis points.   This\n  can be seen in the fact that AAA-rated student loan tranches, with underlying\n  loans 97% guaranteed by the federal government, climbed to yield levels as\n  much as 400 basis points over LIBOR.\n\nWith the spike in yields, the economic incentives to issue evaporated—issuance\n  was just too costly and there was no active market.   After averaging\n  around $50 billion per quarter of new originations in 2007 and the first three\n  quarters of 2008, consumer ABS issuance plunged to only $4 billion during the\n  fourth quarter of 2008. Issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities ground\n  to a complete halt and this market currently remains closed.\n\nSo why did the ABS market collapse?  There are many reasons.\n\nOne factor was that in some areas, the risk management incentives of banks\n  and other issuers of ABS were misaligned with those of the end investors in\n  these securities.  This misalignment manifested itself in the overall\n  deterioration in lending standards that took place across the economy beginning\n  during the middle part of this decade.  Some originators did not do an\n  adequate job of due diligence because the underlying loans were swiftly moved\n  off their balance sheets through the securitization process.  This dynamic\n  should have been mitigated to some extent by the rating agencies as they assigned\n  ratings to these new securities, but that process too proved inadequate, especially\n  for residential real estate-related securities.  The problems associated\n  with these misaligned incentives for issuers and inadequate rigor on the part\n  of the rating agencies became apparent as the housing sector turned down and\n  the economy weakened.  The result was a dramatic spike in credit losses\n  and an almost complete loss of investor appetite for non-agency, residential\n  mortgage-backed product.\n\nA second factor contributing to the collapse of the ABS market was that the\n  benefits of pooling and distributing risk more widely proved to be somewhat\n  illusory.  In practice, the performance across different loans that collateralized\n  the securities was much more highly correlated than was anticipated, and the\n  risks associated with these securities was significantly more concentrated\n  than had been assumed.  Some banks that were unable to sell the highest-rated\n  tranches kept them on their books.  In other cases, the sales were made\n  to off-balance sheet vehicles, in which the banks retained residual risk.  This\n  correlation contributed to the aversion of investors to the asset class as\n  a whole.\n\nA third contributing factor was the fact that these securities were often\n  complex and heterogeneous and, thus, hard to value.   In a stressed economic\n  environment, this complexity exacerbated the erosion in market liquidity conditions,\n  which in turn led to a vicious circle of falling prices and even further diminished\n  liquidity.  The result was that some bank conduits and buyers of securitized\n  products such as SIVs became distressed and failed as mark-to-market losses\n  increased.  In the post-Lehman bankruptcy world—when liquidity was paramount—securitized\n  products were very difficult to trade, in part, because they were very difficult\n  to value.\n\nThe cessation of new asset-backed securitizations has been problematic because\n  banks have not had the capacity to keep credit flowing freely.   This\n  is especially true given that bank balance sheets were already under strain—bank\n  capital has been depleted by credit losses and bank balance sheet capacity\n  has been strained by an inability of banks to securitize new loan originations\n  and by the need for banks to honor their off-balance sheet obligations.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Federal Reserve determined that it was important\n  to augment the balance sheet capacity of the financial system by supporting\n  the ABS market.  This was the purpose of the TALF.   By providing\n  non-recourse, term financing for new AAA-rated consumer asset-backed securities\n  to investors, the TALF essentially provides the balance sheet capacity necessary\n  to facilitate the continued flow of credit to households and businesses.\n\nThe TALF offers three attributes that the private sector has had difficulty\n  providing during this time of financial and economic distress:  1) leverage\n  to purchase highly-rated, low-risk assets, 2) term financing and 3) protection\n  against very adverse economic outcomes.  TALF loans are leveraged—haircuts\n  against the AAA-rated collateral average about 10%; the loan terms are three\n  or five years; and the loans are non-recourse, which means that if the economy\n  performs very badly and the securities fall sharply in value, an investor can\n  put the collateral that secures its TALF loan back to the Fed, only losing\n  the collateral haircut.  The loan is then extinguished.\n\nBecause term, non-recourse financing is not readily available from the private\n  sector currently and the spreads on asset-backed securities remain elevated,\n  TALF provides an opportunity for investors to purchase AAA-rated consumer asset-backed\n  securities and earn relatively high returns.   Although some observers\n  are concerned by the prospect of TALF investors achieving relatively high returns,\n  I think that concern is misplaced.  Investor participation is absolutely\n  essential in order for the TALF to improve the availability of credit and to\n  bring down the cost of credit for households and business.  The prospect\n  of relatively high expected risk-adjusted returns is precisely what gives investors\n  an incentive to participate in the program.  As investors begin to take\n  advantage of the attractive TALF terms, spreads on ABS securities contracts,\n  and rates of return go down, and most importantly, the costs of funds for the\n  issuers of the underlying securities falls.   Investors’ actions\n  to seek attractive returns lead to lower borrowing costs for households and\n  businesses.\n\nDoes the possibility of attractive returns for TALF investors mean that the\n  Federal Reserve is taking on large credit risks?    I think the answer\n  is a clear “no,” principally because the returns earned by investors\n  primarily are due to the absence of sufficient private balance sheet capacity\n  rather than underlying credit risk.  In fact, from the Federal Reserve’s\n  perspective, the risk of loss is very low.   Indeed, there are three layers\n  of protection that stand between the Federal Reserve and losses.\n\nFirst, the underlying securities are AAA-rated, which means that losses on\n  the underlying loans have to be unusually large to move that high up in the\n  capital structure.   And although some of the rating agency models\n  have not held up well in the crisis, the consumer ABS models have proven to\n  be reasonably robust.  In other words, a AAA-rating still means quite\n  a bit in this market.  This is in contrast to the collateralized debt\n  obligation or CDO market , where AAA-rated securities often used subprime and\n  Alt-A mortgage loans as their raw ingredient.\n\nSecond, as noted earlier, the Fed has taken additional haircuts against the\n  underlying securities averaging about 10%.  These haircuts provide additional\n  protection to the Fed.\n\nThird, if the underlying collateral is put back to\n  the Fed, the Fed puts the collateral into a special purpose vehicle. In such\n  a situation, the Fed would be protected by the excess spread earned on the\n  TALF loans and Treasury-provided TARP capital. Only if those buffers were wiped\n  out, would the Fed suffer losses.\n\nWe have done stress simulations on the underlying loans.  We think it\n  is unlikely that the Treasury will lose money on this program, and it sits\n  ahead of the Fed in terms of its loss exposure.  The risk posed to the\n  Federal Reserve therefore seems quite remote.   Instead, we expect that\n  the program will be profitable for the taxpayers and will be successful in\n  pushing down yields and increasing credit availability.\n\nTurning from the issues of design and risk to issues concerning implementation\n  and effectiveness, we have been rolling the  TALF out in stages—first\n  the consumer ABS market, with the first subscriptions for TALF loans in March;\n  second, new CMBS securitizations that will start in early summer; and third,\n  legacy CMBS and, possibly legacy RMBS, later this summer.\n\nBy legacy assets, we mean highly-rated existing securitized assets that are\n  already outstanding.  The legacy TALF program will help support asset-backed-securities\n  prices.  This should help aid market liquidity and make financial firms\n  that hold such assets less vulnerable to the risk of further losses.\n\nSo far, the evidence indicates that the program is working as designed.\n\nFirst, the issuance of consumer ABS securities has been gradually reviving.\n  In March, four deals came to market worth $8.3 billion.   In April, there\n  were another 4 deals worth $2.9 billion.  In May, there were 8 deals worth\n  $13.6 billion and this week, there were 13 deals worth $16.4 billion.   We’re\n  not back yet to the $200 billion annual rate of issuance before the crisis\n  and we don’t expect to get there, but we are making a good start.  Moreover\n  the type of deals has broadened out to include a wide range of asset classes.\n  For example, this month’s deals included credit card, auto loan and lease,\n  equipment leasing, insurance premium and mortgage servicer securitizations.\n\nSecond, the market for such deals is not wholly reliant on TALF financing.  TALF\n  loans have accounted for a bit more than half of total issuance volume of ABS,\n  with considerable variability from subscription to subscription period.  We\n  view this as a good thing.  This means that the TALF is helping to restart\n  the market, rather than the TALF being the market.\n\nThird, and most importantly, spreads on consumer ABS have been coming down\n  sharply from their peak levels reached late last year.   For example,\n  the spreads on AAA-rated credit card ABS have narrowed from a peak of about\n  600 basis points over LIBOR to slightly above 200 basis points currently.   Encouragingly,\n  spreads of even lower-rated ABS—securities that are not TALF eligible—have\n  also narrowed quite significantly.  Although it is still too early to\n  say the TALF has been a resounding success, we at the Fed are encouraged by\n  the results so far.\n\nWhile we are generally pleased with how the TALF program has been evolving,\n  many challenges remain.  One challenge is in striking the appropriate\n  balance between sufficient protections against abuse of the program, on the\n  one hand, and a degree of red tape and restrictions that could make the program\n  unattractive to issuers and investors, on the other.   To the extent\n  that issuers and investors are unwilling to participate in TALF because of\n  fears that their involvement might lead to unforeseen complications at a later\n  date, this would lead to the unattractive outcome of underutilization and the\n  achievement of only a portion of the potential benefits.\n\nOf course it is of critical importance in this facility and in all the programs\n  instituted in response to this crisis that the interests of the taxpayer be\n  protected, and the safeguards and restrictions on the use of TARP funds are\n  designed to achieve this.   However, I think it is fair to say that\n  TALF got off to a relatively slow start because investors were worried that\n  the use of TARP funds in TALF could restrict their ability to conduct their\n  business activities more broadly, perhaps in unanticipated ways and potentially\n  retroactively.  Put simply, to the extent that the use of TARP monies\n  creates stigma, this may limit the effectiveness of TALF and other programs\n  that use TARP funds.   Although we think these fears among market\n  participants that use TALF are misplaced, such anxieties have had an impact\n  on the program.\n\nAnother challenge faced by the TALF is to increase the participation of real\n  money investors (such as mutual funds, pension funds and insurance companies),\n  many of whom are not permitted to use leverage.   We at the Fed are working\n  through a number of highly complex issues to enable the creation of vehicles\n  that will make it easier for a broader range of investors to have access to\n  financing for ABS securities.  The broader the investor base, the greater\n  the demand for the securities, the lower the yield levels and the greater\n  the improvement in credit availability.\n\nThe rollout of TALF to the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities market this\n  summer will be important in determining the overall success of the program.   The\n  revival of the CMBS market is essential to stabilizing the commercial real\n  estate market.   As you know, commercial real estate values are under\n  pressure for several reasons.  Capitalization rates have climbed significantly,\n  reducing commercial real estate valuations.  In addition, the income generated\n  from commercial property has diminished due to the contraction in overall economic\n  activity.   If the availability of funding for this market is not\n  restored, the downturn in commercial real estate valuations and the losses\n  for the holders of these assets will be greater.  This will, in turn,\n  likely further constrain credit availability.\n\nA revival of the CMBS market is also important to accommodate the demand for\n  funds to refinance commercial mortgage loans that will be coming due over the\n  next few years.   If the CMBS market remains shut down, it is unclear\n  where these funds will come from.  After all, in recent years, the CMBS\n  market has satisfied about 40% of the credit needs of the commercial mortgage\n  sector.  If this market is closed, then the refinancing of maturing mortgages\n  will be exceedingly difficult and this will exacerbate the drop in commercial\n  real estate prices, loan defaults and the pressure on bank capital.\n\nFinally, I want to consider briefly whether TALF will turn out to be a band-aid—providing\n  temporary support to otherwise defunct securitization markets—or a bridge\n  to an ultimately revived and vital securitization market.  I think it\n  is too soon to reach a firm conclusion one way or the other.  I suspect\n  that we will discover that some parts of the securitization market will return\n  and prove viable even without government support.   But other parts\n  of these markets were fundamentally flawed, and they will not survive, nor\n  should they.\n\nOn a positive note, the fact that there has been an increase in investor demand\n  for consumer ABS that does not use TALF financing is an encouraging sign.  This\n  indicates that more traditional investor classes, such as pension funds and\n  insurance companies that don’t usually use leverage, are starting to\n  stick a toe in the water.  However, it is hard to believe that there will\n  not be significant changes to the structure of this asset class in the wake\n  of the recent crisis.\n\nSo what are some of the changes that I foresee or otherwise feel are required?\n\nFirst, there needs to be a better alignment of incentives between the lenders\n  and securities dealers that originate and securitize the loans and the investors\n  that purchase these securities.  One suggestion that has received significant\n  attention is for banks to retain a portion of the securitization on their balance\n  sheets.   The notion is that with “some skin in the game,” those\n  making the loans will show greater due diligence in terms of the underwriting\n  standards applied to the underlying loan originations.  In some ways,\n  the TALF program is already facilitating this outcome, with the highly-rated\n  AAA-rated securities sold to investors and the lower-rated tranches generally\n  retained by the issuers.\n\nSecond, I suspect that investors will become less reliant on the rating agencies—conducting\n  more due diligence themselves.\n\nThird, I believe there will be a greater focus\n  among investors on standardized, homogeneous, easy-to-evaluate products. This\n  will improve the underlying liquidity of securitizations, which should result\n  in lower lending costs and should make the assessment of the risk of the assets\n  easier.\n\nFourth, I think the overall securitization market will be smaller.  The\n  demise of parts of the shadow banking system such as the SIVs and the fact\n  that banks are likely to have to consolidate some off-balance activities back\n  onto their books at the end of this year should reduce the overall demand for\n  and supply of securitized product.\n\nDeveloping and implementing the TALF has been challenging.   As the program\n  enters into a new phase with the financing of CMBS and legacy CMBS, we will\n  encounter further hurdles that we will have to overcome, adjusting and modifying\n  the program as needed in order to make it more effective.  Nevertheless,\n  I am confident that we will continue to build on our initial success, reopening\n  credit channels to consumers and businesses.\n\nThank you very much for your attention.",

    "text": "In recent years, the structure of the Treasury market has changed significantly.  Trading has become increasingly electronic, and, in many cases, highly automated.  Less traditional firms, often with a primary focus on automated, low-latency trading strategies, have entered the arena and helped to transform the landscape.  In addition to adapting to these changes, traditional broker-dealers are complying with a more rigorous regulatory framework and are also expanding their use of automated trading technologies.\n\nThese developments raise a number of important questions.  They include: Who are these new entrants and what are their motivations?  Has the changing composition of firms affected the nature of market making and liquidity provision?  How have traditional liquidity providers responded to the expanded use of new technology?  Has the changing structure introduced operational risks in the clearing and settlement infrastructure?  How has the evolution of the repo market affected the secondary market for Treasury securities?  Are the regulatory requirements imposed upon the Treasury market sufficient in today’s world?  And finally, are there any changes―regulatory or otherwise―that could improve the functioning, efficiency and/or integrity of the Treasury market?\n\nAs I noted in my recent remarks on market liquidity, many open questions remain on the subject of Treasury market liquidity. 3 At the same time, the agenda for this conference makes it clear that there are many other important questions beyond market liquidity worthy of consideration and debate.  The breadth and expertise of the attendees at this conference make this forum an excellent opportunity to advance our collective thinking on this range of important subjects.\n\nWhile the recent joint staff report on the events of October 15 certainly revealed that much has changed, it is also important to recognize that both private and official sector efforts to ensure a healthy and efficient Treasury market have been ongoing for some time. 4 One obvious example is the Treasury Market Practices Group, or the TMPG.  Set up in February 2007, the TMPG is a group of market professionals committed to supporting the integrity and efficiency of the Treasury market. 5 A core purpose of the TMPG is to develop and update a set of best practices related to trading, settlement and risk management, thereby establishing a set of behavioral norms to which market participants are expected to adhere.  Most recently, the TMPG updated its best practice guidance to address automated trading, and published a companion white paper on the subject.  And no discussion of the TMPG can go without mention of the “fails charge.”  Instituted in May 2009, this practice provides a standard procedure for market participants to assess―or pay―a fee for settlement failures, and this has proven to be a highly effective remedy for curbing the volume of fails in the Treasury market. 6 I want to thank the entire TMPG for their leadership in supporting the efficiency and integrity of the Treasury market.  I’d like to single out Tom Wipf with a personal thank you.  Tom has served with distinction as the TMPG’s chair since its inception, providing credible, balanced and independent leadership to the Group.\n\nI would be remiss if I did not also mention the ongoing work of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance, or the IAWG.  After the Salomon auction bidding scandal in January 1992, the official sector established the IAWG.  Since that time, it has been a useful forum for the official sector to coordinate and communicate on the various issues that have arisen in the Treasury market.  Indeed, over the years there have been numerous examples of questionable behavior that has come to the attention of the IAWG, and these have been channeled onwards to the appropriate authorities.  The IAWG continues to meet biweekly, as it has since its inception.\n\nAs you all know, the Joint Staff Report concluded that further work is necessary in light of the evolving structure of the Treasury market, and it also highlighted a series of additional steps that the official sector will take to evaluate its approach to this market.  I remain very supportive of these efforts.  In fact, this conference is among the first of those next steps, and presents a perfect opportunity to have a rich debate on the market's evolving structure and the actions that may be appropriate in response.\n\nThank you once again for coming here today.  I look forward to our engagement and discussion.\n\n1 Frank Keane, Michael McMorrow, Joseph Tracy and Nate Wuerffel assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 What I have to say today represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\n3 See Regulation and Liquidity Provision , remarks at the SIFMA Liquidity Forum, September 30, 2015.\n\n4 Joint Staff Report: The U.S. Treasury Market On October 15, 2014\n\n5 The TMPG has since expanded its mandate to include the agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets.\n\n6 A more recent and equally successful practice has also been instituted for the MBS market.",

    "text": "Each visit to this area gives me a chance to deepen the Bank's relationship with the people whom I represent as head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Last summer I travelled through central and western New York and met with community leaders, business people, academics, bankers and government officials.\n\nOn this visit I will also meet with a wide range of people to talk about what we do and to hear first-hand the economic and financial issues important to you in the Hudson Valley so that I can best represent all my constituents in my work at the Fed. I also look forward to walking across that magnificent old railroad bridge, the Walkway Over the Hudson, for the spectacular view that I'm told awaits me.\n\nI thank the Center for Research, Regional Education and Outreach for inviting me to speak at SUNY New Paltz today. This morning I will talk about economic conditions in the nation and the region, paying particular attention to how the recession has affected the labor market here. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (that is, the committee that sets interest rates—also known by its initials as the FOMC).\n\nIntroduction to the New York Fed By way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New York Fed is, what we do and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, which was created by Congress in 1913. With this act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the supply of money in the nation's economy.\n\nThe Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency currently led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 regional Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nEach Reserve Bank is distinct, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made the central bank independent so that policymakers could make decisions about monetary policy—such as whether to adjust interest rates—in the national interest, somewhat insulated from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee consists of the Board of Governors plus the presidents of each of the 12 district Banks. It meets in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy, that is—should we change interest rates and, if so, how much. As the current New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings. At these meetings, each committee member presents his or her current outlook for the economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders. My visit to New Paltz today is a part of these regional activities in which I learn first-hand about the economic and financial conditions important to you.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. For example, the New York Fed is the Reserve Bank charged with implementing monetary policy. This means that at the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities in order to adjust short-term interest rates. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world.\n\nAt the regional level, we continually track economic conditions in our District with the help of a number of tools that we have created for this purpose. For example, to fill a void in current measures of economic output, my staff produces indexes of economic activity which approximate output for New York State and New York City on a monthly basis. We also have initiated a consumer credit panel so that we can monitor local credit conditions. And, we have begun a quarterly survey of small business finances to track the issues related to credit and financing for this key job-generating sector. If you are not already part of the survey, I invite you to give your business card to my staff and we will add you to our survey universe, so that it can reflect your views, too.\n\nTo share the information that we gather and produce about our diverse district, we have created a rich website with very localized current data and maps on conditions in the region. I invite you to visit us on the web to explore the highly detailed information on small business, credit and housing conditions that we provide.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington and at other agencies in the United States and abroad to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing. As regulators, we have made progress, for instance, in crafting tougher capital rules for the biggest banks, but much remains to be completed and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves. We must learn from the economic catastrophe of the past few years so that the financial system is able to perform its essential role in supporting economic activity without being a source of instability for the economy as a whole.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nNational Economic Conditions Now, what is the outlook for and risks to economic activity, employment and inflation in the nation?\n\nSince the recession ended in 2009, the economy has grown at a relatively modest pace. Economic growth in the first quarter of 2011 was somewhat softer than anticipated, with the advanced reading of real gross domestic product (GDP)—that's the economic output of the economy—increasing at only a 1.8 percent annual rate. A number of factors contributed to the slowdown. Construction activity fell—likely reflecting the continued large supply of unsold homes—and government expenditures at the federal, state and local levels declined.\n\nIn addition, real consumption growth (that is, spending on goods and services adjusted for price increases) in the first quarter was slower than in the last quarter of 2010. This occurred, in part, because of the rise in gasoline and food prices that pushed up consumer price inflation last quarter and reduced the amount of income available for other household purchases, a pattern that continued to be evident in retail sales for April. High energy prices have contributed to weaker consumer confidence, which also may have negatively affected consumer spending.\n\nHowever, the weakness of real output growth in the first quarter probably will prove temporary. Although manufacturing production fell in April, largely because of supply disruptions associated with the earthquake in Japan, business survey indicators, including the New York Fed's own Empire State Manufacturing Survey, generally continue to signal growth, suggesting that production should soon return to more robust growth. And financial conditions have continued to improve, albeit gradually. The temporary reduction in payroll taxes and other fiscal measures also are providing support to demand. In addition, demand abroad—particularly in Asia—remains robust, supporting our exports.\n\nMost importantly, the labor market has shown further improvement, as demonstrated by the latest employment report. Although payroll job growth has been subdued during most of this recovery, the latest figures show the economy added 244,000 jobs in April—and an average of 233,000 over the past three months. While the unemployment rate—which is based on a different survey—ticked higher last month to 9 percent it is nonetheless 0.8 percentage points lower than it was in November, a relatively rapid decline by historic standards. Private-sector job growth has been strong enough to more than offset government layoffs, particularly at the state and local levels.\n\nA particularly encouraging sign is the rapid growth of manufacturing jobs over the past year and the recent broadening strength in services employment. While the exact pace of a jobs market recovery is always hard to predict, we were expecting the rate of job growth to pick up over the first half, and I am hopeful that job growth will continue to strengthen in the coming months. We would welcome this. However, even if the economy added 300,000 jobs per month from now on, we would likely still have considerable labor market slack at the end of 2012.\n\nDespite these clearly encouraging signs, there are still some downside risks to the growth outlook that bear watching. Let me list them for you:\n\nAlthough these issues bear watching, they remain risks rather than likely outcomes.\n\nIn regard to inflation, after a period in which inflation was below the levels the Fed judges to be most consistent with its statutory objectives, on a year-over-year basis, headline CPI (consumer price index) has increased more than 3 percent, which is somewhat above this desired level. The rise in commodity prices over the past year probably will push up headline inflation further in the next few months. It is noteworthy, however, that even with the sharp rise in oil and food prices over the past year (and notwithstanding the more recent drops), there has been limited pass-through into the prices of other goods and services. In fact, most measures of underlying inflation trends—such as core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy prices)—remain below levels consistent with our mandate for price stability.\n\nGoing forward, futures markets do not signal that investors expect rapid ongoing increases in commodity prices from current levels. Provided these prices stabilize (or indeed retreat further), I would expect headline inflation to move back to a more mandate-consistent rate. While this process plays out, however, it is critical that we ensure that inflation expectations do not become unmoored. It is much harder to keep inflation in check if people begin to raise their expectations of inflation. At this point, measures of inflation expectations overall remain stable.\n\nEconomists at the New York Fed have examined inflation expectations using a unique survey that we sponsor. As reported in a recent post on our new Liberty Street Economics blog, they find no evidence to suggest that a wage-price inflation spiral is getting underway. However, we will continue to monitor expectations for medium-term inflation very closely.\n\nTo sum up, economic conditions have improved in the past year. Yet, the recovery remains moderate and we still have a considerable way to go to meet the Fed's dual mandate of full employment and price stability.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions So, how is our region doing? As some of you may know, the New York Fed produces Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators to help monitor the performance of the region. Based on these measures, the downturn in economic activity in New York ended in November of 2009, and since then activity in New York State and New York City has been recovering steadily at a moderate pace.\n\nRegional Employment Trends Let me turn specifically to employment trends in the region. In particular, I want to describe our region's experience during the recession and recovery.\n\nNationally, the Great Recession, which began in December 2007, has been the deepest economic downturn since World War II. When employment finally bottomed out in February 2010—about seven months after the official end of the recession—the country had lost almost 6.5 percent of its jobs and the unemployment rate had more than doubled. Many people lost their jobs or saw their hours or income cut, and the duration of unemployment for jobless workers reached a historical high. For many families, this distress was compounded by losses of wealth from declining home prices. Since that low point of employment, job creation has resumed, albeit at a slower pace than we would like, and unemployment has retreated by a percentage point. As in other parts of the country, employment in our region declined substantially during the recession. But, the various parts of our region had very different experiences.\n\nEmployment in much of New York State, including the Hudson Valley, declined less severely than the nation. Both the state and city lost about 3.8 percent of their jobs. Part of the reason for the more moderate decline in jobs in New York during the recession was a less pronounced boom-bust housing cycle. Indeed, as a percentage, the city and state lost fewer jobs during this recession than they did during either of the last two downturns.\n\nNow, as in the nation, a labor market recovery has begun across much of the region. Over the past year, New York State has added roughly 100,000 private-sector jobs. Within the state, the recovery has been somewhat uneven. New York City has been gaining jobs for more than a year now—at roughly the same pace as the nation, while to date, the Hudson Valley has seen little overall job growth.\n\nConditions in the Hudson Valley Continuing to drill down geographically, let me talk in more detail about conditions here the mid-Hudson Valley. I am referring to Dutchess and Orange counties, which comprise the Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown metropolitan area, and Ulster County—which is also the Kingston metropolitan area.\n\nFirst, what does the mid-Hudson Valley region look like from an economic standpoint? There is a lot of economic activity here. All told, about 850,000 people live here and 420,000 jobs are located here. And, over the past decade, all three counties added people more rapidly than the state.\n\nPeople here are, on average, more highly educated than in the nation as a whole, as measured by the over 30 percent of residents who have college degrees. So, it is not surprising that median household income in all three counties is above the national median.\n\nThe industrial composition varies by county.\n\nNow, how has the area fared during the recent recession and recovery? I will address this from three perspectives: housing, credit conditions and jobs.\n\nUnlike central and western New York, this region experienced a modest boom and bust housing cycle. During the boom period from 2000 to 2006, home prices more than doubled in the Poughkeepsie area and increased by 150 percent around Kingston—exceeding the U.S. rise of roughly 90 percent and the average rise of roughly 50 percent that prevailed in our region. The price declines in the bust period, from 2007 to 2009, were somewhat less severe than the nation, falling by roughly 20 percent in both areas, compared with 30 percent nationally. Recently—and this is a hopeful sign—home prices in both areas have steadied.\n\nNext, how are families in the Hudson Valley doing in restoring their finances? During the recession, all across the nation, debt delinquencies soared and many families found that they needed to reduce their debt to a sustainable level. We keep track of the credit conditions in the Second District—including the average debt that people in area carry and whether they are current with their payments—using the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Consumer Credit Panel. In the Hudson Valley, debt per person with a credit report is now down by 5 percent from its peak level in 2008. As of the first quarter of this year, debt was continuing to fall modestly. At the same time, delinquency rates continue to rise. The proportion of debt that is at least 90 days delinquent has risen from 2 percent in 2005—which was low for New York—to 9 percent currently, matching the delinquency rate statewide. These patterns suggest that households in the area are making progress on restoring their balance sheets, but they may not have completed the process.\n\nWith regard to jobs, employment losses in the area during the 2008-09 downturn were steeper than in most of New York State, although less severe than for the Unites States as a whole. As of the first quarter of 2011, the Hudson Valley had yet to see a clear upturn in employment. The private sector has actually seen brisk job gains in the leisure and hospitality sector, and the professional and business service sector added jobs in the Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown metro area. And private-sector employment has held steady in the Kingston area over the past year. Both areas, however, have seen continuing job losses in retail trade and, especially, government employment. State and local government employment has declined by about 3.5 percent in the past year and has weighed down overall job growth in both areas.\n\nUnemployment rates in the mid-Hudson valley peaked at 8.4 percent in late 2009—well below the national peak of 10 percent and moderately below the state-wide peak of 8.9 percent. Nevertheless, as in much of the region and the nation, jobless rates have not retreated much thus far and remain stubbornly high.\n\nThus, the area was severely affected by the recession, but somewhat less so than the rest of the country. The recovery has begun, but some signs of distress remain in housing, credit and labor markets.\n\nIn the near-term, the regional economy, and indeed the economy of the entire state, faces a number of challenges. Among them is the need to address the large state budget gap. New York is not alone in having seen its tax revenue decline as the economy weakened and, thus, facing hard choices. As I mentioned, state and local government employment has already weakened in many areas. Going forward, further contraction in this sector continues to pose some risks to the recovery.\n\nLonger term, one of the key challenges for this region is to ensure that it trains and attracts a highly skilled workforce that can meet the needs of innovative and rapidly changing firms. A region's human capital—that is, the skills and education of its work force—determines a large part of its economic success and resiliency. The education and research taking place in local colleges and universities, such as SUNY New Paltz, directly helps to build those skills and sustain economic growth.\n\nConclusion To sum up, the national economy experienced a soft patch in activity during the first quarter of 2011, while the recovery in much of the region continued at a good pace.\n\nIn the region, the continued expansion of employment across the nation should help increase economic activity and employment in the Hudson Valley. Yet, as elsewhere, state and local government will likely be a drag for some time.\n\nAnd, both nationally and regionally, unemployment remains unacceptably high.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today. As I see it, the complex interconnections that exist between the real and financial sectors of the economy, both within and between countries, have important implications for both macroeconomic and regulatory policy. In particular, cross-border coordination in both realms is warranted. Often, macroeconomic and regulatory policies are too narrow in their focus. At times, policies are designed with the goal of being “best” at the national level. Yet the resulting mix of national policies is distinctly inferior to what a well-coordinated global regime could have produced.\n\nToday I will discuss two important challenges that go along with living in an interconnected world. The first is how to define what aspects of macroeconomic policy or regulation require greater international coordination and harmonization. Some issues can be handled effectively at a national level, but the crisis has demonstrated clearly that many can not. The second challenge is how to make international coordination workable so that progress can be made in a timely manner while still preserving sufficient autonomy for countries to fashion policies to suit their particular idiosyncratic structures. As always, my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWe live in a globalized economy in which the flows of products, capital, and ideas across borders have led to significant economic gains for literally hundreds of millions of people around the world. Thus, there is a strong public interest in ensuring that this global economic integration is supported by a coherent set of coordinated national macroeconomic policies and a harmonized international regulatory regime. This applies to the policy actions we undertake to reduce economic imbalances as well as to the regulations we develop to address the vulnerabilities in our financial system that were exposed by the crisis. The better we are able to develop cooperative global solutions to these types of issues, the more successful we will be in creating a sounder and more sustainable global economy and financial system.\n\nIt is clear that there were important imbalances in both economic and financial activity in the years preceding the financial crisis. For example, in the U.S., too much of economic activity was based on an unsustainable housing boom. The turmoil in financial markets that was unleashed when the boom collapsed subsequently forced the U.S. and other countries to undergo significant adjustments. These adjustments were often sudden. They transmitted large shocks across the global economy. These shocks, in turn, necessitated other adjustments in trade, investment, and in financial markets elsewhere.\n\nMore generally, we know that the global economy operates under an important constraint—the sum of trade balances around the world, properly measured, must add up to zero. When one country follows policies that are designed to increase exports, there must be an offsetting adjustment elsewhere—either higher imports or fewer exports by another country. Similarly, there is the same adding up constraint in terms of the financial flows that accompany trade and investment on the capital account—current account balances around the world—again properly measured—must add up to zero.\n\nWhat this means in practical terms is that the outcomes for economic activity and capital flows for any individual country depend not only on the public policy and private decisions made within that country, but also on policies and mix of activities pursued in other countries. For example, for Germany to have a large trade surplus with the rest of Europe, other European countries must run trade deficits. And if Germany runs such surpluses it must accumulate large financial claims on the other countries. Or, if the U.S. has an unsustainably high level of consumption, the adjustment to a lower, more sustainable level must be offset by greater investment and exports if the U.S. economy is to be able to operate close to full employment.\n\nThe fact that it takes (at least) two to tango to make these types of adjustments is just another way of saying that our economies are interconnected. In order for the U.S. to reduce its dependence on consumption and to increase its exports, there need to be offsetting adjustments in other countries, such as China. Thus, the key issue to consider in crafting internationally coordinated macroeconomic policy is not whether these adjustments will ultimately take place. They will take place because they have to take place. Instead, the issue for policymakers is whether the policies we put in place will allow adjustments to occur in a way that is consistent with a stable global economy, high levels of employment, and low inflation.\n\nAt times, the situation is akin to the Prisoner’s Dilemma—a non-cooperative approach will lead to inferior results for both players compared to a cooperative approach in which each side foregoes the chance for highest potential payoff in exchange for the payoff that maximizes returns jointly. But effective cooperation that leads to higher joint returns is difficult in this game because of the complexity of the inter-linkages and the political and institutional constraints that constrain the scope for action at the national level.\n\nIn macroeconomic terms, the prospects for achieving a more cooperative solution can be enhanced by policy transparency so that the policy goals and reaction function of each authority can be well understood by others. This again applies both within and across countries. For example, the Federal Reserve is making efforts to provide greater clarity about its inflation objective in the context of the dual mandate. In doing so, the Fed is also continuing to underscore that actions such as our purchase of U.S. government securities are driven exclusively by our monetary policy goals, and that these policy actions will not continue beyond the moment they become inconsistent with our dual mandate objectives. In general, policymakers should strive to ensure that we have both fiscal and monetary policy frameworks that are transparent and viewed as credible and durable.\n\nInterconnectedness means that events—be it the tragedy of a Japanese earthquake and tsunami, a revolution in Libya, or a financial crisis sparked by a housing boom and bust in the United States—can be transmitted to domestic economies located far away from the initial source of shock, often at market-speed measured in milliseconds. This interconnectedness underscores our common interest in cooperating not just to facilitate needed economic adjustments, but also to address fragilities in our interconnected global financial system.\n\nI think coordination on regulatory matters differs from on macroeconomic issues in two important respects. First, the benefits to cooperation and coordination on certain aspects of regulation seem easier to identify up front. Second, while policy coordination on regulatory issues is also very challenging, it may not be quite as difficult as in the macroeconomic realm.  The stakeholders are not typically as numerous or diffuse, the problems are generally easier to identify, the gains from a cooperative solution are more obvious, and the cooperative solutions themselves may be easier to implement.\n\nOn the regulatory side, I’ll start with a few broad observations. First, it is essential that regulations be harmonized internationally to a much greater degree than in the past. This will ensure there is a common minimum level of standards, which in turn will help discourage regulatory arbitrage and a “race to the bottom”.\n\nSecond, it is critical that the harmonized regulations produce something that is coherent and effective on an international level, and that the different regimes in specific jurisdictions add up to a workable whole.\n\nThird, regulatory harmonization and cooperation, by necessity requires trust and a willingness to share relevant information across jurisdictions. A corollary to this is that national regulators need to be willing to constrain their unilateral actions somewhat in order to facilitate engagement and cooperative solutions on a global basis.\n\nIn this respect, I think there are two areas where considerable progress has been made since the crisis—the capital regulation of globally active banking organizations and the establishment of global standards for financial market infrastructures. The first initiative is designed to ensure that globally active firms have sufficient capital to keep their risk of failure very low. The second initiative is designed to strengthen the financial market infrastructure so that if a large globally systemic firm were to fail, this event would not threaten to bring down the entire financial system.\n\nBut even in these areas there still is much to do. With respect to Basel III, it is important that the regime be implemented on a consistent basis around the world.  In particular, the definitions of capital must not be watered down and risk-weighted asset calculations must be done in a consistent manner around the world.  An identical portfolio of assets should generate a comparable amount of risk-weighted assets regardless of the country in which the bank’s home office is domiciled.\n\nWith respect to standards for financial market infrastructures, the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, which were published last month, are an important step forward.  These principles establish the minimum standard for important FMIs around the world.\n\nBut the establishment of these standards is just the first step. National authorities now need to ensure that their domestic regulatory regimes embody these principles, and these national regimes have to be credibly assessed for ongoing conformance to the new standards.\n\nGlobal standards for financial market infrastructures are necessary if we are to build a safe global system of central counterparty clearinghouse (CCPs) infrastructures though which to clear standardized over-the-counter derivatives trades around the world. For national regulators to be comfortable with such an arrangement there has to be an appropriate level of information exchange and cooperative oversight, and the Principles explicitly mandate this. Although cross-border information exchange and cooperative oversight are certainly not new—the coordination of currency settlement around the world through CLS is one important example—the model has to be further developed and adopted more broadly across a wider range of important global financial market infrastructures.\n\nHow we proceed from here will be critical to our success in building a global financial system that is both stable and efficient. By facilitating the greatest netting down of risk, global CCPs through which all standardized OTC derivatives trades would be cleared, hold out the potential for the greatest amount of risk reduction and, thus, improvement in financial stability. But, for that outcome to occur, there needs to be a global oversight framework that ensures that the CCPs are held to global standards—not just in theory, but also in practice.\n\nThere are other areas where we face significant challenges in effective global information exchange and regulatory cooperation. We have much more to do to develop resolution regimes for globally systemic financial institutions, including establishing the rules of the game for the exchange of supervisory data for such firms, in clearly identifying ex ante the responsibilities of home and host countries in terms of potential liquidity support, and in overseeing the orderly wind-downs of such firms when they encounter difficulties.\n\nThe exchange of supervisory information is important both for understanding the consolidated condition of a bank that operates in a host country, and for gaining insights into broader financial stability issues. For example, giving supervisors in host countries improved access to consolidated balance sheet information for foreign firms operating in their jurisdiction would allow for a more accurate assessment of a firm’s liquidity position and funding plans.\n\nAnother area where there needs to be greater international cooperation is in defining the roles of home and host countries especially during times of stress. What is the responsibility, for example, of the host country to provide lender-of–last- resort liquidity to foreign firms operating in their jurisdiction? At what stage, if any, does that responsibility shift to home country? Should these responsibilities change depending on the degree of information exchange or the degree or duration of stress?\n\nOn the resolution front, we know that the benefits of a harmonized global regime would be substantial. By providing greater transparency to investors and depositors about the rules of the game in the event of distress, such a regime would likely reduce the likelihood of runs and financial panics while also allowing financial intermediation to occur on a global basis.\n\nHowever, it is proving challenging for some jurisdictions to provide clarity around how an orderly resolution would be implemented in practice. At the same time, this lack of clarity within jurisdictions is contributing to and exacerbated by the lack of a harmonized approach across different legal and regulatory regimes. Many questions must be answered:  How would different creditor and counterparty claims be treated? Who would provide the bridge financing to facilitate the orderly liquidation? Would the home country regime ensure equal treatment of all banks’ claims around the world, regardless of jurisdiction or legal entity? Would there be clarity about this, ex ante?\n\nIf an effective global resolution regime with clearly defined ex ante characteristics were to turn out to be a bridge too far, national authorities may have to fall back on a subsidiarization model, in which global firms would have to establish subsidiaries on a country-by-country basis each with their own capital and liquidity buffers. Such a regime would require greater capital and liquidity as the banks would lose the significant risk diversification benefits gained from operating in many different countries. Such a regime would also presumably make it more difficult for these firms to provide financial services seamlessly to multinational corporations, global asset managers, and others that operate on an international basis. Even in this scenario, however, it would be important to ensure that national resolution regimes could interact with each other in a coherent manner.\n\nTo sum up, my view is that we live in a globalized world both with respect to the macro-economy and the financial system. But too often we set macroeconomic policy and regulatory policy at a national level, and miss important opportunities to coordinate and make the global economic and financial system stronger overall. We need to understand where greater global perspective is required and we need to apply that perspective consistently across jurisdictions in a timely manner. If we don’t do this, we won’t achieve all the benefits that are possible from global specialization and we will continue to run significant risks with respect to financial stability.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.",

    "text": "Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me.  It is always a pleasure to speak with the different communities that make up our region, and it is especially gratifying to have the opportunity to talk with you, our future leaders.\n\nI am especially pleased to be here at Brooklyn College, given the relationship that we at the New York Fed have developed with The City University of New York (CUNY). As an example, we collaborated this year on the College Fed Challenge, our yearly competition where teams of students from area universities take on the roles of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and debate the appropriate next steps for U.S. monetary policy.  A number of CUNY schools competed and professors served as judges. Also, several CUNY schools had a strong showing in our annual Savvy Credit Video Festival which I’ll speak more about later.\n\nMy meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy and to share what we are seeing.  At the Federal Reserve, we try to meet with a diverse array of people in order to get a comprehensive picture of economic conditions in the regions we serve and a fuller understanding of the major issues.  Earlier today, I met with developers and local community leaders to learn about the redevelopment of the Atlantic Yards, was welcomed to a roundtable breakfast meeting with members of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and then traveled to Brownsville to learn about the challenges faced by that community.  Following this visit to Brooklyn College, I’m headed to Bush Terminal in Sunset Park to meet with city officials and learn about an important redevelopment project and then I’ll end the day at Etsy—a successful innovative start-up and a major private-sector employer here in Brooklyn.\n\nThese trips are only one of the many ways in which we seek to engage with the people and businesses in our region.  We also reach out to our local communities through web resources, workshops and conferences.  To assess the performance of the regional economy, we monitor economic activity on a monthly basis, we tap into the insights of the members of our Small Business and Agriculture Advisory Council and Upstate Advisory Board, and we have constructed a consumer credit panel that allows us to better understand the financial condition of homeowners and students at the local level.  We conduct two monthly surveys—the Empire State Manufacturing Survey and the Business Leaders Survey of service firms—which help us monitor regional business conditions in close to real-time. We’ve also developed a “Regional Mortgage Conditions” analysis at the county and zip code level.  In addition, we conduct a biannual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and availability.  It is noteworthy that our most recent poll found that cash flow issues replaced credit availability as the number one concern of small companies.\n\nWe also have worked to support better financial decision-making by young consumers.  Every year the Bank conducts two competitions in which college students are challenged to produce a 30-second video promoting wise credit use.  The two contests, one held in Puerto Rico and the other in the tri-state region, provide students the opportunity to learn about the importance of personal finance while showcasing their filmmaking creativity.  The winning video is then shown at numerous local movie theaters, helping promote the value of the smart use of credit.  This year the judges, including Maria Bartiromo from Fox Business, Tamir Muhammad from the Tribeca Film Institute and Jim Rosenberg from UNICEF, selected a Brooklyn College entry, entitled “Elevate Your Credit” as the winner.  I am pleased to again congratulate Rasa Partin, Ben Remetz and Andrew Roder, and their coach, Jay Kim, for creating the winning video.\n\nNow I would like to review recent developments in the local and national economies, and at the end of my talk will be happy to answer any questions you have.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRegional Employment and Economic Trends\n\nFirst, let’s talk about economic trends in New York City. The City’s economy showed resilience both during and after this last severe recession.  Payroll employment fell sharply in 2008 and 2009; it bounced back, slowly at first, but by July of 2011, the City’s economy had recovered to its pre-recession employment peak and, in November, it eclipsed its previous all-time peak of 1969.  Since then, employment has continued to grow strongly, rising at a roughly 2 percent annual pace and outpacing the national growth rate.  The demand for labor has been driven by start-ups, tech, health care and business services.  While Superstorm Sandy caused substantial damage to homes and the region’s infrastructure and severe economic disruptions in late 2012, the local economy as a whole bounced back quickly.\n\nDespite the robust job growth, the unemployment rate among City residents has been persistently high—though it did fall to 8.0 percent in December, nearly a 5-year low.  Potential workers are not counted as unemployed unless they are actively looking for work, so this relatively high rate of unemployment, in part, reflects the relative strength in labor force participation, as the City’s residents remain engaged and looking for work.  In contrast, at the national level, the picture is quite different—job growth has been slower and proportionately more people have dropped out of the labor force.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, while historically a key driver of the local economy, the finance sector has not been a leader in terms of job growth recently.  Instead, employment in New York City’s finance sector and the securities industry specifically, has been essentially flat over the past two years.  The city’s job gains in this expansion have been broad-based across other sectors, indicating a healthy diversification within the economy.\n\nConditions in Brooklyn\n\nNow let’s focus on Brooklyn. The borough’s economy has been particularly strong in recent years.  Compared with the other boroughs, Brooklyn has seen generally stronger job growth, a stronger housing market, and stronger trends in wage and salary earnings.  This strength is exemplified by the transformation of industrial neighborhoods—such as DUMBO, Red Hook, Greenpoint, East Williamsburg, Gowanus and Bushwick—into increasingly diversified residential and commercial neighborhoods; and the recent development of the Atlantic Yards and Brooklyn Navy Yard.  This changing landscape has helped spur economic activity which has created many new jobs in the borough.\n\nIndeed, employment held up well during the recession, declining by less than 2 percent over a brief period in early 2009, and has averaged a nearly 3 percent annualized growth rate since then.  Job growth has been particularly strong at retailers, hotels and restaurants, and also service firms ranging from advertising to engineering.  That said, the employment picture does have some difficulties.  For example, there is concern over some well-paying health sector jobs given the financial strain at Long Island College Hospital and Interfaith Medical Center and the pressure to close those institutions.\n\nBrooklyn’s economic vitality is also reflected in the commercial real estate market, as both office and retail vacancy rates have fallen steadily over the past few years.  In fact, office vacancy rates are now lower in Brooklyn than in Manhattan.  The strength in the housing market is also evident, with the median home price up by roughly 10 percent in each of the past two years, and the rental market has shown similar strength.\n\nHowever, these increasing prices also raise two other issues that acutely afflict many in Brooklyn and New York City more broadly: housing affordability and poverty.  Despite Brooklyn’s economic renaissance and growing affluence, a large swath of the Borough’s population—one in four residents—still lives in poverty, and many struggle to pay their rent or mortgage.  Even with the strong pace of job creation, Brooklyn’s unemployment rate has remained high, averaging more than 9 percent in 2013.\n\nThere are also continued financial challenges for families here as indicated by the New York Fed’s measures of credit conditions.  As of the end of 2013, average debt per person was about $42,000 in Brooklyn—little changed over several years.  At the same time, the Borough’s delinquency rate on that debt is now 11.6 percent, much higher than the state average and more than double the national average.  What’s more, the mortgage crisis continues to take a toll on local homeowners.  As of the end of 2013, more than 11 percent of mortgage debt in Brooklyn was 90-plus days delinquent, again significantly higher than the New York State and national delinquency rate.\n\nI also want to make a few comments about the impact of Superstorm Sandy.  While areas of the New York City metropolitan region were hard hit by the storm, the devastation was particularly severe along the waterfronts of Brooklyn—and in particular in southern Brooklyn and neighborhoods like Red Hook.  We saw and heard about the devastation of the storm from many of those affected, including a number of our own employees as well as other residents we met at a series of assistance clinics we organized in response to the storm.  Those already living close to the edge financially were particularly vulnerable as were the City’s public housing residents.  Still, Brooklyn’s economy showed resilience: while employment did drop in November 2012, it bounced back strongly the next month and accelerated during the spring of 2013, reaching new highs.\n\nSandy was a catastrophe for many in our region and significant challenges remain in the years ahead.  Recently, the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps that show a much larger number of Brooklyn residents and businesses at risk of a future storm.  While a once-in-a-hundred-year risk of flooding may not appear worrisome, many within this expanded zone may be required to purchase insurance.  The expanded flood zones, coupled with federal government efforts to have insurance premiums accurately reflect the risk, could create a serious affordability problem in the years ahead.  The New York Fed has created maps of community-level flood risk in Brooklyn.\n\nNow I would like to turn my attention to recent developments in the national economy.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nFrom the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009 through mid-2013, real Gross Domestic Product, or the aggregate value, after adjusting for inflation, of all the goods and services produced within the borders of the U.S., grew at a rather tepid 2 1/4; percent annual rate.  Then, in the second half of 2013, the pace of growth moved notably higher, reaching an annual rate of 3 1/4 percent.  Nonetheless, despite this pickup in the growth pace, the average monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment were somewhat lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half.\n\nAt the same time, both total and core inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) deflator, slowed in the second half of 2013 relative to the first half, and the overall PCE deflator index is currently running well below the FOMC’s expressed goal of 2 percent for total inflation.\n\nCombined with the still-elevated unemployment rate and the drop in the labor force participation rate, these conditions suggest that there continues to be a substantial underutilization of both labor and capital resources.  This implies, in turn, that the current, highly-accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time to come.  Let me elaborate on these points.\n\nWhile the timing and magnitude of the pickup of growth were earlier and somewhat stronger than our internal forecast, in qualitative terms the economy has performed much as we expected.  First, by several measures, households’ balance sheets are in much better shape, and this has led to faster growth of consumer spending, particularly for durable goods.  Key measures of household leverage have declined and are now near the lowest levels they have been in well over a decade.  Reflecting rising equity and home prices and declining debt, household net worth relative to disposable income has climbed back to its average of the previous decade.  Recently, banks have eased credit standards somewhat after a prolonged period of tightening.  In fact, our own Consumer Credit Panel, a representative sample of the liability side of the U.S. consumer balance sheet derived from consumer credit reports, indicates that total household liabilities increased last quarter on a year-over-year basis, the first rise since mid-2008.\n\nIn addition to the firming in consumer spending, growth of exports was quite strong over the second half of last year.  Following a few years of lackluster performance, growth among our major trading partners improved, providing a boost to employment and output in our manufacturing sector.  Moreover, the important advances made in oil drilling technology have boosted U.S. energy production, cutting oil imports and boosting petroleum product exports and this is also leading to steady improvement in our trade balance.  The economy also received an important boost from quite strong inventory accumulation, which added nearly a full percentage point to the annualized second half growth rate.  This inventory investment was broad-based across sectors and types of goods.  In fact, all four quarters of 2013 saw a positive growth contribution from inventory accumulation, something that typically only occurs as the economy first emerges from recession.  I interpret this as a sign of increased confidence about the economic outlook within the business community.\n\nFinally, federal fiscal restraint lessened over the second half of 2013.  This is in sharp contrast to the first half of the year, when the payroll tax cut expired, tax rates on higher income households were raised, a series of taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act took effect, and spending was reduced due to the sequester and the gradual winding down of foreign military operations.  Moreover, the sustained contraction in spending and employment by state and local governments appears to be nearing an end.\n\nI wish that I could report that the improved pace of growth of economic activity led to a corresponding increase in the rate of improvement in labor market conditions.  But such was not the case.  As I noted earlier, the average monthly change of nonfarm payroll employment over the second half of the year, at 184,000 per month, was somewhat below the 204,000 average monthly increase of the first half.  In addition, growth of aggregate hours worked by private sector employees was somewhat slower in the second half than in the first.  The source of this apparent anomaly is the fact that labor productivity, or output per hour worked, rose rapidly over the second half of the year after being essentially unchanged over the first half.  This is a perfect example of the double-edged sword of productivity growth.  In the long-run, sustained strong productivity growth is what boosts real living standards.  However, in the short-run it can depress job creation.\n\nWhile overall labor market indicators for the second half of 2013 were not particularly strong, the overall trend in unemployment showed some improvement with the unemployment rate falling sharply over that period, from 7.5 percent in June to 6.7 percent in December.  However, as has been the case since October of 2009 when the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent, this decline in the unemployment rate was driven in large part by a decline in the labor force participation rate.  Much has been written about the forces that are causing this decline of the labor force participation rate.  Researchers have shown that the aging of the population is playing a role, as are changes in behavior.  But our own analysis suggests that the cyclical weakness of demand for labor is an important contributing factor.  As a result, I conclude that the decline of the unemployment rate significantly overstates the degree of improvement in the labor market.\n\nLooking forward, I believe that the underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy have improved to the point where we can expect sustained growth above the roughly 2 1/4 percent annual pace that prevailed from mid-2009 through mid-2013.  Also, the amount of fiscal drag continues to diminish.  Another good piece of news is that Congress has raised the debt ceiling until March 2015.  This lessens the risk that political brinkmanship in Washington could harm consumer and business confidence.\n\nThat said, I expect that growth, over the near term, will slow somewhat from the pace we saw during the second half of last year.  In particular, during the current quarter, unusually cold and snowy weather will undoubtedly depress activity somewhat—especially with respect to construction activity, but also to a lesser extent in areas such as retail spending.  Also, as mentioned above, some special, one-time factors, such as very rapid growth of exports and sustained inventory building, are unlikely to be repeated over the first half of this year.  Moreover, while there is now a much better balance between supply and demand in the housing market, that market is still adjusting to the roughly 100 basis point increase in mortgage interest rates that occurred in mid-2013.\n\nI do expect that growth will be strong enough to lead to continued improvement in labor market conditions.  I must caution, however, that the outlook for the unemployment rate is unusually uncertain.  If our assessment is correct, at some point an improving labor market should cause the labor force participation rate to stabilize or rise a bit as currently discouraged workers begin looking for work.  Such developments could result in a more muted rate of decline of the unemployment rate despite the faster growth.\n\nFinally, as the expansion continues, I expect inflation to gradually rise toward the FOMC’s objective of 2 percent as measured by the PCE deflator.  This forecast is based on the projected gradual increase in the levels of resource utilization, a firming in global demand, and the upward pull exercised by stable inflation expectations on actual inflation.  Underpinning the latter assumption is the broad stability of long-term inflation expectations across different financial and survey measures, combined with ongoing moderate growth of wages and unit labor costs—all observations consistent with anchored inflation expectations.\n\nOverall, I would characterize the outlook as reasonably favorable.  But I would very much prefer faster economic growth and more rapid progress towards our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.  Hence, the continued need for monetary policy to remain highly accommodative to support the economic recovery to the fullest.\n\nThank you for your kind attention and I will now be happy to take some questions.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here at the Association\n  for a Better New \n  York. This group has obviously been very successful. New York today is a far\n  different and \n  vastly superior place from what I found when I first arrived as a freshman\n  at Columbia \n  University in 1970.\n\nToday, I’d like to accomplish two tasks. First, I’ll\n  comment briefly on the economy and \n  the economic outlook—where we have been and where we may be going. I’m\n  going to suggest \n  that the balance of risks is still tilted toward weakness in growth and employment\n  and not toward \n  higher inflation. I will also argue that it is premature to talk about “when” we\n  are going to exit \n  from this period of unusual policy accommodation.\n\nSecond, I will talk about\n  the impact of the Federal Reserve’s lending\n  facilities and \n  purchase programs on the size of the Fed’s balance sheet. I’ll\n  explain why an expanded balance \n  sheet does not constrain our ability to exit from the current degree of policy\n  accommodation. In \n  other words, contrary to what is sometimes argued, it is not the case that\n  our expanded balance \n  sheet will inevitably prove inflationary. It is important that this critical\n  issue be well understood. \n  The public must be absolutely confident that the Fed can meet its monetary\n  policy objectives of \n  low and stable inflation and sustainable economic growth. Before I begin to\n  get into these issues \n  in earnest, let me note that, as always, the views I put forward today are\n  my own and do not \n  necessarily reflect the position of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\n  or the Federal \n  Reserve System.\n\nTurning first to the outlook, the economic contraction appears\n  to be waning and it seems \n  likely that we will see moderate growth in the second half of the year. The\n  economy should be \n  boosted by three factors: 1) a modest recovery in housing activity and motor\n  vehicle sales; 2) the \n   \n  impact of the fiscal stimulus on domestic demand; and 3) a sharp swing in the\n  pace of inventory \n  investment. In fact, if the inventory swing were concentrated in a particular\n  quarter, we could \n  see fairly rapid growth for a brief period.\n\nRegardless of the precise timing,\n  there are a number of factors which suggest that the pace \n  of recovery will be considerably slower than usual. In particular, I expect\n  that consumption—which accounts for about 70 percent of gross domestic\n  product—is likely\n  to grow slowly for \n  three reasons. First, real income growth will probably be weak by historical\n  standards. There \n  were a number of special factors that boosted real income in the first half\n  of the year, helping to \n  offset a sharp drop in hours worked and very sluggish hourly wage gains. These\n  factors \n  included the sharp drop in gasoline and natural gas prices; the large cost-of-living-allowance\n   increase for Social Security recipients reflecting last year’s high\n   headline inflation; a sharp drop \n  in final tax settlements; a reduction in withholding tax rates; and a one-time\n  payment to Social \n  Security recipients. These factors provided a transitory boost to real incomes,\n  which will be \n  absent during the second half of the year. As a result, real disposable income\n  is likely to decline \n  modestly over this period.\n\nSecond, households are still adjusting to the sharp\n   drop in net worth caused by the \n  persistent decline in home prices and last year’s fall in equity prices.\n  This suggests that the \n  desired saving rate will not decline sharply. That means consumer spending\n  is unlikely to rise \n  much faster than income. In other words, weak income growth will be an effective\n  constraint on \n  the pace of consumer spending.\n\nMoreover, some sectors such as business fixed\n  investment in structures are likely to \n  continue to weaken as existing projects are completed. In an environment in\n  which vacancy \n   \n  rates are high and climbing, prices are falling, and credit for new projects\n  is virtually nonexistent, \n  this sector is likely to be a significant drag on the economy over the next\n  year.\n\nPerhaps most important, the normal cyclical dynamic in which housing, consumer\n   durable goods purchases and investment spending rebound in response to monetary\n  easing is \n  unlikely to be as powerful in this episode as during a typical economic recovery.\n  The financial \n  system is still in the middle of a prolonged adjustment process. Banks and\n  other financial \n  institutions are working their way through large credit losses and the securitization\n  markets are \n  recovering only slowly. This means that credit availability will be constrained\n  for some time to \n  come and this will serve to limit the pace of recovery.\n\nIf the recovery does,\n  in fact, turn out to be lackluster, the unemployment rate is likely to \n  remain elevated and capacity utilization rates unusually low for some time\n  to come. This \n  suggests that inflation will be quiescent. For all these reasons, concern about “when” the\n  Fed \n  will exit from its current accommodative monetary policy stance is, in my view,\n  very premature.\n\nIn contrast, I think it is important to address today the issue\n  of “how” the\n  Fed can exit \n  from the current stance of policy when the time comes, even if its numerous\n  special facilities and \n  purchase programs continue to keep the size of its balance sheet at an expanded\n  level.\n\nWhy do I believe it is so important to explain the issue of “how” having\n  just argued that \n“when” is not yet a pressing issue? The reason is that if people\n  believe—correctly or \n  incorrectly—that the Federal Reserve could have a problem managing a\n  smooth exit from its \n  accommodative policy stance, this belief alone could have the adverse effect\n  of causing inflation \n  expectations to become less well anchored and risk premia on long-dated debt\n  securities and \n   \n  loans to rise. These effects could conceivably make it more difficult to generate\n  a sustainable \n  economic recovery.\n\nThis risk seems significant. For example, just last week\n  a major bank published a survey \n  of a broad array of 1800 investors. Of those surveyed, 20 percent thought that\n  inflation might \n  average more than 2.5 percentage points per year above their assessment of\n  the Federal \n  Reserve’s target. This outcome presumably reflects two factors—the\n  balance-sheet expansion of \n  the Fed and the large fiscal deficit.\n\nWith this in mind, let me spend the remainder\n  of my time discussing the sources of \n  growth in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over the past year and\n  a half or so, and explain \n  why I am confident that the exit from our accommodative policy stance, as well\n  as from our \n  various lending facilities and purchase programs, can be handled smoothly.\n\nAs\n  you are aware, the Federal Reserve has been engaged in a wide array of unprecedented\n  activities over the past two years in response to the financial crisis. These\n  include:\n\nThese programs\n    have led to significant changes in both the composition and size of the Federal\n    Reserve’s balance sheet. For example, in August 2007, prior to the\n    onset of the crisis, the \n    Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was about $870 billion. Currently,\n    the size of the balance sheet \n    is about $2 trillion. To gain a better understanding of how we got to where\n    we are now, I think \nit is useful to divide the past two years into three distinct phases.\n\nThe\n    first stage I’ll define as the period running roughly from the\n    start of the crisis in \n    August 2007 to September 2008. During this stage, the Fed’s monetary\n    policy implementation \n    regime worked in such a way that control over the size of its balance sheet,\n    and more specifically \n    over the level of excess reserves, was essential to ensure that the Open\n    Market Desk could \n    control the fed funds rate in a manner consistent with the FOMC’s monetary\n    policy objectives. \n    Had the Fed’s special liquidity facilities grown sufficiently large\n    during that period, raising the \n    level of the excess reserves in the banking system, the fed funds rate would\n    likely have fallen far \n    below the FOMC’s target rate. To keep the fed funds rate around the\n    target, the only sure-fire \n    option was to avoid a significant expansion in the balance sheet by funding\n    the expansion of \n    nontraditional assets, such as TAF loans, FX swaps, and PDCF loans with similarly\n    sized \n    liquidations of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio of Treasury securities.\n    Thus, over the period \n     \n    from August 2007 up through the time of the Lehman Brothers failure in September\n    2008, the \n    total size of the Fed’s balance sheet and the level of excess reserves\n    in the banking system \nchanged very little.\n\nThe second stage began in October 2008 when the Federal\n    Reserve gained the authority \n    to pay interest on reserves, including excess reserves. The addition of interest\n    on reserves to the \n    Fed’s toolkit effectively broke the link between the size of the Fed’s\n    balance sheet and the stance \n    of monetary policy. Policymakers now had the capacity to expand the size\n    of the Fed’s liquidity \n    facilities and other programs without the threat of compromising the control\n    of monetary policy. \n    This new tool immediately proved enormously helpful. The Fed was able to\n    respond to the \n    deterioration of conditions in the fall of 2008 by sharply increasing the\n    size of its Term Auction \n    Facility program and removing the limits on the size of many of the foreign\n    exchange swap \n    programs. These programs, along with the increased use of the Fed’s\n    standing liquidity facilities \n    and the start-up of the Commercial Paper Funding Facility in late October,\n    led to a sharp growth \n    in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet beginning in late September.\n\nThe third phase is marked by the launch of the Fed’s purchase programs,\n    starting with the \n    agency debt program that began in December 2008 and extends through to the\n    present. During \n    this phase, the Fed’s overall balance sheet has actually declined slightly.\n    The demand for the \n    Fed’s special liquidity programs has diminished more quickly than the\n    purchase programs have \n    been ramped up. Although this shrinkage was not anticipated or targeted,\n    it is a welcome \n    indication that there has been improvement in the functioning of the short-term\n    funding markets. 1 As market function has improved and credit spreads have narrowed, many of\n  the Fed’s liquidity \n    facilities have become less attractive and there has been a corresponding\n    decline in usage. For \n    example, outstanding foreign exchange swaps have declined from a peak of\n    $586 billion last \n    December to about $110 billion currently, and outstanding commercial paper\n    held by the CPFF \n    has fallen from a peak of about $350 billion last fall to around $110 billion\ncurrently.\n\nDespite the recent dip in the size of the balance sheet, the size\n    of the purchase programs \n    underway makes it likely that balance-sheet growth will resume as assets\n    acquired in conjunction \n    with these programs overwhelm any further declines in the funds advanced\n    via the shorter-term \n    liquidity facilities. The size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet\n    seems likely to grow to \nroughly $2.5 trillion, somewhat above the peak reached last December.\n\nIt is\n    no coincidence that the growth of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet since last fall \n    has been accompanied by a sharp rise in the amount of excess reserves. When\n    the Federal \n    Reserve extends a loan or purchases a security, this automatically adds reserves\n    to the banking \n    system unless the Fed undertakes an offsetting reserve draining operation.\n    Although some of \n    the excess reserves that have been generated by the balance-sheet expansion\n    were initially \n    sopped up by the Treasury’s Supplemental Financing Program, total excess\n    reserves have \n    climbed to more than $700 billion from nearly zero at the beginning of the\ncrisis.\n\nThe sharp rise in excess reserves has caused the monetary base, which\n    is simply the sum \n    of currency plus total reserves, to expand significantly. The increases in\n    excess reserves and in \n    the monetary base generated by the Fed’s balance-sheet growth have\n    led some observers to \n    worry that this expansion will ultimately prove inflationary. Proponents\n    of this view say that the \n    monetary base, the broad monetary aggregates, total credit outstanding and\n    inflation have \n     \n    historically tended to move together, at least over longer time periods.\n    Thus, if the monetary \n    base is growing rapidly, as it has been over the past year, the view is that\n    this growth will \nultimately lead to inflation.\n\nIs this concern well founded? The answer is\n    that in a world where banks could not be \n    paid interest on excess reserves, these persistent high reserve balances\n    would indeed have the \n    potential to prove inflationary. 2 In\n    that world, the excess reserves are likely to lead ultimately to \n    an overly accommodative monetary policy. The story goes like this: If banks\n    are earning no \n    interest on their excess reserve holdings, they will be willing to lend those\n    reserves out to any \n    creditworthy borrowers as long as the interest rate is positive after adjusting\n    for risk. The \n    borrowers would then spend these monies, thereby boosting economic activity.\n    The funds would \n    not disappear, but instead would flow back into the banking system as they\n    were deposited by \n    those who had received the income generated by the increase in spending,\n    thus replenishing the \n    reserves that had been lent out in the first round of lending. This would\n    result in a new stock of \n    excess reserves that would then lead to a second round of credit creation\n    and a further increase in \n    economic activity. This cycling of excess reserves into credit creation,\n    and the corresponding \n    increase in economic activity, would continue until the excess reserves were\n    fully absorbed by an \n    increase in currency outstanding and/or an increase in required reserves\n    associated with the rise \n    in the amount of banking deposits. Inflation would rise as the excessive\n    credit creation generated \n    by the excess reserves led to an overheated economy and a rise in inflation\nexpectations.\n\nBut that is not the world in which we now live. Because the\n    Federal Reserve now has the \n    ability to pay interest on excess reserves (IOER), it also now has the ability\n    to prevent excess \n    reserves from leading to excessive credit creation. Because the Federal Reserve\n    is the safest of \n    counterparties, the IOER rate effectively becomes the risk-free rate. 3 By\n    raising that rate, the \n    Federal Reserve raises the cost of credit more generally because banks will\n    not lend at rates \n    below the IOER rate when they can instead hold their excess reserves on deposit\n    with the Fed. \n    Because banks no longer seek to lend out their excess reserves, there is\n    no increase in the amount \n    of credit outstanding, no redeposit of the excess reserves, no increase in\n    economic activity and \nno risk that excessive credit creation will fuel an inflationary spiral.\n\nFor\n    this dynamic to work correctly, the Federal Reserve needs to set an IOER\n    rate  consistent with the amount of required reserves, money supply and credit\n    outstanding consistent \n    with its dual mandate of full employment and price stability. If demand for\n    credit exceeds what \n    is appropriate, the Federal Reserve raises the IOER rate to reduce demand.\n    If the demand for \n    credit is insufficient to push the economy to full employment, then the Federal\n    Reserve reduces \n    the IOER rate, recognizing that the IOER rate cannot fall below zero. This\n    does not differ much \n    from how the Federal Reserve has behaved historically—set the fed funds\n    rate at a level \n    consistent with the desired level of economic activity and inflation over\ntime.\n\nSo how does the IOER rate relate to the fed funds rate? The two rates\n    are likely to track \n    each other closely in most circumstances. 4 First,\n    banks generally do not have any incentive to \n    sell fed funds at rates below the IOER rate. Only nondepository institutions—such\n    as the \n    government sponsored enterprises (GSEs)—that can buy and sell fed funds\n    but are not able to \n    hold excess reserves with the Fed, might have an incentive to sell fed funds\n    at rates below the \n    IOER rate. But even in this case, the fed funds rate would not likely fall\n    far below the IOER \n    rate. After all, if the fed funds rate were to fall significantly below the\n    IOER rate, banks could \n    purchase the fed funds and hold them as reserves with the Fed, earning the\n    difference. The \n    ability of banks to engage in arbitrage should limit the size of the deviations\n    between the IOER \n    rate and the fed funds rate. Thus, through the IOER rate, the Federal Reserve\n    can effectively \nretain control of monetary policy.\n\nIn addition to paying interest on excess\n    reserves, the Federal Reserve also has the ability \n    to drain the excess reserves from the banking system. This can be done in\n    a variety of ways: \n    reverse repo transactions with dealers and other counterparties, securities\n    sales from the Fed’s \n    portfolio or bill issuance by the Treasury, with the funds deposited at the\n    Federal Reserve. \n    Although our ability to pay interest on excess reserves is sufficient to\n    retain control of monetary \n    policy, it is not bad policy to have both a “belt and suspenders” in\n    place. As a result, we are \n    working out ways to drain reserves to provide reassurance that we will not—under\n    any \ncircumstance—lose control of monetary policy.\n\nA related concern is the\n    question of whether the Federal Reserve will be able to act \n    quickly enough once it determines that it is time to raise rates. This concern\n    reflects the view \n    that the excess reserves sitting on banks’ balance sheets are essentially “dry\n    tinder” that could \n    quickly fuel excessive credit creation and put the Fed behind the curve in\n    tightening monetary \npolicy.\n\nIn terms of imagery, this concern seems compelling—the banks sitting\n    on piles of money \n    that could be used to extend credit on a moment’s notice. However,\n    this reasoning ignores a \n    very important point. Based on how monetary policy has been conducted for\n    several decades, \n    banks have always had the ability to expand credit whenever they like. They\n    don’t\n    need a pile \n    of “dry tinder” in the form of excess reserves to do so. That\n    is because the Federal Reserve has \n    committed itself to supply sufficient reserves to keep the fed funds rate\n    at its target. If banks \n    want to expand credit and that drives up the demand for reserves, the Fed\n    automatically meets \n    that demand in its conduct of monetary policy. In terms of the ability to\n    expand credit rapidly, it \nmakes no difference whether the banks have lots of excess reserves or not.\n\nAnother\n    source of concern among some market participants has been the Federal Reserve’s\n    purchase of Treasury securities. The worry here is that the Federal Reserve’s\n     purchases are “monetizing the debt” and that therefore these\n    purchases will ultimately prove \ninflationary.\n\nRegarding the Fed’s Treasury purchase program, I want to make two points.\n    First, with \n    the fed funds rate constrained at zero lower bound, policymakers needed to\n    find other ways to \n    stimulate economic activity. The agency debt and agency MBS purchase programs\n    proved \n    effective in narrowing credit spreads in the debt and MBS market, but the\n    Federal Reserve would \n    have encountered diminishing returns in terms of impaired market function\n    if it had raised the \n    sizes of these two programs further. This suggested that the best course\n    to hold down mortgage \n    rates and other private borrowing rates would be to engage in a Treasury\n    purchase program that \n    would put downward pressure on Treasury rates. In this regard, the Fed’s\n    purchases have not \n    been motivated by accommodating an expansive fiscal policy and the large\n    fiscal deficits that are \n    its consequence. I can assure you that the Federal Reserve will never engage\n    in a program to \n    accommodate or facilitate an unsustainable fiscal policy program. Instead,\n    these programs were \n    designed to help ease financial conditions at a time that the Federal Reserve\n    could not push the \nfed funds rate below zero.\n\nSecond, the program is small. So even if one were\n    to take a darker view of what the \n    Federal Reserve has done, it is important to put the purchase program in\n    context. Even after \n    completion of a purchase program of up to $300 billion of Treasuries, the\n    Federal Reserve’s \n    holdings of Treasuries will be smaller than they had been in August 2007\n    on the eve of the crisis. \n    Moreover, as a share of Treasuries outstanding, the Fed’s share will\n    be the lowest since the early \n1990s.\n\nOverall, the Federal Reserve’s balance-sheet expansion has had\n    notable benefits. The \n    asset purchase programs have helped to keep longer-term private interest\n    rates relatively low, \n    and the expansion of liquidity facilities has helped to restore more normal\n    market function. \n    However, this does not mean that the Federal Reserve balance-sheet expansion\n    and Treasury \n    purchase program are cost free, only that the benefits of these programs,\n    individually and \n    collectively, are seen as exceeding the potential costs.\n\nNevertheless, there are three issues on the cost side that deserve note.\n    First, policymakers need to take seriously any concerns that the Fed’s\n    actions might conceivably lead \n    to an inflation problem. After all, inflation is driven mainly by two variables—inflation\n    expectations and the degree of pressure on resources. It would be potentially\n    very damaging if \n    any of the Fed’s programs were to unhinge inflation expectations.\n    One risk with embarking on \n    the Treasury purchase program was that it had the potential to create the\n    misperception that the \n    Fed was providing the fiscal authorities with the means to fund a more stimulative\n    fiscal policy \n    than they would otherwise have been able to finance. This misperception around\n    the intent and \n    purpose of the program could have undermined the Fed’s credibility\n    and triggered a damaging \n    rise in inflation expectations. Indeed, one of my primary goals for this\n    speech is to make it clear \n    that we have not compromised our ability or our commitment to keep inflation\n    in check. \n    Keeping inflation and inflation expectations well anchored around a low level\nis essential.\n\nSecond, the Federal Reserve’s balance-sheet expansion\n    does have a consequence for the \n    balance sheet of the banking system. The increase in the amount of excess\n    reserves has to be \n    held by banks. Excess reserves are a risk-free asset that they may not wish\n    to hold. More \n    important, to the extent that the banks worry about their overall leverage\n    ratios, it is possible that \n    a large increase in excess reserves could conceivably diminish the willingness\n    of banks to lend. \n    At present, these balance-sheet issues do not appear to be having a meaningful\n    effect on bank \n    behavior. In fact, the excess reserves serve as a liquidity buffer that many\n    banks find attractive \n    in the current environment. But that does not mean we can ignore this issue.\n    We need to keep \n    this issue in mind as we contemplate how much balance-sheet expansion might\nbe appropriate.\n\nThird, the Federal Reserve is taking on some interest-rate\n  risk in terms of its balance \n    sheet. The excess reserves have an overnight maturity. These liabilities\n    are being used to \n    purchase longer-term assets. In principle, if short-term interest rates were\n    to move up very \n    sharply, the cost of funding could eventually exceed the return on the Fed’s\n    assets. The bigger \nour balance sheet, the greater the amount of interest-rate risk we are assuming.\n\nWe\n    have examined this issue in detail. Suffice it to say, it is conceivable\n    that the Federal  Reserve’s net-interest margin could be pinched in\n    certain environments—say\n    if the economic \n    recovery turned out to be very robust. But our analysis shows that it is\n    extremely unlikely that \n    the Fed’s net-interest margin will turn negative. In part, that is\n    due to the fact that the balance-sheet \n    risk associated with the interest-rate mismatch is offset to a large degree\n    by the fact that the \n    cost of much of the Fed’s liabilities—the amount of currency\n    outstanding—is\n    zero. So when \n    short-term rates rise, the cost of a significant portion of the Fed’s\nliabilities is unaffected.\n\nMaking policy during a crisis involves making tough\n  choices. Perfect solutions are not \n  always achievable or even legally feasible. I can assure you that our decisions\n  have been made \n  carefully, always with an eye toward finding the right balance between the\n  risks and rewards of \n  alternative options. Most critical is our commitment never to take actions\n  that might \n  compromise our ability to retain our control of monetary policy and that\n  might undermine our\n  ability to achieve our dual mandate of full employment and price stability.\n\nThank\n  you for your kind attention. I would be very happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________ 1 However, it was anticipated that the attractiveness of the Fed’s\nfacilities would decline as market conditions improved. In fact, it was a key\nelement of the exit strategy that was deliberately built into the design of most\nof the facilities. 2 That rate is unlikely to spur too much lending\nright now given the constraints on credit availability, but at some future date\nit undoubtedly would be too low once the recovery is sufficiently advanced and\ncredit conditions improved. 3 For a more detailed discussion of monetary policy\nimplementation under a regime in which the central bank pays interest on reserves,\nsee: Todd Keister, Antoine Martin, and James J.

The Federal Reserve would have precise\n  control over the IOER and this would lead to some variability in the actual\n  fed funds rate. This would not be much of a departure from the\n  recent past in which the actual fed funds rate has tended to fluctuate closely\n  around the fed funds target.",

    "text": "I am the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, part of the Federal Reserve System that serves as our nation's central bank. In this capacity I am also vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Federal Reserve committee that sets interest rates and makes other decisions about monetary policy. This committee sets policy to advance the mandate given to us by Congress: to promote maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIn the support of these objectives I and my colleagues must also guard as best we can against threats to financial stability, because credit is the lifeblood of the economy. Without financial stability we cannot achieve good economic outcomes, as the experience of the past few years so painfully demonstrates.\n\nI will talk today about our nation's economy and the challenges that we face. As you know, the state of our economy is important not just for the well-being of our people, but also for the national security of our country. We need a strong economy so that we have the fiscal capacity and technological, industrial and educational dynamism to sustain a military capable of defending America's global interests.\n\nToday I will focus on why it has proven so difficult to generate a strong economic recovery. I will then lay out some prescriptions as to what we can do to put growth on a firmer footing. This is not just about what the Federal Reserve can do on the monetary policy front, but also about what other steps can be taken elsewhere—in areas such as financial stability, housing policy, fiscal policy, and structural adjustment to facilitate domestic and global economic rebalancing. Before I continue, let me remind you that the views I offer today are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues on the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nRecent Developments and the Outlook for the U.S. Economy We stand here today several years after the onset of the worst financial crisis in modern times. The origins of the crisis are complex, but it had its roots in the bursting of a credit bubble that had grown to great size during the middle part of the last decade. Prior to the onset of the crisis, a combination of rapid financial innovation and unbalanced global economic integration resulted in a mispricing of risk worldwide. This was particularly extreme in certain markets such as U.S. housing and housing finance.\n\nThis mispricing of risk led to a misallocation of resources and an excessive build-up of debt in many parts of the global economy. Many—though not all—U.S. households responded to the easy availability of credit and rising home prices by taking on more debt. When the housing boom lost steam and began to burst, expectations about housing prices and wealth were disappointed. The bursting of the credit bubble also created instability within the global financial system, and this in turn resulted in a sharp constraint in the availability of credit for households and businesses.\n\nThe result was what is now called the \"Great Recession.\" Over the period from late 2007 through mid-2009, real gross domestic product (GDP) declined more than 5 percent, making this recession the longest and deepest recession of the postwar period.\n\nThe recession manifested itself in many ways, but one of the most painful was the severe impact it had on the labor market. Employment dropped sharply during the recession, contributing to a sharp rise in the unemployment rate from around 4.5 percent in the middle of 2007 to over 10 percent in October 2009.\n\nExtraordinary actions by authorities around the world, including the Federal Reserve, prevented full-scale financial and economic collapse, and the global economy stabilized around mid-2009. But since then, the recovery has been bifurcated. While emerging economies have rebounded rapidly, the developed world has grown only slowly. This has hastened a historic shift in the balance of economic power that was already underway before the crisis.\n\nIn the United States, the recovery has proven to be persistently weaker than expected. Growth has been insufficient to either bring down unemployment significantly or to achieve a self-reinforcing cycle of strengthening confidence, demand, income and employment.\n\nAlthough the latest news on the U.S. economy is somewhat more encouraging than that from earlier in the year, we should not take much solace from that. After a very weak first half, when growth was less than one percent, economic activity has strengthened somewhat and inflation pressures are starting to ease. Growth in the third quarter is currently estimated 2.5 percent, and recent indicators suggest growth in the fourth quarter could be somewhat higher. However as we look toward 2012 the U.S. economy continues to face several obstacles to a robust economy. Accordingly, I expect growth of about 2.75 percent for 2012, not much higher. We also continue to face significant downside risks, mostly related to the stress in the eurozone.\n\nWe cannot be satisfied with the current state of the economy or the outlook for the next few years. The economy is operating far below its productive potential –leaving the levels of output, income and employment much lower than they would be if the economy's unused resources were put back to work. One summary statistic says it all—the unemployment rate is unacceptably high at 9 percent.\n\nImbalances and Deleveraging So why has the U.S. recovery been so underwhelming? I think the answer lies in the nature of the boom in credit and housing, and the collateral damage that the bust caused to household balance sheets and to the financial system. Recoveries that take place in the aftermath of severe financial shocks and big declines in asset prices that were mainly funded by debt require highly indebted borrowers to deleverage, or in other words , pay down their debts.\n\nThese shocks and asset price declines, in turn, generate large losses for the financial sector that tightens credit availability and further restricts demand. With weak demand comes weak income growth. Meanwhile, financial and economic volatility and the uncertainty this creates about prospects for future incomes causes those who retain access to credit to hold back.\n\nWhat we have learned, I think, is that the power of these economic forces is even stronger than we had previously understood. And, in such circumstances, although a stimulative monetary policy is essential for recovery, it may not be sufficient.\n\nTo illustrate the problem, let's begin by examining net debt flows in the private nonfinancial and government sectors over the last 10 years. As can be seen in Chart 1 , borrowing by the private nonfinancial sector rose rapidly from 2003 to 2006 and remained high until the crisis hit. Then borrowing turned negative as new loans were more than offset by repayments and write-offs. Only recently has borrowing turned weakly positive.\n\nChart 2 illustrates how the stock of net debt in different sectors of the economy evolved throughout this period. It shows that much of the credit boom was concentrated in the household sector. The business sector only experienced a surge from 2006 onward.\n\nDuring the boom, leverage also increased in the financial sector. As the boom proceeded, credit losses were low and earnings strong. But once the bust began, this dynamic reversed. Credit losses at financial institutions surged and the sector was forced to deleverage rapidly and raise new capital. This resulted in a significant contraction in the availability of credit and was a major direct shock to the global economy. Crucially, this tightening of credit standards exacerbated how much many households and firms had to deleverage. It also crimped demand, inhibiting economic, employment and income growth, which in turn made the deleveraging process more challenging.\n\nThe nature of this process can be usefully illustrated with a simple, but important accounting identity based on the difference between current income and expenditure in each of the nonfinancial sectors of the economy. For each sector, this difference we call the balance. If the economy were isolated from the rest of the world, then government-sector balance and private-sector balance would add up to zero.\n\nIn real life, of course, we have a foreign sector, too. If the United States in total spends more than it earns, that must be offset by foreigners spending less than they earn and vice versa. When domestic expenditures exceed income, this produces a deficit in the current account balance. Putting these pieces together we have: government-sector balance + private-sector balance = current account balance\n\nAs can be seen in Chart 3 , when the crisis hit, the private-sector balance moved quickly into positive territory as households in general tried to save more, and this was accommodated by a record government deficit and a smaller current account deficit. More recently, the private-sector surplus has declined and the government deficit has decreased, with little change in the external balance.\n\nThis distribution of surplus and deficit across the economy's different sectors illustrates a substantial challenge for U.S. economy. In the early stages of adjustment, it was quite appropriate for the government to offset part of the sharp increase in private-sector net saving with increased borrowing. If this had not occurred, the recession would have been even deeper. But at 10 percent of GDP, the government-sector deficit must be reduced over time to avoid creating an unsustainably large government debt burden. This decrease in the fiscal deficit has to be offset by some combination of a smaller current-account deficit or reduced private-sector surplus.\n\nOver time, the U.S. economy needs to increase net exports. However, a rapid turnaround will be hard to accomplish in a world in which most other nations are also looking to increase net exports to support retrenchment at home.\n\nSo it appears likely that even as we try to lay the foundation for a more export-oriented economy, securing the recovery will require help from the domestic private sector—a smaller private-sector surplus. But if highly indebted households continue to deleverage, while those households and businesses with low debt remain very cautious about spending and investment, there will be little impetus in this direction. In that case, the U.S. economy will have trouble building forward momentum.\n\nThe financial sector also plays an important role in this process. If credit availability remains tight, then households and businesses may not be able to increase their borrowing even if they want to. While major financial institutions in the United States have strengthened their capital positions significantly since the peak of the crisis in 2008, and deleveraging has abated, the financial system as a whole is still undergoing a process of repair.\n\nTo understand our prospects a bit better, we need to look at the likely behaviors of business and household sectors separately.\n\nCircumstances for the business sector are mixed with larger corporations generally in much better shape than smaller businesses. Many large corporations entered the recession with healthy balance sheets. While leverage 1 did increase sharply in the recession, it has subsequently come back down to levels similar to the 1990s. Record profit margins have enabled large corporations to build substantial buffers of highly liquid assets.\n\nLarge businesses are cautious because of concerns about the sustainability of growth and demand, political dysfunction, the health of the financial system and their ability to retain their access to credit throughout the business cycle.\n\nFor smaller firms, the situation is generally more difficult. Because this sector has a higher exposure to real estate, falling real estate values pushed up leverage for this group and it remains well above previous historical highs. Although small businesses identify weak demand as their major problem, the availability of credit is also an issue. An improvement in their ability to obtain credit would seem to require some stabilization of real estate prices and a substantial increase in demand for their products and services.\n\nTurning now to the household sector, Chart 4 shows that a combination of the fall in interest rates, paying down of debt and debt write-offs has substantially lowered the share of income required for households to service their debt. However, as shown in Chart 5 , the average homeowner still is substantially more leveraged than before the crisis and has lower net worth.\n\nOne significant problem is the trajectory of home prices. Homeowners have lost more than $6,000 billion in home equity since the housing market turned. For homeowners with mortgage debt, about one-quarter of these homeowners have mortgage debt that exceeds the value of their homes. The loss of home equity is a serious problem in itself of course, but it has been exacerbated by the fact that many households have found it very difficult to refinance to take advantage of lower mortgage rates.\n\nWithout a substantial improvement in the ability to refinance, the outlook for real estate prices, and in income prospects, it seems likely that many of the households that ended up with too much debt after house prices fell 30 percent from their peak may need to deleverage further.\n\nThis implies that for the household balance to fall and provide an impetus to growth, those households with low debts will have to spend more of their income. In many ways these households are in a similar situation to large corporations: their balance sheets contain substantial liquid assets. They are undertaking precautionary saving as a response to greater uncertainty about the economic outlook and their long-term prospects.\n\nIn more normal times, lowering short-term interest rates would induce households and businesses to spend more or invest more in less liquid long-term assets as the real return on their liquid short-term assets fell. The increase in expenditures produced by this change then would lead to increased employment and income growth, higher assets values and a virtuous, reinforcing circle. However, with short-term interest rates close to zero already and problems in the housing market, this standard rebalancing channel is not working as well as we would like.\n\nThis discussion, I hope, has underscored two important truths. First, while deleveraging had to take place following the excesses of the boom period, both the extent of deleveraging on the part of those with high debts, and the degree of precautionary savings by those with low debts, depend on many factors, some of which can be influenced by the policy choices we make.\n\nSecond, the amount of deleveraging and precautionary savings depends on the availability of credit and the health of the financial system and upon the degree to which income is sustained during this deleveraging process. Note that if income growth is sufficiently weak, households may struggle to achieve desired increases in savings and reductions in leverage, which appears to have been the situation of late.\n\nPolicy Responses in This Environment So what should be done? What should economic policy do to secure the recovery and provide a sustainable environment for long-term growth? Clearly, monetary policy will continue to have an important role. But other, complementary, policy initiatives will also be important.\n\nMonetary policy is important as a means of sustaining aggregate demand at a time that the deleveraging process is not yet fully complete and credit availability remains impaired. Sustained low interest rates help support financial asset and house prices, induce households and firms that do not have high debt to save less and spend more, and enable households that do have high levels of debt to refinance them at lower rates. This reduces the amount of deleveraging that has to take place.\n\nHowever, the ability of monetary policy to provide additional support is somewhat constrained by the zero bound—the fact that we cannot lower short-term interest rates below zero, and have to rely on other, less efficient means, to put further downward pressure on longer term borrowing costs. As a result, it becomes progressively more difficult to induce households with low-debt to bring forward consumption by buying motor vehicles or other consumer durables, and to provide further support for asset prices and household net worth. Finally, problems in housing mean that this sector is relatively unresponsive to the low level of interest rates.\n\nDespite this, we are not out of ammunition. Although short-term interest rates have been effectively at zero since December 2008, the Federal Reserve has used other tools—such as balance sheet expansion and communication policies to lower longer term rates and make financial conditions more supportive of growth.\n\nWe could do more in both directions. For instance, we could elaborate on our forward commitment to keep short-term rates low. Indeed, I believe it would be desirable if the committee were able to provide additional guidance as to the economic conditions that the committee would expect to see before raising interest rates.\n\nAnd we could purchase more longer term financial assets. If additional asset purchases were deemed appropriate, it might make sense to do much of this in the mortgage-backed securities market. This would have a greater direct impact on the housing market and would be less likely to disrupt market functioning compared with further purchases in the Treasury market.\n\nAt the same time, we do have to recognize the costs as well as the benefits of further action. Forward commitment entails some risks to our credibility since it is difficult to capture all the considerations that go into policy judgments in simple and concise language. And balance sheet expansion has potential costs, as well.\n\nThese potential costs stem not only because some may view balance sheet expansion as sowing the seeds of future inflation—an incorrect view in my opinion—but also because balance sheet expansion increases the amount of interest rate risk in the Federal Reserve's portfolio of assets and could, if carried to an extreme, harm private market functioning.\n\nBecause reasonable people can differ over the costs and benefits of further action, you should not be surprised that there is vigorous debate among FOMC participants about whether more monetary policy stimulus should be applied. Don't take this debate for disagreement about the broader goal: I am convinced that all FOMC members are committed to taking whatever steps they deem would help advance the dual mandate of price stability and full employment.\n\nFor my own part, I am deeply unhappy with the current forecast of prolonged high unemployment, and will continue to review whether there is more that we could do that would bring more benefit than cost.\n\nMonetary policy must do its part. But there is a strong case for complementary policy actions because such actions can help secure better outcomes than can be achieved through monetary policy alone. If we are to achieve the best possible recovery and build for the future, we will also need ongoing efforts across four broad fronts: financial stability, housing policy, fiscal policy and structural adjustment to foster more sustainable U.S. growth and a more balanced global economy.\n\nOngoing attention to financial stability and the reform and repair of the financial system is essential to support recovery. We need to make sure this proceeds in a manner that is not pro-cyclical, and for this reason we are, for instance, phasing in new capital and liquidity standards, and monitoring how institutions adjust to the new requirements. Nonetheless, the financial system must be healthy to support sustained access to credit. If we want those households and businesses with low levels of debt to reduce precautionary saving, we need to restore their confidence in the financial system.\n\nThis means providing credible assurance that the financial sector is in solid shape today and that the restructured financial system will be able to reliably supply credit across the business cycle – ensuring there is no 2008-style sudden sharp constriction in credit availability. For this reason, policies that increase financial stability, both ex ante by eliminating incentives for excessive risk-taking and making the system more robust to failure, and ex post, by ensuring the capacity to respond to a major shock, will help support growth today.\n\nThe process of financial repair also matters greatly in terms of high debt households, since underwriting standards help define how much deleveraging must occur to regain access to credit. While we do not want a return to the easy credit standards of the bubble period, we also don't what to overshoot in the opposite direction.\n\nHousing is another area where policy can support the recovery by helping to stabilize house prices and housing activity. Housing is the most important tangible asset for most American households, and housing debt the biggest liability. Obstacles to mortgage refinancing undermine the impact of monetary policy. Moreover, declines in house prices and the risk of future declines directly affect the degree of deleveraging that needs to take place among homeowners with high levels of debt, and the extent of precautionary saving by homeowners with low levels of debt.\n\nWhile home prices had to correct following the bubble, they no longer appear overvalued relative to historic multiples of cash flow, income and rents. But it would be unwise to simply assume the market will bottom out at these levels for three reasons. First, expectations of house price declines can easily be self-fulfilling. The feared loss in value can overwhelm the benefit of low mortgage rates, leading would-be buyers to sit out the market.\n\nSecond, with home construction at minimal levels, housing supply cannot decline in response to weak demand. Home prices thus are very sensitive to shifts in demand and credit supply. If access to mortgage credit for home purchases is unduly restricted, the market-clearing price for housing will be lower than it would be if access to mortgage credit was less constrained.\n\nThird, in contrast to the efficient mechanisms in place in the commercial property market to work-out troubled debt, the infrastructure of the residential mortgage market is wholly inadequate to deal with a systemic shock to the housing market. Left alone, this flawed structure will destroy much more value in housing than is necessary.\n\nIn a recent speech I called for a comprehensive approach to housing policy. This might include actions to 1) prudently expand access to mortgage credit for homebuyers, including by limiting putback risks that discourage loan origination and addressing problems with appraisals;\n\n2) eliminate frictions and lower costs to refinancing for all borrowers with prime conforming loans;\n\n3) enable borrowers who are \"underwater\" on their loans but continue to make their monthly payments to earn accelerated principal reduction over time;\n\n4) provide bridge financing for borrowers with proven ability to service their debts who lose their jobs and may take longer than normal to find new jobs in today's weak labor market; and\n\n5) manage the disposition of homes repossessed by creditors in a manner supportive of large-scale conversion into rental units.\n\nI am encouraged by the recent decision by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to make it easier for certain borrowers with high loan-to-value ratios to refinance. I hope this initial step will be followed by others that collectively move in the direction of stabilizing house prices. I believe this would not just be good economic policy, but it would also be extremely beneficial for taxpayers, who now effectively own the credit risk of those home loans guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nOn the fiscal policy front, ongoing support for demand from the public sector at a time when many households are deleveraging sustains jobs and incomes. But this can be partly or wholly offset if households and businesses lack confidence in the long-term fiscal outlook for our nation.\n\nIt would be greatly beneficial if the Administration and Congress could more effectively work together to craft a coherent fiscal policy. As I see it, this would consist of two elements—continued near-term fiscal support to underpin economic activity and long-term fiscal consolidation to ensure debt sustainability. Without action in Washington, fiscal policy will turn sharply restrictive in 2012—exerting a direct drag on real GDP growth of more than one percentage point. At the same time, the long-term path under current policy is unsustainable.\n\nIt should be possible, even in a time of sharp ideological differences, to agree on some common pro-growth principles: support for demand today made possible by credible long-term fiscal consolidation, and a mix of fiscal adjustments that are supportive of future growth. This would involve making an appropriate distinction between outlays that support current consumption versus outlays that lift the economy's long-run potential such as investment in infrastructure, research and human capital—similarly, between taxes that inhibit work and investment versus those that are more neutral in their impact. Broadening the tax base and making tax system simpler might also be helpful. Progress on the fiscal front would have an important ancillary benefit—a demonstration that Washington can put aside partisan interests and step up to the challenges our nation faces would boost household and business confidence.\n\nFinally, we need structural adjustment policies to facilitate the reorientation of the U.S. economy away from the growth path of the previous business cycle—away from a reliance on asset price gains and easy credit to support consumption to a more durable long-term growth path with greater reliance on business investment and exports.\n\nAs I discussed in a previous speech, we can learn from the example of emerging nations that took the tough decisions necessary to emerge from past crises stronger, more competitive, and better positioned to take advantage of their comparative advantages in a fast-transforming world economy. This means not just plugging gaps of deficient demand, but also solving structural problems.\n\nDone right, such structural reforms would provide the foundations for long-term growth. But this would also support the recovery today. By boosting household and business confidence about the future and about their future income prospects, this would reduce the need and desire to further deleverage and increase precautionary savings.\n\nA structural adjustment program for the U.S. would include a number of elements beyond those already mentioned. These include labor market policies to retrain workers, investment in education and infrastructure, more efficient regulation, more efficient provision of healthcare services, and pro-growth trade and immigration reform.\n\nSteps that raise the productivity of U.S. workers lead to rising living standards. Also, they can help put the economy on a more sustainable fiscal path. Higher productivity leads to a bigger economy that can more easily support the ever increasing number of retired workers.\n\nAs we take such steps to put our own house in order, we could reasonably look to other nations to take complementary steps to promote global economic rebalancing. By spurring domestic demand growth, emerging market economies could support global activity while enabling their own citizens to reap the full benefits of the remarkable increases in productivity and output they have achieved in recent years.\n\nIf we were to take all the steps outlined above, then I think we will have a pretty good 2012, with even better prospects after that. If instead, it is all left to monetary policy, then the outlook will be much less satisfactory. My baseline forecast—absent the full suite of complementary policies to support growth—is that 2012 will not differ much from the second half of 2011: moderate growth, slightly stronger employment and some moderation of inflation. But I worry about the downside risks to this forecast especially if the stresses in Europe continue to escalate, or if little progress is made on housing, fiscal policy and global rebalancing. In particular, accommodative monetary policy becomes much less effective if the housing market remains in the doldrums.\n\nConclusion I know that I have laid out here today a daunting set of policy objectives in an environment that is quite challenging. But before being discouraged by that, let's reflect for a moment on what we already have achieved to date and some of the reasons why success is fully within our grasp. U.S. households have already undertaken considerable deleveraging. The U.S. financial system has made material progress toward better health. House prices are back at levels consistent with long-term affordability ratios. Banks have much more capital than they had on the eve of the financial crisis, the quality of that capital is much better and liquidity buffers are now much deeper. Credit availability is slowly improving. Though our challenges are large, we have come a good way already.\n\nAnd the policy challenges we face are not insurmountable. Even the long-term fiscal issues are not as intractable as some maintain; Social Security can be put on a sustainable trajectory with relatively moderate changes, and while Medicare and Medicaid are more complex, successful reform must be possible given that other industrialized economies spend a lot less on healthcare, often with better results across the population.\n\nEven with determined effort the road ahead will not be easy, and it will be several years before our economy once again operates at something close to its true potential and all who seek work have a good chance of finding employment.\n\nHowever, provided we secure the recovery, there is every reason to expect our nation will return in time to prosperity and solid growth. The United States has an extraordinarily flexible economy with a strong entrepreneurial bias that generates new opportunities, jobs and income. Our higher education system is second to none and the country remains a magnet for talented people around the world. The United States has better demographics than most developed countries and some very impressive institutions—such as the U.S. Army—that provide a pathway upward for all based on merit regardless of background.\n\nAmerica's place in a fast-adapting world economy and the prosperity and economic strength of our nation will depend upon the choices we make. In this fundamental sense our economic destiny is in our own hands. Let's get at it.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\nI would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n______________________________________ 1 Defined here as credit market debt to net worth.",

    "text": "Good morning.  I am very pleased to be in Bridgeport and to  speak with you today.  I would like to  give a special thanks to the University of Bridgeport for their part in making  this event possible.\n\nMy visit today is part of our  ongoing efforts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to better understand  the regional economy.  We plan trips like  this so that we can meet with a diverse array of stakeholders in the region to  gain insights and perspectives on the local economy.  These trips also allow us to hear from Main Street  about the major issues and concerns affecting people and businesses in the  area.  Fairfield County is our first  destination in 2016, and this is the second time we have visited the area in  the past three years.\n\nI am looking forward to meeting  with a number of different groups today.  After starting our day here at the University  of Bridgeport, we will meet with an organization called The WorkPlace to hear  about some of the nationally-recognized programs they have successfully  developed to help the long-term unemployed find jobs.  Long-term unemployment is a significant  problem in the broader economy, and something that I will discuss in more  detail later in my remarks.  Next, we  will take a tour of the American Job Center, an organization that provides  workforce assistance to job seekers in conjunction with local businesses.  Later we will attend, a roundtable lunch with  members of the Bridgeport Regional Business Community.  And, finally, we will meet with leadership  from the Housing Development Fund, New Horizons and NeighborWorks America to  hear about the state of affordable housing and community development in  Fairfield County.\n\nThese trips are valuable to us, and  represent one of the many ways in which the New York Fed engages with people  and businesses in our region.  Another  one of our efforts in this vein is our Small  Business Credit Survey ―the latest version of which was released last  month.  This survey―which includes  responses from across 26 states―helps us understand the challenges facing small  businesses in the region, focusing on financing needs and impediments to  obtaining credit.  We partnered with  multiple organizations throughout Connecticut to produce this survey―some of  which are right here in Bridgeport―and received responses from nearly 200 small  business owners from around the state.   I’d like to personally thank those who participated in the survey.\n\nThe remainder of my remarks will  focus on recent developments in the national and local economy.  As always, what I have to say today reflects  my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nU.S. Economic Outlook\n\nDespite the swings we have seen in  financial markets over the past few months and the recent divergences across  different economic and financial market indicators, recent developments have  not led me to make a fundamental change in my outlook for the U.S. economy.  I continue to expect that the economy will  expand over the course of this year at a pace slightly above its long-term  trend—sufficient to push the unemployment rate down a bit further and to more  fully utilize the nation’s labor resources.   On inflation, although recent data have been somewhat firmer, it still  appears that inflation for this year will fall short of our 2 percent objective  for the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator.  However, I anticipate an eventual return to  our objective as the transitory factors that have held down inflation dissipate  over time.\n\nIn assessing the current state of  the U.S. economy, recent news has generated divergent signals.  Several sectors have been showing signs of  softness.  Real consumer spending growth  appears to have moderated somewhat from the relatively robust pace of the  second half of 2015.  Both new and  existing home sales have flattened since the middle of last year.  Finally, indicators of real business  investment spending point to continued softness.  In contrast, manufacturing production—which  had been a particular weak spot of the U.S. economy in 2015—rose in the first  two months of this year.  Recent survey  data, including our own Empire State  Manufacturing Survey , indicate further improvement in conditions for the  manufacturing sector in March.\n\nThrough it all, the U.S. labor  market has remained healthy.  Payroll  employment increased an average of about 229,000 per month over the course of  2015, and the gains in the first quarter of this year were nearly as high.  Even though the unemployment rate ticked up  in March to 5 percent, the amount of slack in the labor market still appears to  be diminishing.  Both the share of the  population that is employed and the labor force participation rate have risen a  bit over the past several months, with the employment-to-population ratio now  at its highest level since the end of the recession.  However, measures of aggregate wage growth  have remained quite subdued, which suggests there is still some slack in the  labor market.\n\nAn important question is how to  reconcile these cross-currents.  I  continue to anticipate that consumption and housing activity will expand at a  moderate pace this year.  Continued job  and wage gains, combined with still-low energy prices, should sustain real  disposable income growth and support consumer spending.  The housing market should remain on a solid  trajectory, supported by rising employment and low mortgage rates.  In contrast to previous years, fiscal policy  should also provide a moderate stimulus this year.  I believe that these positive factors will be  sufficient to offset weakness in other areas, such as net exports and fixed  business investment that will continue to be adversely impacted by the  still-strong dollar, weak foreign growth, and low energy and commodity prices.\n\nPutting this all together, I expect  real GDP growth of about 2 percent in 2016, slightly below the average pace of  growth in this expansion, but a bit above my estimate of the potential growth  of the U.S. economy.  If this  materializes, then we should see some further reduction in the unemployment  rate to around 4¾ percent—my estimate of the rate that I view as consistent  with stable inflation over the long term.\n\nTurning to the outlook for inflation,  on a year-over-year basis, both headline and core inflation have recently risen  above the low levels that prevailed through most of 2015.  Nevertheless, inflation still remains below  the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent objective.   As the FOMC noted in its March statement, this continued low inflation  is partly due to declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices.  Although energy prices have stopped falling  and the dollar has stopped appreciating, earlier movements in these factors  still appear to be weighing on inflation.\n\nA concern with this long period of  low inflation is that it has the potential to reduce inflation expectations,  which, in turn, would tend to continue to hold down inflation.  As past experience shows, it is difficult to  push inflation back up to the central bank’s objective if inflation  expectations fall meaningfully below that objective.  Japan’s experience is cautionary in this  regard.\n\nRecent evidence on inflation  expectations suggests some firming, but there is still cause for concern.  Although both measures of longer-term  inflation compensation based on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury  securities as well as some survey measures of inflation expectations have risen  modestly since mid-February, the levels of many of these measures remain quite  low.\n\nNow, as I have noted, the low level  of market-based inflation compensation probably reflects factors besides  inflation expectations, in particular lower term premiums.  Still, it would be prudent to consider the  possibility that longer-term inflation expectations of market participants may  have declined somewhat.  Even after a  rise in its most recent reading, the median of the three-year inflation  expectations from the New York Fed’s Survey  of Consumer Expectations remains near its lowest reading over its short  history.  Renewed declines in survey  measures would be worrisome.  However, at  this point, my conclusion is that inflation expectations have not become  unanchored.\n\nIn sum, I anticipate that the  combination of decreasing resource slack and anchored longer-term inflation  expectations will help push inflation up to our 2 percent objective over the  medium term.  The recent rise in  inflation and in measures of inflation expectations have increased my  confidence around this outlook compared to earlier in the year, but it is still  possible that the return of inflation to our objective could take longer than I  anticipate.\n\nThe forecast that I have just  described is my best assessment of how the U.S. economy will evolve this year.  As always, there is uncertainty and risk  relative to this forecast, which also needs to be taken into consideration in  assessing the implications of the outlook for monetary policy.  I see the uncertainties around my forecast to  be somewhat greater than usual.  This  assessment reflects the divergent economic signals I highlighted earlier.  In addition, the factors behind the financial  turbulence we saw earlier this year do not yet appear to be resolved fully.\n\nAlthough the downside risks have  diminished since earlier in the year, I still judge the balance of risks to my  inflation and growth outlooks to be tilted slightly to the downside.  The low levels of energy and commodity prices  may signal more persistent disinflationary pressures than I currently anticipate,  while renewed tightening of financial market conditions could have a greater  negative impact on the U.S. economy.  Also,  there is significant uncertainty about economic growth prospects abroad and how  this will affect the U.S. economic outlook.  I continue to monitor global economic and  financial market developments closely to assess their implications for the  outlook.\n\nGiven my outlook and risk  assessment, I judge that a cautious and gradual approach to policy  normalization is appropriate.  Moreover,  caution is also called for because of our limited ability to reduce the policy  rate to respond to adverse developments, recognizing that we could also use  forward guidance and balance sheet policies to provide additional accommodation  if that proved warranted.  Of course, the  trajectory of short-term interest rates and the timing of future monetary  policy adjustments will continue to be informed by the incoming data—both  economic and financial—and how that data influences the outlook.\n\nThe Problem of Long-Term  Unemployment\n\nBefore turning to the outlook for  the local economy, I would like to spend a few minutes talking about the  problem of long-term unemployment.  The  Great Recession was very severe, resulting in a large decline in output and  damage to the labor market.  From peak to  trough, non-farm payroll employment declined by 8.7 million.  The unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent.  At the same time, the average duration of  unemployment increased significantly.  The  number of individuals classified as long-term unemployed—that is, those who  were unemployed for at least 27 weeks—peaked in December 2010 at 6.4 million,  an increase of 5.3 million from the cyclical low in May 2007.  Long-term unemployment as a fraction of total  unemployment increased from 16.7 percent to 44.8 percent.  The hardships of prolonged unemployment  touched many families around the country and this is tragic.\n\nThe very accommodative monetary  policy that we implemented in response was aimed at helping to heal the labor  market and promote price stability.  Slowly,  the economy began to respond and to recover.  In October 2014, the FOMC announced the end of  its latest asset purchase program citing that “there has been substantial  improvement in the outlook for the labor market since the inception of its  current asset purchase program.”  In  March 2015, the FOMC set out conditions for the decision to begin to normalize  monetary policy, stating “The Committee anticipates  that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds  rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably  confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the  medium term.”  The FOMC judged at its  December 2015 meeting that those conditions had been met.\n\nThe  improvement that we have seen in the labor market is very welcome.  It took until May 2014 for the labor market to  recover the jobs lost in the recession, but now there are 5.3 million jobs  beyond the prior cyclical peak.  The  unemployment rate has declined to 5.0 percent. With this improvement, the  number of long-term unemployed has been reduced to 2.2 million.  Despite these gains, it is important to  emphasize that more needs to be done to improve the labor market.  The current number of long-term unemployed is  still higher than the prior cyclical peak in June 2003, and is more than a million  above the prior cyclical low in October 2006.\n\nFurther  progress on transitioning these unemployed workers back into jobs requires  sustained effort on many fronts.  Essential  to this effort are programs such as the Platform to Employment developed by The  WorkPlace.  I am looking forward to my  visit there later today to hear more about this program.  The Platform to Employment program has been  replicated in nearly 20 communities across the country from Newark to San  Diego.  Helping the long-term unemployed  regain employment needs to be a priority for all of us.\n\nThe  ongoing challenge in reducing the number of long-term unemployed is also a  reminder of the importance of financial stability and sustainable economic  growth.  Recessions can quickly undo  years’ worth of hard-earned progress in the labor market.  Making the financial system and the economy  more resilient so we can avoid such deep downturns in the future is a  responsibility that I take very seriously.\n\nLocal Economic  Outlook\n\nTurning now to the region, while  Fairfield County’s economy has recovered from the Great Recession, its job  growth has lagged behind both New York City and the nation.  Only recently has employment approached its  pre-recession levels, and it is still well shy of where it was back in  2000.  Other barometers of the Fairfield  County economy, such as home prices, also indicate a slow recovery from the  recession.  There are still a sizable  number of properties that are either in foreclosure or up for foreclosure sale,  which has weighed down the local housing market.  Yet, Fairfield County has not been the only  place in the metro region to see a sluggish recovery—notably, both northern New  Jersey and the Mid-Hudson Valley have yet to see employment return to their  pre-recession peaks.\n\nThis picture is in contrast with  New York City’s economic performance, which has been exceptionally strong  throughout this expansion, and has been a driver of growth for the whole  tri-state region.  Why is New York City  seeing so much stronger job growth than Fairfield County?  After all, it wasn’t so long ago that  Stamford was attracting finance-sector jobs away from Manhattan.  The answer lies in a mix of cyclical and  secular trends.  On the cyclical side,  while finance employment has been sluggish in both New York City and Fairfield  County, New York City is benefiting from strong employment gains in technology,  construction, retailing and advertising—sectors that are not contributing to  the same degree in Fairfield County.  In  addition, Stamford has had to deal with the relocations of UBS and RBS, while  Fairfield faces the prospective relocation of GE.\n\nOne potential long-term trend that  is likely affecting the region is a renewed urbanization: that is, a gradual  but broad-based shift of preferences to urban living, especially for younger  generations.  Throughout the second half  of the 20th century, we saw a steady and widespread migration from  cities to suburbs.  More recently, this  suburbanization trend seems to have halted; and there are signs that cities,  especially major cities, have been gaining relative to their suburbs.  It’s too early to say if this is the start of  a secular trend, and the implications for Fairfield County are unclear.  However, Stamford and Bridgeport stand to  benefit from a shift in preferences toward more urban living, given their high  population densities and strong transit links to New York City.\n\nEven now, while Fairfield County  may have lagged in job growth, population growth has remained quite sturdy—not  only across the county, but here in Bridgeport as well.  In fact, Bridgeport’s population has grown by  about 6 percent since 2000—its first sustained increase since the 1940s —while  Stamford’s has grown by almost 10 percent.\n\nFairfield County can leverage its  proximity to the New York City job market.   While most residents of Fairfield County rely on job opportunities  locally, many residents commute to jobs in Manhattan.  So the strength in New York City’s economy  should be of significant help to Fairfield County.  Over the past year, New York City’s economy  has, on average, added more than twice as many jobs each month as the total  expected job losses from the relocations of GE, UBS and RBS.  While a majority of these jobs may not have  been in high-paying-industry sectors, some of them were—especially in  technology-related industries.  So, as  long as New York City keeps adding jobs at such a brisk pace, Fairfield County  will benefit.  In addition, research  indicates that a strong central city is critical for the well-being of its  suburbs, meaning that a healthy and growing New York City economy is critically  important to Fairfield County.\n\nWhat else can the region do to  foster economic growth going forward?  It  certainly helps for cities like Bridgeport and Stamford to be attractive  locations for businesses to locate and grow.   It is also important to focus on quality of life issues that make people  want to live here—like good schools and low crime, and also amenities ranging  from nice parks to good restaurants.   Bridgeport has clearly been making progress in this regard, both along  the waterfront at Steelpointe Harbor and along Main Street.  With New York City’s large and booming  economy nearby, and Metro North providing a convenient mass transit link,  anything that makes people more inclined to live here—and perhaps even set up  shop here—is bound to boost the local economy.   And finally, one of the most important ingredients for a healthy urban  economy is a well-trained and motivated work force.  It cannot be overstated how important it is  to help provide residents with the skills and tools they need to be productive  and successful, so that they can realize their full potential.\n\nCollege Graduates  Finding Good Jobs\n\nI would like to close with a  message for the students in attendance today, especially those of you who will  be graduating soon.  If you started  college four or five years ago, you may have heard about the difficult time  that graduates have had finding good jobs, perhaps even making you wonder about  the value of obtaining a college degree.  Indeed, in the years following the Great  Recession, unemployment and underemployment among recent college graduates  reached highs not seen in decades.  So,  it wouldn’t be surprising if many of you are concerned about your ability to  find a good job after graduation.\n\nI want to make two points that  should temper these concerns.  First, it  is not unusual for college graduates to take some time to find the right job  when they transition from school to the working world.  In good economic times, as well as in bad  times, there is often an adjustment period as newly-minted graduates search for  a job that best fits their skills and interests.  Second, as the job market has continued to  strengthen through the expansion, it has gotten easier for those graduating  from college to find a good job. 2\n\nWhile job opportunities for  those with a college degree were flat between 2011 and early 2014, demand for  college graduates has been on the rise for about two years now.  As a result, for the first time during this  recovery, both unemployment and underemployment among recent college graduates  has generally been falling.  This means  that, not only has it become easier to find a job upon graduation, but more  college graduates are taking jobs that better utilize their degrees.  In addition, starting salaries for recent  college graduates have been increasing for the past couple of years, reflecting  the growing demand for their skills in a tighter job market.\n\nTo conclude, while there are  economic challenges facing both the nation and the region, I am optimistic that  we will continue to make progress on both fronts over the next few years.  Achieving our dual mandate of maximum  sustainable employment and price stability will help those who will graduate  soon to achieve their own aspirations.\n\nThank you for your kind  attention.  I would be happy to take some  questions.\n\n1 Jaison Abel, Jason Bram, Tony Davis,  Richard Deitz, Jonathan McCarthy and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these  remarks.\n\n2 We have been tracking these developments  using data our economists have developed to help us better understand the job  prospects facing recent college graduates.

    "text": "Dr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nPresident  Dudley, can you please share with us the purpose of your trip here today to  Queens?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nSo,  there are 12 Federal Reserve Banks around the United States, and one of them is  the Federal Reserve Bank in New York that sits downtown in Manhattan, and near  Wall Street. Our Second District consists of New York, Northern New Jersey,  Fairfield County, Connecticut, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Haven't  gotten to the Virgin Islands yet.\n\nAs  part of our Mission, we want to represent the communities in our District, and  so four times a year, I get on the road, and I go out to visit people, to find  out what's really happening on the ground. It's meeting with businesses,  meeting with people from educational institutions, going to visit manufacturing  facilities, community development organizations.\n\nIt's  really designed to do two things. One, explain sort of a little bit of what we  do – like for example there, in the introduction, talking about this BIS. What the heck is the BIS?  Well, BIS  is a bank for central banks that sits in Basel, Switzerland.  In fact, what did I do last weekend?  Well, I was in Basel, Switzerland, at the BIS. This is where central bankers get together  from across the world, exchange information with one another.\n\nSo,  the first thing is to explain ourselves to people in the community. Because the  Federal Reserve is pretty mysterious in terms of – when I went to grad school  even, I wasn't really sure again what the Federal Reserve was. Had to be  explained to me.\n\nThe  second thing we do in the community, and this is the more important piece, is  to really learn what's going on, on the ground, in the community. What's happening  in terms of businesses – are they successful? If they're having trouble, what  are the reasons for the trouble? Do they have access to the credit? Can they  find people with the job skills they need to support their businesses?  What are the challenges in the community, in  terms of education, in terms of transportation?\n\nQueens,  one of the issues is that if you're not located near a subway line, it's pretty  hard to get around in Queens, and that has pretty significant implications for  people's ability to get to and from work, which is important in terms of  economic development.\n\nAnother  issue is the affordability of housing. Queens is actually doing quite well. If  you look at the employment growth in Queens over the last few years, it's been  very strong. Just like New York City as a whole. But one of the consequences of  economic development can be gentrification, where richer people move in and  they make housing less affordable for people who have been living here for a  much longer period of time.\n\nSo,  all these type of issues that we talk about when we visit. And oftentimes I get  some personal stories and anecdotes that are actually pretty valuable to me in  terms of how I think about how the economy is operating and what we need to do  as the Federal Reserve in terms of how we set monetary policy.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank  you. The economy is coming out of a serious crisis that started in 2008. From  your perspective, where do you see the greatest growth in the economy right  now?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  the good news is the economy is actually in a pretty good place right now. Not  for everybody, but if you think about the unemployment rate today, it's 4.7%,  which is pretty close to what we think is full employment. You could probably  push that unemployment rate even lower, but if you did, you'd probably start to  have an inflation problem. So, that would not be something that you could  sustain over the longer term. The Federal Reserve has two missions: maximum  sustainable employment and price stability. And so we're trying to find that  balance. Right now we're doing pretty well. We're pretty close to both our  objectives. In fact, if you could tell me that we could just stay here for the  next 20 or 30 years, I would be very happy with that.\n\nSo,  things are going pretty well. What's driving the economy? I think in the local  economy in Queens, it's very dependent on transportation, very high level of  transportation employment, in part because of La Guardia and JFK. Those  industries are doing quite well.\n\nTourism  is important to this region, so New York City has really benefited from  tourism. And the fact that people want to live in cities now as opposed to live  in suburbs or more rural areas is also helping a lot.\n\nIn  terms of actual employment in this area, you have the transportation  component.  Healthcare is also very, very  important. A lot of uncertainties on that front. Maybe we'll get some  resolution of some of those uncertainties today. Also business and professional  services is a very important driver of growth in this area.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank  you. From your perspective, which sector do you think is actually propelling  the growth?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  I think – one thing that's been really good for New York City over the last few  years, it's become much more diversified as an economy. In the old days, New  York City was sort of rise and fall, depending on how the financial services  industry was doing, especially the securities industry. And what's happened in  the last few years is the securities industry employment has been pretty flat.  And the securities industry, while they're making some money, it's not at all  as profitable as it was back in the days of 2005, 2006, before the great  financial crisis. Now that profitability was a little bit ephemeral because it  was not built on a strong foundation.\n\nSince  then, the city I think has become a lot more diversified. Tourism has become  more important. Technology – the technology sector really is about the same  size now as the financial services sector. We still see pretty good  manufacturing. The hollowing out of the city in terms of manufacturing seems to  be over. In fact, manufacturing employment is actually doing pretty well in the  city, in certain parts of Queens. It's actually quite supportive.\n\nSo,  in general, it's a pretty positive story. The city still faces challenges. I  think one of the most significant ones is going to be: how does the change in  the conversation about trade and immigration affect people's willingness to  visit New York City?\n\nI  think there is some prospect that international tourism to New York could  decline over the next few years, and that would be something that would hurt  the hospitality industry in New York City. So, that's something that we're  going to have to keep a close eye on.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank  you. The Dodd-Frank Act, which is often referred to as the Dodd-Frank Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, placed regulations on the financial  industry. I wanted to ask you, do you think the removal of the Dodd-Frank Act  would be productive for the economy? And if so, why?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nSo  removal of the Dodd-Frank Act be productive for the economy? I'm going to give  you a little bit more nuanced answer. I don't think it's a question of either  the Dodd-Frank Act or no Dodd-Frank Act. I certainly wouldn't want to go back  to the world we were in 2006, 2007, because that financial system led to the  worst financial crisis that we've had since the Great Depression, and as you  know the economy suffered greatly. The unemployment rate climbed over 10%. So  clearly, we don't want to go back to that.\n\nBut  at the same time, is the Dodd-Frank Act as it exists today perfect? I doubt it.  What I tell people is we really want to be careful not to throw the baby out  with the bathwater. What we want is a system where we have banks with adequate  capital, adequate liquidity – number one – so the probability of a large bank  failing is a lot lower today than it was back in 2006 and 2007.\n\nNumber  two, we want a system where if a large bank were to get into difficulty, we  have the ability to resolve it in a way that it doesn't threaten to take down  the rest of the financial system.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve intervened in a very unusual and aggressive way in 2008 because  the failure of a large financial institution was threatening to basically push  the U.S. economy into a Great Depression. We didn't do it because we wanted to  save the institution. We did it because we wanted to save the economy. We don't  want to be in that situation again. So we need to have a regime in place, so if  a large institution were to fail, it doesn't threaten to take down the rest of  the financial system.\n\nAnd  the third thing we need is we need to a financial system that's robust and  resilient to bad economies, to financial stress. One of the things that the  Dodd-Frank Act does that I think is important is it mandates central clearing  of derivatives activity. Now derivatives activities are things where  corporations exchange interest rate payments, fixed income interest rate  payments for floating interest rate payments, et cetera. During the  pre-Dodd-Frank era, most of these were firm-to-firm. Financial institution to  financial institution. Now they're all cleared centrally. This is a tremendous  innovation because it reduces the amount of risk in the financial system. The  Dodd-Frank Act has one of its chapters or titles all dedicated to the clearing  of over-the-counter derivatives.\n\nAnd  finally, we have some entities called financial market infrastructures. What is  a financial market infrastructure? So, let's say I buy a stock, and then that  stock has to be transferred to me through some entity that actually clears and  settles that stock transaction. The entity that actually manages that stock  transaction – you selling stock to me, or me selling stock to you – that's a  financial market utility. They have to be robust as well. And one of the things  the Dodd-Frank Act does is it allows the Federal Reserve to have some oversight  capacity to make sure that those financial market utilities are sound.\n\nSo,  there are definitely things that could be changed. I think you could definitely  relax the regulatory burden on smaller banking organizations because I don't  think they pose a systemic threat to the U.S. financial system. I think you  could take a look at certain regulations like the Volcker Rule to see if they  could be administered in a less aggressive way.\n\nSo,  it's not in my mind a question of Dodd-Frank or no-Dodd-Frank. I think it's a  question of better financial reform legislation.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank  you. Just like you said, the economy is picking up now, and at the same time,  we are experiencing a kind of upward trend in interest rates. I wanted to ask  you, do you think the current movement in   interest rates is politically-driven? If not, what is the business reason  for the upward movement?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  if I said it was politically-driven, that would be an unbelievable news story. Because  we try to stay as apolitical as possible and set monetary policy, not based on  the political winds and fortunes of the different political parties, but what  we think is appropriate to keep the economy on an even-keel and to achieve our  goals of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. So,  we're basically trying to set the level of interest rates in a way that will  keep the economy close to our objective of full employment, with relatively  stable price. It's 2% inflation.\n\nThat's  sort of where we are right now. So, why are we raising interest rates a little  bit?  First of all, I would point out  that the interest rate rise that we've had in place has been extraordinarily  gradual. The short-term interest rates that the Federal Reserve sets, the  federal funds rate, that range is three-quarters of a percent to 1%. If you  lived like I did through the 1970s and '80s, you realize that that's an  extraordinarily low level of interest rates.\n\nMonetary  policy over the last few years has been what we think is accommodative. In  other words, it's been supporting economic activity. As we get closer to full  employment, we want to make monetary policy a little bit less accommodative  because if monetary policy were too accommodative, we would actually get an  inflation problem over time. Then the Federal Reserve would have to slam on the  brakes, we'd have a recession, people would be thrown out of work. Not a good  situation.\n\nSo,  the idea is to have an economy that moves in a smooth way. And so by taking out  a little bit of that accommodation, moving up interest rates just a little bit,  we think it's more likely that we'll achieve a soft landing and keep the  economy about where it is today in terms of employment. So, it's a delicate  adjustment. It's not something that's very harsh. We think it's appropriate and  necessary. But I think the economy will be able to adjust to this just fine.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank  you. Sometime ago, I think that was 2012, 2013, I took some students to the  Federal Reserve Bank. And you do have annual events at the Fed which I attend  every year, often in March. A question that came to mind is that the students  were very excited when they went to the Federal Reserve Bank. The question I  wanted to ask you is what are the skills required to work at the Fed?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  there's lots of different parts of the Federal Reserve. There isn't one  particular skill. There's a lot of economists because we think about how the  economy is working and operating and the conduct of monetary policy. There's a  lot of people that work on overseeing banks. Supervision is one of our biggest  groups. We have a lot of bank supervisors who typically get degrees in public  policy or business, and come and work at the Federal Reserve and become bank  examiners.\n\nWe  have a lot of people in the Markets Group, which I ran prior to becoming  President of the Bank. We monitor the markets. We talk to market participants  to understand what's going on.\n\nWe  execute monetary policy on behalf of the Federal Reserve System.  We have people that are in Operational Risk,  who assess risk. We have people who manage custody accounts for foreign and  central banks. We have about $3 trillion of foreign central bank assets in  custody at the New York Fed.\n\nWe  have the largest holdings of gold in the world in the vault of the New York  Fed, so someone has to protect that. We have a number of people in the  Protection and Law Enforcement Services that make sure that the gold is safe  regardless of what one of the Die Hard movies implied, that it could be robbed  pretty easily. That's not the case.\n\nWhen  I became the President of the Bank, I actually rented out the Die Hard movie  because I wanted to see if it was plausible – the way they stole the gold from  the New York Fed, and it turned out that they sort of glossed over that. There  was apparently supposedly a subway line that was really close to the gold  vault, and so they just had to punch a little hole in the subway tunnel and the  gold vault was right there. But it doesn't really actually work that way. So  sorry.\n\nMy  point is, there's a lot of different activities that we do. Obviously in  education, Bachelor's or Master's, is sort of I think probably a good place to  start. The more analytical skills you can get in terms of math and economics  and business – those are the skills that are very attractive to us. Training  and public policy because that's what we do, is very important.\n\nIt's  a great place to work. The typical New York Fed employee joins the Bank and  says I'm going to be here two, three years. And then the next stop I ask them  how long have you been here? “25, 30 years.”   Which I think means that it has – it's a good place to work. Reasonable  pay, good benefits  But mainly, a great  culture. People are very committed to what we do.  People have a strong sense of mission and  integrity.\n\nI  tell people that one of the great things about working at the New York Fed is  there's no moral ambiguity at any day about why I'm going to work. We're there  to serve the public interest, and that's a nice thing to think about every day  when you go to the office.  You don't  have to think about, well, why am I doing this exactly?  Well, we're trying to serve the public  interest, keep the economy on an even-keel, and execute on our mission as the  New York Fed.\n\nThe  New York Fed is a little different than the other Reserve Banks because we're  really the operational arm of the Federal Reserve System for many, many  different things. So, it's sort of interesting.   We do policy, and we do operations. Very unlike most central banks  around the world, where the policy and operations are all in headquarters down  in Washington. In the Federal Reserve it's split, with the New York Fed doing a  lot of the operational activities of the Federal Reserve System. It's a pretty  cool place. Check us out!\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nI  will surely do. The Federal Reserve has been around since 1913. How would you  compare the 1929 Depression to that of 2008?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  very different outcome. In 1929, the stock market crash led to a widespread  banking panic, where people basically tried to get their money out of banks  because they were afraid the banks were going to fail. And of course in the  process of trying to pull all those deposits out of the banks, the banks didn't  have enough money, so a lot of banks actually did fail. And in fact, in 1933,  FDR declared a national banking holiday where all the banks were closed for a  period of time.\n\nFortunately,  we didn't get to that point during this crisis. The Federal Reserve, and many  other people around the world, pulled out all the stops to avoid the collapse  of the banking system, of the financial system, and as a consequence, we had a  bad recession – worst recession that we've had since in the post-WWII period,  but far short of what happened in the Great Depression.\n\nThe  Great Depression, the unemployment rate I think climbed above 20%. The price  level, the level of prices dropped by about I think a third. So it was a really  absolutely horrendous experience. If you talk to someone like my mother, my  mom's 94 years old, she was a relatively young girl during the Depression. She  still remembers and talks about it, just incredibly searing. People were out of  work for really until WWII. The Crash started in 1929, the U.S. economy really  didn't get back to close to full employment, only in the 1940s, and because of  WWII.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank  you.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nSo  this time was quite a bit different, thank God.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nI'm  sure that everybody here invests. And they are ... students in economics and  finance. We talk about investment. I wanted to shed light or your perspective  on how the fixed income investor performed in the last eight years, please.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  the fixed income market has been a good place to be because, basically,  interest rates  have been generally  coming down, if you look at long-term bond yields. So, we would like to look at  the government debt issue by the U.S. Treasury. Ten-year government debt is  trading today about 2.4% which is pretty low, and credit spreads have narrowed  over that period. So, fixed income has been a pretty good place to be invested  in over the last 8 years.\n\nSame  thing with U.S. equity market, though, for that matter. If you bought the U.S.  equity market at the very bottom in 2009, it's more than tripled in price since  then. As an investor, you've done pretty well if you've stayed invested through  that entire period.\n\nNow,  I would expect that fixed income investing is going to be less attractive going  forward because interest rates still are at a very, very low level. So, some of  the gains that people have seen in fixed income have been really prices going  up because interest rates were declining. And I think that you're probably not  going to see prices going up a lot because interest rates are declining going  forward.\n\nSo  I would guess most likely, most people think that short-term interest rates  will gradually rise over the next couple of years. That certainly is what the  Federal Open Market Committee expects, and as that happens people generally  expect that longer-term interest rates will eventually rise. And so that means  that there will probably be a little bit less good returns in the fixed income  market compared to the last 8 years.\n\nWe've  had a bull market in fixed income really going back to 1982. My first house I  ever bought, mortgage rates at the time were 17%. They're now around 4%. I got  financing from the seller. I got a 12% mortgage. I thought it was a really good  deal. So now mortgage rates are around 4%. We've had a very, very long bull  market in fixed income. People are debating now whether this is the end of that  bull market or it's going to go on for a little bit further. So, we'll see. Dr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank  you. If you look at the global economy, it's looking buoyant now. Also the  national economy, which is the United States economy, is looking buoyant now. I  wanted to ask you, looking at the United States, which region do you think is  growing at the moment?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nI  would answer that question, which region is growing at the moment, in two ways.  Regionally, in terms of the geography of the United States, it's really the  South and West, and this has been a pattern for a long time, that there has  been sort of a migration to – when they invented air‑conditioning, they made  the South a lot more attractive to people. And so the South and West have been  growing faster than the country as a whole for a very long time.\n\nNow  there are some pockets of weakness there because we had a big collapse in  energy prices, so some of the areas in the South and West that are very  dependent on the energy sector are probably a little bit less robust. So,  that's the first way I would describe it.\n\nThe  second way I would describe it is rural/suburban/urban. There's been a tremendous  shift in people's enthusiasm for living in big cities, and that's really one  reason why New York City is doing so well because people basically want to live  in the big cities, especially younger people. And so you're seeing the cities,  especially the big cities, outperform the smaller cities and outperform the  rural areas. New York City has actually been very much a beneficiary of this,  relative to many other parts of the country.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank  you.  I'm sure now that we may have questions  from the audience. To my right we have – a stand there.  And to my left, we have another.  If you have questions, please, students, colleagues?  It's time for Q&A. If you have any  questions, please.\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nGood  morning, and welcome to your college. Although the Die Hard scenario may not  work in reality, cybercrime has been a greater threat to the financial system. And  recently, it was reported that North Korea was able to illegally transfer  monies from a Bangladesh account at the Fed to an account at the Philippines. What's  being done to protect funds that are held not only at the Fed but also at other  financial institutions?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  that's a good question. Cybersecurity is a really important activity for us at  the Fed. We want to make sure that not only is the Federal Reserve  well-protected but also the banks that we supervise are also well-protected  against cyber-risk.\n\nThis  is a particularly hard risk to evaluate on any given day because we're trying  to improve our defenses, but the bad guys are also improving their  capabilities. So, we do a lot of different activities within the bank to make  sure that we're secure from a cyber-perspective. For example, we phish our  employees, and we send them emails that sort of suggest that if you'll click on  this, and if you click on this you get a message from our Information  Technology Department that you've been phished and you learn that you have to  be a lot more careful about what you actually click on. That's important  because a threat can both come from outside, but it can also come from within.\n\nThe  other thing we've done is we're spending a lot of time internationally to try  to make the financial system safer by making sure that the payment executer,  their systems are secure. So, think of that as Bangladesh. That the messenger,  who the person is who's transmitting the payment, this is SWIFT, is secure. And  the receiver.  So in this case, the New  York Fed is secure.  That goes for  anybody who is executing payments.  It  doesn't have to be Bangladesh, through the SWIFT, to the New York Fed. It's  anybody executing a payment through any payment medium to any receiver.\n\nThe  thing that we're trying to work on internationally is to try to make sure that  everyone understands their responsibilities in that chain. So, it's really  important that the person executing the payment, that their facilities are  secured.\n\nWhat  seemed to be the case in the Bangladesh situation was their facilities were not  secured, so someone executed a payment that looked completely authentic through  the SWIFT pipes to the New York Fed. It was an authentic payment – it looked  like an authentic payment when we executed on some of those payments – not all  of those payments.\n\nSo,  we need to make sure that that first leg is buttoned up, and also we need to  make sure that everyone understands their responsibility along that chain.\n\nSo,  this is something that we take very seriously. We're working also with the  institutions that we interact with. One of the things that the Federal Reserve  runs – the New York Fed runs – is called FedWire, so if you have to wire money,  if someone needs the money immediately, you can wire that through a New York  clearinghouse in the CHIPS system, or you can wire that through FedWire. It's  really important that – and FedWire interacts with lots of institutions around  the country. We need to make sure that all those institutions that interact  with FedWire also have their systems secured.\n\nSo,  it's a big issue. We spend a lot of resources on it. We're going to continue to  spend a lot of resources on it. We take it very seriously.\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nWe  welcome you to Jamaica. I'd just like to ask, there have been some other  regulatory measures taken over the past couple of decades. As I understand it, they  repealed the Glass-Steagall Act and also passed the Sarbanes-Oxley laws. Would  you say that these things had any effect on the 2008 recession, or has Congress  been more responsible than not for the recession?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nI  think that – well, I think Sarbanes-Oxley is actually – was basically about  good financial reporting, good financial accounting. Accountability of the  people at the top of the house for all the financial records and statements. The  Federal Reserve is not subject by law to Sarbanes-Oxley, but we actually follow  Sarbanes-Oxley nevertheless. We think it's good governance. So, I would say  Sarbanes-Oxley generally makes the system safer because it makes it much harder  for people to – it really deters fraud and manipulation of financial accounts  in a way that I think is very, very positive.\n\nThe  second part was?\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nGlass-Steagall?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nGlass-Steagall.  Well, I think that – the Glass-Steagall Act was an act that was passed in the  1930s that basically said that you could either be in commercial banking or you  could be in investment banking. You couldn't be in both. And so this is an act  that basically forced the Morgan Company to separate into Morgan Stanley and  J.P. Morgan. Now what happened was many years later in the 1980s, I actually  was involved with this because I was working at J.P. Morgan at the time, people  started to say, “Look, if I'm a big commercial bank like J.P. Morgan, I'm  losing all my customers who are going to the securities market. I need to  follow my customers, but I can't because of Glass-Steagall.” And they found  that there was a loophole, Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act basically said  that you can't be principally-engaged in securities activities. So, it meant  that you could be engaged but just as long as it wasn't principally-engaged. And  so this is a little loophole that a number of firms managed to exploit. And so  they actually found a way to get into some securities activities, and then  Glass-Steagall Act a number of years later was actually formally repealed  because the firms were already, essentially, in the business.\n\nNow  my own personal view is that I don't think the Glass-Steagall Act had much to  do with the great financial crisis. If you look at the firms that got into great  difficulty, at the earliest stages – Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, AIG – they really had nothing to do with  Glass-Steagall because they really weren't banks and securities firms. They  were securities firms and insurance companies. My own view is that the  Glass-Steagall Act was not a major – the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act was  not a major factor behind the Great Recession and the financial crisis.\n\nNow  this is something that people probably would debate. Other people might have  somewhat different views. You could repeal the Glass-Steagall Act again. I  think it would obviously require a lot of financial corporate restructuring  because there are a lot of firms in the U.S. that are in both the securities  business and the commercial banking business today. I think that there are links  between those two businesses. It probably helps those firms, satisfy the  demands of their large corporate clients more easily than if you had to separate  them into separate entities. But you could do it.\n\nOne  thing I would say if you do do it, you better have a mechanism in place to make  sure that those large securities firms that are left actually are  well-regulated, well-capitalized, have enough liquidity, and have access to a  lender of last-resort.\n\nOne  of the problems that we had in the financial crisis is there wasn't a good method  to lend to securities firms. By law, the Federal Reserve discount window – this  is the facility that we have open to commercial banks – were not allowed to  have that discount window open to securities firms.\n\nSo,  in the crisis, we had to do extraordinary lending activities to securities  firms. We need a better lender of last resort backstop for securities firms.\n\nIf  you decide to repeal Glass-Steagall and separate commercial banks from securities  firms, that's not something that I would recommend, but if you were to do that,  make sure you have a way of backstopping the securities industry, too, so if a  big securities firm gets in trouble it doesn't threaten the entire financial  system.\n\nDr. Olajide  Oladipo:\n\nThank  you.  I'll be expecting questions from  students, too.\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nNot  a student.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nBut  you’re a student of something, right?\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nMy  concern is MWBEs. I feel that the racist element within our capitalization has  not allowed us to participate in the economy on an equal level by having access  to capital. The government's asking for 30% on major projects. For example, at  LaGuardia, we have a $5 billion project. Contracts to facilitate that will probably  be too high for many minority and women-owned businesses. Therefore, if we  don't have access to capital, we won't even be allowed to bid on that work. And  that's when fraud comes in, when a major contractor proposes to a small  contractor, “I'll help you out if you bid, give you give me a number on this  contract.”\n\nIf  we had access to capital, we then bid. I'd like you to take a look at what the  New York State Department of School Construction Authorities are doing. They  worked out a system that allows us to bid on major contracts. If you took a  look at that, because we need some ingenious new ways of financing. We don't  have a black bank per se. There were 94 black banks across this country, now  there's only 23. Some of the banks that's going out of business, I don't think  is kosher, but something has to be done to allow us to participate in the  marketplace.\n\nOn  your material, you have listed some organizations within the minority community  that you deal with. I'd like to recommend some additional organizations. For  example, the ones that are primarily interested in the flow of contracts and  development. I'm not in a prime area of what's going on today. In addition, for  example, we have here at York College one of the best small business development  sectors.  They're number one in the state  a couple of times.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nI  agree with your concern. Is there a question? Audience  Member:\n\nYes,  what can you do to set up financial resources for minority and women-owned  businesses to become involved in the economy? Whether that's establishing a  bank – we've asked the controller to control this, let him set up a funding  source for us using pension funds, and there's a way to do that, if you look at  it. But we need you to be an advocate for us in that area, but help us come up  with an ingenious idea for how we can develop access to capital.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  I certainly agree with the importance of access to capital, and I certainly  agree with you in the importance of having minority work enterprises have the  ability to participate in economic development and bidding on contracts. We  don't have the legal authority to do anything direct, but we have a lot of  convening authority. One thing that we do do is we do continuing workshops,  conferences, symposiums. We've had a number of things with small businesses on  how small businesses can get access to credit, how small businesses can figure  out how to export their goods and services.\n\nAnd  so this is something that for you to talk to our regional development people on  how we could be helpful. Because we definitely think this is an important  issue, and we definitely want to be helpful and use the resources we have, both  in terms of research and our convening power, to try to take this forward. So,  let's have a conversation.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nNext  question please. I'm still expecting a student.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nGood  morning. My question will be in the form of appeal. This is for small  homeowners. Recently, the Fed announced about increasing the interest rate. But  I don't know how long the Federal Open Markets Operations committee will  actually sit for that. But what I'm appealing for is for that period to be  extended. We just came out from an economic recession. Thank God we didn't get  to the depression part of that business cycle. Many homeowners basically, particularly  small homeowners, they are struggling to fix their credits. And because their  credit scores are so terrible, they cannot refinance, and therefore they are  locked in with high interest rates – we are talking about thousands and  thousands of dollars. Banks are making money off them because they cannot  refinance.\n\nIf  you go ahead and increase that interest rates when they are still struggling to  pay what they have now, I think many will lose their homes. So, my appeal is  for the Fed to please, let the current interest rates stay – give a little bit  more room for small homeowners to fix their credit scores so that they can  refinance. Thank you.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  first thing I would say is the level of interest rates are still pretty darn  low. The federal fund rate, that's the rate we target, is three-quarters of a  percent to 1%. And we've only raised interest rates twice since the end of the  Recession eight years ago. It's important to recognize that the trajectory has  been very, very shallow because we are aware of some of the issues that you're  raising and we're trying to get the balance right.\n\nEnd  of the day, what are we trying to accomplish? We want to have an economy that  can grow for a long time. So, we want to keep the economy in balance growing at  a rate that is sustainable over the medium- to longer-run. What we're trying to  do is find that level of interest rates that's just right. Now we recognize  that anytime that we change interest rates, it's going to help some people, and  it's going to hurt other people. So, on the other side of the story are all the  people, like my mom, who are savers and they're unhappy. They've been unhappy  for the last eight years because interest rates have been so low. So, we're  trying to get that balance right.\n\nI  think we've been pretty cautious in terms of how we've been raising interest  rates because of some of the concerns that you raise. Janet Yellen, who's the  Chair of the Federal Reserve, has talked about the headwinds that have been  slowing down the U.S. economy.\n\nOne  of those headwinds is exactly what you're talking about, the fact that people  are locked into homes because their homes are either underwater, the value of  the homes are less than the value of their mortgages, or because their  credit-rating was damaged during the Financial Crisis because people lost their  jobs, and so their credit-rating was impaired. And so that's really the reason  why we've been so delicate and so slow in actually raising interest rates. It's  partly exactly what you're talking about.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank  you.\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nGood  morning. Thank you for being here. One of the things that we've been looking at  here in Southeast Queens is the establishment of CDFIs, additional CDFIs to  support the growth and the access to capital of small businesses. Would you  comment a little bit about what do you see as the future of CDFIs going forward  in this economic climate, and any suggestions that you would have to support us  in doing that? Thank you.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  I guess I sort of think of CDFIs as doing God's work in some ways because the  hardest thing for someone with a really good idea and starting a small business  is to get that initial bit of capital to establish a track record. Banks, as  you know, are reluctant to lend to start‑up businesses because the firms don't  have collateral to pledge against the loans, and they don't have a track record  of experience. So CDFIs are really the group that can provide that lifeblood to  small business enterprises at the start-up stage.\n\nIt's  also very resource-intensive to lend to small businesses, so the economics  don't work very well for a for-profit company. So, I'm a big fan of CDFIs. We  think it's really an important avenue, especially in less developed areas where  getting a small business well-established can create local jobs which can  create a virtuous circle in terms of economic development. So, this is  something that we definitely want to encourage over time, and anything that we  can do to be helpful – we try to partner with the CFI  community to be helpful, in terms of providing data, information. We have a lot  of very detailed information about the local economies and we can be, I think,  helpful in actually providing some information and support to the CDFIs.\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nGood  morning. I want to thank you for coming here and sharing some information with  us.  I have two specific questions I  wanted to ask. A lot of us, we've already talked about access to capital, which  is a huge thing.  For those who don't  know, Sen. Sanders is the ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee for New  York State. My first question is how do we establish a better relationship with  your organization in an effort to – we can get this information that you have  and its resources on the grassroot level? And my second question is – President Dudley:\n\nAll  you have to do is give me your card afterwards.\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nOh,  okay. My second question is we've done an assessment of the economic state of  Southeast Queens, Sen. Sanders' office, and a majority of our residents here  are considered banked and under-banked. My question to you is a lot of ...  especially for – we have a huge population of Millennials, we're looking to  purchase homes in our area. A lot of us make under $50,000 and probably have  some problems with credit.\n\nBut  my question with the home buyers programs is there a way, or how can we have a  conversation about increasing the matching funds because the highest that the  rates for the federal home buyers program is 4:1. And we want to talk about how  we can get that to 10:1 so it can help, it can match the demographics, economic  demographics, of our community, so people can start receiving in tangible  resources like purchasing a home with the resources that they have.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nI'm  not an expert in the issue of how much money you need to match. I don't think I  can speak to that directly. But clearly getting people the resources so that  they can become homeowners in a prudent way is a good thing. And what we saw in  the financial crisis, in the run-up to the financial crisis, is that we were  giving credit to people in an imprudent way. I think as long as it can be done  in a prudent way, where people understand the responsibilities, have the income  to pay on their mortgages, I think it's something that we definitely want to  encourage.\n\nSo,  what I would suggest is give me your card, and I'll give it to the right people  in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and we'll have a conversation and see  what we can do. This is not something that we could probably be involved in  directly, as a funding provider. Legally, we don't have the authority.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve is pretty powerful in terms of monetary policy. But our mandate  is also pretty narrow in terms of what we're allowed to do.\n\nI  remember during the financial crisis, people were coming in and saying, “you  should do this, you should do that, you should do that.”  And most of the things that they were  suggesting that we do were some things that were not actually allowed by the  Federal Reserve Act that was passed back in 1913. Come talk to us and we will  see what we can do.\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nGreetings,  good morning to – or good afternoon to you and your guest. Now while it would  be interesting to speak of why the New York Fed and the Atlanta Fed are  differing on their economic forecasts, that might be interesting, but I want to  speak to something far more local. Far more local.\n\nThis  community, and communities like this, were devastated, were ravaged – and I  could use a stronger word – during the financial crisis of 2008.  We've never recovered from this. The black  community lost approximately 50% of its wealth in four years. 50% of the wealth  accumulated from slavery till today lost in four years. No one, of course, was  ever jailed for these things, no one was ever – very little punishment, if  anything, was done. I understand that while you may want to do or feel strongly  it's not the purview of the Federal Reserve – I understand that.\n\nUsing  your researchers at Liberty and other parts of your organization, I need to  know what laws that I can put on the books to protect communities like this.  We're about to go back into another phase of exotic mortgage-lending, and I  will humbly differ with you on Glass-Steagall, of course.\n\nWe're  about to go into another phase of exotic lending. They call it exotic lending. We  call it predatory lending, and we pay for it. We can expect that again. What  laws can I – what do we need to put on the books to protect communities like  this? Liberty and other organizations, research organizations, that you guys  have can come up with some of these things. I look forward to speaking with you  later today.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nOkay.  On this issue of predatory lending, I mean this is – I think you raised a very  good point, and this is something that we actually heard about small business  lending when we were up I think in the Bronx awhile back, where, basically,  people have these come-ons to lend money to small business, and it seems  attractive on the surface, but it turns out that the actual rate of interest  that people are paying is prohibitive to be able to run a successful business. So,  I think the predatory lending thing is a completely important issue that we do  need to address. Obviously, the Small Business Administration can play a role  in this. I think we would certainly be interested in having a conversation  about it, because I think it is a really serious issue.\n\nI  mean one of the problems, just more broadly, is financial literacy in the  United States. Part of the reason that predatory lending can work is because  people don't really have a good idea –they don't know enough about the  financial system, about the economy, about what's a good value or not. They  just say, “What's my payment going to be next month?” And if the payment is  low, they don't look at the fine print about what the payment is going to be  not next month, but a year from now, or two years from now. And that's how they  get into a great deal of difficulty. So, I think not just working on the  predatory loans writ narrow, but also on the issue of financial literacy writ  large, I think colleges like this one can do a lot in making sure that when  people graduate, they have a level of financial literacy that can help them  navigate through the world.\n\nThe  number of scams that are out there now are just extraordinary. Sometimes people  will pretend that they're me and they send letterhead out supposedly from me  telling people that if they were to send a bunch of money to someone, the New  York Fed would release a check for a large amount of money, and people actually  believe this. Now, my advice to people always is if something seems too good to  be true, it probably is. But unfortunately people offer these things, and it's  really quite tragic, because the people who fall for these things often are  people that are not so sophisticated, of not so large means, and they can't  afford to be sending money to fraudsters hoping that there might be a big prize  from the Federal Reserve Bank in New York or somewhere else down the road,  which of course there's not.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank  you. I think we have – I just have time to take only one more question.\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nActually,  the question I wanted to ask is for the students. Why do you refuse to ask  questions?\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nSomebody  wants to ask now.  Thank you.\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nHow  are you, sir? My question for you today is what are, or were, your daily habits  or rituals that helped you get to the level of success that you have today?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nOooh,  I can't think of any rituals. Habits. I guess what I would say is I've always  just tried to learn more. So basically, it's always about trying to find  opportunity to, what I call, grow my human capital. So, I think – my view of  the way to success is find a job that's interesting to you, because you need that  passion about what you do. If you don't have passion about what you do, it's  not going to feel like a lot of fun and you're not going to do it with a great  enthusiasm. So, if it's not fun and you're not enthusiastic, you're probably  not going to do very well at it. So, the first thing is to find something that  you're really liking, you're enthusiastic about.\n\nAnd  two, basically find something where you can continue to learn. If you get into  a job and you've been in the job for a long time and you're doing the same  thing, you've sort of mastered the job, then it's probably time to move on.\n\nI  was at a large investment bank for many years – 20 years to be exact – and I  decided at the end of 2005 that I was going to retire because there was no job  that they had that they would give me that I wanted. And vice versa. There was  no job I wanted that they would give me. So it was sort of, I can keep doing my  same job of being the Chief U.S. Economist and continue to do that for a great  many, many years. But at that point I felt I was no longer learning so much. I  was bringing in a little bit less enthusiasm to the job, and so, it was time  for a change. I didn't know what that change was, and after I announced I was  retiring, Tim Geithner, who was the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York at the time, called me up. First conversation was, he asked me if I'd  be an advisor at the New York Fed. I said, “Tim, that's a great job. I really  like you, I'd love to work with you, but what do I do the 39 other hours of the  week besides advise you?” And then a couple of weeks or months later, I can't  remember exactly how long it was, he called up again and said, “Well, how would  you like to come to the New York Fed and run the Markets Group?” Markets Group  at the time had about 230 employees. They executed monetary policy for the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  I  wasn't sure I was going to have any time to talk to Tim Geithner in that role. And  so I said yes immediately.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nYou  have a question? Are you a student?\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nYes,  I am.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nThank  you.\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nI  am a student.  Thank you so much for  taking the time and speaking to us. My question was, being from a younger  generation, I'm definitely interested in investing, but what would be your  biggest piece of advice. Especially for us, the younger generation, with a  limited budget, what would you – how should we go about it?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  I don't think I've ever been asked for investing advice before now. It's  probably not appropriate for the Federal Reserve to give out investing advice. I  think the first thing is you want to get knowledgeable. I think the first thing  is you want to get some knowledge before you start to invest. And recognize  that there are no quick, get-rich-quick schemes. If something seems to be too  good to be true, it probably is.\n\nI  remember when I got out of college, back in 1974, a long time ago, I decided –  I had this very small amount of money that my great-grandmother left to me, I  think it was $2,000, and I decided I was going to go out and invest. And I have  to say, at the beginning, I didn't really know what I was doing. But I read a  lot of books and I got really pretty well educated. There's a lot of good books  in the market, and I think you can actually educate yourself. And if you do  that I think then you can start to gingerly start to invest. And you'll learn  as you go. It's a long journey. I've learned things as I invested over the  years. Now I don't do anything, but I'm sort of retired from investing in my  current role. But part of that I found that I kept learning it over a very long  period of time. So, it wasn't like the journey of knowledge was over at any  point in time. But first thing is to find a really good book on investing, and  read that. When I did it, I read probably five or ten different books, and that  gave me a good sort of basis for thinking about investing. But before  investing, make sure you have that $400 that you need in case an emergency  comes up.\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nThank  you.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nThank  you.\n\nDr.  Olajide Oladipo:\n\nWith  two good questions from our students, I think I'm comfortable now to bring the  discussion to an end.",

    "text": "Thank you, Ilan,  and thanks to the Central Bank of Brazil for organizing this event.  It is a pleasure to have the opportunity  today to talk about the issue of globalization.   As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not  necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve  System. 1\n\nAlthough the  debate about the benefits and challenges of globalization is not new, it has  recently come into sharper focus.  This  debate is important to all of us, and I think it is particularly relevant to  Brazil given its importance in the global economy.\n\nGlobalization  means different things to different people.   In my remarks today, I will focus on the role of globalization as a  force for international economic integration and economic development.  I will highlight three themes:\n\nFirst, the  important role that trade plays in promoting higher standards of living  globally.\n\nSecond, how  changes in trade can create challenges for industries and their workers when  they lose competitiveness.  Insufficient  attention has been given to this issue.   We must do better in addressing the very large costs that can be imposed  on particular communities and households.\n\nThird, the answer  to those challenges is not greater protectionism.  Instead, we need to provide greater support  to displaced workers so they can obtain the skills needed to find new  well-paying jobs.  We also need to ensure  that there are strong global institutions and international cooperation to help  manage the effects of globalization.   This includes responding to the challenges stemming from financial  globalization—the flow of capital across national borders.\n\nThese issues are  important to me as a central banker, as they affect the long-term health and  productivity of the U.S. economy, the economic opportunities available to our  people, and the efficiency and stability of the global financial system.\n\nThe debate around  globalization, particularly in advanced economies, reflects many factors.  Undoubtedly, the global financial crisis and  subsequent slow recovery have been significant.   But, just as important have been longer-term trends, such as growing  income inequality, the loss of middle-income jobs, and the rise of large  emerging market economies such as China and India.\n\nAlthough the  debate about globalization is not new, I believe we are at a particularly  important juncture.  If support for  liberalized trade and an integrated global economy were to suffer a significant  setback, the consequence could be slower economic growth and lower living  standards around the world.\n\nWhile considerable  effort has gone into liberalizing trade and developing the existing set of  trade agreements, that does not mean they cannot be improved upon.  I have no doubt some trade agreements could  be enhanced or updated.  Some may not  adequately address recent changes in the global economy—such as the rise of  digital trade—and may need to be refreshed.   And, important trade barriers still remain that should be addressed.  In particular, from a U.S. perspective, the  access of U.S. firms to some foreign markets and the protection of intellectual  property rights are issues that deserve close attention.  But, in addressing these issues, we should  take care to preserve the vital benefits of trade to higher standards of living  in both advanced and emerging market economies.   Our focus should be on further strengthening an open trade regime, and,  as appropriate, amending and improving these agreements.\n\nThe  Pace of Globalization\n\nTo begin, let me  briefly describe the pace of globalization as a reminder of what is at  stake.  Global economic integration has  increased dramatically in recent decades.   Trade in goods and services, for example, has grown from nearly 40  percent of global GDP in 1990 to 54 percent in 2016.  Over the same period, the stock of foreign  direct investment has increased from roughly 10 percent of global GDP to 36  percent.  Put simply, national economies  and financial systems have become more integrated and interdependent. 2\n\nThis rapid growth  in trade reflects falling trade barriers, declining transport costs, and  improved information and communication technology.  These trends have enabled the development of  complex global supply chains that allow companies to manage their production  more efficiently.\n\nEmerging market  economies now make up a much larger share of global trade, the global economy,  and global growth.  As an illustration,  emerging market economies have accounted for 70 percent of global economic  growth since the crisis—double their share from two decades ago. 3 This growth has provided much-needed support  to world economic activity, as advanced economies have recovered slowly from  the crisis.\n\nRising economic  integration is also evident when we examine the trade relationship between  Brazil and the United States.  Bilateral  trade flows in goods have risen from $17 billion in 1994 to nearly $57 billion  in 2016.  The United States is Brazil’s  second-largest export market, and an important destination for manufactured  goods.  In 2016, the stock of U.S. direct  investment in Brazil was $64 billion, up from $18 billion in 1994. 4 Recent initiatives announced by the Brazilian  authorities—including a large and transparent infrastructure concession program  and greater foreign participation in the oil and gas and aviation  industries—underscore the potential for further increases in foreign direct  investment.\n\nThe  Benefits of Open Trade\n\nIncreased trade,  through its longer-term impact on productivity, has been a key contributor to  global growth and prosperity since the Second World War.  Openness to trade brings many benefits to the  supply side of the economy, including:\n\nCollectively,  these forces lead to a more efficient allocation of a country’s scarce  resources—one that is more closely aligned to its international comparative  advantage.\n\nAs a consequence,  consumers can benefit from lower prices, higher real incomes, and greater  variety and quality of goods and services.   Increased openness may also reduce wasteful rent-seeking behavior on the  part of protected industries and the related costs of corruption.\n\nOpenness to trade  has certainly played a large role in the economic ascent of Asia.  Following the rise of Japan, Korea, Taiwan,  and others, fast growth in China and India has lifted hundreds of millions of  people out of extreme poverty—an unprecedented feat in human history.  Reflecting these gains, a number of emerging  market countries have become strong supporters of open trade, a sign of how  much the world has changed in recent years.\n\nBenefits from open  trade are evident in Brazil. 5 Following its dramatic trade reforms in the  1990s, productivity growth in Brazil increased.   Brazil also has leveraged its ample and diverse natural resource  endowments to become a leading exporter of iron ore and a number of  agricultural products.  And, the country  has benefitted from the rise of China—total export volumes more than doubled  between 2000 and 2010, and have now nearly tripled.  Brazilian multinational companies are also  important global players in industries such as mining and metals, food, paper  products, and transportation equipment.\n\nBut, increased  openness to trade is not a panacea in and of itself.  Actual benefits depend on a range of other  critical factors. These include macroeconomic policy, the business and  regulatory environment, the legal and tax regime, labor and product market  flexibility, and the quality of infrastructure and public services, such as  education.  While the gains from a  liberalized trade regime are not guaranteed, the alternative of trying to  achieve a high standard of living by following a policy of economic  isolationism will fail.  Trade has played  a key role in nearly all of the high-growth success stories since the middle of  the last century.\n\nThe  Challenges of Open Trade\n\nIt is important to  recognize that while trade and international integration tend to increase the  overall economic pie, the distribution of the larger pie may be very  uneven.  In fact, slices for some  particular groups may even shrink.  Some  workers—particularly those in industries that are less competitive and whose  skills may have become less relevant—can be hurt and can find adjustment  difficult.  Successful adjustment often  requires individuals to change industries and to relocate to different  regions.  So, while trade is almost  always a win for a country’s economy, not everyone within that economy will be  a winner.  This is especially the case  where the policies to cushion the negative consequences of trade and to  facilitate adjustment are lacking or inadequate.\n\nEffects are  country- and industry-specific, and depend on initial endowments and  conditions.  Low-income workers in  emerging markets, for example, may find it more difficult to adapt, given  weaker safety nets and fewer financial resources available to deal with adverse  economic shocks.  The bigger the  adjustment process, the more the gains from trade will tend to be eroded.\n\nWhile the rise in  the skill premium from trade liberalization has been well established for both  developed and developing countries, determining the aggregate impact of trade  on jobs has been more challenging.  To  date, the evidence has been mixed.  We  need further research in this area to determine with more confidence a  reasonable range of estimates for these employment effects.\n\nAlthough evidence  of the extent to which jobs have been lost due to global trade is inconclusive,  job losses that are attributed to trade tend to be viewed differently.  That is, they are seen as having been “lost  to foreigners” and are often viewed as a consequence of the policy decision to  liberalize trade in the first place.\n\nThe challenge of  adjusting to open trade is a serious issue that has not received the degree of  attention it fully deserves.  This may  partly reflect the fact that the burden has been borne unequally and spread out  over a long time period.  It also may  reflect the fact that the winners from trade have often tended to have a stronger  voice than those who have been the losers.\n\nResearch has  documented that the effects on individuals of job dislocation—including those  resulting from trade—can be significant and long lasting.  Older workers tend to suffer larger earnings  losses, and often face more difficult transitions.  Displaced workers may not have the  appropriate skills to find good jobs in other areas of the economy, including  in growing export sectors.\n\nWhen the affected  industry represents a large share of the local economy, the damage is often  magnified.  In this case, the burden can  become more widespread as the level of wages across the community is negatively  affected.  And, this doesn’t begin to  capture the full human toll—including the impact on workers who have lost confidence  in the future and the poorer health outcomes that occur because of increased  stress.\n\nResearch on Brazil  has found that workers employed in regions facing larger tariff cuts  experienced declines in formal sector employment. 6 They also generally did not migrate to more  favorable regions. Instead, they either became unemployed,  moved into the informal sector of the economy, or—when more fortunate—moved  into another sector within the same region.\n\nWe should find better ways to help communities that are struggling  because of the effects of free trade.  In  the United States, we have historically experienced a high degree of geographic  labor mobility—much higher than in other advanced economies.  The ability to move in search of better  opportunities, when possible, has helped to mitigate some of the adverse  effects of trade.  But, mobility has  declined in the United States in recent years, implying that the adjustment  costs to trade may have increased.\n\nProtectionism  Is Not the Answer\n\nGiven these costs  of global integration and more liberalized trade, what is the best path  forward?  Although protectionism can have  a siren-like appeal because of its potential to provide short-term benefits to  particular segments of the economy, in the longer term it would almost  certainly be destructive.\n\nCountries need to  compete better, not compete less.  Trade  barriers are a very expensive way to preserve jobs in less competitive or  declining industries.  They blunt  opportunities in export industries and they reduce the affordability of goods  and services to households.  Indeed, such  measures often backfire, resulting in harm to workers and diminished  growth.\n\nA better course is  to learn from our experience.  From a  U.S. standpoint, we should work to reduce remaining foreign trade restrictions  that impair our ability to capitalize on our comparative advantages.  For example, market access restrictions can  mean that certain U.S. industries cannot realize their full potential.  Similarly, weaknesses in the protection of  intellectual property rights limit the ability of U.S. producers to realize the  full returns from their investments.   This lowers profits and diminishes incentives to grow the business and  employ more workers.\n\nIf we are going to  enhance the benefits of free trade and better manage its costs, it is critical  that we continue to strengthen the global rules-based system.  On the positive side, I would point to the  World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement, which addresses  customs procedures and could reduce global trade costs significantly.  But, at a broader level, the momentum behind  global trade reform has clearly waned in recent years.  This has occurred even though there are a  number of areas that would benefit from further reform, such as agriculture and  services.  That momentum needs to be  rekindled and reaffirmed.  Although  advanced economies historically have tended to lead the way, it is important  that large emerging market countries now play a greater role.  This is appropriate given their growing  prominence in the global economy.\n\nThere are many  approaches to dealing with the costs of globalization, but protectionism is a  dead end.  Trade restrictions address the  symptoms and not the underlying problems, and they introduce other costs and  distortions.  While such measures might  generate a temporary boost to growth from greater domestic production and  consumption, these would likely be offset by a range of other costs.  Over time, such measures would retard  productivity growth and thereby shrink the economic pie.  As an illustration, import substitution  models that were pursued by many emerging market economies following the Second  World War eventually led to poorer economic outcomes.  Such was the experience in Brazil, which  helped trigger the reforms of the early 1990s.\n\nIn assessing the  benefits and costs of trade, it is important to understand that a nation’s  trade balance reflects much more than its trade policy.  Just as important are the country’s saving  and investment spending proclivities, which are affected by many factors, including  tax and fiscal policies.  For example, in  the United States, we have a chronic trade deficit because domestic investment  spending exceeds our domestic saving.   Foreign capital inflows make up the gap.   In this process, the foreign exchange value of the dollar plays an  important equilibrating mechanism.  If  the domestic saving/investment imbalance is unchanged, then any reduction in  the trade balance from higher trade barriers will need to be offset by lower exports.  The domestic currency will appreciate to  cause the trade deficit to widen to accommodate the desired capital  inflows.  Thus, trade restrictions affect  the composition of trade but not the gap between exports and imports, which is  determined by the difference between domestic savings and investment.  At the end of the day, the protectionist  country would produce more goods in sectors protected by higher trade barriers  but also fewer goods for export.\n\nThe expectation  that higher trade barriers would save jobs ignores these critical second-round  effects.  Moreover, the story may not end  there.  What happens if another country  that now faces higher trade barriers responds by raising its own barriers?  That would push production even further out  of high-value-added exports that are now deterred by the higher foreign trade  barriers and into those exports that face lower trade barriers, or into the  goods protected by the higher domestic trade barriers.  Raising trade barriers would risk setting off  a trade war, which could damage economic growth prospects around the  world.\n\nMeasures that  raise trade barriers typically would protect lower-wage, import-competing jobs,  but would also weigh on the prospects for jobs in the more efficient export  sector, which tend to be higher-paying.   The outcome would be countries producing more where they have a  competitive disadvantage, and less where they have a competitive advantage—the  exact opposite of what we should be aiming for.   For example, in the United States, one of our largest manufacturing  exports is aerospace parts (which requires skilled labor) and one of our  largest imports is apparel (which requires less skilled labor).\n\nThese second-round  effects would also likely hurt productivity growth.  Scarce resources would be used less  efficiently and trade protection would likely lessen the level of competitive  pressure that helps drive innovation.   Moreover, lower productivity growth would likely lead to a slower  improvement in a nation’s living standards over time. 7\n\nBetter  Approaches to Deal with Globalization\n\nRather than  protectionism, a better policy would be to help domestic workers and companies  compete more effectively, rather than compete less.  We need additional mechanisms that allow us  to more fully capture the benefits from liberalized trade and to more  proactively mitigate its costs.  Ideally,  policy should also better address job losses and income inequality from  automation and other technological advances.\n\nHow we respond  should depend on regional and industry circumstances.  These include the nature of trade impacts,  the skill sets and location of the workers that have been affected, and the  amount of resources that can be mobilized to facilitate adjustment.\n\nIncreasing  specialization brings real economic benefits, but can also leave workers more  exposed to shifts in demand for their services, potentially on short  notice.  These issues are not going away,  especially as emerging market economies take on a larger role in the global  economy and automation continues apace.   If we are to maintain a more open trade regime, globalization must be  socially and politically sustainable.   For that to be the case, we have to provide greater support to those who  are hurt by trade.  Policies should  include more assistance with job retraining, help with job search and mobility,  and broader unemployment support. 8\n\nWe also need to do  more research into what measures have been effective in economies around the  world, and we should encourage greater experimentation with new  approaches.  Getting the balance right  between providing assistance and making sure that individuals hurt by trade can  get back on their feet and achieve their earning potential will be a challenge,  and we need a better understanding of what actually works.\n\nMore generally, we  need to do a better job positioning our workforce to cope with globalization  and technological change.  Improvements  across a range of areas—including not only education and training, but also the  business regulatory environment and infrastructure investment—could support  greater worker mobility.  These measures  would also promote higher productivity growth.   While the scope and scale of issues differ substantially by country,  many of these issues may also be relevant in Brazil.\n\nThere are various  measures available in current trade agreements, such as antidumping measures  and countervailing duties for dealing with “unfair” trade, as well as escape  clauses that provide safeguards for industries that face a sudden surge of  imports.  Again, the challenge is to  ensure that such measures are effective, that they help facilitate rather than  retard adjustment, and that they are not abused so as to avoid foreign  competition.  But, both sanctions and  temporary relief have been provided for in global trade rules.  We should be willing to use them when their  use would lead to more equitable outcomes and would help sustain political  support for a more open trade regime.\n\nFinancial  Globalization Is Also Important\n\nFinancial  globalization—the flow of capital across national borders—is also an important  issue that must be considered.  These  flows help to support global economic integration in the trade of goods and  services.  This is a large, complex  subject—and one the Central Bank of Brazil is well acquainted with, having  successfully managed the pressures of heavy capital inflows as well as outflows  during periods of stress.  The tremendous  damage of the global financial crisis underscores the importance of this issue.  As with issues related to trade, achieving  effective financial globalization requires robust and mutually supportive  measures at both the domestic and international levels.\n\nFirst, the high level of cross-border capital  flows—and their potentially volatile nature—further underlines the importance  of solid domestic fundamentals, including exchange  rate flexibility, a credible monetary policy framework, sustainable fiscal  policy, sufficient foreign exchange reserves, and a strong financial system.\n\nThe United  States has a special responsibility to keep its own house in order, given the  large size of its financial markets and the U.S. dollar’s status as a reserve  currency.  Indeed, the U.S. financial  system was the epicenter of the global financial crisis.  I believe that promoting economic growth and  financial stability at home is the most important contribution the United  States can make to promoting growth and stability worldwide.\n\nWith that in  mind, U.S. monetary policy can have a significant impact on global financial  conditions, including exchange rates, and shifts in U.S. monetary policy can  lead to consequential shifts in global capital flows.  Therefore, good communication and  transparency from the Federal Reserve is needed.  In this respect, I believe we have made a  number of improvements in recent years that have facilitated smoother market  adjustments to policy changes.  One  example is the process by which the Federal Reserve began the normalization of  its balance sheet last year.  We  foreshadowed our intentions and initiated a program that was transparent in its  design and ramped up only slowly.  While  the Federal Reserve has a domestic mandate set for it by the U.S. Congress, it  needs to be mindful of the international effects of its actions, which can have  important potential consequences for the global economy and financial markets. 9\n\nA high level  of global interdependence also requires robust cooperation and effective international  institutions.  To provide one example, I  have traveled several times a year for the last decade to Basel, Switzerland,  to discuss economic, monetary, and regulatory policy with foreign central  bankers at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).  This dialogue—supported by ongoing bilateral  discussions between central banks—helps build trust, understanding, and the  valuable relationships that are crucial during periods of stress.\n\nThe global  financial crisis put the need for a more robust and resilient financial system  in stark relief.  Such a regime is  necessary if we are to maintain the flow of credit to the real economy—both  domestically and internationally—during times of stress.  Over the last decade, policymakers have  implemented a range of reforms that have materially strengthened the banking  system, including higher capital and liquidity buffers for the major  international banks. 10\n\nInternational  coordination has been essential to the successful implementation of these  reforms.  Banking is a global business  that requires a high degree of regulatory consistency and as level a playing  field as possible to avoid distortions and regulatory arbitrage.  Under the auspices of the Basel Committee on  Banking Supervision of the BIS, a wide-ranging set of reforms has been  introduced progressively, including the recent finalization of the Basel III  reforms. 11\n\nTighter  regulation of international banks must be complemented by effective  supervision, and much progress has been made in improving home/host supervisory  cooperation.  In a local context,  cross-border supervisory coordination has taken on increased importance as  Brazilian banks have expanded internationally in recent years.  Still, greater clarity around how large  global banks will be resolved is required if we are to successfully end “too  big to fail.”\n\nFinally, it is increasingly  clear to me that we also need to develop a better shared understanding of the  proper role of exchange rate policies and reserve accumulation in a healthy and  fair global trading system.  To be sure,  in a world of volatile capital flows, experience has shown that having adequate  reserve cushions has helped many emerging market economies ward off costly  instability.  Indeed, Brazil’s large  stock of foreign exchange reserves has been a key pillar of stability through  turbulent periods.  But, reserves are a  relatively expensive form of insurance, and excessive reserve accumulation can  undermine global adjustment, shift burdens onto trading partners, and erode  political support for continued trade openness.   As I have said on other occasions, I think that part of the solution  lies in further improving the international safety net, so that countries have  more efficient and less costly ways of ensuring resilience. 12\n\nTo conclude,  although the benefits from an open trade regime remain compelling, we must also  recognize that such a regime imposes costs, and these need to be forcefully  addressed.  Focusing on these costs is  necessary if globalization—including its financial dimensions—is to work for  all of us.\n\nThank you for your  time. I would be happy to take some questions.",

    "text": "But before I get to the implications for EMEs and what the Fed should do or not do to mitigate the impact, a few words on the timing of normalization.  To be as direct as possible: I don’t know when this will occur.  The timing of lift-off will depend on how the economic outlook evolves.  Since the economic outlook is uncertain, this means the timing of liftoff must also be uncertain.\n\nAt the same time, though, I can be clear about what conditions are needed for normalization to begin.  If the improvement in the U.S. labor market continues and the FOMC is “reasonably confident” that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium-term, then it would be appropriate to begin to normalize interest rates.\n\nBecause the conditions necessary for liftoff are well-specified, market participants should be able to think right along with policymakers, adjusting their views about the prospects for normalization in response to the incoming data.  This implies that liftoff should not be a big surprise when it finally occurs, which should help mitigate the degree of market turbulence engendered by lift-off.\n\nNevertheless, I think it would be naïve not to expect some impact.  After more than six years at the zero lower bound, lift-off will signal a regime shift even though policy would only be slightly less accommodative after lift-off than it is before.  I expect that this will have implications for global capital flows, foreign exchange valuation and financial asset prices even if it is mostly anticipated when it occurs.\n\nWhich leads to the key question I want to address in the remainder of my remarks:  What should the Federal Reserve do to minimize the impact?\n\nLike other central banks, our monetary policy mandate has a domestic focus.  Our monetary policy actions, though, often have global implications that feed back into the U.S. economy and financial markets, and we need to always keep this in mind.\n\nFrom one perspective, the unconventional nature of monetary policy around the world adds little that is fundamentally new to the challenges that face EMEs.  Today’s monetary policies simply represent a way of easing that was necessitated by hitting the zero lower bound here and elsewhere.  Central bankers have managed differences across countries in cyclical positions and policy stances many times in the past. This time should not be fundamentally different.\n\nBut, from another perspective, we have less experience operating with unconventional monetary policy, we have been in this regime for a long time and this creates more potential uncertainties.  These uncertainties put a premium on clear communication among central bankers as well as between central bankers and market participants.  In my view, an important fact is that the large scale asset purchase programs undertaken in the United States and elsewhere have dramatically shrunk the size of bond risk premia globally.  This new set of monetary policies affects financial asset prices in a different way compared to changes in short-term interest rates, and we should be humble regarding what we claim to understand about this distinction.\n\nLooking ahead, it seems likely that markets will remain focused on those vulnerabilities that they might have ignored prior to the taper tantrum in 2013. The greater premium on strong fundamentals, policy coherence and predictability will likely remain.  Although we will undoubtedly experience further bumps in the road.  I think we can remain generally optimistic about the prospects for adjustment.  But for this to occur, it will be important for market participants to appropriately discriminate across countries, rather than treating EMEs as a single group.\n\nThe good news is that many EMEs generally appear to be better equipped today to handle the Fed's prospective exit from its exceptional policy accommodation than they were during past tightening cycles.  This reflects the fundamental reforms that EMEs have put in place over the past 15 years, as well as the hard lessons learned from past periods of market stress. Among the positives are:\n\nOf course, progress has not been uniform across EMEs, and more work remains to further strengthen institutional structures in some countries.  In particular, vulnerabilities remain in several important EMEs, and some have been hit by the sharp adverse turn in their terms of trade due to the recent fall in global commodity prices.  Still, the fundamental improvements I’ve cited leave many EMEs better positioned than in the past to weather those times in the cycle when the external environment becomes more difficult.\n\nThe impact that changes in Fed policy can have beyond our borders has led to calls for us to do more to internalize those impacts, or even further, to internationally coordinate policymaking.  As I’ve already noted, we are mindful of the global effects of Fed policy, given the central place of U.S. markets in the global financial system and the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency.  Accordingly, we seek to conduct monetary policy transparently and based on clear principles.  Promoting growth and stability in the U.S., I believe, is the most important contribution we can make to growth and stability worldwide.\n\nThere is, of course, the argument that Fed policy has been too accommodative for too long, creating risks for financial stability worldwide.  Here, I think it’s important to consider carefully the counterfactual.  Would countries beyond our borders really have been better off with a weaker U.S. economy—an economy that might have required exceptional monetary policy accommodation for a much longer period of time?  The fundamental issue is whether U.S. monetary policy has helped support our dual objectives of maximum employment in the context of price stability, and whether this support is consistent with a healthy global economy.\n\nWhile explicit coordination looks neither feasible nor desirable, there may be more that central banks in general, and the Fed in particular, could do to be better global stewards.  As an example, I would emphasize the importance of effective Fed communication. It is clear, in retrospect, that our attempts in the spring of 2013 to provide guidance about the potential timing and pace of tapering confused market participants.  Market participants seemed to conflate the prospective tapering of asset purchases with monetary policy tightening, and pulled forward their expectations about the likely timing of liftoff and raised their expected paths for policy rates.  Lately, we seem to have done better: the tapering down of the Fed’s asset purchase program went smoothly and market participants now seem to share the assessment embodied in the FOMC’s March Summary of Economic Projections that lift-off is likely to begin sometime later this year.\n\nAs you know, we’ve taken a number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve our communications.  This includes regular press conferences by the Fed chair following FOMC meetings; the publishing of growth, inflation and short-term rate forecasts of FOMC participants; and a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at to assess progress toward our mandate.  We also have explained in considerable detail what tools we will use and how we will likely use them to ensure to ensure a smooth lift-off.\n\nA second area we have focused on is doing a better job safeguarding financial stability. Simply put, we failed to act both early enough and decisively enough to stem the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  The U.S. was not alone in this shortcoming, but given our position in the global financial system, we especially should have done better.  We've taken important steps through new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory and supervisory framework.  In particular, systemically important banking organizations must now hold amounts of capital and liquidity that are better aligned with their risk profiles.  Other changes have also been implemented, such as central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives contracts, that should make the global financial system more resilient and robust.\n\nAlthough this effort remains very much a work in progress, I think it will enable us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past decade, and enable us to take a more proactive stance toward mitigating potential future vulnerabilities.  Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here. Since the recent financial crisis, central banks worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how to better fulfill their mandates.\n\nLet me close with a final thought.  The largest problems that countries create for others often emanate from getting policy wrong domestically. Recession or instability at home is often quickly exported abroad.  Equally important, growth and stability abroad makes all our jobs at home easier.  This illustrates the externalities in the work we all do, with more effective fulfillment of our domestic mandates helping to bring us collectively to a better place.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.",

    "text": "Introduction Chairman Paul, Ranking Member Clay, and members of the Subcommittee, my name is Bill Dudley, and I am President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It is an honor to testify today about the economic and fiscal challenges facing Europe, and the Federal Reserve’s efforts to support financial stability in the United States. Financial stability enables U.S. businesses and households to maintain their access to credit and ensures sustained economic growth. This is why promoting financial stability is an important objective of the Federal Reserve, and other central banks around the world.\n\nLet me preface these remarks by stating that the views expressed in my written and oral testimony are solely my own and do not represent official views of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or any other part of the Federal Reserve System. Additionally, because I am precluded by law from discussing confidential supervisory information, I will not be able to speak about the financial condition or regulatory treatment or rating of any individual financial institution.\n\nThe U.S. economy is currently expanding at a moderate pace, and strains in global financial markets, although having eased recently, continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. Because developments in Europe will have an important bearing on the prospects for growth and jobs here in the U.S., the Federal Reserve is monitoring the situation there closely. This is also why we have taken special steps in recent months, together with other central banks, to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n\nEurope\n\nThe economic situation in Europe has been unsettled for the better part of two years, with pressure on sovereign debt markets and local banking systems. High debts, large deficits and slow growth in several European countries have called into question the sustainability of the entire euro area. The resulting strains in European markets have affected the U.S. economy.\n\nThe euro area has the capacity, including the fiscal capacity, to overcome its challenges. However, the politics are very difficult, both because the problem has many dimensions, and because many different countries and institutions in the euro area have to coordinate their actions in order to achieve a coherent and effective policy response.\n\nEurope's leadership has affirmed its commitment to the European Union and its single currency union on numerous occasions. And the leadership is working harder than ever to achieve greater coordination in areas such as fiscal policy. A more robust and resilient European Union would be a welcome development for the United States. Three recent developments are especially encouraging in that regard.\n\nFirst, liquidity concerns have eased significantly following the European Central Bank’s (ECB) long-term refinancing operations in December and February. Through this program, the ECB provides three-year loans to European banks at low rates, accepting a wide array of collateral in return. Hundreds of banks accessed the program in each operation, and the ECB lent nearly €1 trillion in total. As a result, the cost of funding throughout Europe has declined since the program began, the euro has stabilized, and the sovereign bond market has improved. Changes in the ECB’s collateral rules and reserve requirements have also had a positive impact.\n\nSecond, earlier this month, the Greek government worked with European leaders and its largest creditors to restructure the bulk of its €206 billion of outstanding privately-held bonds. This not only reduced Greece’s total indebtedness, it helped calm persistent worries that a disorderly Greek default could become the trigger for a global economic crisis. Shortly after the debt restructuring, the EU approved a €130 billion aid package for Greece. Together, these measures will provide key support to Greek leaders as they pursue the difficult fiscal reforms that are essential over the long term.\n\nThird, leaders in most euro area countries have approved a new treaty designed to increase fiscal coordination. The new rules already appear to be making a difference. Both Spain and Italy recently completed 2012 budgets that move their deficits closer to EU targets. Further, Spain and Italy took their fiscal actions in close consultation with finance ministers from other countries in the euro area, demonstrating a healthy ability to work together. While difficult work still lies ahead, countries in the euro area have made meaningful progress toward achieving long-term fiscal sustainability.\n\nLooking to the future, the difficult work that remains also presents special risks—both for Europe and the United States. If Europe fails to chart an effective course forward, this could have a number of negative implications here. In particular, there are three areas of potential risk that I would like to highlight for the Subcommittee today.\n\nFirst, if economic conditions in Europe were to weaken significantly, demand for U.S. exports would decrease. This would hurt domestic growth and have a negative impact on U.S. jobs. It is important to recognize that the euro area is the world’s second largest economy after the U.S. and an important trading partner for us. Also, Europe is a significant investor in the U.S. economy, and vice versa. Thus, what happens in Europe has significant implications for our economy.\n\nSecond, deterioration in the European economy could put pressure on the U.S. banking system. As the recent round of stress tests revealed, U.S. banks are much more robust and resilient than they were a few years ago. They have bolstered their capital significantly, built up their loan loss reserves and have significantly larger liquidity buffers. The direct net exposures of U.S. banks to the so-called \"peripheral\" European countries are actually quite modest. The good news in the United States means that we are better able to handle bad news from Europe.\n\nWith that said, the exposures of U.S. banks climb sharply when one also considers their exposures to the core European countries and to the overall European banking system. U.S. money market mutual funds, in particular, have significant European holdings. This means that if the crisis were to broaden further and intensify, it would put pressure on the capital and liquidity buffers of U.S. banks and other financial institutions.\n\nThird, severe stresses in European financial markets would disrupt financial markets here, which could harm the real economy. Stress in the financial markets causes banks to more carefully husband their balance sheets. When that phenomenon occurs, the availability of credit to U.S. households and businesses becomes constrained. Such conditions could also cause equity prices to fall, impairing the value of Americans’ pension and 401(k) holdings. This would damage the U.S. recovery and result in slower output growth and less job creation. At a time when U.S. unemployment is very high, this is a particularly unacceptable outcome. In the extreme, U.S. financial markets could become so impaired that the flow of credit to households and businesses would dry up.\n\nU.S. Dollar Swaps In today’s globally integrated economy, banks headquartered abroad play an important role in providing credit and other financial services in the United States. About $1 trillion in worldwide dollar financing comes from foreign banks, $700 billion in the form of loans within the U.S. For these banks to provide U.S. dollar loans, they have to maintain access to U.S. dollar funding. At a time when it is already hard enough for American families and firms to get the credit they need, we have a strong interest in making sure that these banks can continue to be active in the U.S. dollar markets.\n\nBanks headquartered outside the U.S. make extensive use of dollars in their financing activities. In part, this results from the fact that the U.S. dollar is the world's number one currency—a status that brings with it many benefits for our country. It is in our national interest to make sure that non-U.S. banks remain able to access the U.S. dollar funding they need to continue financing their U.S. dollar assets. If access to dollar funding were to become severely impaired, this could necessitate the abrupt, forced sales of dollar assets by these banks, which could seriously disrupt U.S. markets and adversely affect American businesses, consumers and jobs.\n\nOne way we can help to support the availability of dollar funding, and ensure that credit continues to flow to American households and businesses, is by engaging in currency swaps with other central banks. Such swaps are a policy tool the Federal Reserve has used to support dollar liquidity for nearly fifty years. Most recently, the Federal Reserve established dollar swap lines with major central banks during the global financial crisis of 2008, and reactivated them in May 2010. Last November, the FOMC, cooperating with five other central banks, reduced the rate being charged on these swaps to increase usage.\n\nThe swaps are intended to create a credible backstop to support—but not supplant—private markets. Banks with surplus dollars are more likely to lend to banks in need of dollars if they know that the borrowing bank will be able to obtain the dollars it needs to repay the loan, if necessary, from its central bank.\n\nUltimately, these dollar swaps are designed to support financial stability, and avoid an unnecessary tightening in financial conditions, so that economic activity and job creation in the United States can continue to recover. Our principal aim is to protect U.S. banks, businesses and consumers from adverse economic trends abroad. I am pleased that the swaps seem to be working. In conjunction with the ECB’s long-term refinancing operations, the swaps have helped European banks avoid the significant liquidity pressures we feared a few months ago and have reduced the risk that they would need to sell off their U.S. dollar assets abruptly.\n\nConclusion In sum, I am hopeful that Europe can effectively address its current fiscal challenges. The Federal Reserve is actively and carefully assessing this situation and the potential impact on the U.S. economy. At this time, although I do not anticipate further efforts by the Federal Reserve to address the potential spillover effects of Europe on the United States, we will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\nThank you for your invitation to testify today, and I look forward to answering your questions.",

    "text": "In assessing the lessons of the past two years, I will focus on five broad\n  themes that are interrelated:\n\nAs always, my views are my own and may not necessarily reflect those of the\n  FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInterconnectedness\n\nThis financial crisis has exposed how important the interconnections are among\n  the banking system, capital markets, and payment and settlement systems.  Focus\n  on only one part of the financial system can obscure vulnerabilities that may\n  prove very important.  For example, the disruption of the securitization\n  markets caused by the poor performance of highly-rated debt securities, led\n  to significant problems for major financial institutions.  Banks had to\n  take assets back on their books; backstop lines of credit were triggered; and\n  banks could no longer securitize loans, increasing the pressure on their balance\n  sheets.   This reduced credit availability, which increased the downward\n  pressure on economic activity, which caused asset values to decline further,\n  increasing the degree of stress in the financial system.\n\nThe high degree of\n  interconnectedness across the financial system has a number of implications.   First,\n  supervision must not just be vertical—firm\n  by firm, or region by region, but also horizontal—looking broadly across\n  banks, securities firms, markets and geographies.\n\nSecond, this means that supervisory practices need to be revamped.  They\n  need to be coordinated and multi-disciplinary.  I think the U.S. Treasury\n  is right in proposing a systemic risk regulator as part of their regulatory\n  reform plan.  But, we shouldn’t kid ourselves about how difficult\n  this will be to execute.    You will need a flexible and dynamic\n  governance process to be able to identify the important elements of systemic\n  risk, to elevate those concerns to the appropriate level and then to act on\n  those concerns in a timely manner.  It will take the right people, with\n  the right skill sets, operating in a system with the right culture and legal\n  framework.   I don’t believe creating this oversight process will\n  be an easy task.  Consider, for example, subprime lending.  There\n  were obvious excesses in terms of underwriting standards, product design and\n  risk management.  But addressing those issues during the boom would have\n  required the supervisor to absorb attacks that reining in some of these practices\n  would make it more difficult for some low- and moderate-income households to\n  become homeowners for the first time.\n\nSystem Dynamics\n\nIn thinking about interconnectedness, we also need to focus on system dynamics.  By\n  system dynamics, I mean how the different parts of the system interact.  Do\n  they interact in a way that dampens a shock or in a way that intensifies it?    To\n  the extent that the system has important reinforcing rather than dampening\n  mechanisms, then it may need to be modified.  That may require significant\n  re-engineering.\n\nLet me give you some examples of reinforcing and dampening mechanisms:\n\nCapital. When\n  firms have incentives to continue to pay dividends to show they are strong\n  that is a reinforcing or amplifying mechanism.  The\n  paying of the dividends depletes capital, making the firms weaker.  In\n  contrast, when firms have incentives (or are forced) to cut dividends quickly\n  to conserve capital, that is a dampening mechanism.\n\nForeign exchange.   When\n  the debts of a country held by foreigners are denominated predominantly in\n  the home currency, currency depreciation reduces the net debt burden—the\n  value of foreign assets climbs relative to the asset claims of foreigners.\n   The U.S. operates in a dampening regime in this respect. In contrast, when\n  the debts of the home country are denominated in foreign currency, currency\n  depreciation increases the net debt burden.  Some of the Baltic countries\n  are wrestling with this dilemma currently.\n\nSome reinforcing mechanisms that we might want to engineer out of the financial\n  system:\n\nIncentives\n\nIncentives may be very important in determining whether we have a system that\n  is dampening rather than amplifying.  I think bad outcomes are not just\n  about bad luck, they are also about bad incentives.    The problem\n  with incentives may be due to faulty compensation schemes, poor risk management\n  or the fact that participants do not bear the full costs of their actions.\n\nOne problem that we had in the U.S. banking system over the past year was\n  a reluctance of banks to raise sufficient capital to be able to withstand bad\n  states of nature.   They didn’t want to do this because this might\n  unnecessarily dilute their shareholders.  As a result, many banks did\n  not hold sufficient capital and market participants knew this.  This led\n  to tighter financial and credit conditions, which made the bad state of the\n  world more likely.  This is an example of both bad incentives and an amplifying\n  mechanism.\n\nThe Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) exercise that we undertook\n  in the United States leaned against this.  By forcing all the banks to\n  have sufficient capital to withstand a stress environment, we increased the\n  likelihood that all the big banks would be able to survive a stress environment.\n  This generated an improvement in confidence and a willingness of banks to engage\n  with each other.  This also made it easier for banks to be able to tap\n  the capital markets.  The SCAP exercise made a bad state of the world\n  outcome less likely, helping to create a virtuous circle rather than a vicious\n  one.    The SCAP exercise was conducted on an ad hoc basis.  It\n  probably would be much better to figure out how to do these types of exercises\n  on a systematic basis.  Such exercises may need to be hardwired into the\n  oversight of the financial system.\n\nCapital requirements are one area where I think we could adjust the rules\n  in a way to improve incentives. For example, imagine that we mandated that\n  banks had to hold more capital, but that the added capital could be in the\n  form of a debt instrument that only converted into equity if the share price\n  fell dramatically.  What would this do?   It would change management’s\n  incentives.  Not only would management focus on generating higher stock\n  prices, but they would also worry about risks that could cause share prices\n  to fall sharply, resulting in dilution of their share holdings.\n\nDebt convertible into equity on the downside would also be helpful in that\n  it would be a dampening mechanism—equity capital would be automatically\n  replenished, but only when this was needed.\n\nTransparency\n\nThere were many areas where a lack of transparency contributed to a loss of\n  confidence, which intensified the crisis.  One particular area was the\n  case of over-the-counter securities such as ABS, CMBS, RMBS and CDOs and their\n  associated derivatives.\n\nThere was a lack of transparency in a number of different dimensions.\n\nThe SCAP exercise was an example where increased transparency helped to generate\n  a better outcome.  We disclosed our stress test methodology and the results\n  for each of the nineteen largest bank holding companies.  This transparency\n  increased confidence and made it easier for the banks to raise more capital.\n\nMonetary Policy and Asset Bubbles\n\nIn my opinion, this crisis should lead to a critical reevaluation of the view\n  that central banks cannot identify or prevent asset bubbles, they can only\n  clean up after asset bubbles burst.\n\nAs I wrote in 2006, this orthodoxy can be summarized by three propositions:\n\nFrom these propositions, the two important policy implications directly follow:\n\nRelative to this, I would argue that:\n\nLet’s take the housing bubble as an example.   Housing prices\n  rose far faster than income.  As a result, underwriting standards deteriorated.  If\n  regulators had forced mortgage originators to tighten up their standards or\n  had forced the originators and securities issuers to keep “skin in the\n  game”, I think the housing bubble might not have been so big.\n\nI think that this crisis has demonstrated that the cost of waiting to clean\n  up asset bubbles after they burst can be very high.  That suggests we\n  should explore how to respond earlier.\n\nHarkening back to my earlier themes, I think we can respond in a number of\n  ways:",

    "text": "Let me start by  thanking Jens Weidmann and the Bank for International Settlements for the  opportunity to respond and comment on Professor Hélène Rey’s thoughtful remarks  and on the issue of international spillovers associated with U.S. monetary  policy.  As always, what I have to say  today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nAs is  characteristic of her work, what Hélène has to say is well-argued and  provocative.  It is also very relevant to  the conduct of monetary policy and the functioning of the international  monetary system.  I mostly agree with the  major points she makes.\n\nFirst, I  wholeheartedly agree with her on the hazards of financial booms.  Rapid increases in credit and capital flows,  asset prices, and leverage can lead to potentially severe corrections that can  impose great stress on financial systems.   As we have seen repeatedly, this stress can impair the ability of the  financial system to perform well in intermediating credit between savers and  borrowers, and in helping households and businesses manage their financial  risks.  When a financial system becomes  impaired, there can be dire consequences for economic activity and the ability  of central banks to achieve their macroeconomic objectives.\n\nHélène’s work  highlights an important global dimension to financial cycles, showing that  gross capital flows, asset prices and credit often move in a synchronized way  across countries as perceptions of risk change.   As we now know all too well, the global financial crisis dramatically  underscored the fact that instability in the U.S. financial system and those of  other advanced economies imposed extraordinarily high costs on the entire  global economy.\n\nMaking the  global financial system more resilient and less procyclical has been a key  focus of policymakers since the financial crisis, and most countries have made  substantial progress on this front.  This  is evident in stronger capital and liquidity buffers for banks, lower reliance  on wholesale short-term funding, reforms of over-the-counter derivatives  markets, and the development of resolution and recovery regimes for banks and  key financial market infrastructures, among other efforts.  Nonetheless, we must continue to work on these  issues.\n\nIn particular,  the U.S. financial system—the epicenter of the crisis—has been considerably  strengthened.  Here, I would highlight  additional reforms such as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)  regime, which imposes annual capital stress tests on systemically important  banks; tri-party repo reform; and money market mutual fund reform.  Policymakers globally have also made good  progress on strengthening supervisory oversight, and are making headway—albeit  more slowly—in developing effective macroprudential frameworks and  toolkits.\n\nBut, more work  remains to be done in several areas.  I  would put particular emphasis on the tasks of completing the creation of a  credible bank resolution regime that will work on a cross-border basis, and  developing effective recovery regimes for key financial market  infrastructures.\n\nI also agree  with Hélène that monetary policy in the United States—given the size of its  financial markets and the U.S. dollar’s status as a reserve currency—can have a  significant impact on global financial conditions, including exchange rates,  and that shifts in U.S. monetary policy can lead to consequential shifts in  global capital flows.  However, it is  also important to note that the impact of U.S. monetary policy restraint on  emerging market economies (EMEs) has varied widely across tightening  cycles.  The impact depends on many  factors, including EME fundamentals, asset valuations, and the extent and  composition of prior capital inflows to those economies.  Importantly, the impact has tended to be more  benign when U.S. yields rise in response to good U.S. growth prospects.  In contrast, spillovers have tended to be  more adverse when increased monetary policy stringency is associated with a  deteriorating U.S. economic outlook. 2\n\nThese  observations point to the need for the United States to keep its own house in  order.  Promoting economic growth and  financial stability in the United States, I believe, is the most important contribution  we can make to promoting growth and stability worldwide.\n\nLike nearly all  central banks, the Federal Reserve has a domestic mandate set for it—in our  case, by the U.S. Congress.  It cannot  subordinate its legal mandate of maximum employment and price stability in the  United States to alternative international goals.  But, given the role of the United States and  the U.S. dollar in the global economy and financial system, the Federal Reserve  is—and indeed, needs to be—mindful of the international effects of its  policy.  That is because those  consequences can have important potential spillbacks to the U.S. economy and  financial markets.\n\nThe bond market  “taper tantrum” of 2013 highlighted that prospective changes in U.S. monetary  policy could affect the EMEs—particularly those with existing  vulnerabilities—and how those consequences, in turn, could spill back to the  United States.  This episode underscored  the need for clear communication and transparency around U.S. policy so that  expectations can adjust smoothly and be appropriately calibrated to what is likely  to occur.\n\nAs you know, the  Federal Reserve has become increasingly transparent in recent years, in part to  mitigate such risks.  Good communication  and transparency is always important during periods of conventional policy  normalization.  But, good communication  and transparency may be even more important when one begins to unwind  unconventional monetary policy actions, such as balance sheet policies with  which we have little prior experience.   Moreover, I would surmise that adjustments to balance sheet policies  undoubtedly affect asset prices in ways that differ from changes in short-term  interest rates.\n\nEarlier this  month, we announced an addendum to the FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles  and Plans. 3 In this addendum, we spelled out how the  balance sheet normalization program would work.   This was another step in a long chain of communications about the  balance sheet—incremental steps that highlight the evolution of our  communication practices.\n\nI hope you would  agree that we have taken a very measured and careful approach.\n\nThis process  started with the initial release of the Policy Normalization Principles and  Plans in September 2014, which indicated that the FOMC planned to reduce  securities in a gradual and predictable manner.   Related comments followed in the minutes of the July 2015 FOMC meeting  and the December 2015 FOMC statement.   Subsequently, FOMC participants discussed potential long-run frameworks  for monetary policy implementation as detailed in the November 2016 FOMC  minutes.\n\nNext, the March  2017 FOMC minutes reaffirmed that a change in balance sheet policy would be  gradual and predictable, and achieved primarily by changing the reinvestment  policy.  These minutes also noted that  most participants judged a change in reinvestment policy would likely be  appropriate this year, should economic data develop as they expected.  Then, in the May 2017 minutes, it was noted  that nearly all participants had a favorable view of a phased-in, cap approach  whereby reinvestments would be decreased gradually.  Participants favored this strategy because a  preannounced schedule would be gradual and predictable, limiting the magnitude  of the runoff could help mitigate any adverse market effects, and the strategy  would be relatively easy and straightforward to communicate.\n\nFinally, as I  noted earlier, we followed up in our last FOMC meeting with the release of an  addendum to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that outlined how our  balance sheet normalization plan will work when it is implemented.  We also said clearly in the FOMC statement  that if the economy evolves in line with our expectations, we expect to begin  this process this year.\n\nIn response,  market participants have progressively increased the probability assigned to a  change in reinvestment policy this year.   Yet, Treasury and agency MBS markets have responded little at the time  of these announcements—including those undertaken most recently.  To me, this suggests that these  communications have generally been effective in fostering an orderly adjustment  in expectations about how we are likely to normalize our balance sheet.\n\nI also agree  with Hélène about the important role of financial conditions in influencing  economic activity.  As I see it,  financial conditions are a key transmission channel of monetary policy because  they affect households’ and firms’ saving and investment plans and thus  influence economic activity and the economic outlook.  If the response of financial conditions to  changes in short-term interest rates were rigid and predictable, then there  would be no need to pay such close attention to financial conditions.  But, as we all know, the linkage is in fact  quite loose and variable.\n\nFor example,  during the mid-2000s, financial conditions failed to tighten even as the  Federal Reserve pushed its federal funds rate target up from 1 percent to 5¼  percent.  Conversely, at the height of  the crisis, financial conditions tightened sharply even as the Federal Reserve  aggressively pushed its federal funds rate target down toward zero.  As a result, monetary policymakers need to  take the evolution of financial conditions into consideration.  For example, when financial conditions  tighten sharply, this may mean that monetary policy may need to be tightened by  less or even loosened.  On the other hand,  when financial conditions ease—as has been the case recently—this can provide  additional impetus for the decision to continue to remove monetary policy  accommodation.\n\nWhile I agree  with Hélène in most respects, there are a few points where I am less  convinced.  While the global financial  cycle complicates policymakers’ ability to guide financial conditions in their  own economies, I’m not persuaded that the trilemma has been replaced by a  dilemma—that is, essentially an “either/or” choice between an independent  monetary policy versus an open capital account.\n\nWhile there is  no panacea to insulate countries from financial spillovers—particularly when  policy in some areas is constrained by the effective lower bound on interest  rates—I think a combination of exchange rate flexibility, a credible monetary  policy framework, sufficient foreign exchange reserves, and a strong financial  system can help mitigate the effects of such spillovers.  Moreover, it strikes me that market  participants have become more discriminating over time about the circumstances  of different countries, rather than painting all EMEs with a similar broad brush.\n\nThat said, I  accept Hélène’s suggestion that there may be other good alternatives, such as operating  with less financial leverage and the increased use of macroprudential policy,  including more aggressive stress testing.   Also, the current regime—in which countries mostly have to self-insure  against external shocks—seems inefficient.   I believe that a regime with more risk-sharing across countries could be  beneficial for the global economy.\n\nThank you for  your kind attention.\n\nThe Andrew Crockett Memorial

    "text": "What I would like to do today is to explain in some detail the logic underlying this expectation that economic conditions will warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. This conclusion stems from the observation that the current economic environment is qualitatively different from previous post-World War II business cycles. Most post-war recessions were preceded by high rates of resource utilization and rising trend inflation. This prompted a tightening of monetary policy, which, in turn, dampened interest-rate sensitive spending, particularly on housing and consumer durable goods. Then, as underlying inflation pressures subsided, monetary policy was eased and interest-rate sensitive spending rebounded, often quite sharply.\n\nThe current business cycle is different in one key respect. It was preceded by a global financial crisis. The financial crisis was due, in large part, to excessive leverage and excessive investment in real estate assets. It will take time to unwind these excesses.\n\nToday, I will offer a framework for assessing the forces that have shaped the recent performance of the U.S. economy. This framework will provide context to the fiscal and monetary policy responses to what is now being called the “Great Recession.” Then, I will discuss the economic outlook for the United States over the next year. Before I proceed, I want to emphasize that these views are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nBuilding an Analytical Framework Say's law—named after the French economist Jean-Baptiste Say—states that the aggregate value of incomes earned in an economy over some period of time must by definition equal the value of all goods and services produced over that same time period. Or, put somewhat differently, on an ex post (i.e., realized) basis, saving must equal investment. Investment in this case means current spending on new physical, human and intangible capital. This insight is the conceptual basis for national income accounting and the gross domestic product (GDP) statistics that we follow so carefully.\n\nEven so, economists have been debating the implications of Say's Law since it was first expounded. Classical economists argued that this ex post balance would occur in a way that kept the economy quite stable at full employment. If there were shocks to saving or investment spending that pushed the economy away from full employment, prices and wages would adjust quickly, providing the market signals needed to bring about the reallocation of resources required to restore full employment.\n\nThe global depression of the 1930s raised serious questions about this classical theory. Although saving must equal investment on an ex post basis, the two can diverge ex ante, potentially sharply. For example, when ex ante (i.e., desired) saving exceeds ex ante (desired) investment spending, inventories rise above desired levels. If prices of the products in question do not fall sufficiently rapidly so that this unwanted build-up of inventories is sold quickly, then production and employment must fall. Perhaps most famously, Keynes, in The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money , argued that there are institutional rigidities that inhibit price and wage flexibility. This means that periods in which ex ante saving exceeds desired investment might lead to periods of persistent unemployment.\n\nIn this respect, the financial system plays an important role. Financial intermediaries match borrowers and savers. If the financial system is under stress and lending standards are being tightened, ex ante investment is likely to decline relative to saving, all else being equal.\n\nThe financial intermediation process and the creation of credit is the primary channel through which monetary policy affects the economy. By influencing the volume of credit creation, monetary policy strives to keep ex ante saving and investment—alternatively, aggregate demand and aggregate supply—in rough balance. Too rapid a pace of credit creation would overstimulate investment relative to saving, potentially increasing the rate of inflation and this, in turn, could damage the economy's long-run performance. Too slow of a pace of credit creation would likely lead to an ex ante shortfall of investment relative to saving, causing unemployment to increase.\n\nThis analytical framework also applies to the global economy, but with an added level of complexity. At the global level, income equals output and saving equals investment on an ex post basis. However, for an individual country, saving can exceed investment or, alternatively, production can exceed domestic demand to the extent that a country's exports exceed its imports. This requires that, for some other economy or group of economies, investment must exceed saving, or alternatively, domestic demand must exceed production and imports must exceed exports. This means that what happens abroad in terms of desired saving and investment also influences the performance of our domestic economy.\n\nThis framework provides a simple way to evaluate the recent economic environment and the current economic outlook. When desired investment rises relative to saving on an ex ante basis, then an economy tends to strengthen. If the strengthening persists, inflation may rise to levels above what is regarded as consistent with maximum sustainable growth and full employment. This was the story for much of the 2004-06 period. The Federal Reserve responded to rising trend inflation by tightening monetary policy to keep the economy from overheating.\n\nIn contrast, when investment falls relative to saving on an ex ante basis, an economy weakens and may slip into recession, as was the case between 2007 and mid-2009. During this period, the Federal Reserve tried to support employment by cutting its federal funds rate target nearly to zero; by creating a number of special liquidity facilities to support the extension of credit; and by engaging in a large scale asset purchase program, buying Treasuries, agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nAn economic recovery requires that desired investment must rise relative to saving. This has happened recently as fiscal stimulus and an inventory cycle have led to a fall in ex ante saving relative to investment. But for the recovery to strengthen further, this process must continue. There has to be a further demand impulse—be it a decline in household saving rates, a rise in business investment relative to profits, a further expansion of fiscal stimulus or an improvement in the net trade balance via an increase in exports relative to imports.\n\nLet's now apply this framework to evaluate what happened over the past decade and what it implies for the economic outlook.\n\nThe last three decades have been marked by a shortage of U.S. domestic saving relative to investment. The United States has almost continuously run a current account deficit since the early 1980s (Chart 1). In 2005 and 2006 that current account deficit averaged around 6 percent of GDP. Yet, the real exchange value of the dollar today is not terribly different from what it was in the early 1990s (Chart 2). A massive flow of saving into the United States from around the world offset forces that otherwise would have driven the exchange value of the dollar lower.\n\nIn addition to its sheer size, this inflow of saving into the United States is significant in several respects. First, note the direction of the flow. One might expect that capital would flow from the developed world to the developing world, but just the opposite has been the case. In addition, foreign savers have been willing to lend to the United States in the U.S. currency. This means that foreign savers are exposed to the exchange rate risk that the dollar's value might change relative to their own currencies. Finally, one might expect that over time, as their holdings of dollar-denominated assets increased, foreign savers would demand higher interest rates, but, in fact, U.S. interest rates—in both nominal and real terms—have been generally declining over the past three decades 1 (Chart 3).\n\nThese facts are at odds with the prevailing view that spendthrift U.S. consumers and governments are pulling those savings into the United States. Indeed, for some time the “twin deficits” view held that large fiscal deficits in the United States were causing large U.S. current account deficits. However, even when the federal government ran surpluses in the late 1990s, our current account deficit continued to increase. Subsequent research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates that the link between fiscal deficits and capital inflows is not as strong as commonly suggested. 2\n\nBefore proceeding, a few important qualifications are in order. First, despite the large flow of foreign saving into the United States, our international financial position does not appear precarious at the present time. The United States still has substantial investments in foreign countries, and income from U.S. investments abroad still exceeds the income generated by U.S. assets owned by foreigners. Part of the reason is that U.S. firms operating abroad earn higher rates of profit than foreign firms operating here. In addition, low interest rates minimize the cost to the United States of our substantial negative net debt position.\n\nIn addition, the fact that our foreign indebtedness is for the most part denominated in our own currency is a huge advantage in the event the dollar were to come under significant downward pressure. That is because a decline in the dollar would raise the value of the income earned on our foreign direct investment and foreign-currency denominated assets, relative to the income that foreigners earned on their dollar-denominated investments in the United States. All else being equal, this would boost our net investment income balance.\n\nNote that borrowing per se is not necessarily a bad thing. The key is what the borrowing is used for—to finance consumption or investment. And, if it is used to fund investment, it is also important how productive that investment turns out to be over time.\n\nSo what did we do with this inflow of foreign saving? We invested in a substantial volume of physical capital, particularly residential and nonresidential real estate (Chart 4). It seems clear that one important factor behind this investment was the decline in long- term interest rates. For example, from 2003 through 2005 mortgage rates declined to just under 6 percent on average, the lowest level since the first half of the 1960s. These lower mortgage interest rates were capitalized into asset prices. Rising prices for residential and nonresidential real estate assets induced entrepreneurs to produce more of those assets. In the housing market, this increase in prices was helped along by the relaxation of loan underwriting standards, which made it easier to obtain a mortgage and become a homeowner. Credit growth was the strongest among households with relatively low credit scores (Chart 5). The homeownership rate rose after being relatively stagnant for two decades (Chart 6). The increased availability of credit to lower income borrowers and the sharp rise in housing values contributed to the rise of consumption as a share of GDP and the decline of the personal saving rate 3 (Chart 7).\n\nNow, with the aid of hindsight, it is clear that we built too many houses, invested in too much commercial real estate and overvalued both significantly. The market overshot for several reasons. First, there was rampant speculative behavior. The longer these asset prices continued to rise, the stronger the belief became that they would keep rising in the future. Second, the rise in prices reinforced the initial relaxation of underwriting standards. During the period of rising prices, defaults and loan losses were very low. A homeowner who had difficulty servicing the debt could typically sell the home for a profit and pay off the loan. Third, the boom was fueled by new financial products, such as collateralized debt obligations that were backed by subprime and Alt-A mortgages. Investors misunderstood how risky these products were and this resulted in lower mortgage rates for non-conforming residential mortgages and lower funding costs for commercial real estate borrowing.\n\nIn the housing sector, these factors interacted to create a strong reinforcing dynamic. The relaxation of underwriting standards that made it easier to become a homeowner and the low mortgage rates—supported in part by the new financial products—made it easier to speculate in real estate. Moreover, as home prices rose, household net worth increased, making households more willing to consume a greater share of their current income.\n\nNot surprisingly, this bout of speculative fever ended badly. Eventually, the supply of houses caught up with and then vastly overshot demand. Easing underwriting standards to support demand could only go on for so long. Prices turned down. At the national level, home prices peaked in late 2005 to early 2006 with commercial real estate prices peaking about one year later (Chart 8). From those peaks, home prices have fallen by about 30 percent on average, with much larger declines in some areas, while commercial real estate prices have fallen by about 40 percent on average.\n\nAs price declines intensified, the number of serious mortgage delinquencies surged and, in fact, continue to rise (Chart 9). Research indicates that by 2007 the percentage of nonprime mortgages that went into default within their first year rose to 10 percent compared with 3 percent of such loans originated in 2003. While falling home prices appear to be the primary factor explaining this sharp increase in early defaults, most of the increase cannot be explained by traditional risk factors. 4 A potential explanation is that individual home buyers often falsely indicated on their mortgage applications that the property they were buying would be their primary residence. Using an extensive set of data on loan performance that we have developed with Equifax, we find that multiple first mortgage lien holders—that is, people owning more than one home—account for about 40 percent of the dollar volume of seriously delinquent mortgage balances, up from about 5 percent in 2004 (Chart 10).\n\nAs delinquency and foreclosure rates rose, structured finance products backed by riskier mortgage loans performed particularly poorly. The securitization market for non-conforming mortgages collapsed. Credit availability tightened as underwriting practices became much more restrictive, even for plain vanilla mortgages.\n\nThe cascading effect of the sharp increase in mortgage delinquencies and the resulting steep decline in the market value of mortgage assets was a key contributing factor to the financial crisis. As the financial crisis intensified and the economic outlook deteriorated, equity prices eventually declined by 50 percent from their late 2007 peak before bottoming out about one year ago.\n\nBut while the value of real estate and equities plunged, the debt incurred to acquire those assets remained, leaving households very highly leveraged. According to the Flow of Funds Accounts, the ratio of household liabilities to net worth rose from around 20 percent to nearly 30 percent in just three years (Chart 11).\n\nThe result was a sharp decline in desired investment relative to saving. The number of housing starts plunged, commercial real estate investment fell and households cut back on their spending as their net worth plummeted. The economy slumped into what is now called the “Great Recession”.\n\nThe Dimensions of the Downturn According to the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the U.S. economy has experienced 10 recessions since 1950. The duration of those previous recessions averaged slightly less than a year during which real GDP fell an average of 1.75 percent and the unemployment rate increased an average of 2.3 percentage points.\n\nThe Great Recession was far worse. From its peak, real GDP declined 3.8 percent—more than double the average decline of prior downturns (Chart 12). The unemployment rate began to increase in the second half of 2007. Over the next two years, it increased 5.5 percentage points. The rise would have been even more pronounced except that the average workweek and the labor force participation rate declined unusually sharply (Charts 13 and 14). Overall, total hours worked in the nonfarm business sector declined a staggering 10.6 percent (Chart 15). In addition to the decline in demand for labor, the manufacturing capacity utilization rate declined to 65.1 in June of 2009, the lowest level of the post-World War II period.\n\nThe result is that the “output gap”—that is, the difference between actual output and the output achieved at the highest resource utilization rate consistent with price stability—has climbed sharply. This, in turn, has put downward pressure on trend inflation. For example, on a year-over-year basis, the core inflation rate declined to 1.5 percent in January 2010 from nearly 3 percent in the fall of 2006 (Chart 16).\n\nThe Road Ahead Fortunately, the U.S. economy is very flexible and resilient. Although it does not adjust as fast as classical economists envisioned, in the United States prices and wages respond relatively quickly. Moreover, policymakers have been aggressive in supporting the economy by easing monetary policy and by implementing a large fiscal-stimulus program.\n\nAs a result, although the unemployment rate remains unacceptably high, output has begun to expand again, and we appear to be on the verge of seeing sustained growth in employment. We'll know more about this tomorrow when the March employment figures are released. Equity prices have recovered sharply and home prices and commercial real estate prices appear to be stabilizing. Household indebtedness is declining, due to a combination of debt repayment and credit that has been written off by lenders. After falling off a cliff during the first half of 2009, global trade has rebounded. Both U.S. exports and U.S. manufacturing output have expanded rapidly over the past six months (Chart 17).\n\nAlthough these are encouraging developments, I believe that the recovery is likely to be quite muted compared with past recoveries. This comes back to the framework discussed earlier. For faster growth, we need ex ante investment to rise relative to saving and ex ante spending to rise relative to the current trend of income. But it is difficult to see where this impulse will come from in the near term.\n\nThe early stages of past recoveries have been led by consumer spending, particularly for durable goods and residential investment. For example, in the first year of recovery following the deep recessions of 1973-1975 and 1981-1982, real consumer spending increased an average of 6.5 percent and residential investment rose an average of 38 percent. It is unlikely that we will experience this type of strength this time. Households have suffered unusually large shocks to both income and wealth and many remain highly leveraged (Chart 18). Although the household debt to net worth ratio has declined considerably from its peak, it is still around 26 percent, well above the already elevated average of the past decade (Chart 19). Moreover, even if consumers wanted to borrow, credit availability is still constrained and underwriting standards remain relatively tight. Real consumer spending increased at a 2.25 percent annual rate over the second half of 2009 and looks to be growing at about that rate in the first quarter of 2010.\n\nGiven that the personal saving rate is still relatively low, it will be hard for consumer spending to grow more quickly without large increases in real labor income. But big increases in real labor income won't be possible without a much stronger recovery in output. And a much stronger recovery in output is unlikely without stronger consumption.\n\nResidential investment did increase over the second half of 2009, boosted by relatively low mortgage interest rates, lower home prices and the first-time home buyer tax credit. But recent data on the housing sector indicates that the recovery has stalled (Chart 20). As with consumption, we are unlikely to see the typical surge of housing starts and residential investment that was a key feature of most past recoveries. There is already an unusually large volume of vacant homes for rent and for sale (Chart 21). More are likely to come onto the market in the months ahead due to the large volume of mortgage loans currently in the foreclosure process.\n\nFor the government sector, large federal budget deficits are a constraint and fiscal policy is slowly shifting from an expansive policy back toward restraint. At the state and local level, the constraints are even more binding, as budgetary gaps will need to be addressed by spending cuts and tax increases (Chart 22).\n\nExports rebounded sharply over the second half of 2009, particularly to the emerging world (Chart 23). However, domestic demand in Europe and Japan—important export markets for the United States—remains very weak. This suggests that the U.S. trade balance is likely to change little over the next year or two, and, thus, will be relatively neutral in terms of its impact on growth.\n\nOnly business fixed investment is in a position to be a true locomotive of growth. Profits have stayed high relative to investment, and corporate balance sheets are awash with cash (Charts 24 and 25). However, even here, the growth impulse is likely to be weak. Prospective startup businesses are going to find it difficult to obtain funding. And larger businesses will unlikely increase investment spending sharply at a time when capacity utilization rates remain unusually depressed (Chart 26).\n\nRelatively sluggish growth implies that the output gap will be closed very gradually. This suggests that inflation pressures will stay subdued. The excess supply of housing is putting downward pressure on rents, which represent a large share of the consumer price index (CPI) (Chart 27). In addition, unit labor costs have declined sharply over the past year due to the combination of unusually rapid productivity growth and slowing labor compensation growth (Chart 28). Fortunately, longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored. These expectations have not declined and are broadly consistent with my views on the appropriate inflation goal (Chart 29). This is actually a welcome development right now because it will likely help to keep the trend inflation rate from falling too much.\n\nLessons to be Learned We have just lived through a period in which rapid increases in asset prices led to a serious misallocation of resources and a severe financial crisis. What do we need to do to minimize the likelihood of this type of experience in the future?\n\nAs I noted in a recent speech, we face three major challenges that will determine how smooth this economic expansion turns out to be. 5 First, we need regulatory reform that makes our financial system more stable and resilient. This requires many steps, including systemic risk oversight and solving the so-called too-big-to-fail problem. In this respect, we need to think hard about what we can do to prevent the type of speculative bubbles that occurred from causing so much damage in the future. In particular, are there macro prudential tools that the Federal Reserve and other regulators can use to limit leverage and speculation and thus prevent the type of asset price booms and busts that have proved so troublesome?\n\nSecond, we need viable exit strategies from this recent period of monetary and fiscal policy stimulus. On the monetary policy side, we have been working hard to ensure that we have the tools in place so that we can be effective in tightening monetary policy when the time is right, even with an enlarged balance sheet. Third, we need a rebalancing of global economic growth. That means a smaller share of consumption relative to GDP in the United States and offsetting shifts in Asia.\n\nCircumstances have improved considerably from what they were a year ago. But job creation is still much too slow and we have much to do on the regulatory side to make our financial system more resilient and robust.\n\nThank you very much for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________ 1 Brender, Anton and Florence Pisani. 2007. “Global Imbalances: Is the World Economy Really at Risk?” Dexia SA. 2 Bartolini, Leonardo and Amartya Lahiri. 2006. Twin Deficits, Twenty Years Later , Federal Reserve Bank of New York Current Issues in Economics and Finance, 12, no. 7 (October). 3 There are a few caveats to note about this trend. First, there are several categories of spending by households that are lumped into the personal consumption expenditures category in our official GDP statistics that can fairly be counted as investment. These include spending on consumer durable goods, education, and, possibly, medical care, and their combined share of total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose over the period in which the saving rate declined. Second, other forces were at work to push down the personal saving rate. Prominent among these is a secular decline in the share of health care expenditures paid out-of-pocket by consumers, lessening the motivation for precautionary savings. 4 Haughwout, Andrew, Richard Peach, and Joe Tracy. 2008. “Juvenile Delinquent Mortgages: Bad Credit or Bad Economy.”, Journal of Urban Economics, 64, no. 2 (September): 246-57. 5 Financial Market Turmoil: The Federal Reserve and the Challenges Ahead , William C.

    "text": "Good  morning, and welcome to the New York Fed’s Regional Economic Press  Briefing .  Today, we will provide an  update on the economies of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with  particular focus on the impacts of Hurricanes Irma and Maria.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own  views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the  Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nInitial  Fallout from the Storms\n\nHurricanes  Irma and Maria did immense damage to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,  severely exacerbating what were already very difficult economic  conditions.  My heart goes out to our  fellow citizens who have suffered so much and who face a long and difficult  recovery ahead.\n\nMaria  was the most devastating hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly a century.  Many lives were lost, homes and businesses  suffered immense damage, and large parts of the Island’s infrastructure and  agriculture were destroyed.  Moreover,  Puerto Rico’s power outage was, by far, the most severe in U.S. history, in  terms of total customer-hours lost, and it will still likely take many more  months to fully restore electricity and other critical infrastructure to all of  the Island’s residents.  As a result, a  sizable number of residents went to the U.S. mainland in the weeks following  Maria, and it still is unclear how many will return once circumstances improve.\n\nEven  before the storms hit, Puerto Rico was struggling with severe fiscal  difficulties and a long period of poor economic performance.  For over a decade, the Island has been  experiencing a shrinking economy, contracting employment, low and declining labor  force participation, and persistent out-migration of residents to the  mainland.  Furthermore, public debt  reached a problematic level, and the Commonwealth and its  instrumentalities—including the power and water authorities—lost their ability  to borrow in the public markets.   Defaults and ongoing debt restructuring efforts followed.\n\nIn  the U.S. Virgin Islands, the situation is similar in many ways.  St. Thomas and St. John were ravaged by Irma,  and St. Croix was devastated by Maria just two weeks later.  Their economy, which is much more dependent  on tourism than that of Puerto Rico, has also been contracting for the better  part of a decade.  However, the  population of the U.S. Virgin Islands has not fallen nearly as sharply as  Puerto Rico’s, and its economy had stabilized in the past two years following  the closure of a major refinery in 2012.   Still, while by some measures the U.S. Virgin Islands are not as  fiscally stressed as Puerto Rico, they, too, do not have access to the debt  markets.\n\nRecovery  and Rebuilding\n\nThe  combined impact of complex preexisting economic problems and the hurricanes has  made recovery much more challenging.  The  loss of market access has severely hampered the ability of the governments to  mobilize resources to respond to the damage and rebuild and upgrade  infrastructures.\n\nOne  example is Puerto Rico’s electrical grid, which is a major obstacle to  recovery.  Even before Maria, Puerto Rico  suffered frequent blackouts, and the high cost and unreliability of electricity  had reduced business competitiveness.   Puerto Rico’s power plants are largely outdated and inefficient, and the  electrical distribution system is poorly maintained and extremely fragile.  In my mind, given this poor starting point,  now is a perfect opportunity for Puerto Rico to essentially start from scratch  and build a resilient power generation and distribution network.  I would assume that an emphasis on renewable  energy would be part of this effort, especially given the dramatic fall in costs  for this form of electricity generation.   The challenge, of course, will be how to finance this investment, when  the Commonwealth is already mired in debt.\n\nDespite  these woes, there are signs of resilience in Puerto Rico.  As we will show, job losses following the  storm were very substantial, totaling around 4 percent in Puerto Rico and 8  percent in the U.S. Virgin Islands.   These losses are considerably steeper than after most major hurricanes  that have hit the United States. However, they are not as devastating as  Katrina’s impact on the New Orleans economy more than a decade ago, which was  and remains unprecedented.  Nonetheless,  the labor market, at least in Puerto Rico, appears to be stabilizing as jobs in  sectors that were most affected—such as leisure and hospitality—have started to  come back.  And, as repair and rebuilding  efforts get underway in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, jobs are  being created in sectors such as construction.   These job gains are expected to continue for some time to come.\n\nLooking  Ahead\n\nPuerto  Rico now must not only complete the recovery from the hurricane, but also do  what is necessary to get on a sustainable economic and fiscal path.  Given the Island’s high debt, unfunded  pension obligations, declining population, and now the hurricane, the outlook  may seem grim.\n\nBut  there are good reasons not to despair.   As I have noted previously, New York City went through a similar crisis  during the 1970s: its population was declining, the economy was in a five-year  recession, and the city had literally run out of money to pay its employees and  could not borrow in the debt markets.   However, leaders had the courage to confront these problems head on, and  they adopted a series of reforms, including the establishment of a fiscal  oversight board and a more transparent budgeting process.  All of this helped transform the city from an  increasingly blighted urban landscape to the vibrant economy of today.  And, New York City is not the only example of  a major turnaround.  Now-dynamic cities  such as Washington, D.C., Pittsburgh, and Seattle also went through wrenching  economic and fiscal contractions.  While  Puerto Rico’s path to prosperity will not look exactly like that of New York or  other cities, history can provide valuable lessons, as well as hope for a better  future.  The same can be said for the  U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nIn  addition, Puerto Rico has a number of unique attributes and endowments that it  can leverage as it seeks a path toward prosperity, including its educated and  bilingual workforce, its proximity and access to markets on the U.S. mainland,  and its extensive experience as a host to various major U.S. multinational  corporations.\n\nBut,  a recovery is not going to happen on its own.   We at the New York Fed have made a number of suggestions over the years  that we think can help improve Puerto Rico’s competitiveness and economic  prospects. 2 Some of these issues are now being addressed,  and still more are at least being discussed.   Among others, lowering the costs and disincentives to doing business,  helping Island residents develop and use their human capital, and improving  labor market opportunities are all important steps that must be taken.\n\nOn  the fiscal side, the Financial Oversight and Management Board and the  Commonwealth together will be making a series of difficult choices over the  coming months.  It will be critically  important that these decisions put the Commonwealth on a sustainable fiscal  path going forward.  As in other  examples, such as New York City in the 1970s, the fiscal adjustment will be  painful, and many important decisions will undoubtedly be unpopular.  While the pain has been—and will continue to  be—widely shared, it is also critical to seek ways to ensure that the benefits  from the restoration of growth are shared broadly.  How exactly to make this work is an open  question that I am certain the oversight board and its stakeholders will  consider carefully over the coming months.\n\nThe  New York Fed will continue to help in the best ways we can—by providing  independent research and analysis, and by leveraging our convening authority to  bring together stakeholders to share expertise, explore opportunities, and  provide information to those who need it most.   We recently held two events on the Island—one for small business owners  impacted by the storm and another for credit unions.  We plan to do more in the months and years  ahead, and I look forward to gaining a better understanding of conditions on  the ground and how we can help when I travel to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands next month.\n\nNow,  I’d like to turn it over to Jason Bram, who will talk more about what we are  starting to see in terms of the economic impact of the storms.",

    "text": "On behalf of the New York Fed and  our co-sponsors, it is my pleasure to welcome you to this second annual  conference on the evolving structure of the U.S. Treasury market.  We have the opportunity today to continue the  dialogue around the changing nature of the Treasury market, a discussion that  grew more urgent following the events of October 15, 2014. 1 We have made significant progress since last  year’s conference in improving our collective understanding of the Treasury  market, and I believe it is important to continue official and private sector  collaboration on this topic.  Indeed, there is much left to do to ensure the continued integrity and effectiveness of this market, and I look forward to the further progress we will make today.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 2\n\nOver the past year, the Joint Member Agencies 3 have  engaged with market participants and other members of the public to gain more  information on the changing structure of the Treasury market.  The Treasury’s Request for Information, and  comments on various SEC and CFTC proposals, have provided thoughtful  perspectives on the evolution of Treasury market structure.  We have also benefited from consultation with  groups such as the Treasury Markets Practices Group (TMPG), which is made up of  market professionals committed to supporting the integrity and efficiency of  the Treasury market.\n\nContinued engagement between the  official sector and the public on the Treasury market remains necessary to help  to manage its evolution, and to best maintain its efficient function and  integrity.  Those of you who transact in  this market have a crucial perspective on how the Treasury market works and  what information is useful for evaluating its function.  Engagement between the official and private  sectors can also facilitate the development of timely solutions to important  issues in the industry.  Such efforts  include the best practices the TMPG has produced for the Treasury, agency debt  and agency MBS markets, 4 and the Group of 30’s recommendations on banking culture and conduct 5 ―an  issue I believe the financial industry must continue to work on. 6 In fact, it is this type of  collaboration―between a wide array of market participants and official  agencies―that helps different perspectives come together to create effective  practices. 7\n\nIn addition to engagement with the  public, the Joint Member Agencies have continued their inter-agency  collaboration.  We have been working  together to share information and help shape the most effective path forward  for public policy.  These actions include  the signing of a memorandum of understanding that further facilitates  information sharing related to the Treasury market, and again co-hosting this  conference.  Going forward, the staff of  the Joint Member Agencies will continue to work together on effective and  comprehensive data collection, monitoring of market activity and liquidity  through the Interagency Working Group, development of principles and best  practices for Treasury market data transparency, and the regulatory framework  for government securities.\n\nA main focus of recent work by the  Joint Member Agencies has been to improve the availability of information to  both the official sector and the public.  Given this emphasis, it is worth spending a few moments discussing the  benefits of obtaining timely and robust data on Treasury market  transactions.\n\nData are essential to understanding  flash events and market liquidity.  Attendees at this conference are very familiar with the events of  October 15, 2014, when the 10-year Treasury yield experienced a 37-basis-point  trading range over the session.  At that  time, market participants struggled to identify what had caused that sharp  movement.  Similarly, a flash event  occurred in the British pound just this month.  The pound depreciated nearly 6 percent, and then largely retraced this  move within several minutes, seemingly without a major catalyst.  Once the domain of equity markets, flash  events have happened with increasing frequency, also occurring in the  dollar-yen and euro-dollar currency pairs in recent years.\n\nTreasury and foreign exchange  markets share a number of common attributes.  They are evolving rapidly, they are highly automated in key market  segments, and information on trading activity is not widely available.  As a result, it is challenging for the  official sector, market participants, and members of the public to effectively  analyze these markets, understand the sources and risks of flash events, and  evaluate how liquidity is changing.\n\nGiven the role of the Treasury  market as the deepest and most liquid fixed income market in the world, it is  clear that both the official sector and the public need improved access to  transaction-level data, and I am pleased that we are making real progress on  this front.  Greater transparency into Treasury market activity is necessary in maintaining the market’s many  important roles:  as a risk-free benchmark for financial instruments; as a liquid investment and source of safe  collateral; as a channel for the implementation of monetary policy; and, of  course, as a tool to help finance U.S. government activities.\n\nAs the Treasury market continues to  evolve, several complex questions lie ahead.  How should data reporting gaps be closed to ensure that as many relevant Treasury transactions as possible are collected?  What is the proper scope and best process for  sharing Treasury market data with the public?  How can the Joint Member Agencies and private stakeholders best collaborate to ensure Treasury market stability and efficient market function,  even as market structure evolves and new technologies emerge?  What considerations need to be made regarding Treasury market clearance practices given the growth in activity by  participants who are not central counterparty members?  Will the evolving settlement marketplace introduce new challenges to Treasury market participants?  How must practices and culture evolve as  market structure does?  And, how will the  interplay of all of these issues affect the future of the Treasury market?\n\nToday’s conference provides an  excellent opportunity to discuss these issues.  Thank you for coming. I look forward to today’s dialogue and the ongoing  engagement between the Joint Member Agencies and the public as we all strive to ensure the continued sound functioning of this essential marketplace.\n\n1 Joint Staff Report: The U.S. Treasury Market on October 15, 2014 , U.S. Department of the Treasury, Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, U.S. Securities  and Exchange Commission, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, July 13,  2015.\n\n2 Ellen Correia Golay, Frank Keane and Nathaniel Wuerffel assisted in preparing  these remarks.\n\n3 The Joint Member Agencies are the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures  Trading Commission.\n\n4 Best  Practices for Treasury, Agency Debt, and Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities  Markets , Treasury Markets Practices Group, Revised February 2016.\n\n5 Banking  Conduct and Culture , Group of 30, July 2015.\n\n6 Opening  Remarks at Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial Services Industry:  Expanding the Dialogue , William C.

    "text": "Thank you, Deputy Governor Chen,  for the opportunity to speak at this inaugural People’s Bank of China and  Federal Reserve Bank of New York 2016 Joint Symposium.  It is a wonderful occasion for our two  central banks to meet and share ideas on important global macroeconomic and  monetary policy issues.\n\nIt is especially satisfying to  me to be here in Hangzhou to see the result of my discussion last February with  Governor Zhou about this kind of policy and research exchange.  I thank you and the staff of The People’s  Bank of China for developing this idea into such an ambitious work agenda, and  for assembling such a distinguished group of contributors and participants for  this symposium.  We at the New York Fed  look forward to future collaborative efforts to strengthen the relationship  between our two institutions, especially given the key roles that China and the  United States play in the global economy.   By working together I believe we can achieve better outcomes for our  countries and for the global economy.  Today, although I will focus mainly on the  U.S. economic outlook, I also will discuss how global economic and financial  market developments factor into my thinking about U.S. monetary policy.  As always, what I have to say today reflects  my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1 U.S. Economic  Outlook Recent economic and financial  developments have not yet led me to make a fundamental change in my outlook for  U.S. growth in 2016.  At this point, I  have marked down my growth outlook very modestly.  However, financial market conditions have  tightened since the start of the year, mostly in response to international  developments.  If this tightening of  financial conditions were to persist, it could potentially lead to a more  significant downgrade to my outlook. I continue to expect that the  economy will expand over the course of this year at a pace slightly above its  long-term trend—sufficient to push the unemployment rate down a bit further and  to more fully utilize the nation’s labor resources.  On inflation, we continue to fall short of  our 2 percent objective for the personal consumption expenditure (PCE)  deflator.  This shortfall looks likely to  continue longer than I had earlier anticipated due to the persistent strength  of the dollar and weakness in energy prices.   However, I continue to expect a gradual return to our 2 percent  objective as the transitory factors that have held down inflation  dissipate. In assessing the current state  of the U.S. economy, there are divergent signals, with weakness in some  spending and production indicators, but robustness in a number of labor market  indicators.  In the fourth quarter,  investment spending for both equipment and structures fell, and net exports and  inventory investment were drags on growth.   These developments partly reflect the slowing of global growth and the  impact of the dollar’s appreciation since mid-2014.  This weakness has been particularly evident  in U.S. manufacturing.  However, the  latest ISM non-manufacturing index suggests the possibility of a slower pace of  growth also in the services sector, which has been relatively robust.  Consumer spending growth—which had been a  brighter spot for most of 2015—also slowed notably in the fourth quarter. In contrast, the U.S. labor  market has remained healthy and supportive of growth.  Over the course of 2015, payroll employment  increased an average of about 228,000 per month.  Although the January increase of 151,000 was  below last year’s pace, other aspects of the report were strong.  The January data indicated substantial gains  in wages and hours worked, which implies healthy real income growth for the  household sector.  Moreover, the amount  of slack in the labor market continues to diminish based on a number of  measures.  The unemployment rate declined  to 4.9 percent.  This was accompanied by  further declines in both the share of people working part-time that would like  full-time work, as well as the share of people not part of the labor  force.  Consistent with a tighter labor  market, the share of the working-age population that is employed has risen  gradually, and the labor force participation rate has stabilized. While the weakness in some  indicators has led me to make small reductions in my forecast, my overall  outlook has not changed substantially.   In making this determination, a central question is how to reconcile  these cross-currents.  One has to also  factor in that the real GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter was only 1.0 percent and the four-quarter change was 1.9 percent—low even by the subdued  standards of this expansion.  It is  important, though, to recognize that a number of transitory factors held down  growth in the fourth quarter—most notably lower utility spending due to warm  weather and a decline in the rate of inventory investment. As these transitory factors  depressing the pace of economic growth dissipate, the core strengths for the  economy should reassert themselves.  I  anticipate that consumption and housing activity will expand at a moderate  pace.  Continued job and wage gains, as  well as low energy prices, should support real disposable income growth and  consumer spending.  Retail sales in  January provide evidence of this support.   The housing market should remain on a solid trajectory, supported by  rising employment and low mortgage rates.   In addition, the fiscal 2016 budget package passed at the end of last  year, which extended a number of tax breaks and eased caps on spending, means  that fiscal policy should provide a moderate stimulus this year.  I believe that these positive factors should  be sufficient to offset weakness in manufacturing and business-fixed  investment. Putting this all together, I  expect real GDP growth of about 2 percent in 2016, slightly below the average  pace of growth in this expansion, and a bit above my estimate of the potential  growth of the U.S. economy.  If this  materializes, then we should see some further reduction in the unemployment  rate to around my estimate of the rate—about 4¾ percent—that I view as  consistent with stable inflation over the long term. Turning to the outlook for  inflation, headline inflation on a year-over-year basis has begun to rise as  the sharp falls in energy prices in late 2014 and early 2015 are removed from  the calculations.  However, inflation  still remains well below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent objective.  As the FOMC has noted in its statements, this  continued low inflation is partly due to recent further declines in energy  prices and ongoing impacts of a stronger dollar on non-energy import  prices.  Although energy prices will  eventually stop falling and the dollar will stop appreciating, these factors  appear to have had a more persistent depressing influence on inflation than  previously anticipated. This continued period of low  headline inflation is a concern, in part, because it could lead to  significantly lower inflation expectations.   If this drop in inflation expectations were to occur, it would, in turn,  tend to depress future inflation.   Evidence on the inflation expectations front suggests some cause for  concern.  In particular, market-based  measures of longer-term inflation compensation derived from nominal and  inflation-indexed Treasury securities have fallen to very low levels.  In addition, some survey measures of household  inflation expectations have recently moved lower. With respect to the market-based  measures, there are some reasons to discount the decline.  Several   term structure models, including those estimated at the New York Fed,  attribute most of this decline to a decrease in term premiums—what investors  demand for insurance against inflation risks—and not to a decrease in long-term  inflation expectations.  These models  suggest that, over the indicated horizon, investors anticipate that low growth  will occur along with low inflation.   Still, given the extent to which inflation compensation has fallen since  mid-2014, I believe that it is prudent to consider the possibility that  longer-term inflation expectations of market participants may have declined  somewhat. What I find more concerning is  the decline in some household survey measures of longer-term inflation  expectations.  For example, the median of  three-year expectations from the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations  has declined over the past year to its lowest reading in the survey’s short  history, and the longer-running University of Michigan measure is at the bottom  of its historical range.  Further  declines in either measure would be worrisome.   To date, these declines have not been sufficiently large for me to  conclude that inflation expectations have become unanchored.  However, these developments merit close  scrutiny, as past experience shows that it is difficult to push inflation back  up to the central bank’s objective if inflation expectations fall meaningfully  below that objective.  Japan’s experience  is cautionary in this regard. In sum, I still anticipate that  the combination of decreasing resource slack and anchored longer-term inflation  expectations will contribute to inflation rising to our 2 percent objective  over the medium term.  Even so, because  of the more persistent effects of energy and commodity price declines and U.S.  dollar appreciation, the return of inflation to that goal may be slower than I  earlier anticipated.  This does not deny  the possibility of some upside surprise―such as a sharp upswing in wage growth  triggered by low unemployment.  But, on  balance, I am somewhat less confident than I was before.  Partly, this reflects my assessment that  uncertainty to the outlook has increased and that downside risks have crept up,  a topic to which I now turn. Assessment of  Risks to the Outlook The forecast that I have just  described is my best assessment of how the U.S. economy will evolve over  2016.  But there is uncertainty and risk  relative to this baseline forecast, which also needs to be taken into  consideration in assessing the implications of the outlook for monetary policy. There are two key considerations  to this risk assessment.  First, are the  perceived uncertainties about the forecast higher, lower or about average as  compared to the past?  Second, are the  risks symmetric around the baseline forecast or skewed upward or downward?  The level of uncertainty is important in that  it relates to the expected magnitude of forecast errors. The balance of risks  is important in that it relates to the expected sign of those forecast errors. At the New York Fed, we use  surveys, internal models and judgment in forming our risk assessment.  Some surveys, such as the U.S. Survey of  Professional Forecasters (SPF), ask respondents for both point and density  forecasts.  The density forecasts take  the form of respondents filling out a histogram of their probability  assessments that the forecasted outcome will fall into given intervals.  These histograms can be aggregated and the  resulting aggregate distribution can be used to assess both the level of  uncertainty as well as the balance of risks.   Recent U.S. SPF surveys have not indicated any significant changes in  the overall degree of uncertainty around growth or inflation.  The balance of risks have been roughly  symmetric for inflation and tilted to the downside for growth. We supplement this survey  evidence with assessments from internal models.   These models are data-driven and estimate percentiles of the  distribution of possible forecast outcomes for growth and inflation.  Our estimated models have indicated a greater  degree of uncertainty than reflected in the U.S. SPF, and suggest downside risk  to both the growth and inflation forecast.   But, I would caution that these models are still relatively new in terms  of their development and their results need to be supplemented by judgment. Now, putting these inputs and my  judgment together, I see the uncertainties around my forecast to be greater  than the typical levels of the past.   This assessment reflects the divergent economic signals I highlighted  earlier, and is consistent with the turbulence we have seen in global financial  markets.  At this moment, I judge that  the balance of risks to my growth and inflation outlooks may be starting to  tilt slightly to the downside.  The  recent tightening of financial market conditions could have a greater negative  impact on the U.S. economy should this tightening prove persistent and the  continuing decline in energy and commodity prices may signal greater and more  persistent disinflationary pressures in the global economy than I currently anticipate.  I am closely monitoring global economic and  financial market developments to assess their implications for my outlook and  the balance of risks. U.S. Monetary  Policy in a Global Environment Thus far, my remarks have  focused on the U.S. outlook and the risks relative to this outlook.  This focus is appropriate.  Like other central banks, our monetary policy  mandate concerns domestic objectives: maximum sustainable employment and price  stability.  Our monetary policy actions,  however, often have global consequences that, in turn, influence the U.S.  economy and financial markets.  At the  same time, external factors can impact the monetary policy transmission  mechanism in the U.S. and influence the effectiveness of our monetary policy in  achieving our objectives.  We cannot  appropriately calibrate policy without keeping these spillover and feedback  effects in mind. In some cases, these effects can  be significant.  An example is the market  volatility we saw in the spring and summer of 2013 during the so-called “taper  tantrum.”  In the U.S., we saw a spike in  Treasury yields, with the 10-year rate rising by more than 100 basis points  from early May of that year before peaking in September.  Financial markets in emerging market economies  (EME) were hit hard as well, with declines in equity prices, a widening in  sovereign debt spreads and a sharp increase in foreign exchange  volatility. Volatility in EME financial  markets reemerged last summer and has continued into this year.  For EMEs as a group, declines in equity  prices and currency values have been larger than what we experienced during the  taper tantrum.  The recent episode,  however, appears to largely reflect concerns about risks emanating from EMEs  themselves, rather than concerns about the direction of Fed policy. Three related concerns appear to  be at the forefront.  First, there has  been a broad-based slowdown in EME growth.   This slowdown is not new.  Each  year since 2012, EME growth has come in well short of expectations that existed  at the start of the year.  It is  difficult, however, for market participants to recognize and adjust to large  structural shifts in real time.  There is  still considerable uncertainty about the trajectory of long-term EME growth,  and therefore the appropriate pricing of EME financial assets.  In that context, heightened market volatility  is not surprising. Second, this slowdown in EME  growth is happening after a long upswing in credit expansion in these  countries.  Based on BIS data for 23 of  the largest EMEs, since the end of 2007 credit to their private nonfinancial  sectors has risen from roughly 80 to 135 percent of GDP.  In several countries, the increase in private  credit penetration exceeds 40 percent of GDP—roughly the same order of  magnitude that we witnessed in other periods that preceded financial  crises.  Although the magnitude of the  EME credit boom has been apparent for some time, with EME growth now on a more  subdued trajectory and the global financial environment less forgiving, market  participants have begun to sharpen their focus on the risk of larger than  expected credit losses as the credit cycle reverses. Third, China has entered a  period of economic transition, from a growth model based on investment,  manufacturing and rapid state-directed credit growth to one emphasizing  consumption, services and more sustainable market-directed credit  intermediation.  This transition also  involves a downshift in China’s trend growth rate, which is inevitable given the  level of economic development in China and the shrinking margin of  underutilized labor market resources.   Economic transitions are always difficult to manage, and invariably  present policymakers with unexpected challenges.  It is not surprising, then, that market  participants are focused on the risk that the downshift in Chinese growth could  prove to be more pronounced than anticipated.   I want to be clear.  The  rebalancing process now underway in China is both necessary and appropriate,  and will unfold over a period of years.   How to pragmatically strike the best balance between progress on  long-term reform and support for short-term growth is, of course, a matter for  policymakers in China.  You can be sure  that you will have the backing of the official international community as you  oversee this important transformation. Finally, the slowdown in Chinese  and broader EME growth has been a key factor behind the sharp drop in global  commodity prices since mid-2014.  The  income streams accruing to commodity export countries have been adversely impacted,  requiring sometimes painful downward adjustments in investment and economic  activity in these countries.  Here, too,  it may take time for markets to find a new equilibrium, as investment projects  that were based on the price structure prevailing a few years ago are still  coming online. In most cases, EMEs appear to  have the tools and the resources to help manage their way through the current  period of difficulties.  There are fewer  of the pegged exchange rate regimes that often came violently undone during  past periods of acute market stress.   Monetary policy regimes are generally better structured and more  coherent.  Banking systems are better  capitalized and supported by stronger regulatory and supervisory  frameworks.  Foreign exchange reserve  cushions are larger and generally still ample.   I think we can remain cautiously optimistic about EMEs’ prospects  overall in the years ahead, although particular countries will face  considerable challenges over the near term. How will we at the Fed take in and  respond to these developments?  As I’ve  already noted, foreign developments factor into our assessment of the U.S.  outlook.  Recent FOMC statements have  sometimes made this connection explicit, noting that the Committee will be  monitoring foreign economic and financial conditions closely.  The weakness we have been seeing in EME  economies and markets is one of the considerations behind the Committee’s  assessment that the appropriate pace of policy normalization is likely to be  gradual. The federal funds rate is only  one element of the broader set of financial conditions affecting the U.S.  growth and inflation outlook.  Tighter  financial conditions abroad do spill back into the U.S. economy, and  policymakers must take this into account in their assessment of appropriate  monetary policy.  Of course, this does  not mean that we will let market volatility dictate our policy stance.  There is no such a thing as a “Fed put.”  What we care about is the country’s growth  and inflation prospects, and we take financial market developments into  consideration only to the extent that they affect the economic outlook. Our focus on the global  implications of our policies also has a broader dimension.  Given the central place of U.S. markets in  the global financial system and the dollar’s status as the leading global  reserve currency, we in the United States have a special responsibility to be  good stewards of the global economic commons.   This makes it all the more important that we conduct policy  transparently and according to clear principles. This highlights the importance  of effective Fed communication.  I noted  earlier our attempts in the spring of 2013 to provide guidance about the  potential timing and pace of tapering may have served to confuse market  participants.  Market participants seemed  to conflate the prospective tapering of asset purchases with monetary policy  tightening, and pulled forward their expectations about the likely timing of  liftoff, thus raising their expected path for the federal funds rate.  Since then, we have adjusted our approach with  improved results.  The actual tapering of  the Fed’s asset purchase program went smoothly and liftoff of our policy rate  from the zero lower bound was in line with widely held market  expectations.  While the future path of  policy is not on a pre-set course and must remain data dependent, we will  strive to be similarly effective in our communications going forward. As you know, we’ve taken a  number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve our  communications.  This includes regular  press conferences by the Fed chair following FOMC meetings; the publishing of  growth, inflation, unemployment and federal funds rate projections by FOMC  participants; a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will  look at to assess progress toward our mandate; and an equally concerted attempt  to lay out how our various policy tools―such as interest on reserves, overnight  reverse repurchase (ON RRP) operations and reinvestment of principal payments from  our asset holdings—will be used to pursue our objectives. We are also working to be better  stewards in safeguarding financial stability.   Simply put, we failed to act early enough and decisively enough to stem  the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and Great Recession.  The U.S. was not alone in this shortcoming,  but, given our position in the global financial system, we should have done  better.  We’ve taken important steps  through new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory  and supervisory framework.  In  particular, systemically important banking organizations must now hold capital  and liquidity buffers that are better aligned with their risk profiles.  Many other changes have also been  implemented, such as the central clearing of standardized over-the-counter  (OTC) derivatives contracts, which should help make the global financial system  more resilient and robust. While these efforts remain a  work in progress, I think they will reduce the risk of repeating the mistakes  of the past decade, and enable us to take a more proactive stance toward  addressing potential future vulnerabilities.   Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here.  Since the financial crisis, central banks  worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how better to fulfill  their mandates. Let me close with a final  thought.  Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations introduced the concept  of the “invisible hand.”  Smith argued  that individuals acting in their self-interest can collectively promote the  public interest.  This concept, I  believe, also often applies to international monetary policy. 2 The biggest problems that countries create for  others often stem from getting policy wrong domestically.  Recession or instability at home is often  quickly exported abroad.  Equally  important, growth and stability abroad makes it easier to set policy at home.  Central banks, therefore, by individually  acting on their domestic economy mandates, can collectively promote the global  economy. Thank you for your kind  attention. 1 Matthew Higgins, Jonathan McCarthy,  Paolo Pesenti and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks. 2 There are important exceptions of course.   Two noteworthy exceptions include “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies in  which countries engage in unilateral competitive currency devaluation and trade  protectionism.\n\nU.S. Economic  Outlook Recent economic and financial  developments have not yet led me to make a fundamental change in my outlook for  U.S. growth in 2016.  At this point, I  have marked down my growth outlook very modestly.  However, financial market conditions have  tightened since the start of the year, mostly in response to international  developments.  If this tightening of  financial conditions were to persist, it could potentially lead to a more  significant downgrade to my outlook.\n\nI continue to expect that the  economy will expand over the course of this year at a pace slightly above its  long-term trend—sufficient to push the unemployment rate down a bit further and  to more fully utilize the nation’s labor resources.  On inflation, we continue to fall short of  our 2 percent objective for the personal consumption expenditure (PCE)  deflator.  This shortfall looks likely to  continue longer than I had earlier anticipated due to the persistent strength  of the dollar and weakness in energy prices.   However, I continue to expect a gradual return to our 2 percent  objective as the transitory factors that have held down inflation  dissipate.\n\nIn assessing the current state  of the U.S. economy, there are divergent signals, with weakness in some  spending and production indicators, but robustness in a number of labor market  indicators.  In the fourth quarter,  investment spending for both equipment and structures fell, and net exports and  inventory investment were drags on growth.   These developments partly reflect the slowing of global growth and the  impact of the dollar’s appreciation since mid-2014.  This weakness has been particularly evident  in U.S. manufacturing.  However, the  latest ISM non-manufacturing index suggests the possibility of a slower pace of  growth also in the services sector, which has been relatively robust.  Consumer spending growth—which had been a  brighter spot for most of 2015—also slowed notably in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. labor  market has remained healthy and supportive of growth.  Over the course of 2015, payroll employment  increased an average of about 228,000 per month.  Although the January increase of 151,000 was  below last year’s pace, other aspects of the report were strong.  The January data indicated substantial gains  in wages and hours worked, which implies healthy real income growth for the  household sector.  Moreover, the amount  of slack in the labor market continues to diminish based on a number of  measures.  The unemployment rate declined  to 4.9 percent.  This was accompanied by  further declines in both the share of people working part-time that would like  full-time work, as well as the share of people not part of the labor  force.  Consistent with a tighter labor  market, the share of the working-age population that is employed has risen  gradually, and the labor force participation rate has stabilized.\n\nWhile the weakness in some  indicators has led me to make small reductions in my forecast, my overall  outlook has not changed substantially.   In making this determination, a central question is how to reconcile  these cross-currents.  One has to also  factor in that the real GDP growth rate in the fourth quarter was only 1.0 percent and the four-quarter change was 1.9 percent—low even by the subdued  standards of this expansion.  It is  important, though, to recognize that a number of transitory factors held down  growth in the fourth quarter—most notably lower utility spending due to warm  weather and a decline in the rate of inventory investment.\n\nAs these transitory factors  depressing the pace of economic growth dissipate, the core strengths for the  economy should reassert themselves.  I  anticipate that consumption and housing activity will expand at a moderate  pace.  Continued job and wage gains, as  well as low energy prices, should support real disposable income growth and  consumer spending.  Retail sales in  January provide evidence of this support.   The housing market should remain on a solid trajectory, supported by  rising employment and low mortgage rates.   In addition, the fiscal 2016 budget package passed at the end of last  year, which extended a number of tax breaks and eased caps on spending, means  that fiscal policy should provide a moderate stimulus this year.  I believe that these positive factors should  be sufficient to offset weakness in manufacturing and business-fixed  investment.\n\nPutting this all together, I  expect real GDP growth of about 2 percent in 2016, slightly below the average  pace of growth in this expansion, and a bit above my estimate of the potential  growth of the U.S. economy.  If this  materializes, then we should see some further reduction in the unemployment  rate to around my estimate of the rate—about 4¾ percent—that I view as  consistent with stable inflation over the long term.\n\nTurning to the outlook for  inflation, headline inflation on a year-over-year basis has begun to rise as  the sharp falls in energy prices in late 2014 and early 2015 are removed from  the calculations.  However, inflation  still remains well below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent objective.  As the FOMC has noted in its statements, this  continued low inflation is partly due to recent further declines in energy  prices and ongoing impacts of a stronger dollar on non-energy import  prices.  Although energy prices will  eventually stop falling and the dollar will stop appreciating, these factors  appear to have had a more persistent depressing influence on inflation than  previously anticipated.\n\nThis continued period of low  headline inflation is a concern, in part, because it could lead to  significantly lower inflation expectations.   If this drop in inflation expectations were to occur, it would, in turn,  tend to depress future inflation.   Evidence on the inflation expectations front suggests some cause for  concern.  In particular, market-based  measures of longer-term inflation compensation derived from nominal and  inflation-indexed Treasury securities have fallen to very low levels.  In addition, some survey measures of household  inflation expectations have recently moved lower.\n\nWith respect to the market-based  measures, there are some reasons to discount the decline.  Several   term structure models, including those estimated at the New York Fed,  attribute most of this decline to a decrease in term premiums—what investors  demand for insurance against inflation risks—and not to a decrease in long-term  inflation expectations.  These models  suggest that, over the indicated horizon, investors anticipate that low growth  will occur along with low inflation.   Still, given the extent to which inflation compensation has fallen since  mid-2014, I believe that it is prudent to consider the possibility that  longer-term inflation expectations of market participants may have declined  somewhat.\n\nWhat I find more concerning is  the decline in some household survey measures of longer-term inflation  expectations.  For example, the median of  three-year expectations from the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations  has declined over the past year to its lowest reading in the survey’s short  history, and the longer-running University of Michigan measure is at the bottom  of its historical range.  Further  declines in either measure would be worrisome.   To date, these declines have not been sufficiently large for me to  conclude that inflation expectations have become unanchored.  However, these developments merit close  scrutiny, as past experience shows that it is difficult to push inflation back  up to the central bank’s objective if inflation expectations fall meaningfully  below that objective.  Japan’s experience  is cautionary in this regard.\n\nIn sum, I still anticipate that  the combination of decreasing resource slack and anchored longer-term inflation  expectations will contribute to inflation rising to our 2 percent objective  over the medium term.  Even so, because  of the more persistent effects of energy and commodity price declines and U.S.  dollar appreciation, the return of inflation to that goal may be slower than I  earlier anticipated.  This does not deny  the possibility of some upside surprise―such as a sharp upswing in wage growth  triggered by low unemployment.  But, on  balance, I am somewhat less confident than I was before.  Partly, this reflects my assessment that  uncertainty to the outlook has increased and that downside risks have crept up,  a topic to which I now turn.\n\nAssessment of  Risks to the Outlook The forecast that I have just  described is my best assessment of how the U.S. economy will evolve over  2016.  But there is uncertainty and risk  relative to this baseline forecast, which also needs to be taken into  consideration in assessing the implications of the outlook for monetary policy. There are two key considerations  to this risk assessment.  First, are the  perceived uncertainties about the forecast higher, lower or about average as  compared to the past?  Second, are the  risks symmetric around the baseline forecast or skewed upward or downward?  The level of uncertainty is important in that  it relates to the expected magnitude of forecast errors. The balance of risks  is important in that it relates to the expected sign of those forecast errors.\n\nAt the New York Fed, we use  surveys, internal models and judgment in forming our risk assessment.  Some surveys, such as the U.S. Survey of  Professional Forecasters (SPF), ask respondents for both point and density  forecasts.  The density forecasts take  the form of respondents filling out a histogram of their probability  assessments that the forecasted outcome will fall into given intervals.  These histograms can be aggregated and the  resulting aggregate distribution can be used to assess both the level of  uncertainty as well as the balance of risks.   Recent U.S. SPF surveys have not indicated any significant changes in  the overall degree of uncertainty around growth or inflation.  The balance of risks have been roughly  symmetric for inflation and tilted to the downside for growth.\n\nWe supplement this survey  evidence with assessments from internal models.   These models are data-driven and estimate percentiles of the  distribution of possible forecast outcomes for growth and inflation.  Our estimated models have indicated a greater  degree of uncertainty than reflected in the U.S. SPF, and suggest downside risk  to both the growth and inflation forecast.   But, I would caution that these models are still relatively new in terms  of their development and their results need to be supplemented by judgment.\n\nNow, putting these inputs and my  judgment together, I see the uncertainties around my forecast to be greater  than the typical levels of the past.   This assessment reflects the divergent economic signals I highlighted  earlier, and is consistent with the turbulence we have seen in global financial  markets.  At this moment, I judge that  the balance of risks to my growth and inflation outlooks may be starting to  tilt slightly to the downside.  The  recent tightening of financial market conditions could have a greater negative  impact on the U.S. economy should this tightening prove persistent and the  continuing decline in energy and commodity prices may signal greater and more  persistent disinflationary pressures in the global economy than I currently anticipate.  I am closely monitoring global economic and  financial market developments to assess their implications for my outlook and  the balance of risks.\n\nU.S. Monetary  Policy in a Global Environment Thus far, my remarks have  focused on the U.S. outlook and the risks relative to this outlook.  This focus is appropriate.  Like other central banks, our monetary policy  mandate concerns domestic objectives: maximum sustainable employment and price  stability.  Our monetary policy actions,  however, often have global consequences that, in turn, influence the U.S.  economy and financial markets.  At the  same time, external factors can impact the monetary policy transmission  mechanism in the U.S. and influence the effectiveness of our monetary policy in  achieving our objectives.  We cannot  appropriately calibrate policy without keeping these spillover and feedback  effects in mind.\n\nIn some cases, these effects can  be significant.  An example is the market  volatility we saw in the spring and summer of 2013 during the so-called “taper  tantrum.”  In the U.S., we saw a spike in  Treasury yields, with the 10-year rate rising by more than 100 basis points  from early May of that year before peaking in September.  Financial markets in emerging market economies  (EME) were hit hard as well, with declines in equity prices, a widening in  sovereign debt spreads and a sharp increase in foreign exchange  volatility.\n\nVolatility in EME financial  markets reemerged last summer and has continued into this year.  For EMEs as a group, declines in equity  prices and currency values have been larger than what we experienced during the  taper tantrum.  The recent episode,  however, appears to largely reflect concerns about risks emanating from EMEs  themselves, rather than concerns about the direction of Fed policy.\n\nThree related concerns appear to  be at the forefront.  First, there has  been a broad-based slowdown in EME growth.   This slowdown is not new.  Each  year since 2012, EME growth has come in well short of expectations that existed  at the start of the year.  It is  difficult, however, for market participants to recognize and adjust to large  structural shifts in real time.  There is  still considerable uncertainty about the trajectory of long-term EME growth,  and therefore the appropriate pricing of EME financial assets.  In that context, heightened market volatility  is not surprising.\n\nSecond, this slowdown in EME  growth is happening after a long upswing in credit expansion in these  countries.  Based on BIS data for 23 of  the largest EMEs, since the end of 2007 credit to their private nonfinancial  sectors has risen from roughly 80 to 135 percent of GDP.  In several countries, the increase in private  credit penetration exceeds 40 percent of GDP—roughly the same order of  magnitude that we witnessed in other periods that preceded financial  crises.  Although the magnitude of the  EME credit boom has been apparent for some time, with EME growth now on a more  subdued trajectory and the global financial environment less forgiving, market  participants have begun to sharpen their focus on the risk of larger than  expected credit losses as the credit cycle reverses.\n\nThird, China has entered a  period of economic transition, from a growth model based on investment,  manufacturing and rapid state-directed credit growth to one emphasizing  consumption, services and more sustainable market-directed credit  intermediation.  This transition also  involves a downshift in China’s trend growth rate, which is inevitable given the  level of economic development in China and the shrinking margin of  underutilized labor market resources.   Economic transitions are always difficult to manage, and invariably  present policymakers with unexpected challenges.  It is not surprising, then, that market  participants are focused on the risk that the downshift in Chinese growth could  prove to be more pronounced than anticipated.   I want to be clear.  The  rebalancing process now underway in China is both necessary and appropriate,  and will unfold over a period of years.   How to pragmatically strike the best balance between progress on  long-term reform and support for short-term growth is, of course, a matter for  policymakers in China.  You can be sure  that you will have the backing of the official international community as you  oversee this important transformation.\n\nFinally, the slowdown in Chinese  and broader EME growth has been a key factor behind the sharp drop in global  commodity prices since mid-2014.  The  income streams accruing to commodity export countries have been adversely impacted,  requiring sometimes painful downward adjustments in investment and economic  activity in these countries.  Here, too,  it may take time for markets to find a new equilibrium, as investment projects  that were based on the price structure prevailing a few years ago are still  coming online.\n\nIn most cases, EMEs appear to  have the tools and the resources to help manage their way through the current  period of difficulties.  There are fewer  of the pegged exchange rate regimes that often came violently undone during  past periods of acute market stress.   Monetary policy regimes are generally better structured and more  coherent.  Banking systems are better  capitalized and supported by stronger regulatory and supervisory  frameworks.  Foreign exchange reserve  cushions are larger and generally still ample.   I think we can remain cautiously optimistic about EMEs’ prospects  overall in the years ahead, although particular countries will face  considerable challenges over the near term.\n\nHow will we at the Fed take in and  respond to these developments?  As I’ve  already noted, foreign developments factor into our assessment of the U.S.  outlook.  Recent FOMC statements have  sometimes made this connection explicit, noting that the Committee will be  monitoring foreign economic and financial conditions closely.  The weakness we have been seeing in EME  economies and markets is one of the considerations behind the Committee’s  assessment that the appropriate pace of policy normalization is likely to be  gradual.\n\nThe federal funds rate is only  one element of the broader set of financial conditions affecting the U.S.  growth and inflation outlook.  Tighter  financial conditions abroad do spill back into the U.S. economy, and  policymakers must take this into account in their assessment of appropriate  monetary policy.  Of course, this does  not mean that we will let market volatility dictate our policy stance.  There is no such a thing as a “Fed put.”  What we care about is the country’s growth  and inflation prospects, and we take financial market developments into  consideration only to the extent that they affect the economic outlook.\n\nOur focus on the global  implications of our policies also has a broader dimension.  Given the central place of U.S. markets in  the global financial system and the dollar’s status as the leading global  reserve currency, we in the United States have a special responsibility to be  good stewards of the global economic commons.   This makes it all the more important that we conduct policy  transparently and according to clear principles.\n\nThis highlights the importance  of effective Fed communication.  I noted  earlier our attempts in the spring of 2013 to provide guidance about the  potential timing and pace of tapering may have served to confuse market  participants.  Market participants seemed  to conflate the prospective tapering of asset purchases with monetary policy  tightening, and pulled forward their expectations about the likely timing of  liftoff, thus raising their expected path for the federal funds rate.  Since then, we have adjusted our approach with  improved results.  The actual tapering of  the Fed’s asset purchase program went smoothly and liftoff of our policy rate  from the zero lower bound was in line with widely held market  expectations.  While the future path of  policy is not on a pre-set course and must remain data dependent, we will  strive to be similarly effective in our communications going forward.\n\nAs you know, we’ve taken a  number of steps in recent years to increase transparency and improve our  communications.  This includes regular  press conferences by the Fed chair following FOMC meetings; the publishing of  growth, inflation, unemployment and federal funds rate projections by FOMC  participants; a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will  look at to assess progress toward our mandate; and an equally concerted attempt  to lay out how our various policy tools―such as interest on reserves, overnight  reverse repurchase (ON RRP) operations and reinvestment of principal payments from  our asset holdings—will be used to pursue our objectives.\n\nWe are also working to be better  stewards in safeguarding financial stability.   Simply put, we failed to act early enough and decisively enough to stem  the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and Great Recession.  The U.S. was not alone in this shortcoming,  but, given our position in the global financial system, we should have done  better.  We’ve taken important steps  through new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory  and supervisory framework.  In  particular, systemically important banking organizations must now hold capital  and liquidity buffers that are better aligned with their risk profiles.  Many other changes have also been  implemented, such as the central clearing of standardized over-the-counter  (OTC) derivatives contracts, which should help make the global financial system  more resilient and robust.\n\nWhile these efforts remain a  work in progress, I think they will reduce the risk of repeating the mistakes  of the past decade, and enable us to take a more proactive stance toward  addressing potential future vulnerabilities.   Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here.  Since the financial crisis, central banks  worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how better to fulfill  their mandates.\n\nLet me close with a final  thought.  Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations introduced the concept  of the “invisible hand.”  Smith argued  that individuals acting in their self-interest can collectively promote the  public interest.  This concept, I  believe, also often applies to international monetary policy. 2 The biggest problems that countries create for  others often stem from getting policy wrong domestically.  Recession or instability at home is often  quickly exported abroad.  Equally  important, growth and stability abroad makes it easier to set policy at home.  Central banks, therefore, by individually  acting on their domestic economy mandates, can collectively promote the global  economy.\n\nThank you for your kind  attention.\n\n1 Matthew Higgins, Jonathan McCarthy,  Paolo Pesenti and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 There are important exceptions of course.   Two noteworthy exceptions include “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies in  which countries engage in unilateral competitive currency devaluation and trade  protectionism.",

    "text": "I am very pleased to be here and to  have this opportunity to speak with representatives of Puerto Rico’s business  and academic communities.  In my remarks,  I will discuss the lessons learned from municipalities in the United States  that have faced crises over the years―such as New York City―and what those  outcomes might imply for Puerto Rico as it seeks to restore and sustain  economic growth.  I will also touch  briefly on the Puerto Rico Small Business Survey , a new survey from the New York Fed that focuses on the  business performance, financing needs and borrowing experiences of firms across  the Island.  As always, what I have to  say reflects my own views and not those of the Federal Open Market Committee or  the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nMy meeting with you today is part  of the New York Fed’s continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the  grassroots level within our Federal Reserve district.  We plan these trips so we can interact with a  diverse group of stakeholders.  These  meetings help me get a more complete picture of economic conditions on the  Island and a fuller understanding of the major issues and concerns.  This is the third time we have visited Puerto  Rico in the past five years.\n\nYesterday, I met with  Governor-elect Rosselló to discuss the transition into his new role and the key  challenges for his upcoming term.  I also  spent time with members of El Colaboratorio, a shared workspace organized by  the Foundation for Puerto Rico.  I  attended a roundtable discussion with local businesses and spoke with former  and current members of several of the New York Fed’s advisory councils.\n\nEarlier this morning, I met with  the heads of a number of financial institutions and the University of Puerto  Rico’s interim president, Celeste Freytes.   Following this visit, I will meet with the leadership from Parallel18,  an economic development initiative that attracts early-stage, high-potential  startups to Puerto Rico.  Finally, I will  join the leadership of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Puerto Rico for a discussion  on the organization’s initiatives and a site visit to one of the clubs to learn  about workforce development programs and youth services.\n\nAs we all know, the Commonwealth of  Puerto Rico has been through a very rough 10 years.  The economy has been in a long slump that  could easily be called a depression.   Residents have endured a terrible drought, periodic blackouts and a  fiscal crisis.  I don’t need to elaborate  on all of the struggles Puerto Rico continues to face.  The Island has been suffering from a vicious  cycle.  As employment declines, people  move to the mainland to find jobs.   Accordingly, economic activity and tax revenues decline, forcing the  government to raise taxes and cut spending, which further reduces employment  and prompts still more residents to move.   At this point, the outlook for anyone who has been living here must be  bleak, and it may be hard to imagine this situation turning around anytime  soon.  And yet, history tells us that a  turnaround, though not inevitable, is indeed achievable.\n\nLessons from Past  Crises\n\nNew York City is probably the most  famous example of a municipality that experienced a major fiscal crisis,  recovered and is now thriving.  New York  City’s experience is viewed, in retrospect, as a major success, and some, including  myself, have pointed to it as a hopeful example of what could come to pass in  Puerto Rico.  But, there are important  caveats to the New York City story and its applicability to the Commonwealth.\n\nLike Puerto Rico, New York City  experienced a number of years of both political and economic pain as a result  of its fiscal crisis in the 1970s.  On  the political side, New York City residents lost a large measure of their  ability to chart their own fiscal direction for several years.  Decisions about tax and spending policies  were removed from elected city officials.   The Emergency Financial Control Board was empowered to review all fiscal  decisions of local officials and demand changes to the city’s budgets.  Part of the city’s tax base was dedicated to  bond repayment—essentially handing it over to the city’s creditors.  For 10 years, the city could not access the  debt markets without support from the state.\n\nThe economic pain was also very  real.  More than 70,000 city government  workers were cut from the payrolls in 1975 and 1976.  City residents faced dramatic service  reductions—fire houses closed, schools and police precincts had fewer  resources, and crime continued to rise for many years.\n\nIt is also important to note that  New York isn’t the only U.S. city that has been through a major fiscal  crisis.  Cleveland, Philadelphia,  Washington, D.C. and, most recently, Detroit have all struggled to manage their  budgets, and all ultimately reached a point when they were unable to pay their  bills.  As a result, these cities lost  their fiscal autonomy to one degree or another.   In the case of New York City, this turned out relatively well, as the  short-run loss of decision-making power led to a strong economic rebound that  eventually restored the city’s ability to finance its own choices.\n\nSo, is New York City’s experience  really all that instructive for Puerto Rico?   With the advantage of hindsight, it now seems almost obvious that New  York City’s fiscal crisis was only going to be a detour.  The city’s economy had many fundamental  strengths, so it only needed some assistance to get back on track.  Still, it’s worth pointing out that this was  by no means clear at the outset the crisis in the mid-1970s.  Then, many commentators looked at New York  City and other large cities as outmoded forms of economic activity, unlikely  ever to recover.\n\nWhile we do not have great measures  of economic activity for cities, population change is a good indicator of how  attractive a place seems to be.  By that  measure, New York City at the time was seen to have very poor prospects—the  city’s population fell by over 10 percent during the 1970s.  So, New York City’s eventual bright future  was far from clear as its fiscal crisis was unfolding.\n\nOf course, not every city that has  faced a fiscal crisis has the same track record.  Relative to cities that had similarly grim  outlooks, New York City’s rebound has been much stronger.  In Detroit, there are hopeful signs, but it’s  too soon to tell how things will turn out.   Both Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia experienced multiple decades of  population declines leading up to their crises. These population declines  reversed in the 2000s.  Washington,  D.C.’s population actually grew over 5 percent between 2000 and 2010, a rate  even faster than that of New York City.   Cleveland’s fiscal reforms, on the other hand, were less comprehensive,  and the city has never really turned itself around.  Its population in 2010 was less than half the  level of 1960.\n\nThe different performances across  cities reflect the complex interplay of native endowments, economic conditions  and fiscal outcomes.  As in Puerto Rico,  the fiscal woes of many of our largest cities have been closely related to  long-term economic transformations—essentially, changes in the industrial  specialization that occurred in those particular places.  In the case of New York City, the  transformation was from manufacturing to services, and it took a generation to  complete.  The city’s management of that  transition was far from perfect, and the fiscal crisis was the major  manifestation of that failure.  The  institutions set up to respond to the crisis were crucial to ensuring that  fiscal policy didn’t continue to amplify the problems associated with the economic  transition.  For a city to turn its  circumstances around, it must navigate this economic transformation, identify  what will define its comparative advantages going forward, and then build anew  around those sources of strength.\n\nThe Road to Recovery\n\nA successful fiscal reform first  requires a regime in which local officials recognize and accept the reality of  the changing economic situation, and set spending budgets accordingly.  This part is fairly straightforward, because  it produces the simple policy dictum that borrowing—in all its forms—must be  strictly limited.  Of course, knowing  what to do and actually getting it done are different things, especially when  politics are involved.  As a result, the  record suggests that it can be extremely helpful to have some kind of  independent fiscal monitor in place on an ongoing basis.  It’s important that this monitor be insulated  from the direct influence of politics, giving it freedom to deliver objective  analysis that may at times be very unpopular.   In Washington, D.C., this took the form of the Office of the Chief  Financial Officer; in New York City it is the Independent Budget Office, which  is modeled after the Congressional Budget Office.  These monitors have proven invaluable in  keeping policymakers and the public informed on budgetary matters, and in  providing apolitical expertise to assist in keeping budgets on a sustainable  course.\n\nThe second major component is a  successful completion of the economic transformation, which is a critical  factor for reversing―rather than simply halting―a city’s decline, establishing  a virtuous cycle of rising growth and strengthening fiscal outcomes.  New York City had the huge benefit of its  comparative advantage in finance—an industry that was poised for sustained growth  in the post-fiscal-crisis period of the 1980s through the 2000s.  Still, the city weathered a lot of shocks  during that period, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the financial crisis  and Hurricane Sandy.  It’s also worth  pointing out that New York City is still prospering, even though employment in  its finance sector has stagnated.  This  illustrates the need for cities to continually look for new areas of growth,  such as health care, technology, and leisure and hospitality services.\n\nThis is why PROMESA (the Puerto  Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act) emphasizes  long-term growth, and why the New York Fed has been focused on identifying  impediments to the Commonwealth’s growth.   Since 2012, we have released two major reports and several shorter  analyses—most of which appeared in our Liberty Street Economics blog—presenting  ideas that, if implemented, might help to make the Island more competitive and  reverse its economic decline.  These  ideas have ranged from the very narrow and technical to the very broad—from  improving the quality of Commonwealth financial reporting to bolstering growth  through education and job training to build the Island’s human capital.\n\nSince I’ve identified managing the  ongoing economic transformation as a major component of a successful plan for  Puerto Rico, let me summarize a few themes on that front.  Most of these feature an important role for  the Commonwealth’s government, underscoring the fundamental importance of  getting public policy right as a means of restoring economic growth.\n\nFirst, it is important to reduce  the cost of doing business on the Island as a way of encouraging business  growth and increasing the demand for labor.   We have put forward many ideas to consider here, ranging from ones  targeted at hiring—such as giving Puerto Rico more autonomy over setting its  minimum wage policy—to more general ideas like streamlining regulation.  One thing that we’ve repeatedly emphasized is  the need to find efficiencies in the Island’s energy industry.  Commercial customers on the Island pay  roughly 20 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity—nearly double the mainland  average.  Island residents and  businesses, as you are well aware, are also burdened with exceptionally high  water utility bills.  It is also  important to think hard about the supply of labor—the willingness of people to  work, and the education and skills that they have to bring to the market.  Labor supply is equally important, but less  widely discussed than the demand side of the market.  Labor force participation is lower at all  ages in Puerto Rico than on the mainland.   This is a crucial impediment to growth, and addressing it requires  innovative policy options.  One idea to  address this problem would be to extend the Earned Income Tax Credit to Puerto  Rico.  In addition, the structure of the  Commonwealth’s tax system creates disincentives to work in the formal sector,  and suggests that tax reform could produce a growth dividend as well as a more  reliable source of revenue.  On top of  the low labor force participation is the well known and deeply concerning high  level of out-migration.  In addition to  the lack of labor demand, it seems likely that quality-of-life concerns such as  high crime rates are playing a role in these decisions.  This underscores the importance of basic  public service delivery and is another example of the interplay between fiscal  and economic outcomes.\n\nAnother important dimension of  labor supply involves the skills that workers bring to the market.  Many of these skills are acquired while in  school.  Our research indicates that test  scores for school-age children on the Island are low, suggesting that there is  an opportunity for improvement in the quality of public education.  One clear lesson from recent research in  urban and regional economics is that the collective skills of the people living  in an area are a critical ingredient for its growth prospects.  Improving the education available to  residents can pay large dividends over time.\n\nI know that this list seems long,  and none of issues I have raised are easy to address.  Nonetheless, I am confident that Puerto Rico  has started on the road to recovery.  In  the current environment, it’s hard to see beyond the immediate crisis to a  brighter future for Puerto Rico, but that has been said of other places that  have come back stronger than ever.   Getting the fiscal situation in order is an important first step.  The factors leading up to the crisis took  many years to develop, and history shows that a successful recovery from a  crisis also takes time.  It is important  to recognize that fact and to stay the course.\n\nBefore I conclude, let me briefly  discuss our new survey.  Earlier this  month, the New York Fed released the Puerto  Rico Small Business Survey , which focuses on the business  performance, financing needs and borrowing experiences of firms across the  Island.  The survey is intended to fill important knowledge gaps and flag  potential economic growth opportunities for the Commonwealth.  It was designed with input from partners here  in Puerto Rico, and we are very grateful for their cooperation.\n\nKey  findings reveal that firms are persevering through Puerto Rico's economic  crisis, though a majority reported declining revenues.  Managing cash flow is a top concern, ranking  above concerns about rising business costs.   There is significant demand for credit, with the most common reason  being the need to meet operating expenses.   For about half of all small firms, credit needs were under $25,000.  Lastly, about 80 percent of firms do not sell  online or export their wares or services.   Firms see this as a growth opportunity, ranking programs in support of  increasing sales—to the federal government, via online commerce and through  exports—as their top training need.  We  hope that the survey will provide useful insights into a key economic sector  and help inform policy to support Puerto Rico’s recovery.\n\nThank  you for your kind attention.  I would be  happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 Jason Bram, Tony Davis, Andrew Haughwout and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing  these remarks.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the  opportunity to join you again at the Economic Leadership Forum.  I would  like to thank John McWeeney of the New Jersey Bankers Association and Rutgers  University for the invitation to be here today.  Northern New Jersey is a  vital part of the New York Fed’s district, and I don’t just say that because I  live here.  My staff and I actively maintain ties with local community,  business and banking leaders, and we always benefit from opportunities to hear  about what is on your mind.\n\nI am particularly delighted to  see that community banks are well represented here today.  The Federal  Reserve understands the importance of a vibrant community banking sector and  the crucial role community banks play in supporting the activities of local  businesses and households.  While protecting the safety and soundness of  the financial system is an important part of the Federal Reserve’s mandate, I  believe that the regulation of community banks should be appropriately  calibrated to reflect the lower degree of risk they pose to the financial  system relative to larger banks.  In other words, community banks should  not be subject to the same set of regulations that are applied to the most  systemically important banking organizations.\n\nIn my remarks, I will discuss  the U.S. economic outlook and the implications for U.S. monetary policy.  I will focus primarily on last month’s  Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) “lift-off” decision—the first increase in  the federal funds rate target range in nearly 10 years.  I’ll explain what motivated my vote to begin  to normalize U.S. monetary policy.  I’ll  also offer a preliminary assessment of how things are going so far―both  with respect to how the U.S. bond market reacted to lift-off and how well our  new tools are working as we begin to push up short-term interest rates.  Both issues are pertinent, as money market  rates have spent a very long time close to zero and we have never attempted to  tighten monetary policy with such a large balance sheet and high level of excess  reserves.  To summarize my conclusions:  Generally so far, so good on both fronts.\n\nLooking ahead, I’ll talk about  what comes next.  No surprises here—it  depends on the data.  As noted in the  December FOMC statement, we expect that the normalization of monetary policy  will be quite gradual.  But, there is no  commitment here.  The flow of the  data—broadly defined―will drive our actions as it influences our assessment of  the economic outlook and our view of the stance of monetary policy best suited  to achieve our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and  price stability.  As always, what I have  to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the  Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nIn terms of the economic  outlook, the situation does not appear to have changed much since the last FOMC  meeting.  Some recent activity indicators  have been on the softer side, pointing to a relatively weak fourth quarter for  real GDP growth.  But this needs to be  weighed against the strength evident in the U.S. labor market.  I continue to expect that the economy will  expand at a pace slightly above its long-term trend in 2016.  In other words, I anticipate sufficient  economic strength to push the unemployment rate down a bit further and to more  fully utilize the nation’s labor resources.\n\nTurning to inflation, we  continue to fall short of our 2 percent objective for the personal consumption  expenditure (PCE) deflator.  But I take  it as a positive sign that the core PCE inflation rate—that is, excluding food  and energy—has been quite stable despite the downward pressure being exerted by  lower energy prices on the prices of non-energy goods and services, as well as  the drop in non-energy import prices from a firmer dollar.\n\nGoing into more detail, U.S.  economic activity has areas of both strength and weakness.  On the stronger side of the ledger, domestic  demand is doing reasonably well.  In  particular, consumption and housing activity continue to expand at a moderate  pace.  Consumer spending has been  supported by solid real disposable income growth, which has been underpinned,  in turn, by sturdy job gains and falling energy prices.  Residential investment has been slowly  increasing for several years and that trend seems likely to continue in 2016.  Housing starts are still well below the rate  consistent with the nation’s population growth rate, and the fundamentals of  housing demand remain positive.  Rising  employment is likely to boost the household formation rate and low mortgage  interest rates should keep housing relatively affordable, despite the ongoing  recovery in home prices.  Last month’s  passage of a fiscal 2016 budget package should also provide support to economic  activity.  Not only does this budget  package reduce uncertainty about the budgetary outlook, but its extension of a  number of tax breaks and easing of the caps on domestic and military spending  means that fiscal policy in 2016 will likely turn somewhat stimulative.\n\nOn the weaker side, the collapse  in energy prices continues to pull down domestic investment in oil and gas  drilling projects.  Although this  adjustment is now well-advanced, I suspect that there remains a further leg  down given the sector’s diminished cash flows and the reduced access to  credit.  In addition, manufacturing  remains very soft—hurt by the drop in energy-related investment, an ongoing  inventory adjustment and the loss of competitiveness caused by the persistent  strength of the U.S. dollar.  Even the  one bright spot in manufacturing over the past year—the auto sector—seems to be  close to a cyclical peak.  Thus, I  suspect manufacturing will continue to be soft in 2016.  Overseas developments, especially with respect  to the emerging market economies, pose a risk to the U.S. economic  outlook—potentially exerting greater restraint on the demand for U.S. exports  and contributing to greater turbulence in global financial markets.  Putting these positives and negatives  together, the most likely outlook seems to be more of what we have experienced  in this expansion—an economy that grows at slightly above a 2 percent annual  rate this year.\n\nThe inflation outlook also has  not changed much.  Inflation remains well  below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent objective.  In my assessment, this is due mainly to  weaker energy prices and the impact of a stronger dollar on non-energy import  prices.  However, the fact that core  measures of inflation are considerably higher than the headline readings, and  have been quite stable in recent months, suggests to me that we are likely to  see inflation rise once energy prices stop falling and the dollar stops  appreciating—clearly neither trend can persist indefinitely.  Of course, this assumes that the U.S. economy  grows sufficiently rapidly so that pressure on available labor and capital  resources continues to increase.\n\nWith respect to the risks to the  inflation outlook, the most concerning is the possibility that inflation  expectations become unanchored to the downside.   This would be problematic were it to occur because inflation expectations  are an important driver of actual inflation.   If inflation expectations become unanchored to the downside, it would  become much more difficult to push inflation back up to the central bank’s  objective.  Japan’s difficult experience  indicates the importance of avoiding such an outcome.\n\nFor this reason, we closely  monitor inflation expectations.   Inflation measured by the PCE deflator has been running below the FOMC’s  objective since May 2012.  A concern is  whether these persistent underruns in inflation may be beginning to weigh on  inflation expectations.  Some surveys of  inflation expectations have softened recently.   For example, the University of Michigan measure of median long-term  household inflation expectations—that is, expected inflation at a five-to  ten-year horizon—is currently at 2.6 percent.   This is near the very bottom end of its range over the past two  decades.\n\nThe New York Fed’s Survey of  Consumer Expectations also shows softness.   The median of 3-year inflation expectations has declined over the past  year, falling by 22 basis points to 2.8 percent.  While the magnitude of this decline is small,  I think it is noteworthy because the current reading is below where we have  been during the survey history.  Up until  July 2014, the median largely stayed in the range from 3.2 to 3.4 percent, and  from July 2014 to July 2015 it remained near 3 percent.\n\nWhile it has a short history, I  put more weight on the New York Fed’s survey because its methodology should be  more robust in accurately assessing consumer inflation expectations.  Compared to the more widely followed  University of Michigan survey, for example, the New York Fed survey has several  advantages.  The sample size is larger,  most of the people that are interviewed are the same each month, and the  inflation expectations question is posed differently to focus the respondent’s  attention on inflation rather than on prices.   We believe that all these factors lead to a more reliable estimate of  inflation expectations.\n\nObviously, I didn’t think the  degree of weakness we have seen in our survey measure of inflation expectations  was of sufficient concern to defer the start of monetary policy  normalization.  And, as long as the  economy continues to grow at an above-trend pace, I expect the increase in  resource utilization will be sufficient to push both inflation and inflation  expectations higher over time.  That  said, should the economy unexpectedly weaken, then this fall in inflation expectations  would become more concerning.\n\nAssuming, as I anticipate, that  inflation does move back towards our 2 percent target, I am often asked how  tolerant would I be of an overshoot?   In  other words, is the 2 percent inflation target a ceiling or not?  I don’t think of the 2 percent objective as a  ceiling.  I would be equally intolerant  of misses relative to 2 percent in both directions, above or below, with my  intolerance growing the further we deviated from our 2 percent objective.  We will almost certainly never be precisely  at our 2 percent objective for any length of time given all the forces—many of  which are not under our control—that influence actual inflation outcomes over a  business cycle.  Thus, with a neutral  monetary policy, my goal would be to spend about the same amount of time  slightly above as slightly below our 2 percent objective.\n\nTurning now to U.S. monetary  policy, why did I favor raising the federal funds rate target last month?  Basically, my assessment was that our  conditions for lift-off had been met. Recall, these two conditions were: 1)  further improvement in the labor market that we anticipated would be sustained  in 2016, and 2) greater confidence that inflation would begin to move back  towards our 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term.\n\nThe timing of policy  normalization involves a balancing of risks.  I don’t disagree with our critics that there were  risks from lifting off in December versus waiting a little longer.  First, the economy might turn out to be more  fragile than we anticipate, or economic shocks could push the economy  off-course relative to our expectations.   In other words, our economic projections might be too optimistic.  Second, the first tightening move might  itself provoke another taper tantrum characterized by higher bond yields and  tighter financial market conditions that could be sufficiently strong to impede  the economic recovery.\n\nMy judgment was that these risks  were manageable.  First, downside  forecast errors are certainly possible, but the U.S. economy appears to be on  sufficiently sound footing to withstand downside shocks better than was the  case a few years ago.  Second, I felt  that the likelihood of a substantial tightening in financial market conditions  due to lift-off was relatively low, in part, because the rate hike was widely  anticipated.  Market conditions had  adjusted quite smoothly—except for some strains observed in the high-yield debt  market—as market participants placed higher odds of tightening in the weeks  preceding the December FOMC meeting.   This reinforced that conclusion.   A large market reaction would have been a surprise given that this was  one of the most anticipated monetary policy events in history.  Also, the policy action needs to be viewed in  context.  While this decision was the  first upward adjustment to short-term rates in nearly 10 years, the actual move  was small—only 25 basis points—which, by itself, should have only a very mild  impact on the overall trajectory of the economy.  As we noted in the FOMC statement and as  Chair Yellen pointed out in her December press conference, even after this rate  hike, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.\n\nMoreover, it is important to  recognize that there are also significant risks from waiting longer to lift  off.  Upside forecast errors are also  certainly possible.   For example, while  the pace of growth has generally been weaker than expected in recent years, the  pace of labor market improvement has generally been stronger.  By waiting, we would increase the risk that  we would need to raise rates more aggressively in the future.  This could unduly threaten the economic  expansion.  In balancing these risks,  relatively “early and slow” seems like a better strategy than “late and  fast”—especially when one is uncertain both about the degree of accommodation  being provided by monetary policy and the level of unemployment consistent with  our price stability mandate.  Because  monetary policy works with a lag, policy normalization needs to begin before  the economy reaches its employment and inflation objectives.  That is, if we are to get to a neutral  monetary policy setting before inflation materially overshoots our 2 percent  objective, then we need to get started.   Once underway, the pace of policy tightening can be calibrated to how  the economy and financial market conditions are responding.\n\nA particular risk of late and  fast is that the unemployment rate could significantly undershoot the level  consistent with price stability.  If this  occurred, then inflation would likely rise above our objective.  At that point, history shows it is very  difficult to push the unemployment rate back up just a little bit in order to  contain inflation pressures.  Looking at  the post-war period, whenever the unemployment rate has increased by more than  0.3 to 0.4 percentage points, the economy has always ended up in a full-blown  recession with the unemployment rate rising by at least 1.9 percentage  points.  This is an outcome to avoid,  especially given that in an economic downturn the last to be hired are often the  first to be fired.  The goal is the  maximum sustainable level of employment—in other words, the most job  opportunities for the most people over the long run.\n\nSome of you may be wondering  whether the risk of a recession isn’t already quite high?  And, if so, doesn’t this imply a need for  special care in adjusting monetary policy?   After all, the current economic expansion is more than six years old—a  bit long in the tooth by post-war standards.\n\nEven so, recession risk did not  play a major factor in my thinking.   Economic expansions don’t simply die of old age.  They primarily end either because monetary  policy is kept too loose for too long, thereby necessitating a subsequent sharp  tightening in monetary policy to prevent a significant inflation overshoot, or  because some large adverse shock hits the economy that the central bank cannot  easily offset.  Mitigating the first risk  of being forced to choke off the expansion argues for getting started with  policy normalization now rather than holding off.  With respect to the second risk of  unanticipated shocks, this is obviously very difficult for the central bank to  insulate the economy from.  Making sure  the financial system is robust and resilient is probably the most important  thing the central bank can do in this respect.\n\nI would like to turn now to the issue of how the initial step in normalization is going.  The U.S. bond market response to lift-off has  been very mild.  There has been no bond  market “taper tantrum” such as what occurred in 2013 when Chairman Bernanke discussed  the possibility of tapering Federal Reserve asset purchases.  Normalization is also going very well in the  sense that, even with an extraordinarily large balance sheet, the tools we have  developed to raise the federal funds rate (and other money market rates) have  so far worked well.  The federal funds  rate is trading close to the middle of the new target range of 25 to 50 basis  points and other money market rates have moved up in tandem.\n\nWhy is this noteworthy?  To explain, I’ll first have to provide some  background on how monetary policy used to work before the crisis and then  compare that regime with how it works now.\n\nBefore the financial crisis,  banks valued reserves―even though the Federal Reserve paid no interest on them―because  the Federal Reserve kept their supply scarce.   When the FOMC wanted to adjust its federal funds rate target—that is,  the interest rate banks earn or pay when lending or borrowing overnight  reserves with another bank—it directed the System Open Market Account (the  Desk) manager in New York to alter the supply of reserves within the banking  system (up or down) as needed to match the estimated demand for reserves in  order to keep the federal funds rate very close to the FOMC’s target. 2 In this setup, the amount of banking reserves  in the system—required and excess—was very small and the Desk typically  conducted open market operations that added or drained no more than a few  billion dollars of reserves from the banking system to ensure that the federal  funds rate traded around the FOMC’s target.\n\nIn October 2008, after passage  of the TARP legislation, the Federal Reserve was authorized to implement a new  tool, the ability to pay interest on required and excess reserves. 3 This tool was significant because it meant that  the FOMC would be able to control interest rate policy even with a much larger  balance sheet and a much larger amount of excess reserves in the banking  system.  This was important because it  gave us more scope to expand the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to help  address the financial crisis and to provide support for the economic recovery,  knowing that later, when the recovery took hold, we could raise interest rates  even with an enlarged balance sheet.  The  Fed wouldn’t necessarily be forced to return to the much smaller balance sheet  we had prior to 2008 before we could begin the monetary policy normalization  process.\n\nWhen interest is paid on reserves, these reserves retain value even when they are no longer scarce.  Banks may be able to borrow funds at lower interest rates from financial entities such as money market funds that are not permitted to hold deposits at the Federal Reserve and place these borrowed funds with the Federal Reserve to earn the higher interest rate paid on reserve balances.\n\nHow well the ability to pay interest on reserves works in practice in raising the entire constellation of short-term interest rates depends critically on the willingness of banks to engage in such arbitrage activity.  Prior to lift-off, we were uncertain how much friction there might be that would limit the willingness of banks to expand their balance sheets.  These frictions include limits on bank leverage that can make the use of balance sheet capacity costly, competitive frictions given the relatively narrow range of banks that are viewed as sufficiently creditworthy to warrant being recipients of large uncollateralized loans and, for those banks that accept FDIC insured deposits, insurance premiums that increase when they borrow reserves and their total liabilities increase.\n\nTo help ensure that money market rates would track the federal funds rate regardless of these frictions, the FOMC developed a second tool—the overnight, fixed-rate, reverse repurchase facility (overnight RRP).  In this facility, a number of financial entities, such as money market funds, that cannot hold reserves at the Federal Reserve can lend funds overnight to the Federal Reserve against the Fed’s Treasury collateral and receive the overnight RRP rate—currently 25 basis points.  The overnight RRP provides these institutions with an alternative investment if the interest rate offered by banks is unattractive.  Consequently, these financial entities should be unwilling to lend funds to banks and others at lower rates than the overnight RRP rate.  The overnight RRP rate should act, therefore, as a floor on money market rates.\n\nAs I noted earlier, the tools are working as anticipated.  Not only is the federal funds rate trading close to the middle of the new 25 to 50 basis point target range, but the entire complex of money market rates, such as LIBOR deposits and GCF repo, has also risen as well.  Moreover, apart from a temporary spike in usage around year end, which was expected, the usage of the overnight, fixed rate reverse repo facility has fallen back to levels similar to what we saw during the testing phase.  In recent days, usage has averaged less than $100 billion per day.  Thus, the facility has been absorbing only a small fraction of the $2.4 trillion of excess reserves in the banking system.  This demonstrates that to firm interest rates, we don’t necessarily have to drain reserves or shrink the size of our balance sheet.\n\nWe are very pleased by how well  our tools are working, and this has reinforced our confidence that they will  support the policy normalization process going forward.  This is what we expected given our extensive  testing, but there are always uncertainties that only can be resolved by  actually getting underway.  For example,  there was some residual uncertainty about how important a factor the zero lower  bound of interest rates had been in supporting the federal funds rate and other  money market rates.  This uncertainty now  has been at least partially resolved.   Even as we have moved away from the zero lower bound, the relative yield  relationships we saw before December’s federal funds rate hike have persisted.\n\nSo what’s on the docket for  monetary policy in 2016?  The answer is  that it depends on how the incoming data weighs on the outlook, and how changes  in the outlook influence our views on the appropriate setting for monetary  policy.  What I can say is that our  expectation at the December FOMC meeting was for further interest rate hikes in  2016 and beyond.  Participants  anticipated that the federal funds rate would likely continue on a gradual  upward path.   Over the longer term, FOMC  participants expected that the federal funds rate would eventually reach 3 to 4  percent as inflation rose back to our 2 percent objective and the headwinds  from the financial crisis that had been restraining economic activity fully  dissipated.\n\nEven though this path is shallow  relative to previous tightening cycles, the median federal funds rate path of  FOMC participants in the December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) is well  above the path implied by the federal funds futures market.  Should this be a concern?    Does this imply that there is a significant  risk of an abrupt future spike in short- and long-term interest rates as market  rates realign to levels more consistent with the median FOMC participants’  projections?\n\nI don’t think so for several  reasons.  First, the SEP projections are  modal forecasts—that is, what the participants believe is most likely to  happen—whereas those embodied in market prices are a mean—that is, an average  across all possible outcomes.  One might  reasonably expect these modal forecasts to be above the mean when inflation is  low and the economic outlook is uncertain.   Second, the median federal funds rate forecasts for primary dealers and  for buyside participants surveyed just prior to the December FOMC meeting differed  only marginally from the December SEP median projections of FOMC  participants.  This reinforces my  judgment that the difference between means and modes is the main factor for the  gap between the federal funds futures market and the SEP paths.  Third, the differences between the interest  rates implied by futures markets and the SEP have been quite small at  shorter-term time horizons, such as the end of 2016, and grow much larger as  the time horizon lengthens.  I think this  is noteworthy because the confidence one has at longer horizons should be much  lower than at shorter horizons.\n\nBecause I do not know what the  federal funds rate target range will be at the end of 2017 or 2018 with any  confidence, I am not very concerned if others have a different modal  forecast.  Projections will adjust as  incoming information changes the economic outlook.  I would expect convergence over time of the  SEP and market expectations as new information informs the outlook.\n\nLet me close with some  observations about my current thinking concerning our reinvestment of maturing  Treasury securities and paydowns in our agency MBS holdings.  As we noted in the December FOMC statement,  we anticipate that we will continue reinvestment “until normalization of the  federal funds rate is well underway.”  I  think this policy makes sense not only because the decision to end reinvestment  will represent a further tightening of monetary policy, but also because it is  difficult to assess ahead of time the impact of such a decision on financial  market conditions given the lack of historical experience.\n\nI also believe that continuing  reinvestment until the federal funds rate reaches a higher level makes  sense.  We want to ensure that we have  the ability to respond to adverse shocks by easing monetary policy by lowering  the policy rate.  Having more “dry  powder” in the form of higher short-term interest rates seems more desirable  than less dry powder and a smaller balance sheet.\n\nNow the words “well underway” in  the FOMC statement are vague—what does that mean in terms of the level of the  federal funds rate?  Reiterating the  disclaimer that I am speaking for myself, my view is that we should not set a  numerical tripwire for ending reinvestment.   If the economy were growing very quickly and the risks of an early  return to the zero lower bound for the federal funds rate were deemed to be  low, then I could see ending reinvestment at a relatively low federal funds  rate.  In contrast, if the economy lacked  forward momentum and the risks of a return to the zero lower bound were judged  to be considerably higher, I would want to continue reinvestment until the  federal funds rate was higher.  Consistent  with the general principles I mentioned before, the evolution of the overall  monetary policy stance—both interest rate decisions and balance sheet  developments—should be data dependent.\n\nIn my view, good monetary  policy-making requires ongoing assessment and judgment, not the adherence to  mechanical rules.  I know market  participants desire certainty, but in the uncertain world in which we live,  that desire is not consistent with the policy that would best achieve our  objectives.  We will strive to  communicate as clearly as we can so you can think along with us and alter your  expectations just as we do in response to incoming information.\n\nThank you for kind  attention.  I would be happy to take a  few questions.\n\n1 Antoine Martin, Jamie McAndrews, Jonathan McCarthy, Paolo Pesenti and Joseph  Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 In  this arrangement, the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was mainly  driven by the amount of currency in circulation.  As the amount of currency in circulation  increased, this drained reserves from the banking system.  The Federal Reserve offset this by increasing  its holdings of Treasury securities.\n\n3 The Federal Reserve gained the authority to pay interest on reserves earlier as  part of the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006; that legislation  authorized the Federal Reserve Banks to begin payment of interest on reserves  in 2011.  As part of the TARP  legislation, Congress moved up the date at which the Federal Reserve could  exercise that authority to October 2008.",

    "text": "The financial crisis and the ensuing recession exacted a high cost on the country.  Real gross domestic product (GDP) declined by over a half of a trillion dollars.  Total nonfarm payroll employment declined by 8.7 million jobs, and 5.8 million households lost their homes to foreclosure.  Extraordinary fiscal and monetary policy efforts were required to prevent a collapse of the financial system and the onset of a world-wide economic depression.  In the aftermath, new regulations, such as Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act, were implemented to strengthen the financial system and to limit the risk of a future financial crisis.\n\nSome opponents of tougher bank regulation claim that the increased regulatory requirements, such as the higher capital requirements and new liquidity standards, that have been imposed on large financial institutions in the aftermath of the financial crisis have reduced these firms' market-making capacity.  As a result, so the argument goes, this is leading to less liquidity for trading securities, and to more illiquidity events in which the prices of financial assets move sharply and become temporarily unmoored from their fundamental valuations.  The contention is that higher liquidity costs and more frequent illiquidity events will, over time, drive up the borrowing costs of households, businesses and the U.S. government; and that this is a substantial, largely unintended cost imposed by tougher regulation.  Thus, the argument concludes, the regulatory burden should be rolled back.\n\nThis is a noteworthy assertion and would have significant implications for regulatory policy if it were correct.  However, as I will lay out in my remarks, I don't think the hypothesis is well-supported by the available evidence.  First, the evidence to date that liquidity has diminished markedly is, at best, mixed.  Second, even if one were to interpret the evidence as indicating that liquidity has been reduced, it is not clear whether regulation is the primary driver, as other changes have played important roles as well.  Moreover, even if higher capital and new liquidity requirements were found to result in greater transaction costs, these costs would need to be assessed against the benefits of having a more robust and resilient financial system and a reduced risk of financial crises in the future.\n\nThat said, more work should be undertaken to fully assess this issue.  There is much that is still unknown.  The available market liquidity data primarily focus on the inter-dealer markets and thus do not shed light on possible liquidity changes between dealers and customers.  In addition, the financial system is adjusting in complex ways in reaction to regulatory, technological and other changes.  We need to better understand the degree to which any changes in the nature of liquidity reflect the evolving structure of financial markets, changes in regulatory policy or other factors.  With respect to regulatory policy, an important objective should be to achieve the best balance between the benefits of increased safety and soundness versus any costs imposed by these regulatory changes on market function and liquidity.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will focus on market liquidity rather than funding liquidity, although I recognize that the two are related in important ways.  I will examine market liquidity in two important fixed-income markets—the U.S. Treasury market and the U.S. corporate bond market.  The Treasury and corporate bond markets provide a useful contrast in evaluating liquidity conditions as they differ with respect to the homogeneity of their securities, how their securities are traded and how regulatory changes may have affected the incentives of dealers to make markets in these securities.\n\nThe Treasury market is much more homogeneous and the average size of each issue is much larger.  Trading volume and average trade sizes are much larger, and much of the trading activity for interdealer on-the-run securities is conducted electronically through the use of central limit order books (CLOB).  In contrast, the corporate bond market is much more heterogeneous; there are many more distinct bonds available; and bond sizes are much smaller.  As a result, corporate bond trading is fragmented across a large number of distinct outstanding bonds. Consequently, trading tends to occur infrequently and largely on a bilateral basis.\n\nThrough the prism of these two asset classes, I hope to provide some preliminary answers to five key questions.  First, what do we mean by liquidity and how can we measure it?  Second, what does the available evidence show in terms of how liquidity has changed in recent years in the U.S. Treasury and corporate bond markets?  Third, what factors could influence liquidity provision?  Regulation might be one factor, but there also could be others.  Fourth, what are the costs associated with shifts in liquidity and how do these costs compare to the benefits of a more resilient and robust financial system?  Fifth, what future work is needed to better assess whether increased regulation has damaged liquidity provision and whether the resulting costs exceed the benefits of higher capital and liquidity standards in terms of financial stability?  As always, what I have to say today represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nWhat do we mean by liquidity and how can we measure it? I would define liquidity as the cost—both in expense and in time—of buying or selling an asset for cash.  This would incorporate any direct transaction expense, such as fees or brokerage costs, the price the transaction was executed at relative to the midpoint of bid-ask spreads, how much—if at all—the size of the transaction moved market prices, and the immediacy or speediness with which the transaction could be completed.  How quickly prices revert back to earlier prices after a large trade also is relevant in assessing liquidity costs.  The costs of liquidity would go up if the costs of execution rose, the bid-ask spread widened, if prices moved more in response to a given sized transaction or if it took a longer period of time to complete the transaction and receive cash.\n\nIn assessing liquidity, we also need to distinguish between those liquidity conditions that generally prevail versus those that arise during periods of market stress when liquidity may become constrained.  Liquidity risk is the risk that liquidity might be impaired in the future when one wants to buy or sell an asset.  If liquidity risk is high, this means that there is a substantial risk that the price received could be at a greater concession to the prior trade than anticipated.\n\nLiquidity is dynamic, unobservable and multi-dimensional in nature, and, as such, can only be measured indirectly.  We can measure liquidity using a number of metrics, including bid-ask spreads, market depth and price impact.  Bid-ask spreads are a measure of the potential compensation for market makers for liquidity provision.  Market depth measures how thick the central limit order book is at any point in time.  If the CLOB is denser and thicker, then a large trade should result in a smaller price concession, everything else equal.  Price impact measures how the price of a security changes in response to trades of a given size.\n\nTo measure liquidity risk, we combine the various measures of liquidity discussed above into a single liquidity index.  Large jumps in illiquidity are identified as days in which the liquidity index deteriorates by an unusually large amount.  We benchmark this as moves of greater than two standard deviations.  Liquidity risk is calculated as the number of such jumps in illiquidity over a two-year rolling window.  Constructed in this manner, we are implicitly assuming that the risk of an illiquidity event in the future is correlated with the frequency of such illiquidity events in the recent past.\n\nWhat does the available evidence show in terms of how liquidity has changed in recent years in the U.S. Treasury and corporate bond markets? With respect to the U.S. Treasury market, we do not find much evidence based on available measures consistent with a significant deterioration in liquidity.  For example, quoted bid-ask spreads, after widening sharply during the financial crisis, subsequently narrowed and have remained stable at pre-crisis levels since 2010. (Exhibit 1) Other measures paint a more mixed picture.  While order book depth is appreciably lower now than in 2012 and 2013, it is much higher than during the financial crisis, and does not appear to be unusually low by historical standards. (Exhibit 2) Similarly, the price impact of trades appears to have risen a bit since the October 15 flash rally indicating some deterioration of liquidity, but is still not high relative to its longer-run experience. (Exhibit 3) Average trade sizes have followed a similar pattern to the order book depth and have recently declined somewhat. (Exhibit 4)\n\nAnother way to assess liquidity conditions is through the potential impact on Treasury yields.  If liquidity had deteriorated markedly, then we would expect to see larger deviations of actual yields compared to the yields predicted by an empirically fitted yield curve.  If liquidity were more costly, the deviations of actual yields from fitted yields would increase because the costs of arbitrage to eliminate those divergences would be higher.  During the financial crisis, for example, there was a sharp deterioration in liquidity, which was associated with a sharp rise in some measures of yield curve fitting errors to a peak of about 20 basis points. This compares to less than 2 basis points prior to the crisis.  In contrast, yield curve fitting errors have been low and stable recently and not outside historical norms. (Exhibit 5) Of course, the Federal Reserve's large scale interventions in the Treasury market over this period may also have had an impact on this measure.\n\nTurning to corporate bonds, given their heterogeneous nature, liquidity in the corporate bond market depends on the ability and willingness of dealers to hold these securities on their balance sheets while they find buyers.  Disaggregated data on dealer balance sheet holdings have only been published since April 2013.  While limited in terms of its history, these data indicate no clear reduction in investment grade security holdings over time, but do show a significant reduction in high-yield security holdings since the end of the financial crisis.  This might be indicative of deterioration in market liquidity in corporate bonds.\n\nTo investigate corporate bond market liquidity in more detail, let's examine three liquidity measures: the average trade size, \"effective\" bid-ask spreads and price impact.  The evidence on the average trade size for investment grade corporate bonds indicates a slight reduction from between $700,000 to $800,000 in the early 2000s to around $500,000 in the last few years. (Exhibit 6) However, price measures of corporate bond liquidity do not substantiate the trend in this quantity measure.  The effective bid-ask spread has been trending down since the early 2000s, around the same time that TRACE reporting was introduced.  The spread spiked during the financial crisis, but is now lower than its pre-crisis levels. (Exhibit 7) Similarly, price impact—the effect on price from a $1 million trade—has also been trending down since the early 2000s apart from the jump during the financial crisis. (Exhibit 8)\n\nAlthough liquidity in the Treasury and corporate bond markets does not appear to have changed much recently, liquidity risk may have risen.  For the Treasury market, our liquidity risk measure increased sharply with the financial crisis, and declined from 2009 to 2013.  However, over the last two years Treasury liquidity risk has moved higher and relative to the pre-crisis period is currently somewhat elevated.  For the corporate bond market, liquidity risk also increased sharply during the financial crisis, and then quickly fell as the crisis passed.  Corporate bond liquidity risk subsequently increased again in 2012 and early 2013, but is now back down close to its pre-crisis level. (Exhibit 9)\n\nIn sum, there is limited evidence pointing to a reduction in the average levels of liquidity.  However, there are reasons to think liquidity risk may have increased, and there are some data to support this conjecture.\n\nTwo cautionary notes are warranted in evaluating the available evidence.  First, the Treasury market evidence is based on the inter-dealer markets, and we do not have comparable evidence on liquidity conditions in the dealer-to-customer market.  Second, it is important to note that the FOMC's unconventional monetary policy may have affected recent measures of liquidity in ways that could make it more difficult to clearly discern any potential changes.  To the extent that this may be the case, then a clearer picture on liquidity conditions may only emerge as monetary policy is normalized.\n\nWhat factors could influence liquidity provision? Clearly many factors could affect liquidity provision.  On the regulatory side, capital and liquidity requirements are probably the most important factors.  Dealers have been an important provider of liquidity.  Higher capital requirements reduce dealers' returns on equity for a given level of intermediation activity and margin.  At the same time, liquidity requirements increase the cost of holding less liquid assets.  To compensate for the higher capital and liquidity requirements, dealers can shrink their activity in lower margin businesses and raise the price for the liquidity services they provide.  Presumably, both adjustments occur in most markets with the ease of entry, the degree of economies of scale, business model and overall client profitability influencing whether the adjustment occurs more through a resizing of the activity or a change in unit trading margins.\n\nFor the U.S Treasury market, the most important change in regulatory requirements is probably the introduction of the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) in the United States.  The SLR limits how leveraged a dealer balance sheet can be.  Because in the SLR all assets require regulatory capital, the SLR is much tougher on low risk assets compared to the risk-based capital measures it complements.  Of note, the long-standing U.S. tier 1 leverage ratio also requires the same amount of regulatory capital for all assets, but the SLR has been more binding given its higher calibration and more expansive coverage of exposures.  The SLR is currently the binding capital requirement for some dealers, and it has significantly increased the amount of capital that needs to be held against low-risk assets.  This has resulted in significant adjustments in the composition of dealer balance sheets.  For example, the imposition of the SLR has been cited as an important factor in the shrinkage of dealer repo financing activity.  In contrast, the risk-based capital standards and new liquidity standards are unlikely to be important for Treasuries and repo backed by Treasuries because Treasuries are treated as posing less risk to the banks that hold them and count as high-quality liquid assets.\n\nFor the corporate bond market, the most relevant factors are probably the increase in the Basel risk-weighted capital ratio, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress tests—which subject the dealer trading book to additional global market shocks that include a sudden increase in general risk premiums and credit risk combined with significant market illiquidity—and the Volcker Rule, which prohibits proprietary trading for a number of asset classes including corporate bonds, but not U.S. Treasuries.\n\nHowever, for both markets, other non-regulatory factors are also important.  Liquidity provision is affected by changes in market structure, how trades are executed and by competition from outside of the regulatory boundaries that have been established for systemically important financial institutions.  The market structure for many asset classes has evolved from a bilateral OTC structure toward a more open, centralized structure through the adoption of electronic trading platforms, post-trade infrastructures and higher degrees of transparency.  For example, in the U.S. Treasury market, firms specializing in high-frequency algorithmic trading have become much more important and now make up more than half the trading in the electronic, interdealer cash market.  This change in market structure has reduced the cost of trading in the interdealer market, especially for small trade sizes.  Electronic trading enables the use of automated trading strategies which tend to employ speed for executing small-size trades, and the liquidity on electronic trading platforms allows traders to get in and out of positions quickly.  The growth in high-frequency trading likely accounts for the reduction in trade size discussed earlier rather than this reduction being indicative of less liquidity.  The movement toward electronic trading has allowed a more diverse set of actors to participate in the market, thereby increasing competition and likely leading to improved market liquidity.  These changes, though, may have reduced the profitability of providing liquidity for dealers engaged in trading activity in the Treasury market. 2\n\nLiquidity risk in the Treasury market may also reflect the growth in high-frequency trading rather than the impact of regulation.  Temporary illiquidity events may reflect unanticipated, complex and dynamic interactions among high-frequency trading strategies that can play out faster than the timeframe in which human intervention can occur.  In addition, high-frequency trading activity, by undercutting the returns to providing liquidity services on a lower frequency and a higher trade size basis, may have both increased liquidity in the small—hence narrowing bid/offer spreads in normal trading conditions—but decreased it in the large—when selling or buying pressure on one side of the market predominates.\n\nFor the corporate bond market, market structure has also changed in important ways.  For example, bond mutual funds and exchange traded funds now hold a much higher proportion of corporate bonds than before the financial crisis.  Presumably, this shift in the structure of the market has affected liquidity provision and liquidity risk in the corporate bond market through the redemption risk faced by these funds.  Also, shifts in market structure and regulation have undoubtedly affected other markets related to the corporate bond market.  For example, changes in capital requirements for single name credit default swaps have presumably—and appropriately from a supervisory perspective—increased hedging costs and affected dealer market-making appetites and capabilities.\n\nWhat are the costs associated with shifts in liquidity and how do these costs compare to the benefits of a more resilient and robust financial system? Even if one were to read the evidence as supporting the notion that liquidity has become somewhat more costly, this does not imply that we should simply unwind recent regulatory requirements.  First, as I discussed, there are non-regulatory factors that could be more important factors.  Second, even if a connection could be made to regulatory causes, the costs of any reduction in liquidity or increase in liquidity risk might be low relative to the benefits of the regulations.\n\nAs I noted at the outset of my remarks, recent regulatory changes have been designed to produce a safer and sounder financial system.  Higher capital and liquidity requirements have made major financial institutions less prone to failure.  This can be seen in the sharp fall in credit default swap spreads for major dealers in recent years.  Moreover, other steps have made the financial system more robust to the failure of a systemically important firm.  For example, the shift to central clearing of over-the-counter derivatives through central counterparties (CCPs) has reduced bilateral risk exposures, and significant progress is being made on how to resolve the failure of a systemically important financial firm in a way that does not threaten the entire financial system. 3\n\nAs I see it, the prior regime did not sufficiently foster financial stability, a necessary condition for sustained economic growth.  Most noteworthy to me is the fact that the regulatory regime that was in place in 2008 and 2009 was associated with an episode of the most illiquid market conditions since at least the Great Depression.  A return to such a regime could lead to a higher cost for liquidity over the long-run.\n\nI think we are in a much better place today.  We have a financial system that is much more resilient, and the available evidence suggests that this transformation has not resulted in any significant erosion in market liquidity.\n\nWhat future work is needed? There is a tendency to compress a complex world into a sound bite—such as, \"tougher regulation is increasing the cost of liquidity and driving up liquidity risk.\"  Policy needs to be based on evidence and the available evidence supporting this claim is mixed, at best.  Most importantly, I think it ignores the complex nature of the changes underway in financial markets.  The methods of intermediation are changing and will likely continue to evolve.  There are new players with different objectives and goals, and technology is evolving rapidly.  These factors strike me as just as important as the increase in regulatory requirements for the large dealers.\n\nThe recent work analyzing the October 15 Treasury market flash rally illuminates the complexity of today's market structure.  After a careful examination of the evidence, the authors of the October 15 flash rally report conclude that \"the events of October 15 underscore the importance of efforts by the official and private sectors to understand more fully the implications of the evolving Treasury market structure for liquidity, trading and risk management practices, data access, and monitoring and surveillance.\"  The report goes on to suggest \"further study of the evolution of the U.S. Treasury market and the implications for market structure and liquidity;\" \"continue monitoring of trading and risk management practices across the U.S. Treasury market;\" \"an assessment of the data available to the public and to official sectors on U.S. Treasury cash securities;\" and \"continued efforts to strengthen monitoring and surveillance and to promote interagency coordination related to trading across the U.S. Treasury market.\" 4 I concur with all these recommendations.\n\nThere is much more work to do—not just with respect to the U.S. Treasury market, of course, but also on the broader issue of how changes in regulation and market structure influence liquidity conditions across the different financial markets.  For example, electronic trading was introduced to the foreign exchange market well before recent regulatory changes.  Consequently, a study of the foreign exchange market may shed some additional light on the role of electronic trading on liquidity risk in an environment prior to recent regulatory changes.  Only through much more careful study and data analysis can we thoughtfully address the two most important questions—not whether regulation should be rolled back in order to return to the liquidity conditions prior to the financial crisis, but instead:\n\nWe certainly don't want to undermine the progress we have made in making the financial system more robust and resilient.  But if there are adjustments to regulation that could improve liquidity provision without increasing financial stability risks, we should be open to considering such changes.  I suspect, however, making this determination will require considerably more data, research and reflection before we reach any definitive conclusions. Thank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\nCharts\n\n1 Tobias Adrian, Dianne Dobbeck, James Egelhof, Michael Fleming, Joshua Frost, Lorie Logan, Michael McMorrow, Matthew Raskin, Ernst Schaumburg, Katherine Tilghman-Hill, Joseph Tracy and Nathaniel Wuerffel assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 The Federal Reserve's large scale asset purchases presumably have also played a role by removing a large volume of Treasury securities from the marketplace.\n\n3 This includes requirements for total loss-absorbing capital (TLAC), Title I resolution plan requirements and the option of Title II single point of entry resolution\n\n4 See Joint Staff Report: The U.S. Treasury Market on October 15, 2014 , pp 6-7.",

    "text": "Good morning.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to  speak to you as I travel through Upstate New York to meet with various  communities in the region.  This  afternoon I will focus on national and regional economic conditions and what  the Fed is doing about them—with particular attention to the housing sector and  to conditions in Upstate New York.  As  always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIntroduction to the New York Fed As many of you  know, this is my first chance to speak at the University at Buffalo since I  became president of the New York Fed.   So, by way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New  York Fed is, what we do and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed  is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, and was created  by Congress in 1913.  With this act,  Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the  money supply—and designed it be decentralized, representative of all of America  and independent of the political process.   The Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington,  D.C.—a federal agency led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 autonomous Reserve  Banks that span the country.  For  example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York,  the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto  Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Each  Reserve Bank is autonomous, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn  from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors.  The law that created the Federal Reserve made  us independent so we can make decisions in the national interest free from  political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set  an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of  employment consistent with price stability.   This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it  combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation.  In order to promote these objectives, we also  pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial  stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe FOMC meets in  Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary  policy.  As New York Fed president, I am  vice chairman at these meetings and have a permanent vote.  At these meetings, the 16 other members (the  Board of Governors and the other Reserve Bank Presidents) and I each present  our current outlook for the economy.  For  these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical  information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of  directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local  stakeholders.  You may know that one of  my councils, the Upstate New York Regional Advisory Board, is designed  specifically to provide me with timely information from this area.  In this way, decisions by the FOMC are  continually informed by views gathered from all parts of the country, including  Upstate New York.\n\nOne thing that  makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique  within the Fed.  Let me tell you about  some of them.  We, alone, implement  monetary policy.  At the direction of the  FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities.   We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we  supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country.  We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large  money transfers between banks.  And, we  provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and  governments from around the world.   Finally, I must mention that the New York Fed's district could be the  most diverse in the System:  ranging from  the urban density of Manhattan to the forested sparseness of the northern  Adirondacks, to the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.  All in all, there is a lot to keep my  colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nThe Crisis and  Response Of course these  are anything but normal times.  The  financial crisis that broke in mid-2007 and intensified dramatically following  the failure of Lehman Brothers has been among the most virulent ever.  And it was followed by the longest and one of  the deepest recessions since World War II, called by many the \"Great  Recession.\"\n\nThe Fed responded  aggressively and creatively in an effort to pursue our dual mandate.  Our actions fell into two broad buckets.\n\nFirst, we took  steps to supply liquidity to the financial system, so that financial markets  could continue to function properly and to enable households and businesses to  maintain access to credit.  Carrying out  an age-old central banking role, we loaned funds to financial firms, secured  against their high-quality collateral.\n\nTraditionally,  such loans were only made to depository institutions, such as banks.  Of course, the modern U.S. financial system  includes many lenders that are not banks.   These companies and markets provide vital financing for credit card  loans, short-term business needs and many other activities.  Many years ago, Congress gave the Fed the  emergency authority to lend to nonbanks in \"unusual and exigent  circumstances.\"  During the crisis—in  order to limit damage to the wider economy—we exercised this authority to lend  to a wide variety of financial firms and markets.\n\nA handful of  times, we made the difficult decision to make emergency loans to prevent the  disorderly failure of particular firms.   We did so not because we wanted to help the firms, but because allowing  them to collapse in a disorderly fashion in the midst of a global crisis would  have harmed households and business throughout the United States.  All the Fed's loans were collateralized and  we are confident they will be repaid in full.\n\nSecond, we took  aggressive steps to ease monetary policy in order to support economic activity  and employment.  By the end of 2008 we  reduced short-term interest rates to virtually zero—the lowest level in the  history of the Fed.  In order to provide  still further support for the economy, we bought more than $1.5 trillion of  long-term assets—principally mortgage bonds guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac with the support of U.S. Treasury—between December 2008 and March 2010.\n\nWhen the Fed buys long-term  assets, it pushes down long-term interest rates. This supports economic  activity in a number of ways, including by making housing more affordable and  boosting consumption in households that can refinance their mortgages at lower  rates.  In addition, low long-term rates  reduce the cost of capital for businesses, thereby fostering more hiring and  investment spending (on equipment, construction and machinery, for example) for  any given economic outlook.\n\nNational Economic Conditions So where are we  today? Let me start my discussion of economic conditions with a few comments  about national economic conditions.\n\nAs I discussed in  a recent speech, the Great Recession has been followed by a tepid  recovery.  Since June 2009, economic  activity has grown—but not robustly.\n\nIn recent months, the momentum has  slowed.  After rising at a 3.25 percent  annual rate during the second half of 2009, real gross domestic product growth  has slowed.  With demand growth barely  keeping pace with firms' ability to increase productivity, job creation has  been too weak to significantly reduce unemployment, which stands today at 9.6  percent.  And, as is typical in such  circumstances of considerable slack, the rate of inflation has declined.\n\nWhy are we experiencing this soft patch  now? There are several reasons:\n\nThe slow recovery of consumer  spending and housing in the face of very substantial monetary and fiscal  stimulus reflects the painful unwinding of the dynamics at work during the  expansion that preceded it.  Beginning  around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were  significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in  home prices. The rise in home prices helped support more borrowing as  households used lines of credit and second mortgages to tap into their rising  home equity.  This also fueled a strong  boom in home construction.  But house  price increases could not be sustained without limit.  When home prices peaked and started to turn  down, the dynamic linking house prices, credit and consumption went into  reverse.\n\nLet's consider  first what this means for consumption.   Consumption of goods and services rose at a slow 2 percent annual rate  over the first half of 2010 and with no sign of a rebound.  Several factors are inhibiting families from  spending, including:  job or income  losses, low confidence and declines in wealth as real estate and stock prices  dipped.  Households have been saving more  and paying down their debts.  Of course,  lenders have also reinforced this tendency with tightened underwriting for  credit relative to prerecession standards.   Have households completed their deleveraging, so they will soon spend  more?  Although we believe that  substantial progress has been made, it is hard to tell how much further this  process has to run.\n\nNow, let's  consider why housing market activity—both new construction and sales—remains  depressed.  One reason for this is that  many existing homes stand vacant.  We  estimate that there are roughly 3 million vacant housing units more than  usual.  This stock of vacant homes will  shrink when foreclosures fall and more empty homes are sold or rented out.\n\nOn the sales  side, even though low mortgage interest rates and falling home prices have  together boosted housing affordability to its highest level in 40 years, the  current pace of sales is quite sluggish.   Impediments to home sales include tight lending standards, a weak job  market and continued uncertainty about home prices.  Importantly, the large drop in home prices  between 2006 and 2008 also reduced homeowner equity broadly, making it more  difficult to \"trade-up\" and move into better homes.\n\nWith lower home  prices, many families now owe more on their mortgages than their homes are  worth.  This means that they cannot  refinance or sell their homes easily if they experience a crisis such as a job  loss or a serious illness.  Foreclosure  completions are at an all-time high, although the initiation of new  foreclosures may be finally slowing.   Recently, attention has focused on cases where some of the documentation  used in the foreclosure process may have been flawed. The Fed actively  encourages efforts to find viable alternatives to foreclosure.  Not many people know this, but a team of New  York Fed officials work with mortgage counselors and community activists to  support distressed homeowners, and our lawyers support legal aid programs for  people facing foreclosure. At the same time, it is important that foreclosures  that comply with the law can ultimately take place. This is a necessary part of  returning the housing market to more normal conditions.\n\nAlong with two  other agencies, the Fed is reviewing the foreclosure practices at the major  bank mortgage servicers.  We are also  keeping an eye on banks' potential liabilities where they made representations  about mortgages bought by investors that may not have been correct in all  cases. We want to ensure that the housing finance business is supported by  robust back-office operations—for processing of new mortgages as well as  foreclosures—so that homebuyers and investors have full confidence in the  process.  We are monitoring developments  closely in order to evaluate any potential impact on housing or financial  markets and the overall economy.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Upstate New York Now let me turn to economic  conditions in Upstate New York.  It is no  secret that this region has struggled with weak economic growth and population  loss in recent decades.  The region has  experienced some very painful economic restructuring, particularly as it lost  so many of its high- paying manufacturing jobs.   Yet the process has yielded a productive and more diversified economy,  with a larger service sector.  For this  and other reasons I will discuss, the Upstate New York economy has weathered  the Great Recession relatively well.\n\nWhile the Upstate economy  generally underperformed the nation during the 1980s and 1990s, its recent  experience has been quite different.   During the Great Recession, Upstate New York's job losses began later  than they did for the United States as a whole, and those losses were generally  less severe.\n\nThe relatively strong economic  performance of the region of late is also clearly tied to its stable housing  markets.  Upstate New York's relatively  slow economic performance and lack of population growth during the expansion in  the 2000s supported only modest increases in home prices and sales during the  housing boom.  When home prices and sales  began to decline quite rapidly in many parts of the nation, they held steady  across the region.  As a result, Upstate  New York has largely been spared the boom-and-bust cycle in housing that  occurred in other parts of the country.   In fact, many of Upstate New York's metropolitan areas even experienced  home price appreciation during the housing bust, making these places among the  best performing in the country during this period. Many parts of the country  experienced severe housing busts, with sharp drops in housing-related activity  (such as construction and purchases of major appliances).  For example, in fast-growing places such as  California and Florida, construction jobs grew to be a large share of  employment, but the number of these jobs then plummeted during the  recession.  This dynamic did not occur in  places like Buffalo, where the housing sector was small and thus, had few jobs  to lose.\n\nAnother part of the story is that  homeowners in Upstate New York did not take on as much debt, and households  have been less strained here than elsewhere.   One reason is that home prices did not appreciate rapidly here, so homes  remained affordable. Moreover, there was generally lower penetration of risky  nonprime loans into the region's housing markets.  So, Upstate New York's home loans have  generally performed better than elsewhere in the country, with fewer  delinquencies and foreclosures.  Indeed,  much of the region was spared the worst effects of the nonprime mortgage boom  and bust.\n\nThus, compared with other parts of  the nation, the Upstate economy has performed well over the past few  years.  As a large and growing sector,  local colleges and universities have surely contributed to the region's  economic stability over the past few years.   Indeed, the University at Buffalo provides a clear example of how a  university can play a key role in its local economy.  The benefits of the higher education industry  go beyond their direct economic contributions, such as employment and spending,  for a very important reason: they can increase a region's stock of human  capital—that is, the total supply of knowledge and skills in its workforce.\n\nA region's human capital  contributes to its economic success and resiliency.  The educational activities of a region's  colleges and universities help build the skills of the local workforce.  In addition, the knowledge created by  colleges and universities through research activities can play a key role in  starting and supporting local businesses.   Businesses can use university expertise, infrastructure and research  findings to help them develop cutting edge products and services. Furthermore,  universities often employ local businesses to develop and commercialize  products that arise from their research activities.  This dynamic can expand local economic  activity and consequently create new jobs for high-skilled workers in a  region.  Institutions such as the University  at Buffalo play a vital role of this sort in the Upstate economy.\n\nThe diversification of Buffalo's  economy has helped the region to weather the Great Recession.  In particular, major investments in the  Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus have allowed the health care and education  sectors to expand and become an increasingly important part of the local  economy.  These sectors provide stability  because they are less susceptible to contraction during economic downturns than  other sectors of the economy.  Moreover,  Buffalo's robust banking industry provides an additional source of  strength.  And the strong Canadian dollar  has attracted Canadian shoppers to the region, bolstering retail sales,  contributing to local economic stability over the past few years.\n\nWhat Is the Fed Doing Now? Since the beginning of the  downturn, the Fed has actively used monetary and regulatory policy to help  support economic activity and improve economic outcomes—here in Buffalo and  across the nation—relative to what would have happened in the absence of this support.\n\nWith regard to monetary policy,  the Fed has in place a highly accommodative stance.  The FOMC has said that it will keep short  term interest rates at exceptionally low levels for an extended period of time.  The Fed also retains large amounts of mortgage-backed  bonds acquired in order to support the housing market and help bring down  mortgage and other long-term interest rates to the historically low rates in  place today.\n\nThe FOMC and the Chairman have  stated their commitment to take further actions to bring interest rates down  further should economic conditions warrant.   In a recent speech, I said that   both the current levels of unemployment and inflation and the timeframe  over which they are likely to return to levels consistent with our mandate are  unacceptable. I said that I thought further Fed action was likely to be  warranted unless the economic outlook were to evolve in a way that made me more  confident we would see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before  too long.\n\nTurning to regulatory policy, the  biggest lesson of the financial crisis is that severe financial disruptions can  inflict very large and persistent costs on people's lives and jobs.  Over the past year, with Fed leadership and  support, important new regulatory initiatives have been advanced to create a  global financial system where the players cannot slide back into the risky  \"business as usual\" that created this crisis.   These include the recent agreement with international bank regulators  (sometimes called \"Basel III\") to impose stricter standards for globally active  banks and the considerable regulatory changes embodied in the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThese measures recognize that to  avert or contain future financial crises, we need a financial system that can  withstand large negative shocks.  First,  market participants must not have incentives to take excessive risks.  Instead, incentives should reward actions  that support economic growth and financial stability.  And financial firms must set aside enough  capital and liquidity so that when things go wrong they can absorb losses with  their own resources.  Finally, if these  buffers prove inadequate and a financial firm veers toward failure, the  official sector needs the tools to wind them down in an orderly manner without  having to make the terrible choice between a chaotic failure that harms the  whole economy and a taxpayer-funded rescue.\n\nConclusion I appreciate the opportunity to  talk to you about how my job at the New York Fed ties in with your lives and  work here in Upstate New York.  The links  are many, including\n\nTo summarize conditions at the  moment: after a recession that was milder in Upstate New York than in many  parts of the country, the region is showing signs of a modest recovery.  A more diversified, more knowledge-based  economy and a relatively small housing sector helped to limit the recession's  impact on many communities.  Nevertheless,  the Great Recession spread much pain throughout this region and unemployment  remains much higher than we would like.\n\nThe Fed cannot wave a magic wand  and make the problems remaining from the preceding period of excess vanish  immediately.  But we can provide  essential support for the needed adjustments.   Even with our best efforts, the road to full recovery here in Upstate  New York and across the nation is likely to be long and bumpy.  But I am confident that we will make it.  And, the dynamism that is represented in this  room—the private sector combined with academic learning and research—will  provide a strong underpinning for future prosperity.\n\nThank you for your kind  attention. I will now be happy to take some questions.",

    "text": "Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this  panel discussion.  As always, what I have  to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open  Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nIn assessing where we are eight years after the financial  crisis, I would make three broad observations.   First, we have made considerable progress in bolstering the safety and  soundness of the global financial system.   In the U.S., which was the epicenter of the crisis, the risk of a  failure of a systemically important financial firm has declined  considerably.  Second, although  significant progress has been made toward ending “too big to fail,” there is  still much more to do.  While the risk of  failure of a global systemically important financial institution has  diminished, it has not been eliminated.   Without a well-functioning resolution process, the consequences of such  a failure could still be catastrophic.   Much headway has been made in the U.S. in developing a Single Point of  Entry resolution regime with a layer of total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC)  that would facilitate recapitalization and enable an orderly resolution.  However, significant challenges remain,  especially on managing resolution on a cross-border basis.  Third, bank leaders still have much to do to  rebuild the trustworthiness of their industry.   Long after the financial crisis, conduct failures have persisted.  We need financial firms to foster cultures that  are intolerant of bad conduct and that are attentive to incentive structures  that may encourage such behaviors.\n\nSo, let me begin with the good news.  The U.S. financial system is much more  resilient now than it was a decade ago on the eve of the financial crisis.  This progress reflects a number of  initiatives―some focused on the ability of firms to absorb shocks, and others  oriented at reducing structural vulnerabilities within the financial system  that spanned the activities of firms and their counterparties.\n\nChanges made to capital and liquidity requirements in the  U.S. and globally have made banks more resilient and robust.  The major U.S. banking organizations today  have much more capital, much higher-quality capital, and much larger liquidity  buffers than prior to the crisis.  On the  capital side, we have taken a belt-and-suspenders approach.  The Basel III risk-weighted capital standards  framework has been significantly strengthened―a stronger belt―and a  supplemental leverage ratio requirement has also been imposed on large banks  and bank holding companies to restrain overall leverage―the suspenders.  In addition, and perhaps most importantly,  the capital requirements have now become much more forward-looking.  Each year a bank’s capital dividend and  share-repurchase plan is assessed against the amount of capital the bank would  potentially have under an extremely stressed economic and market environment  given its portfolio of assets.  The  annual Comprehensive Capital and Analysis Review (CCAR) process has pushed U.S.  banks to improve their capital planning processes and forced them, when needed,  to retain more earnings and to build up their capital.  As a result, these banks are much less risky  now than they were prior to the financial crisis, when their vulnerability was  masked by a high, but unsustainable, level of profitability.\n\nOn the liquidity side, there has also been significant  improvement.  The Liquidity Coverage  Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio requirements have forced banks to hold  more high-quality liquid assets and have reduced the scope for maturity  transformation.  The ability and  willingness of banks to finance illiquid, hard-to-value assets with short-term  funding was an important element that contributed to the financial crisis.\n\nIn addition, I believe that supervisory oversight has  improved.  There is more attention on  horizontal evaluations across the systemically important firms and a greater  emphasis on bank governance, risk management, cyber security, and bank data and  technology capabilities than in the past.\n\nBut the progress has not just been in terms of enhancing  the strength of individual institutions.  The system as a whole is also stronger because of a number of important  initiatives.  Due to time constraints, I  cannot be exhaustive today.  But, there  are four important structural changes to the financial system that are worth  highlighting.  First, the tri-party repo  system—which matches institutional investors with bank dealers that need to  fund their securities portfolios—has been made much safer.  Before the crisis, each morning the two large  clearing banks provided huge amounts of intraday credit to their tri-party repo  borrowers when cash invested overnight was returned to lenders.  These temporary extensions of credit have  been largely eliminated.  This is an  important structural reform because these exposures had proven to be  destabilizing during the financial crisis.   In particular, when a major dealer became stressed, the clearing banks  were motivated to reassess their large overdraft exposures to the dealer, and  that turned out to be an important channel of contagion.\n\nAnother important change has been the shift in  over-the-counter derivatives activity from bilateral settlement to central  clearing.  Although this shift was  already underway at the time of the financial crisis, it has now been  underpinned by important changes to the capital and collateral regime, which  has accelerated the process by strengthening the incentives to structure and  clear trades centrally.\n\nWhen banks settle their trades with central  counterparties (CCPs), it reduces risk in the system.  Exposures can be netted, and the counterparty  risk is shifted from many individual firms to the single CCP that clears the  trades.  Although this shift in clearing  activity still has some way to go, the proportion of centrally cleared trades  will continue to rise as legacy trades mature.\n\nA third important structural change is the increased  focus on the strength and resiliency of CCPs.   Because CCPs are now going to play a more significant role, they must be  strong and resilient.  There have been  many important initiatives in this regard.   Foremost, perhaps, is the promulgation of the international standards  embodied in the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI)—which  were developed when I chaired the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems  (CPSS)—and the work currently underway on financial market infrastructure  resolution.\n\nA fourth significant structural change has been reform of  the U.S. money market mutual fund industry.   The October 14th implementation of floating net asset values  (NAVs) for prime institutional money market mutual funds has dramatically  reduced their use and has encouraged banks and other borrowers to find sources  of funding that are less prone to runs.\n\nThe financial crisis exposed two important flaws of the  money market mutual fund industry.   First, the fixed NAV structure created a first-mover advantage that  encouraged runs.  That is, if a fund came  under stress, investors who quickly withdrew their funds received par  value.  Second, although money market  mutual fund investments are often collateralized, the funds themselves have no  desire to take possession of the collateral in a crisis.  Instead, they tend to head for the exits at  the first sign of trouble, which makes the financial system less stable.\n\nMuch progress has been made in making the U.S. financial  system safer and less prone to panics.   Still, there is more to do before we can say that we have ended “too big  to fail.”  This is work that we  absolutely must complete.  In particular,  U.S. bank holding companies must do more to make their organizations resolvable  under either Title I bankruptcy or Title II resolution.  This requires having clean parent holding  company structures, less corporate complexity, and essential service and  support operations that are able to continue to operate even when the parent  company becomes non-viable.\n\nAlso, while there has been significant progress in terms  of developing a workable resolution regime—the Single Point of Entry regime  established under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act—we still have to ensure that  this regime can be safely utilized on a cross-border basis.  This requires fully implementing the TLAC  framework, and defining more explicitly the expectations and responsibilities  of the different supervisory and regulatory oversight bodies that would have to  work together internationally.  In  particular, this includes how liquidity would be provided to an insolvent firm  during the early stages of resolution, so that the firm’s operations could be  wound down in an orderly way without destabilizing the global financial system.\n\nFinally, I would like to address the issue of bank  culture and conduct.  Although there has  been considerable effort here, there is still much more to do.  Banks must restore their trustworthiness.  Only then can they effectively perform their  critical financial intermediation role in funneling funds from savers to  borrowers, and in helping firms and households manage their finances and risk  exposure.\n\nAs I see it, incentives drive behavior, and behavior  establishes the social norms that define culture.  This means that bank leaders need to take a  close look at the incentives they put in place with respect to compensation and  promotion in particular.\n\nIn addition, bank leaders must foster an atmosphere that  encourages people to speak up when they witness questionable behavior.  Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the  Southern District of New York, highlighted the importance of getting people to  speak up when he spoke at the New York Fed’s conference on bank culture in  October.  He argued—and I agree—that big  problems can be nipped in the bud when people speak up and senior management  responds appropriately.  Therefore, bank  leaders ought to recognize and reward those who speak up.  Actions speak louder than words in shaping  culture.  Establishing appropriate  incentives and fostering an environment in which people feel they can speak up  would go a long way toward bolstering bank culture.\n\nI am gratified that many bank leaders and boards of  directors are working hard to improve their firms’ cultures, and I very much  appreciate the G30’s efforts in this area.   I think most leaders recognize that good culture is fully consistent  with strong financial performance, and that it helps enable banks to attract  the talent needed to sustain such performance.   Yet, we could make greater progress more quickly if this effort were  coordinated across the industry.  I think  bank leaders could benefit from sharing best practices and participating in  surveys that would allow them to benchmark their strengths and weaknesses  versus others on an ongoing basis.\n\nBuilding a financial system that is more resilient and  robust, having a bank resolution regime that credibly ends “too big to fail,”  and building strong cultures that restore the trustworthiness of the financial  industry are all goals we must continue to pursue.  Without success on all three fronts, I don’t  think we can say that we have fully addressed the problems made evident by the  financial crisis.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n1 Beverly Hirtle, Antoine Martin,  Susan McLaughlin and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.",

    "text": "Good  afternoon.  It is a pleasure to have the  opportunity to speak with you at this event.   Today, I will focus on the economic outlook for 2018 and beyond.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own  views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or  the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nBroadly speaking,  the prospects for continued economic expansion in 2018 look reasonably  bright.  The economy is likely to  continue to grow at an above-trend pace, which should lead to a tighter labor  market and faster wage growth.  Under  such conditions, I would expect the inflation rate to drift higher toward the  FOMC’s 2 percent long-run objective.\n\nOver the longer  term, however, I am considerably more cautious about the economic outlook.  Keeping the economy on a sustainable path may  become more challenging.  While the  recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 likely will provide additional  support to growth over the near term, it will come at a cost.  After all, there is no such thing as a free  lunch.  The legislation will increase the  nation’s longer-term fiscal burden, which is already facing other pressures,  such as higher debt service costs and entitlement spending as the baby-boom  generation retires.  While this does not  seem to be a great concern to market participants today, the current fiscal  path is unsustainable.  In the long run,  ignoring the budget math risks driving up longer-term interest rates, crowding  out private sector investment and diminishing the country’s  creditworthiness.  These dynamics could  counteract any favorable direct effects the tax package might have on capital  spending and potential output.\n\nFavorable  Near-term Outlook\n\nTurning to the  near-term outlook, the prospects appear favorable for another year of  above-trend growth.  Consumer spending  should continue to grow at a moderate pace, supported by solid fundamentals.  Household income is being bolstered by faster  compensation growth and continued healthy employment gains.  Moreover, the aggregate household balance  sheet remains in good shape, due in part to rising home prices, a strong stock  market, and only moderate growth in household debt.  Over the past year, home prices have risen by  about 7 percent on a national basis, and the S&P 500 equity index has risen  by nearly 20 percent.  In contrast,  household debt has risen about 4 percent over the past year, only slightly  higher than the growth in personal income.   Further, the household debt service burden is low, reflecting the  extended period of low interest rates.\n\nOf course, the  aggregate figures mask some underlying problems.  Two issues worth highlighting are the  persistent growth in income and wealth inequality and the burden of rising  student loan debt. 2 Many people of more modest means don’t  directly benefit from rising home and stock prices.  And, increasing student debt burdens have  made it more difficult for many young adults to become homeowners. 3 This is significant because homeownership is  a major avenue for wealth accumulation for many households.  Nevertheless, the tightening labor market  should provide greater opportunities for workers to obtain employment, build  human capital, and gain greater opportunities to improve their financial  circumstances.\n\nOn the business  side of the ledger, investment spending should remain solid.  Business cash flows are strong, and the  corporate sector is set to receive a meaningful lift from the recently enacted  tax legislation.  The large reduction in  the statutory corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the  100 percent expensing provision for investment should drive down the effective  cost of capital for business.\n\nIn addition, the  U.S. economy should be well supported by the recent improvement in the global  economic outlook.  More synchronized  cyclical recoveries in Europe and Japan—and a revival of growth in many  emerging market economies—should ensure that demand for U.S. goods and services  remains strong.\n\nPutting it all  together, I have raised my real GDP forecast for 2018 by about half a  percentage point to three quarters of a percentage point to a 2½ percent to 2¾  percent range.  About one-third of this  upward revision reflects the firmer momentum of the economy going into 2018 and  about two-thirds the stimulative impact of the tax legislation.\n\nWhile this  legislation will reduce federal revenues by about 1 percent of GDP in both 2018  and 2019, I anticipate the boost to economic growth will be less than that.  Most importantly, most of the tax cuts accrue to the corporate sector and to  higher-income households that have a relatively low marginal propensity to  consume.  This suggests that a  significant portion of the tax cuts will be saved, not spent.\n\nOn the business  side, the boost to investment from the lower corporate tax rate and full  expensing is likely to be relatively modest.   In the past, aggregate investment spending has not been very sensitive  to the cost of capital, which is only one of many factors that influence  investment spending. 4 Moreover, the reduction in the effective tax  rate for corporations—or what they typically pay in practice—is only about 3 to  4 percentage points, far smaller than the reduction in the statutory rate.  On the household side, the impact is likely  to be attenuated by the temporary nature of many important provisions.  Households may not spend much of the  additional after-tax income if they perceive the gains as likely to be transitory.\n\nFinally, the  legislation is likely to generate some frictional costs that will mitigate its  effects on growth.  In particular, it  likely will have disparate impacts regionally and across economic sectors.  For example, the $10,000 cap on the amount of  state and local income and property taxes that can be deducted will raise the  effective cost of owning higher-end residential property in high-tax  states.  This could adversely affect  prices and construction activity of high-end housing in such states.\n\nIf the economy  continues to grow at an above-trend pace in 2018, the labor market should  tighten further.  In fact, I anticipate  that the civilian unemployment rate will fall below 4 percent this year and  reach the lowest level since at least 2000.   If this scenario proves accurate, this should lead to further firming of  wage growth.\n\nOn this point,  some wonder whether the relationship between tight labor markets and higher  inflation has broken down.  I have not  lost faith in this relationship.  As the  labor market has tightened over the past few years, we have seen a discernible  firming in the wage inflation trend from 2 percent to around 2½ percent. 5 Also, data at the state level indicate that  states with lower unemployment rates tend to have firmer wage trends.  This supports the case that tighter labor  markets tend to be associated with higher wage growth.\n\nAs the labor  market tightens and wage growth firms further, I would expect these conditions  to push up price inflation, particularly for services.  Research by the New York Fed has found that  prices of manufactured goods do not appear to be sensitive to labor market  tightness. 6 In contrast, tighter labor markets tend to be  associated with higher price inflation for services.  This difference presumably reflects several  factors.  First, prices of manufactured  goods are determined in global markets, whereas prices for most services are  determined locally.  Second, there  remains significant excess capacity in manufacturing across much of the world.  In the United States, for example, the manufacturing  capacity utilization rate was only 76.4 percent in November, about 2 percentage  points below its average since 1972.   Third, for manufactured goods, there may be more scope for substituting  capital for labor, and/or lowering labor costs by importing labor-intensive  intermediate goods.  To the extent that  this margin of adjustment is available, it would tend to dampen the impact of  higher wage costs on prices of manufactured goods.  Finally, the so-called “Amazon” effect, which  results in greater price transparency for buyers, may weigh disproportionately  on goods prices.\n\nAlthough inflation  remains somewhat below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective on a year-over-year  basis, I still anticipate that it will stabilize around that level over the  medium term.  As I noted earlier,  above-trend growth should tighten the labor market further, pushing up wage  inflation and eventually services prices.   In fact, we have already seen some increase in inflation in recent  months.  Over the three months ending  with November, core personal consumption expenditure prices rose at a 1.8  percent annual rate, up from a corresponding rate of just 0.4 percent last  May.  The pronounced slowing of core  inflation during the first half of 2017 was due, in part, to transitory  factors, such as a sharp fall in prices for cellular phone services.  Those influences have been temporarily  depressing the year-over-year figures.\n\nWhen these  transitory influences drop out of the year-over-year numbers this spring, the  inflation rate is likely to move higher.   Importantly, even as inflation undershot the FOMC’s objective over the  past year, inflation expectations have been broadly stable.  I would be much more concerned if low  inflation outcomes were contributing to a decline in inflation expectations.  That would make it more difficult to push  inflation back toward our 2 percent objective and would increase the risk of  getting stuck at the effective lower bound for interest rates following the  next economic downturn, which inevitably will come.\n\nEven if inflation  were to remain somewhat below 2 percent over the near future, that might not be  a serious problem, if the economy were to continue to perform well in other  respects.  To me, it would imply that the  unemployment rate associated with “maximum employment” is lower than current  estimates and that we could let the labor market tighten a bit further.  This would be a positive outcome because the  productive capacity of the U.S. economy would be enhanced and more people would  be able to find jobs, develop their job skills, and build their human  capital.\n\nIn short, 2018  looks like it will be a good year for the economy.  I anticipate that the Federal Reserve will  make further progress in achieving its dual mandate objectives of maximum  sustainable employment and price stability.   If circumstances evolve close to what I have outlined today, I will  continue to advocate for gradually removing monetary policy accommodation.  As I see it, the case for doing so remains  strong.  While the fact that inflation is  below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective argues for patience, I think that is more  than offset by an outlook of above-trend growth, driven by accommodative  monetary policy and financial conditions as well as an increasingly  expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nMoreover, if the  labor market were to tighten much further, there would be a greater risk that  inflation could rise substantially above our objective.  But, let me be clear: A small and transitory  overshoot of 2 percent inflation would not be a problem.  Were it to occur, it would demonstrate that  our inflation target is symmetric, and it would help keep inflation  expectations well-anchored around our longer-run objective.  In contrast, if inflation were to shoot  appreciably above 2 percent for a considerable time, the FOMC would have to adopt  a markedly tighter policy stance that would put the economic expansion at  risk.  In such circumstances, it is  unlikely that we would be able to sustain a low level of unemployment and also  achieve our inflation objective.\n\nPotential  Concerns for the Longer-term Outlook\n\nSo, if 2018 looks  good, what about the longer term?  Let me  start by discussing what I’m not worried about, before turning to those areas  where I have greater concerns.  For one,  I do not think the economic expansion—now in its ninth year—is vulnerable just  because it is “old.”  As we like to say,  expansions don’t die of old age—they die either because monetary policy needs  to be tightened appreciably to combat rising inflation, or because the economy  gets hit with a large shock that overwhelms the ability of the Federal Reserve  and other policymakers to stabilize it successfully.  In general, with inflation below the FOMC’s  long-run objective we can be cautious in how we adjust monetary policy.\n\nSimilarly, I am  not concerned about the recent flattening of the Treasury yield curve even  though some commentators believe that such a flattening foreshadows a  recession.  At the end of 2017, the  spread between the 10-year Treasury bond and 2-year Treasury note had narrowed  to 52 basis points, from 125 basis points at the start of the year.  As I see it, some flattening in the yield  curve should be expected as we gradually remove monetary policy  accommodation.  If the yield curve were  not flattening, it would suggest that we were behind the curve in removing  accommodation.  Moreover, this recent  flattening is not particularly pronounced.   For example, the 10-year/2-year spread of 52 basis points is only 46  basis points narrower than the average since 1978.\n\nIn addition, all  else equal, we should expect the yield curve to be flatter than normal in the  current environment.  Not only are bond  term premia depressed due to quantitative easing both here and abroad, but the  low inflation environment is also likely a contributing factor.  If investors perceive that the risk of  significantly higher inflation has fallen over time as inflation has  persistently undershot 2 percent, they should demand lower bond term premia as  compensation for inflation risk.   Finally, while inverted yield curves have typically preceded recessions,  I am unaware of any causal element in that relationship.  For example, I don’t believe that banks  become unwilling to lend when the yield curve inverts and that this tightening  of credit availability “causes” a recession.   I think it is noteworthy that in the current environment, higher  short-term interest rates tend to raise—not lower—the banking industry’s  profitability.  This is demonstrated, in  part, by the strong performance of bank stocks in 2017 as the Federal Reserve  raised short-term interest rates.\n\nAs I see it, the  Treasury yield curve becomes inverted when investors believe that short-term  real interest rates are high and monetary policy is tight.  Investors anticipate that such a regime will  slow the economy and be followed by a reduction in short-term rates.  Because these expectations turn out to be  validated eventually, we observe that inverted yield curves precede and signal  recessions.  But, we are not in this  situation currently. Investors expect short-term interest rates to rise, not  drop, and to remain higher in the future than they are now.  Despite the flatter yield curve, the  consensus view continues to be that monetary policy is not yet tight.\n\nOne area I might  be slightly—but not particularly—worried about is financial market asset  valuations, which I would characterize as elevated.  While valuations are noteworthy, I am less  concerned than I might be otherwise because the economy’s performance and  outlook seem consistent with what we see in financial markets.  Volatility in the real economy has been low,  and this has been matched by low volatility in financial markets, which has  helped support high valuations.  I am  also less worried because the financial system today is much more resilient and  robust than it was a decade ago.  Thus,  even if financial asset prices were to decline significantly—which presumably  would occur if the economic outlook were to deteriorate—I don’t think such  declines would have the destructive impact we saw a decade ago.  Higher capital and liquidity requirements for  major banks have made the banking system more resilient and better able to  absorb market shocks without this impairing its ability to intermediate credit  flows between borrowers and savers.  It  was the collapse of confidence in the financial system in 2008 that caused  credit availability to dry up, contributing greatly to the severity of the  Great Recession. 7\n\nSo, what am I  worried about?  Two macroeconomic  concerns warrant mention.  The first is  the risk of economic overheating.  Now,  this seems like an odd issue to focus on when inflation is low, but it strikes  me that this is a real risk over the next few years.  Not only do we have an economy that is  growing at an above-trend pace—at a time when the labor market is already quite  tight—but the economy will be getting an extra boost in 2018 and 2019 from the  recently enacted tax legislation.   Moreover, even though the FOMC has raised its target range for the  federal funds rate by 125 basis points over the past two years, financial  conditions today are easier than when we started to remove monetary policy  accommodation.\n\nThis suggests that  the Federal Reserve may have to press harder on the brakes at some point over  the next few years.  If that happens, the  risk of a hard landing will increase.  Historically,  the Federal Reserve has found it difficult to achieve a soft landing—especially  when the unemployment rate has fallen below the rate consistent with stable  inflation.  In those circumstances, the  Federal Reserve has been unable to both push up the unemployment rate slightly  to a level that is consistent with stable inflation and avoid recession. 8 Now, I don’t want to imply that a recession  is inevitable once the FOMC finds it necessary to nudge up the unemployment  rate to a sustainable level.  The  starting point in terms of the inflation rate is also important because it will  influence how far the FOMC is likely to go in terms of making monetary policy  tight.  Nevertheless, I think it is fair  to say that the track record on this score is not encouraging.\n\nThe second risk is  the long-term fiscal position of the United States.  Recognizing that fiscal policy is the domain  of the executive and legislative branches rather than the Federal Reserve, I  would emphasize several points.  For one,  the current U.S. fiscal position is far worse than it was at the end of the  last business cycle.  For example, in  fiscal year 2007, the budget deficit was 1.1 percent of GDP; in fiscal 2017, it  was 3.5 percent of GDP.  Similarly,  federal debt held by the public was 35 percent of GDP in fiscal 2007, and 77  percent in fiscal 2017.  Additionally,  three factors will undoubtedly cause these budgetary pressures to intensify  over time: the tax legislation will push up the federal deficit and federal debt  burden; debt service costs will rise as interest rates normalize; and  entitlement outlays will increase as the baby boom generation retires.  Let me discuss each of these in turn.\n\nWith respect to  the tax legislation, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the cost at  around $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years. 9 This estimate takes into consideration the  likelihood that the legislation will boost the productive capacity of the U.S.  economy somewhat—raising the economy’s potential growth rate—and that this  incremental growth will generate additional tax revenues.  To me, this seems like a reasonable estimate,  recognizing that with any complex tax legislation, there is a high level of  uncertainty about its impact on longer-term growth and revenues.  It is possible that the boost to the nation’s  productive capacity from higher capital spending and greater labor supply will  be higher than anticipated, leading to faster growth and greater revenue.  But, on the other side, the revenue  projections might also turn out to be overly optimistic as households and  businesses react to changes in the tax code by adjusting how they conduct their  activities in a way to minimize their tax liabilities.  This might especially be true as people look  to take advantage of the lower top marginal pass-through rate that is available  on sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs and S corporations compared to wage  income.\n\nDebt service costs  will undoubtedly be boosted by higher levels of federal debt and higher  interest rates.  In fiscal year 2007,  federal debt service costs totaled $237 billion on $5 trillion of federal debt  held by the public.  By fiscal year 2017,  although federal debt held by the public had nearly tripled to almost $15  trillion, debt service costs were $263 billion, only modestly above where they  were 10 years earlier.  Over the past  decade, the sharp decline in short- and long-term interest rates has kept a lid  on debt service costs—that lid is now being lifted.\n\nAlthough the  future path of interest rates is highly uncertain, the most recent 10-year  projections of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) illustrate where debt  service costs are heading.  For example,  the CBO projects that debt service costs in 2027 will be more than $800  billion—nearly 3 percent of GDP, more than double their current share. 10\n\nFinally, the  retirement of the baby boom generation over the next decade will put  considerable pressure on outlays.  The  CBO projects that, by 2027, outlays on Social Security and Medicare will rise  to 6 percent and 5 percent of GDP, respectively—each more than a percentage  point higher than in 2017.\n\nAs the economist  Herbert Stein once remarked, trends that are unsustainable must end.  How, precisely, the United States chooses to  address its fiscal challenges will have important consequences for the economy,  monetary policy, and financial markets in the years ahead.\n\nTo sum up, I am  optimistic about the near-term economic outlook and the likelihood that the  FOMC will be able to make progress this year in pushing inflation up toward its  2 percent objective.  The economy has  considerable forward momentum, monetary policy is still accommodative,  financial conditions are easy, and fiscal policy is set to provide a  boost.  But, there are some significant  storm clouds over the longer term.  If  the labor market tightens much further, it will be harder to slow the economy  to a sustainable pace, avoiding overheating and an eventual economic  downturn.  Another important issue is the  need to get the country’s fiscal house in order for the long run.  The longer that task is deferred, the greater  the risk for financial markets and the economy, and the harder it will be for  the Federal Reserve to keep the economy on an even keel.\n\nThank you for your  kind attention.  I would be happy to take  a few questions.",

    "text": "Over the past 20 months, I have been engaged in a series of outreach meetings all across my Federal Reserve District. I consider these visits just as important as my trips to Washington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy or to Switzerland to shape international bank regulation. The understanding that I gain today will help ensure that my policy decisions reflect the public interest in the broadest sense.\n\nEach visit within the region helps me deepen relationships with the people I represent. As you may know, the New York Fed's District includes all of New York State; 12 counties in northern New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This year I have met with community leaders, businesses and elected officials around the region.\n\nAlthough the Bronx is the city's second smallest borough, it has 1.4 million residents—equal to the combined population of three to four average U.S. cities. You host world-class institutions such as the Yankees, the New York Botanical Garden, the Montefiore Medical Center and the Hunts Point Market. You also are home to the largest Dominican population in the city and sizable groups from around the globe. In sum, the Bronx is a major metropolitan area and economic force all on its own.\n\nWhat the New York Fed Does By way of introduction, I will briefly review what the New York Fed does and what makes my job so interesting. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nI serve as Vice-chair of the FOMC—a Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a year in Washington, D.C., to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy. At FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current regional and national outlook. For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical information that we learn from our boards of directors, regional councils and community leaders, such as you.\n\nAt the New York Fed, we continually track conditions in our District and have created tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of economic activity—essentially local measures of output—for the city, New Jersey and New York. We have also started a consumer panel to track local household credit conditions.\n\nIn addition, we have a new survey about credit and financing for small businesses. Almost 900 regional businesses responded to our May 2011 poll—nearly 10 percent from the Bronx. If you, as part of a small business, would like to participate in our January poll, please pass your card to my colleagues in the audience.\n\nThis December we will host a workshop for the New York City metro area's small businesses—to provide information about credit enhancements and loans from the Small Business Administration. I will send your president, Mr. Caro, details about how to register. I hope to see you in at the New York Fed in lower Manhattan in December.\n\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as New York have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some key initiatives specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. We have worked hard to help neighborhoods, including some in the Bronx, that face high foreclosure rates. Later today, I'll tour some hard-hit areas with the city's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development.\n\nTo share what we learn about our diverse District, we have a rich website. I invite you to visit newyorkfed.org to explore our detailed maps and information on small business, credit and housing conditions.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with Fed colleagues and other agencies to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing. Yet, much remains to be done and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues busy.\n\nNational Economic Conditions Now, let me update you on national economic conditions.\n\nPut simply, growth in 2011 has been disappointing. We entered the year with some momentum, spurred by fiscal and monetary policy stimulus. U.S. economic output grew at a 3 percent annual rate from mid-2009 through 2010. While hardly a blistering pace, it was sufficient to reduce the unemployment rate by a half percentage point during 2010. Then, during the first half of 2011, growth slowed so much that the unemployment rate rose back up to 9.1 percent.\n\nGrowth slowed partly because of temporary factors. As these factors have subsided, growth has picked up. But the consensus expectation for 2.4 percent annualized growth in the third quarter is still disappointing.\n\nLooking forward, I regard continued modest growth as the most likely outcome. This sluggishness convinces me that other, more persistent factors must also be holding back growth. And, given the depressed level of household and business confidence and the fragility evident in financial markets, I also conclude that there remain significant downside risks.\n\nIt is worth elaborating on these points. First, what are the temporary factors that slowed growth in early 2011? Of the items noted by the FOMC, two bear special mention:\n\nThese temporary factors are now waning. Nonetheless, four factors are preventing a more vigorous recovery:\n\nThus, our economy continues to face some serious headwinds. Without robust growth, the economy is more vulnerable to negative shocks, which unfortunately seem to keep coming. It is like riding a bicycle—at a slow speed, the bicycle wobbles and the risk of falling rises. Politics have not helped. The intense debate around raising the debt ceiling took a toll on confidence. More recently, the difficulties in Europe and lower U.S. growth prospects made investors less inclined to take risks, spurring a major stock market sell-off and widening credit spreads. All these events increase the downside risks to growth.\n\nLet me turn now to the inflation outlook. As you may know, the FOMC has two charges: promoting stable prices and sustainable growth. This has been a tough year on both counts. Unemployment remains too high. At the same time, inflation has risen more than expected. Nevertheless, because monetary policy works with a lag, we have to make policy based not on where inflation is today, but where it is headed in the future. I believe that underlying fundamentals will help to subdue inflation over the next few quarters.\n\nAs of August, the 12-month change for a broad measure of consumer prices was 2.9 percent, almost double the change in the year before. However, the bulk of that increase was due directly to the run-up of energy and commodity prices, which tend to bounce around a lot. Measures of the underlying rate of inflation have moved up too, but by less and to levels broadly consistent with price stability. I expect those to subside soon, as well. It is important to remember that a year ago the worry was that deflation—meaning a persistent, widespread decline in prices—might take hold. Deflation tends to inhibit growth because people and companies have a harder time paying down debt and may defer investments and purchases when prices and wages are falling. Avoiding outright deflation is a very good thing.\n\nThus, barring more energy price jumps, I expect inflation to fall late this year and next. Moreover—and this is crucial—households' inflation expectations remain well anchored. Low and stable inflation expectations help us to deliver low and stable inflation.\n\nIn light of the current weak outlook, the FOMC has announced that we expect to keep short-term interest rates exceptionally low at least through mid-2013 and will change the composition of the assets the Fed holds to provide additional support for growth. In addition, we have discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery even as we keep inflation pressures in check.\n\nJust like interest rate cuts in normal times, our monetary policy provides support through lower interest rates that encourage private-sector business investment and household spending. This policy tool should not be confused with fiscal stimulus or government spending.\n\nI believe that the actions we have taken recently will be helpful in supporting growth and jobs. However, I do not think that monetary policy is all-powerful. To get the strongest possible recovery we need reinforcing action in areas such as housing and fiscal policy.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions Now, how has the region fared during the downturn and its aftermath? Based on the New York Fed's indexes, 1 the downturn in the economy in New York City ended in November of 2009. Since then, the city's economy has been on the mend and, as of September, the recovery continues at a healthy clip.\n\nThe local economy has fared better than the nation during this deep recession and slow recovery. Employment fell by a smaller percentage in the city than it did nationally. During the recovery, New York City has already regained half of the net jobs lost during the recession. This has happened without much help from the securities industry (Wall Street), a key driving force behind past local economic recoveries. The strongest job growth has been in professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and—importantly for the Bronx—education and health services.\n\nAlthough closely linked to the rest of the city, the borough has its own vibrant economy. Some manufacturing takes place here, particularly in food, apparel and textiles. In addition, Hunts Point may be the world's largest food distribution center. However, the largest sectors—health and education services—account for nearly half of all private jobs in the borough. In education, the Bronx hosts Fordham University and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others. As for health services, numerous facilities include the Montefiore Medical Center, now the borough's largest employer.\n\nI am pleased to report that the Bronx, unlike the nation and the city overall, sustained almost no net job loss during the recession. While national employment remains well below its pre-recession peak, the Bronx has added 10,000 jobs since the recession began. Some of this resilience is due to the borough's concentration in health and education—the only sectors that grew nationally during the recession. Another factor is that Bronx residents largely rent their homes, so they were less vulnerable to the fallout from the housing crisis.\n\nThis is not to say that all is well here. Some 12 percent of the Bronx workforce—a painfully high share—is jobless and less than a fifth of its adult population hold a college degree. The seeming disconnect between the pace of job creation here and high unemployment reflects commuting patterns. Many Bronx residents work in Manhattan and other places where job trends have been less favorable. In addition, not all jobs in the Bronx are filled by borough residents.\n\nHigh unemployment and low average levels of education help explain why the per capita income here is less than two-thirds of the national average. A quarter of the population here lives below the poverty line, more than double the national rate. Reducing poverty and raising the graduation rate are clearly major challenges for policymakers here, 2 even though the Bronx, like the city, seems headed in a promising direction.\n\nHow are families here doing in reducing their debt to more sustainable levels? Let me tell you what our special consumer credit panel reveals about the Bronx. 3 Families here, as renters, carry relatively little debt. However, it worries me that in contrast to falling debt levels elsewhere, Bronx residents have not reduced their indebtedness during the last two years.\n\nAlso troubling is the 17 percent of household debt in the Bronx that is seriously delinquent: roughly double the rate in the state and nation. Plus, the number of delinquencies is still climbing here, even though they are falling in the state and nation. All of this tells me that Bronx households have a considerable way to go before they reach more comfortable debt levels.\n\nConclusion To sum up, over the first half of 2011, the slowing of economic growth in the nation and the weak labor market has been a major disappointment. Recently, growth has picked up modestly, but not enough to reduce unemployment. Despite some bright spots in the U.S. economy, strong headwinds are preventing a more vigorous recovery. Inflation, which has risen in recent months, is poised to slow soon. The Fed is doing—and will continue to do—everything within its power to promote jobs and price stability.\n\nHigh poverty, unemployment and delinquency rates suggest that the Bronx faces a number of challenges. However, the continued job growth in the Bronx and rest of the city should create more opportunities for Bronx residents to improve their incomes and personal finances.\n\nGoing forward, the key challenge for the Bronx will be to prepare its residents for the best jobs being created in the region. The Bronx must strive to build the human capital—that is, education and skills—of its workforce. A region's human capital determines a large part of its economic success. The Bronx needs to ensure that it can attract and train workers for the broad range of tasks that an advanced economy demands. In addition, expanding education and skills goes a long way to broaden participation in the economy to all residents.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n_______________________________________ 1 Regional Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators » 2 See, for additional discussion of this topic, William Dudley. 2011. \"Job Creation in the Region.\" Remarks at the Quarterly Regional Economic Press Briefing, New York City.

    "text": "I am very pleased to have the opportunity to join you today at the 17th Annual Bronx Bankers Breakfast.  I would like to thank Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr., the Business Initiative Corporation of New York and the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation for the opportunity to speak about the economic outlook for the Bronx.  This is my second visit to the Bronx in the past five months.  When I was here last December, I had the opportunity to hear from various community and business leaders about what they were seeing and the issues they were facing.  Such visits are an important part of the New York Fed’s outreach efforts to keep apprised of key developments in the Second District, and to identify areas where we should be directing our attention.\n\nIn my remarks today, I will focus on the outlook for the Bronx, the important role that community banks play in the local economy, as well as specific challenges facing local small businesses.  It is important to recognize that small businesses play a vital role in any economy, so fostering economic and financial conditions that allow these businesses to flourish is important to the health of the local economy.  In light of recent developments, I am optimistic about the economic prospects for the Bronx and local small businesses.  I also believe that community banks and community development organizations have an important role to play in paving the way forward.\n\nAs always, my comments today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe Economic Outlook for the Bronx\n\nTo appreciate where we are, we need to remember where we’ve been.  Those of you who are long-time Bronxites know that starting in the 1950s, but especially during the 1970s, the Bronx endured a massive economic slump.  In that one decade, the 1970s, the borough’s population fell by 20 percent—and by even more in many well-established neighborhoods.  As people moved out in droves, buildings were abandoned, crime increased and jobs vanished—all in a vicious cycle, creating an atmosphere of despair.  Yet, the borough persevered and conditions began to stabilize and then to even improve a bit in the 1980s.\n\nToday, while there is still much progress to be made, the Bronx is in dramatically better shape on many dimensions: its economy has been growing at a brisk pace, its population is on the rise, its housing stock is being rejuvenated and many businesses are thriving, creating strong job and income growth.  This is particularly evident in neighborhoods like Hunts Point and the area around Yankee Stadium, down to the Bronx Terminal Market and beyond.  Between 2007—right before the last recession—and last year, employment grew by 10 percent in New York City, making it one of the best performing areas in the nation.  In the Bronx, employment grew even faster, rising by more than 14 percent.\n\nWhile job creation in the Bronx has been quite broad-based, I would like to highlight two particular industries, each very different in nature, to illustrate the diversity of Bronx’s economy.  Both health services and wholesale food distribution have been flourishing here.  These sectors, on average, pay relatively well and both have been contributing strongly to overall job creation and to the borough’s economic resurgence.  By health services, I don’t just mean hospitals and clinics serving the local population.  For example, Montefiore Medical Center is a nationally-ranked institution in a variety of specialties as well as a highly regarded teaching hospital.  Additionally, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine is a graduate medical school and clinical research facility.  And, of course, the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center houses institutions such as the Fulton Fish Market, which moved here from lower Manhattan about a decade ago.\n\nBut, of course, these aren’t the only industries driving the Bronx economy.  Just last November I visited OnForce Solar, an installer of solar heating systems located in the Port Morris section of the South Bronx. There has also been a great deal of retail development over the past decade—most notably, perhaps, the Bronx Terminal Market just south of Yankee Stadium.\n\nA little known fact is that, on average, jobs pay more in the Bronx than in any other of the five boroughs, except for Manhattan.  And my regional economists assure me that it’s not just the Yankees that bring up the average, although they do make a difference.\n\nThis, of course, is not to say that all is well in the Bronx.  Its poverty rate and unemployment rate are both roughly twice the national average, and higher than in any of the other boroughs.  While crime has fallen dramatically over the past two decades, it also remains higher than in the rest of the city.  Debt is also burdensome for many Bronx residents.  Delinquency rates on household debt are relatively high, suggesting that many people are financially “distressed.”\n\nAll this makes it especially important to maintain the economic momentum that is improving the quality of life in the Bronx.  Community banks have an important role to play in this process. Bank lending can help businesses—especially new and small businesses—expand and grow jobs, and help residents invest in improving their homes, neighborhoods and communities.  Lending to small businesses and entrepreneurs requires deep knowledge of local business conditions and potential borrowers, both of which community banks have a comparative advantage in acquiring.  Former Chairman Ben Bernanke in a 2012 interview summarized this point quite well.  He stated that “community banks have the capacity to respond with greater agility to lending requests than their national competitors; they have more detailed knowledge of the needs of their customers and closer ties to the communities they serve.” 2\n\nGiven this critical role played by community banks for localities such as the Bronx, it is important to ensure that the local banking sector remains vibrant.  The financial crisis offers important lessons for community banks in this regard.\n\nLessons for Community Banks from the Financial Crisis\n\nAmerica’s banking system began with community banks, and today they continue to play a critical role in the financial system.  However, the number of commercial bank charters has declined by 50 percent since 1985, with the recent financial crisis contributing to this decline. A total of 417 banks and thrifts failed between 2006 through 2011. 3 Many community banks, though, not only survived but also thrived during the crisis.  Why?  What sets those banks apart from others that failed, or that survived but did not thrive?  What were some common characteristics across the successful banks?  These characteristics are undoubtedly important and will be an essential element of success in the future.\n\nSome factors that one might think are important turn out not to be critical in determining performance.  For example, asset size was generally not a factor in performing well during, and following, the financial crisis. Community banks that thrived varied in asset size—from below $50 million, to as large as $10 billion in assets.  Geography, though, did matter to a degree.  By definition, community banks are not geographically diversified, so those located in states that were most severely affected by the financial crisis and the recession faced the largest challenges.  However, there are examples of banks that performed well in Michigan despite the severe economic problems that Michigan experienced; and there are examples of banks that floundered in Texas despite the solid economic performance that Texas experienced.  Here in the Second District, while we had relatively modest declines in real estate values on average, some local areas saw house price declines as serious as in the worst hit states such as Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada.\n\nRecent research has identified several characteristics common to community banks that prospered during and following the financial crisis. 4 First, thriving banks exercised a comparatively conservative growth strategy during good times, with a management culture that focused on long-term franchise value and not short-term profitability.  Successful banks had lower concentrations in commercial real estate lending generally; and much lower concentrations in construction and land development loans specifically.  While profitable during the boom, these loan categories suffered the greatest losses as real estate values declined and the recession set in.  As the boom progressed, the more conservative underwriting standards of successful banks led to declines in their market shares as other banks competed for business by relaxing their standards.  However, successful banks were able to gain back this market share and then some after the bust due to the relative strength of their balance sheets.  The successful community banks were patient and conservative regarding investments—desiring reasonable, sustainable returns, not necessarily “spectacular” returns.  It seems that their managers devised their business plans heeding Friar Lawrence’s advice to Romeo as he devised his courtship plan for Juliet: “Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.”\n\nOther noteworthy characteristics also identified in this research were an engaged board of directors, talented staff who were familiar with the community, sound senior management oversight and thorough due diligence before offering a new product or service.  The studies further cited successful community banks as having a strong and localized customer service focus—that is, avoiding the temptation to expand into new, less familiar areas and markets—and high community visibility, with staff members heavily involved in community activities, which in turn, created customer relationships built on trust. 5\n\nSo what did we learn from the experience of community banks with the financial crisis?  A foundation built on good risk management practices and intimate local knowledge helped the successful banks to thrive during one of this country’s most difficult financial periods.  The banks that prosper in the future will likely have characteristics similar to those that outperformed during the financial crisis.  It bears repeating that community banks are critical in keeping local economies vibrant and growing.  Strong community banks are essential to the provision of credit to small businesses in their localities.\n\nImportance of Small Business Lending\n\nIt is often noted that small businesses contribute disproportionately to employment growth in their communities.  When you dig a little deeper into this stylized fact, you discover that it is new small businesses that are responsible for this growth.  Upon reflection, this makes sense given that, by definition, old small businesses are not growing.  If they had been growing fast, they would no longer be small.  A related fact is that the failure rate is quite high for new small businesses.  Taken together, this implies that it is important to provide an environment that is conducive to new business formation.  The more new businesses that are created, the more that have a chance of surviving and growing into larger, prosperous members of the local economy.\n\nOn earlier visits in the District, I heard several small business owners voice their concern over their ability to access credit.  Based on these conversations, I asked my research staff to investigate the degree to which they could substantiate with data whether Bronx small businesses seem credit-constrained relative to other boroughs or relative to other comparable counties across the country.  They first looked at the share of small business loan amounts made in each borough relative to the share of small businesses located in each borough, using data for 2013 (the latest available at the time).  If small business credit is equally available, then we would expect to see ratios of approximately one for each borough.  What the data show is that the ratio is well below one for the Bronx and Staten Island, with the Bronx being the lowest.  This is consistent with what I heard during my last visit.\n\nBroadening the lens of the analysis, my staff then compared the Bronx to a random sample of comparable low income counties that were located in urban areas, again using data for 2013.  They looked at the ratio of the volume of small business lending per small business.  The ratio for the Bronx was $9,900 as compared to a mean ratio of $10,400 across the sample of other counties.  While lower by $500, this difference is not large.  Taken together, the evidence suggests that while access to small business credit in the Bronx seems more constrained relative to Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens, it is relatively consistent with what is typically available in lower income counties across the country.  Of course, this may simply indicate that small businesses in lower income areas of the country are generally constrained in their credit access.\n\nAnother way to investigate the question of credit constraints is to look for evidence that would reflect the consequences of these constraints.  For example, more constrained access to credit might result in a slower rate of new business formation.  My staff analyzed small business starts between 2010 and 2013.  For the Bronx, the number of small businesses per capita grew at a 12 percent rate over that period, double the average rate for the sample of 50 lower income counties.  This evidence can be viewed in multiple ways.  My take is that, in general, it is difficult to prove or disprove the presence of credit constraints with the available data, especially at the county level.  In the case of the Bronx, we found evidence both for and against the proposition.  In either case, we take seriously the feedback from local businesses that they perceive access to credit to be a problem.  The question then becomes what can be done to improve the situation going forward.\n\nNot surprisingly, most loans to small businesses tend to be small. Microloans—defined $100,000 or smaller—make up 90 percent of all loans to small businesses.  These loans tend to be labor intensive and costly to underwrite relative to the returns they generate.  This combined with the higher risk associated with these loans present challenges to banks.\n\nCommunity development financial institutions (CDFIs) can help fill this space.  CDFIs are specialized financial institutions that target their efforts to areas underserved by traditional financial institutions.  They provide a range of financial products including capital for investments to start-up or expanding businesses in low-income areas.  Most CDFIs tend to be nonprofit organizations, but some are regulated institutions such as community development banks and credit unions.  Examples of CDFIs operating in the Bronx include the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, the Bethex Federal Credit Union and Spring Bank.  However, CDFIs tend to make loans smaller than $50,000.  A challenge, then, is bridging the gap between the maximum loan amount typically provided by a CDFI and the minimum loan amounts typically provided by a bank.  Since the CDFIs have the relationships with the small businesses, partnerships between banks and CDFIs that increase the lending capacity of the CDFIs could be helpful.  Possible avenues to achieving this include partnerships between CDFIs and banks, as well as assisting CDFIs to better access funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system.\n\nI would like to touch on three additional issues that I think would assist small businesses to be successful: financial education, certification of community organizations that assist small businesses and greater transparency for small business lending.\n\nEstablishing a thriving small business takes more than a good idea and hard work.  While both of these are essential, there are many other factors that come into play.  It is important that people starting businesses have access to financial information that will assist them in navigating the difficult way forward.  This assistance can include how to develop a sound business plan, how to enhance their credit profile, how to avoid early pitfalls such as obtaining financing with punitive interest rates and how to cultivate a banking relationship.  These will all increase the likelihood that the small business will have access to the credit it needs over time to grow and thrive.  CDFIs have been an important source of this financial education to small businesses, and these efforts should be supported and expanded.\n\nIt is critical that small businesses also know that the organizations they work with are reputable and knowledgeable.  Unfortunately, there are individuals who try to take advantage of owners of new businesses by providing them with poor advice or overcharging them for credit. Researching the backgrounds of these service providers and lenders is difficult and time intensive, leaving small business owners too often uncertain as to who to deal with.  In some cases, this uncertainty can discourage a business owner from seeking assistance.\n\nI believe that we need a better system of certification for organizations that work with small businesses.  The certification will assure a business owner that the organization has been properly vetted and has the requisite skills to assist the owner.  This not only provides assurances to business owners, but saves them the time and resources required to do this due diligence on their own.\n\nFinally, in addition to certification, it would be helpful to have consistent standards and transparency requirements for organizations that lend to small businesses.  Such standards and requirements exist for lending to households, and I believe the same justification exists to extend these requirements to small businesses.  As a result, small business owners would have greater confidence that they fully understand the terms and conditions of their loan.  This, in conjunction with the access to more financial information and education, will help small business owners make better decisions about their use of credit.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, economic conditions in the Bronx are improving but more progress is necessary.  Community banks will play a key role in spurring this progress, so it is essential that they remain financially sound and engaged.  The financial crisis provides many lessons for how banks can thrive even in turbulent economic conditions.  The vitality of the Bronx and other communities depends on the ability of entrepreneurs to establish and grow new businesses.  While access to credit is important, success depends on a wide range of factors, and we need to make sure new business owners have the help they need to prosper.\n\n1 Jason Bram, Christopher Calabia, Tony Davis, Jacqueline Fenton, Claire Kramer Mills, Don Morgan, James Orr, Joseph Tracy and Luis Uranga assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 The Importance of Community Banking: A Conversation with Chairman Ben Bernanke , Community Banking Connections, Third Quarter 2012\n\n3 The Future of Community Banks: Lessons Learned from Banks That Thrived During the Recent Financial Crisis by  R.

    "text": "Thank you all for being here to commemorate the opening of the centennial exhibit for the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the Museum of American Finance, just a few blocks from the New York Fed’s landmark head office at 33 Liberty Street.  I would like to say thank you to our friends at the Museum for their work and interest in the Fed and for supporting us in organizing this event.\n\nBefore making some brief remarks about the centennial, I would also like to acknowledge some of the people in attendance tonight.  We have two former New York Fed presidents here this evening: Jerry Corrigan and Bill McDonough.\n\nI met Jerry, the seventh president of the Bank, when I was still wet behind the ears.  I was just out of graduate school at the Board of Governors in Washington, but Jerry was already a force to be reckoned with and a part of Paul Volcker’s inner circle.  Jerry’s tenure as president had many memorable moments, including the October 1987 stock market “break”.  Jerry, of course, was instrumental in working with then Chairman Alan Greenspan in devising a response to provide liquidity to the market, and an episode that could have ended in financial crisis soon passed.  Jerry also tackled many other difficult issues during his tenure, including the Latin-American debt crisis and the development of the first Basel accord.\n\nWe also have Bill McDonough, the eighth president of the Bank, who built on the accomplishments of Jerry’s tenure, and made great strides in connecting the New York Fed to the broader region.  At the same time, he helped ensure that the Federal Reserve was prepared to face new, salient challenges presented by developments in the global economic and financial landscape.  During his tenure, the city, the country and the Bank experienced a very significant crisis on September 11, 2001.  Under Bill’s leadership, New York Fed staff worked tirelessly on Liberty Street, supporting the efforts of first responders, while ensuring that financial markets continued to operate and serve their vital function in the U.S. and global economy.\n\nA number of the members of our Board of Directors, including Chairwoman Rafferty, are with us, as is  one of the Federal Reserve’s friends from the international central banking community: Mervyn King, the recent head of the Bank of England.  Mervyn and his wife recently moved to New York City, so we should extend  a warm welcome to them.  For Mervyn, I am guessing that one hundred years may not seem like a long time, given that the Bank of England is over 300 years old, but I am sure he will graciously allow us our moment.  We are also joined by many other friends and associates of the New York Fed, and a great number of our current and former staff.\n\nFor 100 years the Federal Reserve has been an essential contributor to American economic prosperity and stability and that record is reflected in this fascinating exhibit.  Rather than focus on its achievements during my brief remarks this evening, I thought I’d highlight what I think makes the institution that I have the honor of leading, the New York Fed, such a remarkable place within this extraordinary System.\n\nFirst, we are a bank within government.  That means we not only have researchers, supervisors and market analysts, but we also provide banking services and possess significant operational capabilities.  We accept deposits, make loans and operate the System Open Market Account for the Federal Open Market Committee.  When exigent and unusual circumstances require extraordinary operations, be it in a financial crisis or to implement unconventional monetary policies, we stand ready.  Our operational capabilities complement our more conventional central bank policy role in a way that is, I think, very special within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSecond, the New York Fed is a vital component of the international role played by the Federal Reserve System.  This can be seen in our Central Bank International Account Services, where we have more than $3 trillion in foreign assets under our management.  Some of those assets glisten on the bedrock of Manhattan.  The gold vault at 33 Liberty Street remains the world’s largest depository of monetary gold held on behalf of foreign governments, central banks and official international organizations.   This international orientation was also very much in evidence during the crisis as we negotiated foreign exchange swap agreements with a number of foreign central banks and then operationalized the provision of dollar liquidity worldwide through a coordinated system of dollar auctions.\n\nThird, and perhaps most importantly, we have an unusually talented and dedicated group of people working at the Bank who are committed to promoting the mission of the institution and serving the public interest.  While we may not, on occasion, be as nimble as we might like, the attitude of our staff is to always find a way, to do whatever it takes (within the law and the scope of our responsibilities, of course), and to not rest until we have come up with the best plan of action.  That attitude was most clearly and publicly evident during the Bank’s response to the financial crisis, where we played a critical role within the System in preventing a financial panic from turning into a world-wide depression.  We continue to display that spirit each and every day at the Bank.\n\nAnd it is that attitude, ability and esprit de corps that will no doubt allow us and the System to meet the important challenges on the road ahead.  I will focus briefly on a few such challenges:\n\nThe first will be on the monetary policy front.  The Federal Reserve has engaged in a set of unconventional monetary policies in recent years.  These policies have been necessary because the FOMC could not ease monetary policy further by conventional means—the federal funds rate was constrained by the so-called “zero lower bound”.   Exit from these unconventional set of policies is certainly feasible—the ability to pay interest on excess reserves gives us a viable tool to manage monetary policy even with an enlarged balance sheet, and the New York Fed is prepared to execute on this mission, as we always are.  But we do have to be a bit humble about what we don’t know. There will undoubtedly be communications and operational challenges and unexpected consequences.  We will need to be sufficiently agile so that we can best achieve our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.\n\nThe second challenge for us at the New York Fed, and within the regulatory community more generally, will be in staying the course and implementing a regulatory regime in which no institutions are “too big to fail” (TBTF).  TBTF is wrong for several reasons.  It creates an unfair disparity between large and small institutions. In addition to being unfair, it creates greater risks to financial stability by encouraging greater size and complexity.  We have made considerable progress toward ending TBTF—raising capital and liquidity requirements for the largest, most systemic banks—but there is a ways to go.  In particular, to paraphrase former New York Fed President Tim Geithner, while the single point of entry concept “beats no plan”, significant barriers to achieving a cross border resolution remain, and there are still insufficient incentives in place for firms to take corrective actions early on to prevent their failure in the first place.\n\nThe third challenge for the Federal Reserve is to put financial stability on par with monetary policy.  As our experience from 2007 to 2009 has demonstrated, monetary policy cannot work properly when there is financial instability. When financial instability occurs, it disturbs market functioning and can impair bank balance sheets in a way that disrupts their financial intermediation function, constraining the availability of credit for households and businesses. This, in turn, can lead to further reductions in aggregate demand that put additional stress on the weakened financial system.  Financial stability cannot be subordinated to any other priority.\n\nThe fourth challenge is to sustain and enhance the capabilities of the New York Fed.  This starts most obviously in continuing to attract, develop and retain the best people.  But it also extends to tending to the so-called culture of the institution—for example, ensuring that good ideas rise to the top no matter where they originate, and that people feel comfortable to challenge the conventional wisdom.\n\nThese challenges are energizing, and that’s why being president of the New York Fed is the greatest job in the world.  And I am confident that, because of the talent and dedication of our staff, the New York Fed will succeed in surmounting the challenges it faces now and will face over the next 100 years.\n\nAnd to drive home the point of our staff’s dedication, I would like to highlight the efforts of one person, Rosemary Lazenby, who has made this exhibit possible.  Rosemary is the longest tenured employee at the Bank—55 years—she is our resident historian and curator and she has delayed her retirement in order to develop this centennial exhibit.  Her efforts are just another example of what really glistens at 33 Liberty Street (and I am not referring to the gold in our vault).  Thank you Rosemary, and thank you all for coming out this this evening to enjoy the centennial exhibit.",

    "text": "Good morning and welcome once again  to the New York Fed's Quarterly Regional Economic Press Briefing. I am pleased  to have this opportunity to talk with the journalists covering our region—and  through you, to the people in our District. This morning I will discuss  national and regional economic conditions, with particular attention to  household debt in the nation and especially in the Second Federal Reserve  District, which covers New York; northern New Jersey; Fairfield County,  Connecticut; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Following my remarks, my  colleagues will provide more detail. As always, what I have to say reflects my  own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the  Federal Reserve System. National Economic Conditions To provide context, let me first  comment on national economic conditions. Since the Great Recession ended in  2009, the economy has grown at a modest pace. When we last met, in October, the  available data showed that we hit a soft patch at mid-year. The recovery had  slowed, extending the time before employment and inflation could be expected to  return to levels consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. And, with  the loss of economic momentum, downside risks had increased.\n\nIn order to foster greater economic  momentum, reduce downside risks and speed up the return to more normal levels  of unemployment and inflation, in early November the Federal Reserve announced  its intention to purchase $600 billion of Treasury securities. These purchases helped  to ease financial conditions, thereby stimulating economic activity.\n\nMore recently, we have seen signs  of a pick-up in the pace of growth, with activity in the second half of 2010  turning out to be considerably stronger than most analysts expected. Real final  sales grew at a 4 percent annual rate over the second half of 2010, up from 1  percent over the first half, led by surprisingly strong growth of consumer  spending, continued strong growth of exports and slower but still healthy  growth of business fixed investment.\n\nSeveral notable forces combined to  encourage the resumption of stronger growth. On the policy side, as I  mentioned, the Federal Open Market Committee provided further stimulus through  purchasing Treasury securities. This, plus the lagged effects of its previous  measures, helped to improve financial conditions. Also, the Board of Governors'  Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicates that, while the absolute level of  lending standards remains tight, banks did begin to ease standards somewhat in  the second half of 2010.\n\nThe pick-up in the economy has  occurred despite renewed weakness in the housing market. Home prices have  softened anew and construction activity remains stuck at a very low level,  likely reflecting the continued large supply of unsold homes. We believe that  it will take more time, perhaps as much as another year, for enough of these  homes to be bought that residential construction might begin a meaningful  recovery.\n\nOn the labor front, the most recent  employment report for January 2011 is quite difficult to interpret. Only 36,000  nonfarm payroll jobs were added, well below expectations. Yet, we get a very  different perspective from the unemployment rate, which fell by 0.4 percentage  points for the second month in a row and now stands at 9.0 percent. Job growth  was undoubtedly held down by the severe winter storms that affected many major  cities, including our own. The decline in the jobless rate was not an  unmitigated positive, as a significant part of this decline was due to fewer people  looking for work.\n\nThus, neither the disappointingly  slow job growth nor the welcome steep drop in unemployment seems to paint the  full picture. The truth lies somewhere in between. Despite the stronger job  growth that we expect in the months ahead, we will continue to have a  substantial amount of slack in our labor markets that will take time to absorb.\n\nAt this point, while the soft patch  is over and the risk of a double dip has subsided, the economy still faces  headwinds as a result of the aftermath of the financial crisis, the housing  bust and the high level of unemployment that still prevails. As banks and other  financial institutions seek to strengthen their balance sheets and avoid future  credit losses, they may keep credit conditions tighter than normal. In  addition, many consumers' borrowing options may be limited by their impaired  credit histories, and the recovery is not getting the strong boost from home  construction that most previous recoveries have benefited from. Furthermore, as  I will discuss later, households are still feeling the financial impact of lost  wealth and jobs, which makes some cautious about spending and investing.\n\nThe economy is healthier, but it is  not yet well. In order to reduce joblessness significantly over the coming  quarters, the economy needs to grow at a considerably faster rate than we have  seen so far in this recovery.\n\nI am happy to say that we believe  that conditions are in place for such higher growth in 2011 and 2012. We  entered this year with a fair amount of momentum. Business and household  spending has strengthened, presumably reflecting greater confidence in the  economic outlook and progress in the repair of household balance sheets.  Businesses are expanding their investments in equipment and software at a  healthy pace. And, their spending on nonresidential structures, such as office  and factory space is no longer contracting as sharply as it was a year ago.  Further support comes from the agreement by Congress and the administration to  postpone some tax increases, to reduce payroll taxes temporarily and to extend  unemployment benefits. In addition, our exports continue to expand, supported  by strength in demand abroad, particularly in Asia.\n\nHigher growth, a steady reduction  in spare capacity in the economy and continued stability in inflation  expectations should also slowly begin to reverse the recent decline in core  inflation. Inflation was quite low during the second half of 2010, but we  expect that to be the low point of the cycle.\n\nIn short, viewed through the lens  of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate—the pursuit of the highest level of  employment consistent with price stability—the current situation remains  unsatisfactory. However, we appear now to be moving in the right direction.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions  (update since the October regional press briefing) Now, how is our region doing?  Overall—in contrast to the pick-up in the nation—the regional economic recovery  appears to have paused in the fourth quarter. More similar to the nation,  joblessness in the region has retreated somewhat from the peaks recorded toward  the end of 2009, but remains unacceptably high.\n\nAs attendees at previous regional  press briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces Indexes of Coincident  Economic Indicators to help monitor the performance of the regional economy.\n\nBased on these measures, the upturn  in economic activity that we saw for much of 2010 in both New York State and  New York City has paused. To be sure, activity in both the state and the city  is higher than a year ago, but we saw no increase over the prior quarter. This  pause is particularly evident in New York City where the economic recovery had  been relatively strong. By the way, let me note that this pause occurred before  mid-December, so it cannot be attributed to the recent spate of heavy snow  storms.\n\nBy contrast, New Jersey's economy  has seen no pick-up in activity and, in fact, activity there continued to  decline at a modest pace through the end of 2010.\n\nWe monitor Puerto Rico using an  index produced by the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico. This index  shows that the recession there, which started back in 2005—well before that  experienced in the mainland—appears to have subsided. As of November of last  year, activity was no longer falling, although indications of a recovery are  still mixed.\n\nTurning to jobs, the latest data  indicate that businesses in the region, on balance, were not expanding their  workforces at the end of last year. As a result, the total number of jobs in  the region has held steady, lagging behind the job growth rate experienced  nationally.\n\nMuch of this recent weakness in  employment stems from job losses in the retail, wholesale and manufacturing  sectors in our region. In the rest of the nation, these sectors expanded during  the last quarter. Moreover, our state and local governments cut jobs much more  severely than governments did elsewhere.\n\nAt the same time, job gains in some  of the region's strongest sectors—professional and business services, finance,  education and health—were not large enough to completely offset these losses.  At this point, it is difficult to say whether the recent pause in job growth is  short-lived or not. As such, we will continue to closely monitor our region's  job situation.\n\nMeanwhile, unemployment rates have  ticked down across the region. Given the disappointing job numbers, it is not  surprising that this change is largely due to a decline in labor force  participation. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the labor force of both New York  and New Jersey declined by about 0.3 percentage points, meaning that fewer  people were actively seeking work. December's unemployment rate in New York and  New Jersey, at 8.2 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively, were below the  national jobless rate of 9.4 percent for that month, though these rates remain  painfully high. Puerto Rico's 15.7 percent unemployment rate, although down  from its high of over 17 percent, still shows little evidence of a sustained  improvement.\n\nOverview of Household  Debt during the Crisis Now, let me turn to this session's  special topic: household debt. This topic provides an important lens into  economic conditions in our country and our region. How families are adjusting  their saving, borrowing and spending in the aftermath the mortgage crisis and  the Great Recession will help shape the path of the recovery.\n\nHere at the Federal Reserve, we try  to answer questions such as: what is happening to households' credit, debt and  delinquencies and what economic consequences will that have? This monitoring  and research on household debt and credit conditions helps us better understand  the connections between financial market developments, the broader economy and  families' well-being. We follow a variety of metrics, including lending  activity, the level of interest rates and of interest rate spreads, survey data  on lending standards, delinquency rates on loans, and home and other asset  price changes.\n\nOne new, key source of information  on household debt and credit conditions is the New York Fed's Consumer Credit  Panel. As you heard a few moments ago, these data are now available for all of  2010. They come from a nationwide sample covering all households where at least  one member has a credit report. The records tell us about five major categories  of household debt—mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and credit card, auto  and student loans.\n\nTo set the stage, one can think  about the recent path of household debt in three phases.\n\nThe nature of the run-up to the  crisis has been well-documented, so let me focus here on the latter two phases:  the crisis and convalescence.\n\nDuring the crisis, weakness in the  housing market contributed to financial strains as many families found that  their mortgages were \"underwater,\" that is, their homes were now worth less than  their mortgage balances. As a result, they had no financial buffer they could  tap if their finances came under stress. And, as the economy weakened further,  many households faced sharply reduced incomes as family members lost their jobs  or had their work hours cut. So, more families found it difficult to pay their  credit card bills and other debt obligations on time.\n\nAs a consequence of these strains,  households began the painful process of deleveraging. They started reducing the  amount of debt they owed, relative to their income. During the run-up to the  recession, households were saving only about 2 percent of their income; now  they are saving around 6 percent of their incomes. This increase in saving was  mostly used to pay down their debts, but it also included adding to their  savings accounts and borrowing less. Of course some of the reduction in debt  reflects loan charge-offs of bad debts. But work done here with the Consumer  Credit Panel shows that some consumers also became more frugal, rebuilding their  net wealth by paying down their debts. These actions enabled families to  rebuild their financial reserves—precautionary funds that could be used in the  event of a job loss or illness—to maintain their consumption and keep up with  their mortgage payments. But to save more, it also means that they had to  consume less, which dampened economic activity further.\n\nInterestingly, student loans are  the only part of household debt that continued to rise throughout the crisis.  More families and students may have needed to rely on loans to fund education  during the difficult times. And going to school was more attractive for some,  given the deterioration in labor market conditions.\n\nJust as households began  deleveraging during the crisis, banks needed to respond in light of the large  loan losses that they were taking. As defaults rose, banks tightened their  underwriting standards and raised the margins that they charged on loans. As a  consequence, they made fewer loans. This tightening of credit availability  exacerbated the decline in real activity. It created an \"adverse feedback loop\"  between the financial and real sectors of the economy that deepened the  recession.\n\nWhere are we now? There are several signs that we are  now convalescing; this damaging dynamic—the adverse feedback loop—now appears  to be reversing. From historical experience with financial crises we know that  this phase is a gradual transition process—not a quick event—as households and  banks slowly complete their painful adjustments. Once the adjustments are  completed, households can consume more and regain their access to credit, and  these developments help to support a more vigorous economic recovery.\n\nOf course, we don't yet know  precisely where we are in this adjustment process. For example, families may  choose a permanently higher rate of saving in order to rebuild their retirement  savings. What they decide to do will depend in part on their expectations for  future income, their outlook for the economy, what they think will happen to  housing and stock prices, and prospects for taxes and benefits such as social  security and Medicare payments. However, we do know that during good times few  households are likely to be delinquent on their bills. And, overall, we'd  expect their borrowing to grow at least modestly as the economy strengthens.\n\nThe Household Debt and Credit  Report released today indicates that there has been a pick-up in credit flows.  Households increased their non-mortgage debt last quarter, a development not  seen since the fourth quarter of 2008. The number of credit card applications  increased—an indication of a pick-up in consumer demand for credit. And, the  number of open credit card accounts also increased slightly—as more accounts  were opened than were closed. Of course, signs of distress continued:  households are still reducing their housing-related debt and delinquencies  continue to be a problem. So, the adjustments remain far from complete.\n\nIt is  encouraging that credit flows are no longer contracting because households'  renewed demand for credit has no doubt supported some of the recent rise in  consumer spending.\n\nTrends in Household  Debt in the Region One key question we'll address  today is how this process is playing out for households in our region. In  general, our region has fared well in comparison to the nation as a whole.  Following the three phases of the cycle that I noted for the nation, I will  consider three questions:\n\nOne reason that households in  our region have weathered this credit cycle relatively well is that debt levels  are lower relative to income and this debt rose more modestly in the run-up to  recession than in the nation as a whole. Using the debt-to-income ratio to help  us make meaningful comparisons across different geographies, debt levels are  particularly low in upstate New York and New York City. Three key exceptions to  this generalization are Long Island, Edison, New Jersey and Puerto Rico, where  household debt-to-income ratios have risen to levels above the U.S.  average.\n\nSince the vast majority of  household debt is related to housing, it is not surprising that debt-to-income  ratios were highest and rose most in places that experienced rapid rises in  home prices. So, for example, debt-to-income ratios are among the highest in  the nation in those places most associated with the housing bubble, such as  California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nThis relationship can also be  seen within our region. For example, household debt grew more slowly than  nationally and has remained relatively low in upstate New York, which was  largely bypassed by the housing boom. The key exception is New York City, where  a large share of residents rent their homes. Overall, city residents still have  relatively low levels of mortgage debt, even though these debt levels rose  during the run-up to the recession. Elsewhere in the region, debt levels tended  to rise most in places where housing prices increased the most, such as Long  Island and parts of New Jersey.\n\nDuring the crisis, in most parts  of our region, households reduced their debts. But, because they had not  accumulated as much during the run-up, the decline was well below the national  average. In general, households in our region—with some exceptions that I will  mention in a moment—have not been under as much pressure to deleverage. It's  particularly notable that in upstate New York, where debt levels are well below  the national level, households have actually continued to very slowly add to  their debt. Clearly, deleveraging has not been particularly consequential for  many upstate New York households. The deleveraging process in other parts of  New York and New Jersey, while quite severe by historic standards, has proved  milder than elsewhere in the nation.\n\nNevertheless, many families in  the region have had to make painful adjustments to their spending in order to  pay down debts. These families tend to be concentrated in neighborhoods where  households took on more debt during the run-up or sustained more severe income  losses during the crisis. These factors contribute to delinquency rates that  run well above average in certain areas, including certain parts of New York  City and Long Island. In fact, some neighborhoods in these areas now have  delinquency rates two to three times the national rate.\n\nLooking forward, we see some  signs that the region is turning the corner on the credit cycle. After  declining during the crisis, credit applications have begun to increase,  suggesting that the demand for credit is rising. Although housing debt is still  declining and delinquencies are still high, households in many parts of the  region have sought and taken on some new debt in recent months. In particular,  auto debt has been rising over the past year across New York, northern New  Jersey and Puerto Rico—a signal that households in the region once again want  to increase spending on durable goods, and are willing and able to borrow to do  so. Conclusion To sum up, although the national  economy experienced a pick-up in activity during the last quarter of 2010, the  region saw a pause. The loss of momentum locally is disappointing because until  the fourth quarter, much of the region was recovering somewhat faster than the  nation. However, I would not be overly discouraged by this. After all, soft  patches are not uncommon during economic recoveries. Both nationally and  regionally, unemployment remains stubbornly high, but many indicators suggest  that conditions are in place for stronger growth in the coming months.\n\nWith respect to debt, households in  most parts of the region are in better shape than the nation as a whole. They  increased their debt burdens less during the boom and thus have had less need  to deleverage. In addition, there are emerging signs both nationally and  regionally that consumers have begun to spend more and appear willing to take  on some new debt. This bodes well for another step forward in terms of economic  momentum in the nation and the region. However, high delinquencies in New York  City and Long Island are a reminder that many households remain under  significant stress.",

    "text": "Good afternoon.  It is always a pleasure to speak with the different communities that make up our region, and it is especially gratifying to have the opportunity to speak with you, our future leaders.  So thank you for inviting me.\n\nI am especially pleased to be here at CUNY (City University of New York) Queens College, given the relationship that we have developed with CUNY through our educational and regional outreach.  This academic year we are hosting, at the Bank, a Queens College student participating in the CUNY Service Corps which is a program to provide students with work experiences in regional and economic outreach.  We also collaborated with CUNY for this year’s College Fed Challenge , our yearly competition where teams of students from area universities take on the roles of the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and debate the appropriate next step for U.S. monetary policy. A number of CUNY schools competed and professors served as judges, including your own Professor Thom Thurston.\n\nMy meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy and to share what we are seeing. Earlier today, I met with a number of Queens business leaders, and the leadership of HANAC, the Hellenic American Action Committee.  Following this visit to Queens College, I’m headed to the Queens Chamber of Commerce to meet with others in the business community.  Subsequently, I’ll tour the manufacturing floor of Steinway & Sons piano factory.\n\nThe agenda for these visits is always packed, but that’s part of the point—to meet with a diverse array of people in order to get a comprehensive picture of economic conditions and issues in the regions we serve and a fuller understanding of the major concerns. This is our second trip to the Borough of Queens in the past few years and recent trips have also taken us throughout our District, to Upstate New York, Northern New Jersey, Long Island, Fairfield County, Staten Island, Brooklyn and the Bronx.\n\nThese outreach trips complement the ongoing efforts of the New York Fed to assess conditions in our region, which I will discuss shortly. Among our activities, we monitor economic performance on a monthly basis, we tap into the insights of the members of our Small Business and Agriculture Advisory Council and Upstate Advisory Board, we have constructed a consumer credit panel that allows us to better understand the financial condition of homeowners and students, we have developed a “Regional Mortgage Conditions” dataset and other housing tools at the county and zip code level to ensure that policymakers and counselors are well informed, and we conduct a biannual poll of small businesses to understand their credit needs and availability. Interestingly, our most recent poll, released in May of this year, shows improvements in small businesses’ ability to get credit throughout the region, though it remains a major growth challenge for these types of firms.\n\nAs you can see, we have a lot to keep us engaged with the region. Much of this information can be found on our website, which I would invite you to visit and use as a resource.\n\nNow, I’d like to review recent developments in the local and national economies, and at the end of my talk will be happy to answer any questions you have.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nStarting with the area’s economy, one of the greatest challenges in the City over the past year has been the massive disruption and destruction caused by Superstorm Sandy.  While areas of the New York City metropolitan region were hard hit by the storm, the devastation was particularly severe along the waterfronts of Queens—and in particular in Far Rockaway.  We saw and heard about the devastation of the storm first-hand from many of those affected, through a series of support clinics that we held in the storm’s immediate aftermath, as well as from many of our own employees who lived in some of the hardest hit areas.\n\nThe good news is that a little more than one-year later there has been a significant rebound in employment and economic activity across the five boroughs.  New York City has continued to see pretty solid job creation through this past summer, and, in stark contrast with past economic expansions, this is happening without any direct contribution from the securities industry—or, more colloquially, Wall Street.  So far this year, the city’s job gains have been broad-based, led by strong growth in industries such as education and health, advertising, computer services, leisure and hospitality, wholesale and retail trade, and, especially, construction.\n\nOf course, while it is reassuring that most of the city has bounced back strongly from this historic natural disaster, it is important to remember that the hardest hit communities, and the residents and businesses there, who lost so much, are still struggling to recover.  Many of those communities are right here in Queens: the whole Rockaway peninsula—from Breezy Point to Arverne—was completely flooded, as were neighborhoods like Howard Beach, Springfield Gardens, Lindenwood, and even parts of Flushing, Long Island City, Astoria and Maspeth.  Still, Queens as a whole showed strong resilience—employment bounced back from Sandy fairly quickly, and as of early 2013 it had already surpassed its pre-Sandy level.\n\nWhile many residents here commute to work in other boroughs, primarily Manhattan, Queens has a formidable industrial base of its own.  Jobs are prevalent in industries ranging from medical care to construction, not to mention printing and a number of other manufacturing industries that benefit from being in a large population center.  But Queens’ most concentrated industry is transportation—specifically air transportation which employs about 27,000 workers, about five percent of Queens’ jobs.\n\nEducation is another key industry in Queens and the city as a whole. And it is not just a job creator. The investment in human capital that education entails makes it a socially desirable activity.  There is considerable value from a college education both to the person that has been educated and to society as a whole.  The Great Recession and sluggish recovery that has followed has made it difficult for people to find jobs, and I’m sure you may be wondering about whether going to college will turn out to be a good investment, especially if faced with the burden of student debt, something we track quite closely.\n\nLet me reassure you, the benefits of a college degree remain significant.  Research we have undertaken at the New York Fed shows that young people with a college degree are more likely to have a job and they tend to earn considerably higher wages than those without degrees—and this is true even for those who may be underemployed initially when they first enter the labor market after graduation.  Although the labor market has been challenging for college graduates in recent years, I am confident that most will find work and transition into higher-skilled jobs as they gain experience and as the labor market improves.\n\nNow, I’d like to turn my attention to recent developments in the national economy.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nLet me begin by taking stock of where we are at the moment. Then I will address my expectations for the performance of the economy in 2014 and 2015.\n\nSince the end of what is now called the Great Recession in mid-2009, the U.S. economy has experienced 17 consecutive calendar quarters of positive growth of real GDP. However, the compound annual rate of growth over that period has only been around 2 ¼ percent, close to prevailing estimates of the economy’s potential growth rate. Thus, we have made limited progress in closing the substantial output gap that was created during the recession.\n\nA similar conclusion is drawn from an assessment of labor market conditions. Although the unemployment rate has declined by about 2 ¾ percentage points since peaking at 10 percent in October of 2009, a significant portion of that decline reflects the substantial decline of the labor force participation rate over that period. It should also be noted that since the previous business cycle peak at the end of 2007, the decline of the labor force participation rate has been more than accounted for by a decline in participation of people in the prime working age of 25 to 54.\n\nThe inflation data are also consistent with this overall picture of an economy operating well below its full potential. Total inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, has been quite volatile in recent years due to sharp fluctuations in energy prices. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components and thereby may be a better guide as to underlying inflation, slowed from around 2 percent in early 2012 to just above 1 percent in mid-2013. In recent months it has shown signs of stabilizing, but remains well below the FOMC’s expressed goal of 2 percent for total inflation. Fortunately, inflation expectations remain relatively stable at levels somewhat above the current inflation rate. This stability should help prevent an undesirable further drop in inflation relative to our 2 percent objective.\n\nThat said, there are some nascent signs that the economy may be doing better.  For example, based on the first estimate, which is subject to revision, real (gross domestic product) GDP increased at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2013, above the trend of the past four years.  And the most recent payroll employment report showed a pickup in the monthly pace of job gains.  The 3-month moving average rose back above a 200,000 pace after slowing to about 150,000 as of July of this year.  I hope that this marks a turning point for the economy.\n\nBut before we rush to this conclusion a few more cautionary comments are appropriate.   With respect to GDP growth, it turns out that inventory investment contributed ¾ of a percentage point to that overall growth rate. Thus, because this impetus from inventories will likely reverse this quarter, the real GDP growth rate is likely to slow to around a 2 percent annual rate or a bit less in the fourth quarter. With respect to payroll employment, we have seen such bursts in payroll growth before over the past few years and have been disappointed when the pickups proved temporary and did not lead to a rise in the overall growth rate.\n\nBut, I have to admit that I am getting more hopeful.  Not only do we have some better data in hand, but also the fiscal drag, which has been holding the economy back, is likely to abate considerably over the next few years at the same time that the fundamental underpinnings of the economy are improving.\n\nThe first thing to note is that federal fiscal policy in 2013 has been unusually contractionary.  At the beginning of the year the payroll tax cut expired while tax rates on higher income households were raised, a series of taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act took effect, and spending was reduced due to the sequester and the gradual winding down of foreign military operations.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the cyclically-adjusted or full-employment budget balance increased by roughly 1 ¾ percentage points of GDP in fiscal year 2013. Over the past 50 years there have been only two other episodes of fiscal contraction of this order of magnitude, and both of those occurred when the unemployment rate was substantially lower than it has been of late.  Under current law, the amount of federal fiscal restraint will decline in 2014 and then decline further in 2015.  At the same time, the sustained contraction in spending and employment by state and local governments appears to be over.\n\nThe fact that the U.S. economy has continued to grow at around a 2 percent pace in 2013 despite this quite intense fiscal restraint provides evidence to the second key point, which is that the private sector of the economy has largely completed its healing process and is now poised to ramp up its level of activity. Key measures of household leverage have declined and are now near the lowest levels they have been in well over a decade. Household net worth, expressed as a percent of disposable income, has increased back to its average of the previous decade, reflecting rising equity and home prices and declining debt. Recently, banks have eased credit standards somewhat after a prolonged period of tightness. As a result, we are now experiencing a fairly typical cyclical recovery of consumer spending on durable goods. For example, sales of light-weight motor vehicles have increased steadily over the past four years, reaching an annual rate of 15.7 million in the third quarter of 2013, though sales in September and October have been somewhat below that average.\n\nSimilarly, after five years in which housing production was well below what is consistent with underlying demographic trends and the replacement demand for houses, it now appears that we have worked off the excess supply of housing built up during the boom years of the last decade. Housing market activity has begun to recover, and a widely followed national home price index is up 12 percent over the 12 months ending in September. 1 Anecdotal reports suggest that this higher-than-expected increase in home prices is due to a relatively low number of homes for sale.  Due to this shortness of supply, there is reason to expect increases in starts going forward.\n\nYet another bright spot on the horizon is the fact that growth prospects among our major trading partners have improved following a few years of lackluster performance which induced a sharp slowing of growth of U.S. exports. In particular, the euro area appears to have emerged from a protracted recession and is experiencing modest but positive growth.\n\nTo summarize, while growth in 2013 has been disappointing, I believe a good case can be made that the pace of growth will pick up some in 2014 and then somewhat more in 2015. The private sector of the economy should continue to heal, while the amount of fiscal drag should subside. Despite near-term concerns, growth prospects among our major trading partners will improve further next year. This combination of events is likely to create an environment in which business investment spending will strengthen. As growth picks up, I expect to see more substantial improvement in labor market conditions and a gradual updrift in inflation back towards the FOMC’s target rate.\n\nHowever, the notion that the economy will grow more swiftly remains a forecast rather than a reality at this point. As is always the case, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding this forecast. Moreover, there is always the possibility of some unforeseen shock. Thus, we will continue to monitor U.S. and global economic conditions very carefully and will adjust our views on the likely path for growth, inflation and the unemployment rate accordingly.\n\nThank you for your kind attention and I will now be happy to take some questions.\n\n1 Based on the CoreLogic home price index including distressed sales.",

    "text": "It  is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today on the important  topic of financial regulatory reform.  As  always, what I have to say reflects my views and not necessarily those of the  Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nA  robust financial system is central to our economic well-being.  The financial crisis and the Great Recession  wreaked havoc on millions of American households and businesses, and much of  this damage was due to a flawed regulatory framework.  In particular, many large banks and  securities firms had inadequate capital and liquidity buffers, and the  financial system had a number of important structural weaknesses that made it  vulnerable to stress.  In response,  legislators and regulators made significant changes to strengthen our  regulatory framework.  Importantly, as we  consider further changes, we must avoid throwing the baby out with the  bathwater.\n\nAs  I see it, an effective regulatory regime for the financial system must do three  things:\n\nIn  contemplating changes to the regulatory regime, the good news is that the U.S.  financial system is much sounder today than it was on the eve of the financial  crisis.  The quantity and quality of  capital and liquidity for U.S. banks have markedly improved, meaning that the  banking industry can support the economy even under considerably more adverse  economic conditions.  And, although  returns on equity have dropped as balance sheet leverage has declined, banks  remain profitable enough to cover their cost of capital and continue to serve  their household and business customers.\n\nMuch  of this progress is due to regulatory changes enacted since the crisis.  In addition to buttressing the capital and  liquidity standards for major banks, the regulatory community has made  significant strides in many other areas.   We developed a resolution framework for systemically important banks  that better enables a failing bank to recapitalize with less risk to the rest  of the financial system, and in a way that should not require taxpayer  assistance.  We reformed key segments of  the financial system such as the money market mutual fund industry.  We reduced the aggregate risk in the system  by mandating the centralized clearing of OTC derivatives.  And, we strengthened the prudential oversight  of those systemically important financial market utilities (FMUs) that clear  such activity.  Collectively, these  reforms make the system more robust and resilient to the failure of a large,  systemically important institution.   Thus, we have made considerable progress toward ending a regime in which  some financial firms were “too big to fail.”   We want to avoid the unfortunate situation where authorities are faced  with a Hobson’s choice: save a failing firm to prevent it from taking down the  entire financial system, or allow the firm to fail but risk the collapse of the  financial system.\n\nNearly  a decade ago, we suffered the worst financial and economic crisis since the  Great Depression.  In fact, we were  perilously close to experiencing another depression.  The harm the crisis caused Americans can only  be described as catastrophic.  From  November 2008 to April 2009, the economy lost an average of 700,000 jobs per  month.  Total employment in the United States  fell by nine million jobs, and the unemployment rate rose to more than 10  percent.  There was also a broad-based  decline in home prices—about 30 percent on average, nationally.  As a result, nearly 8 million foreclosures  occurred, and the homeownership rate declined to levels not seen since the late  1980s.\n\nThe  crisis exposed many significant structural weaknesses in the U.S. and global  financial systems.  Among them:\n\nWe  should never forget how close we came to a full-blown depression, and we must  resolve to never allow a return to conditions like those that existed prior to  the financial crisis.\n\nThat  said, it is entirely appropriate to take a critical look at the changes that  were made to the regulatory regime.   While we do not yet have evidence of how these reforms will hold up  during the next economic downturn, many have been in place long enough that we  can begin to evaluate their efficacy.\n\nIn  such an evaluation, we should keep in mind the three goals I mentioned in my  introduction.  First, we must ensure that  the probability of failure for a systemically important firm is exceedingly  low.  Such a failure can lead to  contagion that can damage a broad set of financial market participants, and  impede the ability of the financial system to support the economy.  The failure of a single systemically  important firm—because of its size and interconnectedness—can significantly  weaken the entire financial system.  We  saw this firsthand following the failure of Lehman Brothers.\n\nSecond,  if a systemically important firm does fail, we must have mechanisms in place to  minimize the damage to the rest of the financial system.  While we can make individual firms stronger,  more robust and less prone to failure, I expect that there will still  inevitably be failures in the future.  In  principle, we could make individual institutions completely bulletproof in all  possible environments. However, this would require such high levels of capital  and liquidity that it would likely make them uncompetitive in their ability to  provide financial services to their customers.\n\nThird,  we must keep in place the structural changes that have made the global  financial system less vulnerable to adverse shocks.\n\nSo,  what does this imply when we consider revisions to the Dodd-Frank Act and other  aspects of reform?\n\nCapital and  Liquidity Standards\n\nIt  is important to maintain appropriate capital and liquidity standards for large,  complex firms to mitigate external shocks and the risks they pose to the  economy.  In particular, we need to  maintain our focus on firms whose impairment would have significant negative  consequences for the rest of the financial system.  Effective capital and liquidity standards  help to limit these adverse consequences.   At the same time, they work against conferring a competitive advantage  to large banks from a perception that they may be too big to fail.  Accordingly, large financial firms have had  to more than double their stock of high-quality capital since the crisis.\n\nPrior  to the financial crisis, large financial firms were not required to hold  sufficient high-quality liquid assets to protect against runs, and, as a  result, several would have failed if not for extraordinary government  intervention.  Today, the liquidity  buffers for large financial firms have dramatically improved in terms of both  their size and quality.  This is due in  part to investors’ demands, but also to the efforts by regulators and  supervisors in the United States and abroad to develop appropriate liquidity  standards for large banking institutions.\n\nSome  have argued that capital standards alone would be sufficient to mitigate the  risks of failure.  I am not  convinced.  As I just noted, the crisis  clearly demonstrated the added importance of liquidity, as the firms that  failed appeared to have been appropriately capitalized based on traditional  regulatory metrics at the time.\n\nMoreover,  I strongly favor a system of capital and liquidity requirements that is  harmonized on a global basis.  Some  believe that the United States should no longer participate in international  forums—such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision—that discuss and  recommend minimum capital and liquidity standards for global banking  institutions.  The argument is made that these  international bodies are dictating to and constraining the choices of the  United States.  That is simply not the  case.  The Basel standards and other  international efforts actually benefit the United States and its banks.  In the preponderance of cases, agreements  struck in these forums raise international standards closer to existing U.S.  standards.  Establishing a more level  playing field enhances the competitiveness of internationally active U.S.  firms.  It also makes the global  financial system safer by ensuring that foreign banks are subject to  appropriate standards that cover their global operations.  This protects the U.S. households and  businesses that transact with these banks in the United States and abroad. 2\n\nAlso,  it is important to note that the recommendations of these international  standard-setters are not automatically legally binding in the United  States.  They do not go into effect  unless they are adopted by a U.S. authority acting under U.S. laws following an  administrative process. They are also subject to a period of public notice and  comment.  When appropriate, U.S.  authorities have adopted different standards than those proposed in  international forums.\n\nFinally,  following the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve developed a capital stress  testing supervisory program—known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and  Review (CCAR).  CCAR has become an  integral part of ensuring appropriate capital levels.  By imposing a discipline of forward-looking  capital assessment on our largest firms, CCAR helps protect the safety and  soundness of the largest financial institutions—and therefore the stability of  the entire financial system.\n\nThe  CCAR process consists of two parts.   First, the quantitative assessment evaluates whether a firm holds a  sufficiently large capital buffer so that it can continue to be a viable  financial intermediary even in a stressed market and macroeconomic  environment.  Second, the qualitative  assessment evaluates whether the firm’s risk management and capital planning  processes are well-developed and well-governed.   CCAR has helped to strengthen the capital levels of the largest  financial institutions, and has pushed these firms to steadily improve their  risk management and capital planning processes.\n\nResolution\n\nWe  also must have an effective resolution mechanism that allows a firm to fail  without threatening to bring down the entire financial system.  We are not quite there yet—given some of the  challenges in executing resolution on a cross-border basis—but we have made  significant progress.  In particular, I  would point to two developments that are especially important.\n\nThe  FDIC and the Federal Reserve have used the authority provided by Title I of the  Dodd-Frank Act to oversee the so-called “living will” process—the resolution  planning that large financial firms must do as a contingency for their  potential failure.  Developing living  wills necessitates that firms and regulators consider, in advance, how  bankruptcy can serve as the basis for resolution, and take actions to address  any obstacles to an orderly resolution under the bankruptcy code.  This effort has helped to reduce the  complexity of large financial firms and has made them better positioned to  enter bankruptcy without imposing large costs on society.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve recently finalized a rule that requires systemically important bank holding companies to have minimum levels of total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). Firms are expected to meet this requirement mainly via the issuance of long-term debt by the holding company parent. In  bankruptcy, this debt could be used to recapitalize these firms and would be  available to absorb any additional losses.\n\nThe  Dodd-Frank Act also created a “last resort” option for the resolution of a  large financial firm—Title II Orderly Liquidation Authority.  This authority can be triggered only in  special circumstances, and requires the action of a number of regulatory and  fiscal authorities.\n\nThere  is an understandable reluctance for the government to be directly involved in  resolving a large firm.  It creates the  perception that the largest firms get special advantages.  This is why many would prefer to eliminate  Title II and rely exclusively on a bankruptcy process. 3\n\nBut,  if we were to rely on ordinary bankruptcy rather than Title II for the  resolution of a systemically important financial firm, we would need to ensure  that the bankruptcy regime would work in a way that does not destabilize the  financial system.  First, such a regime  would need to enable a systemically important firm to initiate a resolution  strategy over a weekend while markets are closed so that the firm’s  subsidiaries could continue to operate.   Otherwise, the remaining franchise value of the troubled firm would  quickly evaporate and we would experience significant contagion across the  financial system.  Second, there would  need to be a credible liquidity backstop for the restructured firm in place by  Sunday evening when Asian markets open.   Many of the troubled firm’s counterparties would undoubtedly initially  run because the cost of doing so would be very small.  They would be especially likely to do so if  there were no credible liquidity backstop.   Debtor-in-possession financing would not be not a viable option because  it simply would not likely be available in a timely manner and on the  scale—potentially hundreds of billions of dollars—needed to fill the hole  created when counterparties run away from a systemically important financial  institution.\n\nThere  is also another difficulty.  In the event  of a financial holding company’s bankruptcy restructuring, there are limits on  the Federal Reserve’s ability to lend to subsidiaries that continue to  operate.  The Federal Reserve has the  legal authority to lend through the discount window against a subsidiary bank’s  high-quality collateral, with appropriate haircuts.  But, under existing laws and regulations, the  Federal Reserve cannot lend to the securities affiliates.  Moreover, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve  Act restricts the commercial bank subsidiary of a systemically important firm  from on-lending the funds borrowed from the Fed to its broker-dealer—even if  the broker-dealer has good collateral to pledge against the loan.\n\nPut  simply, in today’s legal and regulatory regime, there is a large potential  liquidity gap.  There is not a credible  liquidity backstop for a broker-dealer in bankruptcy.  In contrast, Title II provides for temporary  funding through the Orderly Liquidation Fund, which can support the resolution  of the recapitalized entity, including the broker-dealer.  This means that if one were to eliminate  Title II, one should develop an alternative means to provide a temporary,  comprehensive liquidity backstop to the restructured firm.\n\nReforms to  Market Structure\n\nWe  should also keep in place the key structural reforms of financial markets that  are making the financial system safer.   In my mind, the most important of these include money market mutual fund  reform, tri-party repo reform, and the mandate for the centralized clearing of  OTC derivatives.  In each case, the  post-crisis structural reforms have made the system more resilient to the  potential insolvency of a major financial institution.  As a result, the level of stress placed upon  the entire financial system by the failure of a single firm should be considerably  lessened.\n\nAs  part of this, we must maintain the capability for robust oversight of key  FMUs.  Centralized clearing is a  beneficial development for financial markets.   It reduces the amount of risk in the system by facilitating the netting  of exposures to the central clearing party.   As a result, centralized clearing makes the financial system more  resilient and enables greater efficiency and transparency for trading  counterparties.  However, the trade-off  for these benefits is that more residual risk is now concentrated in the  FMUs.  Consequently, it is important to  retain the protections contained in the regulatory framework provided by Title  VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act.  We must  ensure that FMUs are appropriately supervised and can withstand the failure of  one or two of their largest counterparties and continue to operate.\n\nWorth Another  Look\n\nSo,  what hasn’t worked as well as we might have expected, or might be less crucial  in light of the principles that I discussed earlier?\n\nFirst,  I would start with regulations for small and medium-sized banking  institutions.  As I discussed earlier, we  must ensure that the firms whose failure could impose the greatest costs on  ordinary borrowers and savers have the capital, liquidity and risk management  standards appropriate to that risk.  But,  the majority of banks in the United States do not come close to falling into  this category.  For smaller institutions,  the regulatory and compliance burdens can be considerably lighter because the  failure of such a firm will not impose large costs or stress on the broader  financial system.\n\nAlso,  we must recognize that smaller firms have less ability to spread added  compliance costs across their business.   All else equal, an increase in compliance burden can create an  unintended competitive advantage for larger institutions.  We should also recognize the important role  that smaller banking institutions have in supporting local communities around  the country.  The ability to lend to  local businesses often depends on close bank-customer relationships, and on  knowledge that is often difficult to develop when the home office is very  distant.\n\nThere  have been efforts by regulators at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere to reduce  the regulatory requirements for such institutions, and that is something that  we should continue to work on.  Lawmakers  could also evaluate statutory thresholds to see if they should be raised to  apply to fewer, larger institutions.  For  example, the Dodd-Frank Act sets a higher prudential regime for those firms  with $50 billion or more in assets.  I  believe that this threshold could be raised significantly without unduly  increasing the risk to the broader financial system.\n\nSecond,  policymakers might reexamine the implementation of the Volcker Rule to ensure  that it is efficiently achieving its policy objectives.  The fact is that most market-making activity  has an element of proprietary trading.   The market maker that bids successfully often does so based on a view on  which way the market might be headed in the near term.  Thus, the line between market-making and  proprietary trading is not always clear-cut, which makes regulation in this  space difficult.\n\nSome  market participants have argued that the Volcker Rule has contributed to the  decline in market liquidity of corporate bonds.   Although I view the evidence on this point as inconclusive, it may be  worth considering giving greater discretion to trading desks that facilitate  client business to intervene when markets are illiquid and volatile.  Also, community banks are subject to the  Volcker Rule even though they typically do not engage in proprietary trading,  or sponsor or retain ownership interests in hedge funds or private equity  funds.  This seems like an unnecessary  burden that drives up compliance costs without a significant corresponding  public benefit, so we also should exempt community banks from the Volcker Rule.\n\nThird,  although CCAR is a vital part of our bank regulatory toolkit, I believe that we  should consider changes that might lessen the burden it places on banks.  In this vein, the Federal Reserve recently  removed the CCAR qualitative assessment for large, non-complex firms.  This is a good example of identifying  regulatory burdens that are not worth the cost.   We are also considering the implementation of a stress capital buffer  that would better align the dynamic stress capital requirements of CCAR with  our more static, point-in-time regulatory capital rules.  Other potential adjustments include changes  to the assumptions about the pace of a firm’s planned dividend and share  repurchases, and how a firm in a stressed environment would likely manage its  balance sheet and business footprint.\n\nThe  financial crisis provided a vivid reminder that a well-functioning financial  system is a necessary condition for a vibrant economy.  The efficient intermediation of funding from  savers to borrowers supports economic activity and, over time, raises living  standards.  This means that we need a  financial system that is robust and resilient to shocks.  Most of the changes that have been  implemented since the financial crisis have moved us in this direction, and it  is important that any new changes to laws and regulations be grounded in what  we have learned.  Our central purpose  must be to ensure a safe and sound financial system that efficiently provides  financing to households and businesses through the ups and downs of the  business cycle.\n\nThank  you for your kind attention.  I would be  happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "Good morning, and welcome to the New  York Fed’s Regional Economic Press Briefing.   Today,  we will provide an update on economic conditions in the region, and then  discuss the issue of regional wage inequality.   As always, what I have to say  reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market  Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nCurrent Economic Conditions\n\nThe  Federal Reserve has pursued an accommodative monetary policy since the Great  Recession to facilitate achieving our dual mandate of maximum sustainable  employment and price stability.  This  policy stance has provided support to the economy and helped lower the  unemployment rate from 10 percent at the depths of the Great Recession to 4.3  percent currently.  Measures of  underemployment have also improved considerably and are near pre-crisis  levels.\n\nStronger  labor market conditions are perhaps the best means to improve the economic  well-being of most Americans, particularly those who have been struggling and  are most vulnerable to economic downturns.   Improved job opportunities have helped to support household income  growth, consumption, and saving, as well as the housing market.  And, as discussed in the Fed’s recent Monetary Policy Report and in Chair Yellen’s testimony before Congress, it is  encouraging that unemployment rates continue to fall for most major demographic  groups, including African-Americans and Hispanics.  At the same time, we should remain concerned  about those groups, for which the jobless rates remain above the unemployment  rate for the nation.  Our outlook  anticipates a continued moderate growth trend, with some further strengthening  in the labor market and an increase in inflation over the medium term toward  our objective of 2 percent.\n\nAlthough  job growth in our region has slowed somewhat in recent months, economic  activity continues to expand.  After  outpacing the United States as a whole for a number of years, job growth in New  York City is now running a bit below the national average.  And, as has been the case for some time, job  growth in Northern New Jersey remains a little below New York City’s pace.  Over the past year, job growth has flattened  out in much of upstate New York, with Albany remaining a bright spot in the  region.  Unfortunately, Puerto Rico and  the U.S. Virgin Islands both remain mired in economic difficulties with no clear  signs of a revival.\n\nWhile  the post-crisis expansion is now the third-longest on record, by historical  standards it has been marked by a relatively weak pace of growth, with annual  GDP growth averaging just 2.1 percent since mid-2009.  Wage growth has also been comparatively modest  even as unemployment has declined.  In  part, this likely reflects the fact that productivity growth has been sluggish  compared to historical experience.   Relative income differences are likely to get more attention when  economic growth is weak and people do not see significant improvement in their  absolute income levels.  With that in  mind, as we consider how to address the issues of income inequality and  mobility, we should also consider how to improve flagging productivity growth,  because that would help raise the level of household income.\n\nWage Inequality\n\nToday’s  briefing will focus on labor market inequality, including wage inequality in  our region.\n\nCurrently,  we see comparatively high levels of inequality in the labor market in terms of  differences in the wages workers earn.   This situation has been in the making for several decades.  Since the early 1980s, wages have increased  more rapidly for workers toward the top of the income distribution than for the  median worker, and much more rapidly than for workers toward the bottom of the  distribution.  Further, this increase in  inequality can be seen throughout the entire distribution of wages.\n\nIn  my view, two main factors are responsible for this pattern of differential wage  growth and the resulting increase in wage inequality.  First, advances in technology have  dramatically changed the nature of work, increasing the skill requirements for  many jobs while displacing others.   Second, the pace of globalization has accelerated in recent decades,  with increased cross-border trade, investment, immigration, and the emergence  of global supply chains.  Together, these  economic forces have contributed to significant job losses in certain sectors,  most notably manufacturing.  The  resulting decline in demand for middle- and lower-skilled workers has resulted  in fewer jobs and has depressed wages for many in those industries.  Other, less important factors behind the rise  in inequality include the decline in private sector labor unions and the  falling real value of the minimum wage.\n\nAt  the same time, technological change and globalization have created jobs in  areas such as engineering and software development.  Demand has been particularly high for  knowledge workers, resulting in strong wage growth in certain sectors.  All told, the forces of technological change  and globalization have contributed to wage inequality by pushing up wages for  those toward the top, and stifling wage growth for workers toward the middle  and bottom of the wage distribution.  As  I have said in previous remarks, we need to do a better job of helping those  hurt by globalization. 2\n\nMonetary  policy can help support economic growth, but it is much less powerful in  addressing the structural factors that underpin inequality in the labor  market.  That said, understanding the causes and consequences of economic  inequality is important to the Fed.  We  are working hard at producing research, information, data, and analysis so that  we can better understand inequality and participate in an informed debate on  how to best address it.  One significant  initiative within the Federal Reserve System is the creation of the Opportunity  and Inclusive Growth Institute at the Minneapolis Fed.  The Institute conducts research to measure,  analyze, and make recommendations to improve the economic well-being of all  Americans, with a particular focus on structural barriers that limit full  participation in economic opportunity and advancement.\n\nLagging Economic Mobility\n\nIn  a free market economy, some wage inequality is inevitable given variability in  individuals’ endowments, skill sets, and education levels.  These attributes influence the demand for  their services and the wages they are paid. We don’t expect those just starting  out to have the skills of more experienced workers.\n\nBut,  the access and opportunity needed to attain the attributes associated with  higher wages may not be uniform—and that is concerning.  Inequality reflects impediments to people  reaching their potential.  These include  limits on access to education, credit, transportation, and housing.  Such impediments may discourage workers from  investing in themselves, and may lead some to drop out of the labor force.  We should all work to ensure that people have  opportunities to develop their skills, build human capital, and improve their  job prospects.\n\nTo  me, inequality is especially problematic when it reflects and reinforces  barriers to economic mobility.  Too many  parents are increasingly pessimistic about their children’s economic  future.  According to a recent Pew  Research Center survey, only 37 percent of American parents think their  children will be better off financially than they are. 3 This is a deeply troubling finding.  I believe that income inequality is generally  less problematic when it does not impede economic mobility and when economic  mobility is high.  While the “rags to  riches” story has been a popular theme in U.S. history, income mobility in the  United States is now notably lower than in many other advanced economies.\n\nUnfortunately,  substantial differences in economic mobility exist within the United  States.  Important research by Raj Chetty  and his co-authors suggests that upward mobility strongly depends on where one  grew up. 4 That is, places themselves seem to have a  measureable effect on economic outcomes for children as they reach  adulthood.  In particular, this research  indicates that higher upward mobility is associated with areas that are less  residentially segregated by race or income, and that have higher-quality  schools, stronger social networks, greater community involvement, and stable  family structures.  Significantly, they find  that places with greater upward economic mobility tend to have lower income  inequality.  This evidence suggests that  there is a fundamental inequality of opportunity for advancement that is tied  to where people live.  Reducing  inequality of opportunity is something we should all work toward.\n\nDirections for Policy\n\nSo,  what are some specific ways policy can address inequality and improve economic  mobility?  While this is a difficult and  complex set of issues with no easy answers, I do have a few thoughts.  First and foremost, we can improve the  quality of education for our most vulnerable citizens.  Children who attend better schools and attain  higher levels of education have more favorable long-term outcomes, including  better job prospects and higher earnings.   There are large disparities in the quality of education a student  receives, which are highly correlated with where that student lives.  We need to look for ways to provide  higher-quality education regardless of where people live. Reducing the role of  local property taxes in school financing to better equalize school quality  across locations is one example. 5\n\nIn  addition, education’s benefits start very early in life and are  cumulative.  While we need to further  strengthen primary and secondary education, there is convincing evidence that  educational investments in early childhood have especially high rates of return  in terms of lifetime earnings and are associated with many other positive  outcomes. 6\n\nWorkforce  development is another key policy area that can improve economic mobility and  reduce inequality.  Because of the swift  pace of economic change driven by advances in technology and globalization, we  ought to step up efforts to help workers build the skills necessary to adapt to  change.  This means providing these types  of services at the local level.  These  efforts should include innovative workforce development programs, coursework  and certifications in key skills that are in demand, and fostering partnerships  between higher education institutions and local employers.  Here, I would point to Monroe Community  College in Rochester as a model of successful collaboration with employers to  create job-training programs that align with current employment opportunities. 7\n\nConclusion\n\nThe  issues of economic inequality and income mobility are among the most important  that we face as a nation and as a region.   These issues are particularly relevant for our region because the Second  District is home to some of the highest and lowest levels of wage inequality in  the country.  Next, Research Officer  Jaison Abel will discuss regional economic conditions and wage inequality.\n\nThank  you for your kind attention.",

    "text": "Good morning.  It is my pleasure to welcome you to the New  York Fed for today’s conference on the costs and returns of higher education and  higher education financing.  I am  delighted to see such broad interest and attention from the academic community  on this topic.  The role of education and  education financing in today’s labor market and economy has never been more  important.  It is a topic that I have  spoken about frequently during my tenure here at the New York Fed, especially  with regard to education’s importance for economic mobility.  Understanding educational investment  decisions and their macroeconomic implications requires rigorous analysis from  top academic researchers like you.  Let  me briefly discuss some developments that I find particularly significant and  worthy of investigation.  As always, what  I say represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market  Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nAs has  been well documented by Raj Chetty and his co-authors, income inequality has  increased in recent decades, while economic mobility has stagnated.  Meanwhile, absolute mobility appears to have  fallen, indicated by the declining share of children who earn more than their  parents.  The combination of high inequality  and low mobility is problematic, because it means that being born into a  low-income family is more consequential today than in the past.  Since education is a key determinant of  upward mobility, one way to increase economic mobility in the United States  would be to increase overall post-secondary educational attainment.  There are, however, a number of important  barriers to achieving that goal.\n\nFirst, many high school students and their parents  appear to lack accurate information about the returns obtained from a college  education.  New York Fed research shows  evidence of systematic underestimation of the average benefits—and  overestimation of costs—of a college education, with larger biases among  lower-income and non-college households.   Research by Caroline Hoxby and Sarah Turner shows that among low-income  high school students, even very high achievers are poorly informed about the  academic options that are available and their effects on career  opportunities.  This research finds that  the provision of relevant information can lead to markedly better outcomes.\n\nA second impediment is the lack of preparedness  among new college entrants, with large numbers of those students needing  remedial courses that earn no college credit.   Low readiness contributes to persistently low college completion rates,  especially among lower-income, part-time, and nontraditional students.  Higher dropout rates, in turn, contribute to  a substantial reduction in the net expected and realized returns from college  attendance.\n\nThe third major barrier to college attendance and  completion is the rise in the cost of a college education.  While a college education is generally a good  investment, the cost of attending a four-year college has risen considerably  faster than wages over the last several decades.  This means that college has become  increasingly unaffordable—which can act as a drag on economic mobility and the  growth of a college-educated workforce, and by extension, on productivity  growth and living standards.\n\nAs has  been well documented by my New York Fed colleagues, many young Americans  have adjusted to rising tuition and fees by taking on more debt.  This trend highlights the importance of the  federal student loan program, which has helped mitigate the impact of the shift  in financing of higher education from state and local funding to students and  their families over the past few decades.   However, the end result is that more students leave college with  significantly higher amounts of debt.   Student loan debt has more than tripled over the past two decades and  now totals over $1.4 trillion.\n\nIt is important to consider what these changes in  financing higher education mean for economic mobility.  First, New York Fed researchers have  documented that a large percentage of student borrowers—especially those who  attend less selective colleges or drop out—have trouble staying current on their  loans, and often become delinquent and default on their debt.  We also know that these factors—slow  repayment, delinquency, and default—are most prevalent among those from more  modest family circumstances.  In addition,  there is evidence that student debt acts as a drag on homeownership.  Specifically, our research indicates that  when college tuition rises in a state, it leads to higher levels of student  debt and a lower homeownership rate.   These factors matter for inequality and social mobility, because  increasing home equity is the major form of wealth accumulation for the great  majority of American families.  Thus,  rising tuition and changes in the way that college is financed appear to have  diminished the ability of higher education to lift people from poverty into the  middle class.\n\nOf course, students’ reliance on debt and the  returns from graduating vary across educational institutions.  Of particular interest here is recent work by  Raj Chetty and his co-authors showing that some colleges—some of which can be  found in the CUNY and California state systems—appear to be much better at  fostering economic mobility than others.   In other words, they accept relatively large numbers of lower-income  students while also producing large numbers of high earners, which means that  these institutions facilitate considerable upward mobility.  Learning exactly how they do it and how it  can be replicated strikes me as a first-order question for further study.  Recent research by Caroline Hoxby to assess  differences in productivity across educational institutions makes important  progress in that direction.\n\nIn summary, academic research on  the financing, costs, and returns of higher education is more important now than it has ever been.  We are pleased to have many of those  researchers participating in this conference. I would like to thank Raji Chakrabarti and Wilbert van der Klaauw and  the New York Fed’s Research Group for organizing this timely conference, and  for bringing together this superb group of scholars.  Thank you all for your participation.  I wish you a very productive and enjoyable  conference.",

    "text": "You may have noticed videos playing as you walked into the room. These videos are the winners of a Federal Reserve Bank of New York contest to promote financial literacy among young adults. This year, students from LaGuardia Community College took both first and second-place in the competition. The top winning video ran as a public service announcement at several movie theaters in New York City. All three videos are available on the New York Fed’s website and on YouTube. 1 This is an impressive achievement and I applaud the students and LaGuardia Community College.\n\nAlthough some people may refer to Queens as an “outer borough,” I am quite aware that the center of population of New York City is in Maspeth, Queens. Of course, Queens is special not just for its central location, but also for its extraordinary diversity. Queens continues to serve as a land of opportunity for immigrants from all over the world. Roughly 46 percent of Queens’ population is foreign born—more than four times the national average and higher than any other county in the country with the exception of Miami-Dade. Sizable communities of immigrants from countries ranging from Columbia to Korea, Ecuador to Egypt, Greece to Guyana, and Italy to India have made Queens their home.\n\nThis morning I will talk to you about national and regional economic conditions. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIntroduction to the New York Fed By way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New York Fed is, what we do and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, and was created by Congress in 1913. With this act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the supply of money in the nation’s economy.  Congress designed the central bank to be decentralized, representative of all regions of the country and independent of the political process.\n\nThe Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency currently led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 regional Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nEach Reserve Bank is distinct, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made the central bank independent so that policymakers could make decisions about monetary policy in the national interest, somewhat insulated from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe FOMC consists of the Board of Governors plus the presidents of each of the 12 district Banks, and it meets in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy. As the current New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings and have a permanent vote. At these meetings, the committee members and I each present our current outlook for the economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders.  My visit to Queens today is a part of these regional activities.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. For example, the New York Fed is the Reserve Bank charged with implementing monetary policy. At the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world.\n\nFinally, I must mention that the New York Fed's district could be the most diverse in the System: ranging from the urban density of New York City to the forested sparseness of the northern Adirondacks, to the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. All in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nU.S. Economic Outlook Now, what is the outlook for economic activity, employment and inflation? In particular, what are the areas of vulnerability that we should be most concerned about?\n\nI am pleased to say that the economic outlook has improved considerably in the past six months. Despite this, we are still very far away from achieving our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. Faster progress toward these objectives would be very welcome.\n\nOn the activity side, a wide range of indicators show a broadening and strengthening of demand by households and production by firms. For example, on the demand side, families boosted their real consumption at a 4.1 percent annual rate during the fourth quarter. This compares with only a 2.2 percent annual rate during the first three quarters of 2010. Not surprisingly, businesses’ orders and production are following suit. And this revival in activity, in turn, has been accompanied by improving consumer and business confidence.\n\nThese contributed to a 2.8 percent growth rate in our most comprehensive measure of national output (real gross domestic product or GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2010. I actually suspect that this number may understate the economy's forward momentum. That is because real GDP growth in the quarter was held back by a sharp slowing in the pace of inventory accumulation. In my view, the revival in demand, production and confidence strongly suggests that we may be much closer to establishing a virtuous circle that will support stronger growth. What I have in mind is a cycle in which rising household and business demand generate more rapid income and employment growth, which in turn bolsters confidence and leads to further increases in spending. The only major missing piece of the puzzle is the absence of strong payroll job growth. We will need to see sustained strong employment growth in order to be certain that this virtuous circle has become firmly established.\n\nWith respect to the labor market, last Friday’s report helps resolve some conflicting signals. On one hand, the unemployment rate has fallen sharply over the past three months, dropping to 8.9 percent from 9.8 percent two months earlier. On the other hand, payroll employment gains had been very modest and were not consistent with a sustained drop in the unemployment rate.\n\nLast Friday we learned that the economy added 192,000 jobs in February, and estimates of previous job growth were adjusted upward modestly. Particularly encouraging is the growth of manufacturing jobs. Over the past year we have added factory jobs at the fastest pace since the 1990s. This makes me more confident that job growth in January was temporarily depressed by unusually bad winter weather. Other labor market indicators, such as initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits and the employment components of both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing business surveys have also shown improvement recently.\n\nAlthough there is still uncertainty over the timing and speed of the labor market recovery, I do expect that job growth will increase considerably more rapidly in the coming months. We should welcome this. A substantial pickup is sorely needed. Even if we were to generate growth of 300,000 jobs per month, we would still likely have considerable slack in the labor market at the end of 2012.\n\nSo, why is the economy finally showing more signs of life? In my view, the improvement reflects three developments.\n\nFirst, household and financial institution balance sheets continue to improve. On the household side, the 2008-09 rise in the saving rate appears to have stabilized in the 5 percent to 6 percent range. Meanwhile, the amount of money they need to service their debt (for mortgages, cars, credit cards, etc.) has fallen sharply to levels that prevailed during the mid-1990s. Debt service has been pushed lower by a combination of debt repayment, refinancing at lower interest rates and debt write-offs. Financial institutions have strengthened their balance sheets by retaining earnings and by issuing equity. As a result, some measures of bank credit are beginning to expand again.\n\nSecond, monetary policy and fiscal policy have provided support to the recovery. On the monetary policy side, we at the Fed have maintained unusually low levels of short-term interest rates and engaged in large-scale asset purchases. These measures have fostered a sharp improvement in financial market conditions.  On the fiscal side (that is, government spending and taxes), the economy has been supported by the shift in policy to help support growth. In particular, the temporary reduction in payroll taxes could have a particularly strong impact on growth during the first part of the year.\n\nThird, growth abroad—especially among emerging market economies—has been strong and this has led to an increase in the demand for U.S.-made goods and services. Over the four quarters of 2010. real exports rose 9.2 percent. After a disappointing performance earlier in the year, U.S. net exports surged in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe firming in economic activity, in short, is due both to natural healing and past and present policy support.\n\nIn this regard, it is important to emphasize that we at the Federal Reserve have been expecting the economy to strengthen. We provided additional monetary policy stimulus via the asset purchase program to help ensure that the recovery regained momentum. A stronger recovery with more rapid progress toward our dual mandate objectives is what we have been seeking. This is welcome and not a reason to reverse course.\n\nYet, we must not be overly optimistic about the growth outlook. The coast is not completely clear—the healing process in the aftermath of the crisis takes time and there are still several areas of vulnerability and weakness. In particular, housing activity remains unusually weak and home prices have begun to soften again in many parts of the country. State and local government finances remain under stress, and this is likely to lead to further spending cuts, tax increases, or job losses in this sector that will offset at least a part of the federal fiscal stimulus. And we cannot rule out the possibility of further shocks from abroad. For example, higher oil prices cut into household purchasing power, and the situation in the Middle East and Africa remains uncertain and dynamic. Also, we cannot ignore the risks stemming from the longer-term fiscal challenges that we face in the United States.\n\nBut in the near-term, the most immediate domestic problems may recede rather than become more prevalent. On the housing side, stronger job growth should lead to more household formation. For example, more young people will be able to move out of their parents’ homes when they get jobs. This trend should provide more support to housing demand. And anxieties about the large overhang of unsold homes represented by the foreclosure pipeline may overstate the magnitude of the excess supply of housing. Families that have lost their homes through foreclosures are likely to seek new homes as their income permits, even though many may re-enter the housing market as renters rather than buyers. On the state and local side, a rising economy should boost sales and income tax revenue, and help narrow near-term fiscal shortfalls.\n\nWe also need to remain watchful for signs that low interest rates could foster a buildup of financial excesses or bubbles that might pose a medium-term risk to both full employment and price stability. Fortunately, current risk spreads on U.S. financial assets are not unduly compressed. This suggests that people are still being relatively cautious about taking on a lot of financial asset risk.\n\nOn the inflation side of the ledger, there are some signs that core inflation is now stabilizing after falling for several years. At the Fed, we track core inflation (which excludes the volatile food and energy prices) because experience and research tell us that core inflation provides the best measure of whether overall inflationary pressures are building up or subsiding. Core inflation has proven quite reliable in predicting future total, or “headline” inflation rates. At the moment, both headline and core inflation remain below levels consistent with our dual mandate objectives—which most members of the FOMC consider to be 2 percent or a bit less on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure.\n\nRecent evidence shows that the large amount of slack in the economy has contributed to declining inflation over the past couple of years. I expect this slack to continue to dampen price pressures in the near term. Inflation expectations are well-anchored today and we intend to keep it that way. A sustained rise in medium-term inflation expectations would represent a threat to our price stability mandate and would not be tolerated.\n\nNevertheless, we always need to be careful about inflation—even in an environment of ample spare capacity. Let me focus on one issue, commodity prices, for a moment. Surely some of the businesses in the audience have faced the challenge of sharply rising oil, food or metal prices in recent months. For example, the spot GSCI—a broad measure of commodity prices—has risen more than 35 percent over the past year. This was in train before the upheavals in the Middle East and Africa raised market concerns about potential disruption to oil supplies, pushing energy prices—though not other commodity prices—still higher. Commodity price pressures are pushing measures of headline inflation above measures of core inflation, which, as I mentioned, exclude food and energy prices. You may have concerns that the rise in commodity prices will turn out to be persistent and, if so, how this might impact the inflation outlook.\n\nFrom a policymaking standpoint, there are important factors that suggest that it would be unwise for the Federal Reserve to over-react to recent commodity price pressures by raising interest rates soon. Why? First, despite the general uptrend, some of the recent commodity price pressures are likely to be temporary—due to poor weather or geopolitical uncertainties. This is certainly what is anticipated by market participants.\n\nSecond, even if commodity price pressures were to prove persistent, they have a smaller impact in the United States than they do in many other countries. Relative to most other major economies, the U.S. inflation rate is lower, the amount of slack much greater and commodities represent a relatively small share of our consumption basket. This small share helps to explain why the “pass-through” of commodity prices into core measures of inflation has been very low in the United States for several decades.\n\nThird, the Federal Reserve's success in anchoring inflation expectations has also been important in limiting pass-through. Since 1984, for example, when the Federal Reserve began to achieve success in driving down and then subsequently anchoring long-term inflation expectations, there has been very little evidence of commodity price pass-through into core inflation. In contrast, prior to 1984, when inflation expectations were much less well-anchored, pass-through did occur and, at times, played an important role in pushing underlying inflation higher.\n\nThus, while rising commodity prices may be giving some of you a bad headache, they are not likely to lead to a sustained rise in inflation to levels inconsistent with our dual mandate. We will have to ensure, however, that these pressures do not cause inflation expectations to become unanchored. If that were to occur, that would be a troublesome development that would complicate the pursuit of our dual mandate of high employment and low and stable inflation Because we have an Federal Open Market Committee meeting next Tuesday, I will not comment today on the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy.\n\nOutlook for the Region and Queens Now, let me turn briefly to the situation here in the city and in Queens, in particular. While the national economic outlook improved considerably during the latter part of 2010 and into early this year, growth in New York City's economy appears to have slowed a bit.\n\nThe regional economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have developed a composite economic index for New York City. It incorporates measures such as employment, unemployment and income, and can serve as a barometer of the state of the local economy. Based on this measure, the city's economic activity, which had declined fairly sharply throughout much of 2008 and all of 2009, rebounded at an encouraging pace in the first half of 2010. Growth slowed in the second half of the year, but recently released employment data point to some pickup in the city’s economy in early 2011 and suggest that the local economic recovery remains on track.\n\nOver the past year, employment in the city has expanded fairly strongly in a number of key industries, including finance, professional and business services, education and health, and tourism, including air transportation.  Job losses in construction and government, however, continue to weigh down growth. Meanwhile, New York City's unemployment rate has edged down steadily over the past year, though it remains unacceptably high at 8.9 percent. Unfortunately, as in the rest of the nation, much of the recent drop in the unemployment rate has come from people withdrawing from the labor force so that they are no longer counted as unemployed. Some of the unemployed have been able to find jobs, but not in large numbers thus far.\n\nWhere do Queens’ residents find employment? While many of them commute to work in other boroughs (primarily Manhattan), Queens has a formidable industrial base of its own. As the home to the city's two major airports, the volume of air traffic coming through Queens ranks third highest among U.S. counties. Not surprisingly, then, transportation is Queens' largest industrial specialty; it accounts for 12 percent of total employment—four times the national average. Air transportation alone accounts for 6 percent of Queens’ jobs, or 15 times the nationwide share. But, of course, Queens has a diverse economy, with jobs in industries ranging from medical care to construction, not to mention printing and a number of other manufacturing industries that benefit from being in a large population center.\n\nDuring the recent recession, Queens' dynamic economy was hard hit, yet it proved more resilient than Manhattan’s and much of the nation’s. From peak to trough, employment declined by roughly 3 percent in Queens, far less than the roughly 7 percent plunge nationally and the 4.5 percent loss in New York City as a whole. Although borough-specific economic data are not quite as current as city-wide data, we at the New York Fed see clear indications that employment in Queens stopped declining in the first half of 2010. We hope that upcoming reports will show a sustained upturn. With prospects for the national economy improving in early 2011, the outlook for Queens’ diverse and vibrant economy—and New York City’s as a whole—seems to be brightening as well.\n\nConclusion To sum up, the national economy experienced a pick-up in activity during the last quarter of 2010 that shows signs of continuing in 2011. Although the city’s economy saw some loss of momentum, I would not be overly discouraged. After all, soft patches are not uncommon during economic recoveries. Both nationally and regionally, unemployment remains stubbornly high, but many indicators suggest that conditions are in place for stronger growth in the coming months.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________ 1 See top winning videos of the New York Fed's Financial Awareness Video Competition on YouTube: Think Twice Before You Swipe Debt Comedy Jam Credit Card Arrest",

    "text": "Viewed through the lens of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate—the pursuit of the highest level of employment consistent with price stability, the current situation is wholly unsatisfactory. Given the outlook that the upturn appears likely to strengthen only gradually, it will likely be several years before employment and inflation return to levels consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.\n\nToday, I will discuss why the recovery has been disappointing and highlight some of the issues facing the Federal Reserve and monetary policy, echoing some of the themes laid out by Chairman Bernanke in his Jackson Hole speech in late August. As always, what I am going to say reflects my own views and does not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn recent quarters the pace of growth has been disappointing even relative to our modest expectations at the start of the year. After rising at about a 3.25 percent annual rate during the second half of 2009, there has been a progressive slowing—to a 2.75 percent annual rate during the first half of the year and, very likely, to an even slower rate in the third quarter.\n\nThe factors responsible for the failure of the recovery to pick up speed include: (1) the gradual petering out of the contribution from the swing in inventories from rapid liquidation during the first half of 2009 to a modest increase in the second quarter of 2010; 2) the sluggish recovery in consumer spending; and 3) the continued weakness in housing. Normally, at this stage of recovery, the handoff from growth led by inventory accumulation to growth led by private final demand would have been more fully accomplished. This handoff has been delayed because households have been paying down their debts—a process known as deleveraging. In addition, many businesses have been reluctant to hire. This has limited income growth.  Slow income growth, and along with caution in the face of economic uncertainty, has also restrained spending.\n\nAlthough so-called “soft-patches” are quite common during the early stages of an economic expansion, this soft patch is a bit different. First, it looks like it will last somewhat longer because the deleveraging process is not yet complete. Second, the current weakness is somewhat more concerning because it is occurring at a time that the central bank has already cut interest rates to near zero.\n\nIn fact, this failure of the recovery to “catch fire” has occurred despite aggressive monetary and fiscal policy steps to stimulate the economy. On the monetary policy side, short-term interest rates have been nearly zero for a year and a half; the Fed purchased $1.7 trillion of long-term assets, and the proceeds from maturing securities are being reinvested to keep the balance sheet from shrinking unduly. On the fiscal side, a series of measures has provided support to a broad range of activities.\n\nThe sluggish nature of the recovery in the face of very substantial stimulus reflects the dynamics at work during the expansion that preceded it. Beginning around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in home prices. The two trends were inextricably linked. The rise in home prices helped to support additional demand for credit as households used the collateral represented by their homes to borrow large sums of money via home equity lines of credit and second mortgages. Chart 1 illustrates how the growing proportion of nonprime first mortgage loans helped fuel the sharp rise in home prices.\n\nAs home prices rose and the stock market performed strongly, household net worth rose sharply. Households responded by borrowing more and saving less. After all, why save when the rise in home prices was adding to your wealth and the housing equity created by the rise in home prices could be easily tapped for funds as needed? The use of home equity as a source for funds to support consumption is evident in the fact that the homeowners’ equity as a share of home values was essentially flat over this period (Chart 2). This indicates that homeowners were borrowing against their accumulated gains. The surge in home prices pushed up the ratio of household net worth to disposable income to nearly 640 percent and the personal saving fell below 2 percent (Chart 3).\n\nThe surge in home prices was fueled by products and practices in the financial sector that led to a rapid and unsustainable buildup of leverage and an underpricing of risk during this period. These dynamics in turn provided the fuel that caused house prices and consumer spending to rise much faster than income. As shown in Chart 4, the share of GDP accounted for by consumption and residential investment climbed to a peak of 76 percent in 2005 from 71 percent in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe boom, of course, was unsustainable. The progressive easing of underwriting standards that was needed to support housing demand could only persist as long as housing prices were rising rapidly. But for home prices to rise rapidly, underwriting standards had to be progressively relaxed in order to generate more buyers. When home prices began to slip beginning in 2006, the dynamic swung into reverse. The collateral values supporting borrowing and spending began to fall.\n\nAs banks’ and other financial intermediaries’ credit losses began to mount, credit availability became impaired and this exacerbated the downward pressure on home prices and on borrowing and spending. Not only did households that had overextended themselves have to cut back; others also retrenched because they were also affected by declines in wealth and heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook and their job prospects.\n\nIt is not surprising that the workout from the excesses of this type of boom would take a long time. Just as it took several years for the boom to begin and run its course, so it would take years, not months, for households and financial intermediaries to adjust their balance sheets and behavior to the new environment. Households had to raise their saving rates in order to rebuild their balance sheets. Financial intermediaries had to replenish their capital to replace losses via loan charge-offs and other credit impairments. Both adjustments would need to occur before the economy could grow rapidly.\n\nWith this in mind, the key questions are: 1) Where are we in the adjustment process, and 2) what, if anything, can monetary policy do to facilitate a smoother adjustment and more rapid progress toward our dual mandate objectives?\n\nIn terms of the adjustment process, starting on the household side, most signs point to significant progress. For example, the revisions to the national income and product accounts announced in July revealed substantial upward revisions to the personal saving rate (Chart 5). The current saving rate is broadly consistent with the historical relationship between personal saving and the household net worth-to-income ratio. Of course, part of this story depends on the stabilization of household net worth, which had earlier fallen sharply due to declines in both home and equity prices. Although household net worth dropped significantly again in the second quarter according to the Flow of Funds accounts, the subsequent rise in the U.S. equity market is likely to have reversed that decline. Meanwhile, housing price declines have moderated substantially, helped, in part, by the fact that the low level of mortgage rates combined with the sharp drop in house prices has resulted in a substantial improvement in affordability (Chart 6).\n\nHouseholds have retrenched in terms of their borrowing and this has helped push down the household debt-to-income ratio sharply from its peak in 2007. Another factor behind the fall in the debt-to-income ratio has been credit losses and debt forgiveness. Since 2007, charge-offs have reduced household debt outstanding by over $880 billion.\n\nSome argue that the decline in the household debt-to-income ratio must go much further before the deleveraging process can be complete. After all, the household debt-to-income ratio is still far above the level reached as late as 2002, before the surge in household borrowing began. Some even argue that household debt-to-income ratios must fall back to the level of the 1980s. I think that this is an overly pessimistic view for a simple reason—both household debt and household financial assets have been rising faster than income growth on a secular basis since the 1950s. Focusing just on debt misses what is happening on the other side of the balance sheet (Chart 7). One reason why both household assets and debt have been rising faster than income is due to greater financial intermediation. For instance, tax incentives encourage people to fund their 401(K) pension plans rather than pay down mortgage debt as they get older.\n\nThe notion that the household adjustment process is well advanced is also supported by other data, as well. For example, the share of after-tax income devoted to servicing debts, as well as paying property taxes and homeowners insurance or rent, has declined sharply over the past two years and is now back to levels that prevailed in the late 1990s (Chart 8). In addition to the declining stock of debt, households have been able to refinance outstanding debt at lower interest rates.\n\nMoreover, mortgage delinquency rates, even in the most serious category, have started to fall, and data that tracks changes in the proportion of borrowers who are delinquent and then become current versus becoming even more delinquent is encouraging (Charts 9 and 10). Finally, the less serious delinquencies for credit card, auto and student loans have been trending lower, though not the more serious delinquencies (Chart 11). Of course, these recent improvements have come in the context of the stabilization in unemployment and house prices. To ensure that the more favorable trends in household balance sheets continue, the economic environment needs to become more supportive.\n\nWe should recognize that there is still considerable uncertainty about the level of the saving rate and configuration of household balance sheets that will prevail in the coming years. It is possible that households now perceive the world to be a riskier place than they did before and will want to have more “rainy day” funds. More saving may also be needed to meet higher downpayment requirements for home purchases. Thus, while we may be far along in the adjustment process, it is difficult to judge just how much further we have to go.\n\nTurning now to the issue of credit availability, there is no question that credit conditions are still tight. There are a number of impediments: 1) Financial institutions—many of which still face balance sheet problems of their own—have tightened underwriting standards and, 2) a decline in property prices has cut collateral values and made the refinancing of many residential and commercial mortgages difficult.\n\nOn the banking side, there is considerable differentiation across the industry in terms of health. The largest banks in the United States are generally in much improved health following the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in 2009, which led to substantial additional equity raising. For smaller banks, the situation is more mixed. According to the FDIC, as of June 30, 2010, 829 of the nation’s 7,830 commercial banks and savings institutions remain on the FDIC’s problem institution list.\n\nBut overall, the situation is one in which credit availability is slowly improving. According to the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officers Survey, the percentage of banks reporting that they were tightening credit standards across a wide range of lending categories peaked in late 2008. The most recent data indicate that virtually no banks are tightening standards, and a number of banks have begun to relax credit terms (Chart 12).\n\nIn addition to households, the small-business sector is another area that has seen a contraction in credit. Focus groups and surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve System suggest this contraction is the result of three distinct factors—a decline in demand for credit, a tightening of lending standards, and a weakening of credit quality due to lower collateral values and cash flows. 1 Which is the most important is difficult to discern.\n\nHowever, surveys of small-business owners indicate that much of the weakness in lending to this sector reflects lack of demand. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index, for instance, asks respondents to indicate their single most important problem from a standard list. For some time now, the response “poor sales” has been the most frequently cited problem. In contrast, relatively few respondents cite “financial and interest rates” as the most important problem (Chart 13). A caveat to this is that credit constraints could be inhibiting the formation of new small businesses—something that surveys of existing firms would not capture.\n\nAlthough credit availability has begun to improve, the decline in collateral values remains a significant impediment. For example, housing prices have declined so far that nearly one quarter of homes are now worth less than the value of the mortgages that finance them. Lacking sufficient collateral value, such homeowners cannot take advantage of the fact that conforming mortgage rates are at their lowest level in history and refinance their mortgages. Overall, the desire to rebuild wealth through savings and the limits on credit availability to households has acted to restrain consumer spending, keeping the recovery tepid.\n\nTo some degree, this adjustment is unavoidable, as the economy had reached unsustainable levels of consumption and housing demand. However, the fact that many of these adjustments are inevitable does not rule out a role for monetary policy to support economic activity. Very low interest rates can help smooth the adjustment process by supporting asset valuations, including making housing more affordable and by allowing some borrowers to reduce debt interest payments.\n\nBeyond this direct role in smoothing the deleveraging process—to the extent that monetary policy can “cut off the tail” of the distribution of potential adverse economic outcomes, making a truly disastrous outcome less likely—it can help encourage those households and businesses with money to spend to do so.\n\nToday’s low and falling rate of inflation—at a time when interest rates are near zero—is a problem that is slowing the adjustment process. Currently, by most measures, inflation is below the level that members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) view as consistent with price stability. Although the Federal Reserve has no formal numerical inflation target, it is noteworthy that the long-run inflation forecasts of the FOMC members cluster around 1.75 percent to 2 percent for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator. This compares with a 1.5 percent year-over-year rate for the PCE deflator and 1.4 percent rate for the core PCE deflator, which excludes food and energy prices.\n\nLow and falling inflation is a problem for several reasons. First, low and declining inflation makes it harder to accomplish needed balance sheet adjustments. That is because, all other things being equal, lower inflation means slower nominal income growth. Slower nominal income growth, in turn, means that less of the needed adjustment in household debt-to-income ratios will come from rising incomes. This puts more of the adjustment burden on paying down debt.\n\nSecond, and even more importantly, low and falling inflation can cause inflation expectations to decline. This is important because inflation expectations are an important factor that influences actual future inflation. Moreover, when inflation expectations decline, the expected real cost of credit increases—a subject I will return to in a moment.\n\nSo what could the Federal Reserve do? As I see it, there are two potentially complementary avenues. First, we could take steps to make our current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy more effective in stimulating economic activity by providing additional guidance about what we are trying to achieve today and in the future. Second, we could find ways to increase the amount of stimulus we currently provide via our balance sheet.\n\nTurning to the first issue, clear communication about objectives and intent is an important element of effective monetary policy. For example, communicating clearly our intention to return inflation to more normal levels can help keep inflation expectations well anchored around levels consistent with our inflation goals. As the central bank, we and we alone can control inflation—if not precisely in the short run, then over the medium term. By clarifying our intentions, we can reduce the risk of further disinflation—or even an outright debt-deflation spiral that would make it still more difficult to accomplish the necessary balance-sheet adjustments.\n\nClear communication on the part of a central bank is important at all times, but it is even more critical when the federal funds rate is at or near its effective lower bound. In this environment, a decline in inflation expectations that drives up the real interest rate and thereby increases the real cost of credit cannot be offset by simply lowering the federal funds rate. Thus, in a very direct sense, a fall in inflation expectations when the target interest rate is at the zero bound represents a de facto tightening of monetary policy and of financial conditions. Such a tightening would clearly be highly undesirable at a moment when unemployment is too high, inflation is too low and the economy has only moderate forward momentum.\n\nIn this situation, the FOMC must be clear and resolute in its commitment to its price stability objective. This is why the most recent FOMC statement clearly stated that underlying inflation was running somewhat below levels consistent with the dual mandate.\n\nThere are a range of options we could pursue if we judged it worthwhile to go even further in communicating our objectives and intent. We could be even more explicit with regard to the inflation rate that the Committee views as compatible with price stability, for instance, by stating an explicit inflation objective as is common practice in other advanced economies. This could help anchor inflation expectations at the desired rate. It would also clarify the extent to which the current level of inflation falls short of that rate.\n\nIf we were to go down this path, it would be important to note that any provision of more information on our inflation objective would not be a signal that the inflation element of the dual mandate had become more important than the full employment objective. Instead, it would principally reflect the fact that inflation being “too low” (just like inflation being “too high”) is an impediment to achieving the full employment objective of the dual mandate.\n\nIf we judged it desirable, we could go still further and provide more guidance on how monetary policy would react to deviations from any stated inflation objective. One possibility would be to keep track of inflation shortfalls when the federal funds rate is constrained by the zero bound, as is the case today. For example, if inflation in 2011 were a 0.5 percentage point below the Fed’s inflation objective, the Fed might aim to offset this miss by an additional 0.5 percentage point rise in the price level in future years.\n\nIn the current environment, such an approach would have some advantages as well as some disadvantages. When there is a large amount of slack in the economy, the Federal Reserve might not easily be able to hit an inflation objective soon. But, the central bank could plausibly promise to make up the difference later on. Indeed, the further the Fed fell behind its inflation objective in the near term, the more inflation would need to increase in order to push the actual path of prices up to the path consistent with price stability over the long run. To the extent this policy was more credible, it might do a better job keeping inflation expectations from falling. This might make monetary policy more stimulative and, thus, might help the FOMC achieve its objectives more quickly.\n\nHowever, such an approach would only work well if people understood how it would operate and formed their expectations of future inflation accordingly. And there could also be significant costs. For example, if people mistakenly concluded that the Fed was tinkering with its long-run inflation objective, this could lead to greater uncertainty about future inflation. This might lead to higher risk premia and higher nominal interest rates that would undermine the effectiveness of such a policy to stimulate the economy.\n\nIn addition to communication strategies, the Federal Reserve has a second set of tools, namely the ability to expand its balance sheet to stimulate activity and move inflation toward desired levels—either by purchasing medium and long-term Treasuries or agency mortgage-backed securities. Such purchases of long-duration assets pull down the level of long-term interest rates by removing duration from private-sector hands, who respond by purchasing other long-dated assets.\n\nTwo interesting questions pertain to balance sheet expansion: (1) How much would the Fed have to purchase to have a given impact on the level of long-term interest rates and economic activity, and, (2) what constraints exist in terms of limits to balance- sheet expansion, and what are the costs involved that could impede efforts to meet the dual mandate now or in the future? The questions demand serious consideration prior to any decision to expand the balance sheet further.\n\nWith respect to the first question, some simple calculations based on recent experience suggest that $500 billion of purchases would provide about as much stimulus as a reduction in the federal funds rate of between half a point and three quarters of a point. But this estimate is sensitive to how long market participants expected the Fed to hold on to these assets.\n\nMore broadly, the clearer and more credible the framework governing purchases, the greater the likelihood that market participants would act in a manner that helped the Fed achieve its objectives. In particular, the more confident market participants are in the Fed’s ability to exit when the time is right, the more effective its purchases will be in stimulating the economy.\n\nSuppose the Fed was indeed successful in reducing long-term interest rates further—what then? Some claim that lower rates would have no effect on economic activity—that the Fed would be “pushing on a string.” This is too dark a view. Although the responsiveness of demand to reductions in interest rates is probably lower in a world in which balance sheet constraints are important, the responsiveness is not zero. I believe that it remains significant.\n\nEven in today’s challenging circumstances, lower long-term rates would support the economy through a number of channels. Lower long-term rates would support the value of assets, including houses and equities and household net worth. Lower long-term rates would make housing more affordable and support consumption by enabling households to refinance their mortgages at lower rates. This would increase the amount of income left over for other spending. Of course, this channel can be made more powerful to the extent that further progress can be made in efficient mortgage debt restructurings that allow households with negative equity in their homes to take advantage of the drop in mortgage rates. In addition, lower long-term rates would reduce the cost of capital for businesses, thereby fostering higher levels of capital spending for any given economic outlook.\n\nIn considering the limits to balance sheet expansion, there are two constraints—one major and one more minor. The first constraint is the risk that the balance sheet expansion might cause inflation expectations to become unanchored, leading to higher risk premia. This risk is presumably greater in a period in which budget deficits are high, as they are today.\n\nIf exit concerns were to rise as purchases increased, then a rise in inflation risk premia would offset at least some of the expected fall in interest rates. In contrast, the more credible the ultimate exit strategy, the less likely it is that inflation risk premia would go up and the more effective purchases would be in lowering long-term rates. Also, the more credible the ultimate exit plan, the more confident investors would be about the Fed’s willingness to do what is needed to accomplish its objectives. This is important because it would help stabilize longer-run inflation expectations at levels consistent with the dual mandate.\n\nThe FOMC should be able to assure investors that it has both the means and the will to exit when—but not before—the time is right. That is because the Federal Reserve has the tools to control financial conditions and credit creation even with an expanded balance sheet. Payment of interest on reserves allows us to control short-term rates with even a large amount of excess reserves outstanding. In addition, we can drain excess reserves in several ways. We have developed term deposit accounts and the ability to conduct reverse repurchase operations with a large number of counterparties that would allow us to drain a large volume of reserves. Also, when the time is right, the Fed can always sell assets. Such asset sales would lead to a rise in longer-term rates and this would have a contractionary effect on the demand for credit.\n\nI am very mindful of concerns here and abroad that balance sheet expansion could be interpreted as a policy of monetizing the federal debt . However, I regard this view to be fundamentally mistaken. It misses the point of what would be motivating the Federal Reserve. The FOMC would only engage in large-scale asset purchases in order to push the economy more rapidly toward the dual mandate goals of full employment and price stability. Once these goals were accomplished, there would be no basis for further purchases regardless of the government’s fiscal position because additional purchases would not be consistent with this mandate.\n\nThe second constraint is that further balance sheet expansion would increase the Federal Reserve’s interest rate risk by raising the maturity mismatch between its assets and liabilities. Recall that the bulk of the Fed’s liabilities are overnight reserves and the bulk of its assets are longer-term Treasuries, agency and agency MBS securities. The bigger the balance sheet becomes, the more a future rise in interest rates will squeeze the Federal Reserve’s net interest margin.\n\nSome worry that this exposure to higher short-term rates could conceivably affect the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy credibility in the future. Some market participants might worry that the Federal Reserve could become reluctant to raise short-term rates in a timely way because this would constrain the amount of revenue that it would earn and remit to the Treasury. I am confident there is nothing to worry about on this score.\n\nEven if the Federal Reserve was not obliged to act in keeping with its dual mandate—which it is—with its assets skewed toward longer-duration securities, the Federal Reserve would have every incentive to ensure price stability over the long term.\n\nIt is true that the larger the size of the balance sheet, the more likely it is that the Fed would ultimately sell assets back into the market, potentially at prices that could result in losses. Although some fear that such losses could compromise the Federal Reserve’s independence, there is no reason why this should be the case, providing we stick closely to our mandate at all times.\n\nTo date, the Fed’s actions in responding to the crisis have resulted in abnormally large profits that might reasonably be set against any subsequent losses. But much more importantly, our dual mandate does not state that we should do what is necessary to promote full employment and price stability only at times when we are virtually certain that in doing so we will make a profit. It directs us to promote full employment and price stability at all times. Profits and losses in any given year are much less important than getting the U.S. economy back to the highest level of employment consistent with price stability.\n\nIn making our assessments about next steps, we need to be a bit humble about our capacity to forecast how market participants would respond to our actions. We do not control their behavior nor have much historical experience that we can draw on to easily assess how they are likely to behave. Even viewpoints that turned out to be incorrect could persist for a long time and generate adverse consequences. It is not enough for us to be right in theory. We also have to be convincing in practice and in explaining why concerns we think are misplaced are indeed unwarranted.\n\nAs Chairman Bernanke indicated at Jackson Hole, the FOMC’s decision with respect to providing additional accommodation will be made by weighing the costs against the benefits. This is a dynamic process, which depends on the evolution of the economic outlook and our own ability to learn how to become more effective in improving the cost/benefit trade-offs.\n\nAnd, at its last meeting in September, the FOMC said it is “prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.”\n\nCurrently, my assessment is that both the current levels of unemployment and inflation and the timeframe over which they are likely to return to levels consistent with our mandate are unacceptable. In addition, the longer this situation prevails and the U.S. economy is stuck with the current level of slack and disinflationary pressure, the greater the likelihood that a further shock could push us still further from our dual mandate objectives and closer to outright deflation.\n\nWe have tools that can provide additional stimulus at costs that do not appear to be prohibitive. Thus, I conclude that further action is likely to be warranted unless the economic outlook evolves in a way that makes me more confident that we will see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before too long.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________ 1 Chairman Ben S.

    "text": "I welcome this opportunity to talk with business leaders, workers and educators. My goals are to hear what issues are on the minds of people here and to let you know what the Federal Reserve has been doing to help improve the economy. So I'm very grateful to the Center for the New Economy (CNE) for giving me the opportunity to speak to—and learn from—you. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI want to start by talking about the implications of the close economic ties between the mainland and Puerto Rico. Since the economies of the mainland and the Commonwealth are very tightly linked, what happens on the mainland has important consequences for Puerto Rico, as well. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, we anticipate that the mainland recovery will prove to be sustainable, and that this will ultimately benefit the economy here. But Puerto Rico faces some significant challenges beyond its ties to the weaknesses in the broader U.S. economy, including problems in its own financial sector. Dealing with these problems forcefully and expeditiously is crucial to ensuring that Puerto Rico benefits fully from the expected economic recovery over the next few years. The Fed is assisting in several ways: by setting the stage for a resumption of world economic growth, by helping to resolve problems in the U.S. mainland and Commonwealth financial sectors and by partnering with Puerto Rican groups to make meaningful contributions toward resolving some of the Commonwealth's other underlying issues.\n\nPuerto Rico's Special Economic Relationship with the Mainland Puerto Rico has what economists often call an “open economy.” What this means is that Puerto Rico is especially dependent on external trade, so what happens to the Puerto Rican economy is greatly affected by what is going on with its major trading partners. When demand from Puerto Rico's export customers is weak, then sales and prices for the Commonwealth's products fall, so jobs and incomes on the island suffer.\n\nIn the recent recession—as in many financial crises—global trade declined even faster than output. As a result, the shock generated by the financial crisis spread quickly throughout the world. Economies and regions far from where the problems began suffered. This was especially true for economies dependent on trade, such as Puerto Rico's. In fact, Puerto Rico suffered much more than most because the Puerto Rican economy was already in recession when the financial crisis struck. While Puerto Rico interacts with many other economies, one partner looms especially large for the Commonwealth. For generations, the mainland United States and Puerto Rico have had a special economic relationship in many dimensions. One of the most obvious of these ties is the free flow of people between the mainland and the island. Indeed, according to the U.S. Census, about one half of the people who identify their origin as Puerto Rican lived on the mainland in 2008. The active migration, return migration and remittances to family members reflect and reinforce the close personal and economic ties between Puerto Rico and the mainland. Another link is our common use of the dollar. This means that tourists from the mainland can visit without worrying about changing currencies. In addition, businesses can make long-term investments in Puerto Rico without worrying that currency fluctuations against the dollar will undermine their competitiveness. It also means that when the U.S. dollar falls in value, Puerto Rico's exports become more competitive around the world, although not, of course, in the United States. Somewhat less obvious are the consequences of the mainland's role as Puerto Rico's largest trading partner. The mainland accounts for half of the island's imports and three-quarters of its exports. With such heavy trade flows, when the mainland economy does poorly—as during the past year—Puerto Rico's economy and job growth suffer. Financial regulation also represents an important linkage. Of course, my presence here representing the New York Fed is one example of that particular connection—Puerto Rico is part of the Second District of the Federal Reserve System, along with New York, the U.S. Virgin Islands and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. I'll return to the theme of financial regulation shortly. For now, let me just say that we share, along with the rest of the world, a commitment to taking the necessary steps to prevent the type of financial crisis that we just experienced from recurring in the future. The Fed's Role in Coping with the Crisis and the Outlook for the United States The close ties with the mainland means that the broader outlook for the United States is very important for Puerto Rico. The U.S. economy has been through a terrible period, having suffered the worst financial crisis in 70 years. Extensive study of banking crises shows that they tend to be “protracted affairs” with surprisingly similar, if unpleasant, contours. Downturns average four years, during which the unemployment rate rises an average of 7 percentage points. The peak-to-trough decline in output averages 9 percent. Those statistics point out the risks that we faced. Well aware of the threat of a second Great Depression, U.S. policymakers took very aggressive actions to support economic growth in 2008 and 2009. The Fed provided liquidity facilities and took many other actions to contain and reduce pressures in financial markets, while the U.S. Treasury supported the banking system and provided cash and incentives to households, businesses, and state and local governments to support spending during 2009. The Fed's “lender of last resort” interventions—including facilities such as the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), as well as programs such as reciprocal currency agreements—are examples of the rapid application of central banking tenets to the unique challenges we faced as this crisis evolved. Indeed, in many ways, the crisis has underscored why the Federal Reserve was created almost a century ago: to provide a backstop for a banking system prone to runs and financial panics. Where it proved necessary and feasible, the Fed also used its emergency lending authority to forestall the disorderly failure of systemically important institutions. These actions truly were extraordinary—well outside the scope of our normal operations—but our judgment was that not taking those actions would have risked a broader collapse of the financial system and a significantly deeper and more protracted recession. Faced with the choice between these otherwise unpalatable actions and a broader systemic collapse, the Fed, with the full support of the Treasury, invoked its emergency lending authority and prevented the collapse of certain institutions previously considered to have been outside the safety net. Make no mistake: these necessary moves were unprecedented and controversial. The U.S. government's financing of Treasury's actions required federal debt to rise sharply, and stabilizing the financial system temporarily boosted the size of the Fed's balance sheet. The final numbers aren't in yet, but it now appears that the downturn in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States lasted about a year and a half, much shorter than the typical banking crisis downturn. Peak to trough, output fell about 4 percent, less than half the typical decline seen in past financial crises. While there are still some significant downside risks to the economy, in general, the outlook is improving. Of particular note, the capital markets—except for certain securitization markets—are now generally open for business. In addition, the big banks in the United States have been able to raise a large amount of equity capital to put themselves in a stronger position. I believe that Federal Reserve actions over the last year and a half have contributed very substantially to this improvement. But there still is a lot of work to do. Smaller banks—especially those with large commercial real estate exposures—are under pressure, while households and smaller businesses find that their access to credit is still constrained. Moreover, regulatory reform is essential to prevent this type of financial crisis going forward. We need to ensure that no financial institution is “too big to fail.” This means we need Congress to enact a resolution mechanism that allows large, complex financial firms to be wound down smoothly, without the need for extraordinary interventions. In addition, we need to take steps to make the financial system as a whole more resilient and robust. This requires many steps—some already in train—including higher capital requirements for large banks, bigger liquidity buffers, and changes to ensure that compensation practices are consistent with safety and soundness and financial stability. It's a long list—there is no single silver bullet—and it will take time, but the regulatory community and the political leadership will fail to meet our shared responsibility as stewards if we do not implement the necessary reforms in a timely and effective manner. Outlook for the Recovery and Risks from the Financial Sector The U.S. economy has begun to recover. Growth in the second half of 2009 was a bit stronger than expected and the pace of layoffs has diminished. We currently expect that the economy will keep expanding, but at a somewhat slower growth rate than during the second half of 2009 as the temporary boost from the inventory cycle fades and the effects of the stimulus bill gradually weaken. With modest growth, we expect price pressures to remain well contained. Nonetheless, it's far too early to pop the champagne corks. While the U.S. economy is growing, unemployment remains unacceptably high and certain impediments could restrict growth in the near term. One set of challenges are current conditions in the financial system. The initial stages of the financial crisis have been widely attributed to a rapid rise in residential mortgage defaults. Many large financial institutions turned out to have direct exposure—and often indirect exposure through complex linkages—to residential real estate, and found themselves facing severe funding problems as the value and liquidity of their assets sharply diminished. As the real economy slipped into recession in 2008 and unemployment began to rise, other financial instruments came under stress, including commercial real estate loans and instruments based on these loans. Commercial real estate loans are frequently originated by medium-sized regional banks that have significant expertise in their local areas and are often held in the lending bank's portfolio. In many parts of the United States, including Puerto Rico, these commercial real estate loans have now soured, and many banks are seeing the value of their assets decline and their revenues shrink. In extreme cases, some banks have become insolvent. Finding ways to address problem assets and the health of the exposed banks is fundamental to restoring the banking industry to the firm footing that is needed to properly support economic growth. To bring this point home, let me step back and offer some observations on the importance of a well-functioning financial system. A healthy banking sector is crucial for economic growth because banks and other parts of the financial system play a key role in determining how savings are allocated among competing projects and users of credit. If households and businesses cannot get credit on reasonable terms, then the economy sputters. To underline this point, the Fed and Treasury did not intervene during the recent crisis to save the financial system (and with it, some big financial firms) for its own sake. We intervened because a collapse of the financial system would have done irreparable harm to Main Street. With the limited tools at hand, we made our choices (often between unattractive options) with the goal of supporting the economy, households and small businesses. A well-functioning financial system is also crucial in fostering economic development. History shows that substantial risks to the economy come from a persistently weak banking sector. Economists have debated whether healthy banks drive real economic growth, or vice-versa, but a wealth of recent evidence suggests that the causality runs at least partly from banks to growth, and not just the other way around. So, from my perspective, getting Puerto Rico's banking system back onto solid footing is “job one” for supporting growth here. Preparing Puerto Rico to Benefit from Recovery in the World Economy Of course, that isn't the whole story. Growth may also be impeded by factors that are specific to particular regions or policies. I work in New York and live in New Jersey, where we know a thing or two about fiscal problems. Puerto Rico's large public debt has the potential to reduce its growth prospects as the world economy recovers. Puerto Rico's fiscal situation has deteriorated sharply over the last five years as the Commonwealth's recession has deepened. Throughout this period, public debt has risen quickly as revenues that are sensitive to economic activity—such as income taxes—have declined. But the fiscal problem in Puerto Rico pre-dates the current crisis. Even when the economy was growing, public debt was growing even faster. This structural imbalance is difficult to sustain in the long run, and requires attention if Puerto Rico is to prosper. A critical factor here is ensuring that the Commonwealth's tax system is designed to generate the revenue required to sustain government operations. Furthermore, any good tax system should satisfy three important criteria: simplicity, fairness and neutrality. The current system suffers from some problems that make it difficult to meet these tests and generate adequate revenue. In particular, high rates are levied on a narrow tax base. One of the key public services funded by these taxes is education. Workers need skills to produce the complicated technological products of the future. There is clear evidence that workers with the sort of flexible thinking skills not easily duplicated by computers have seen their productivity and earnings rise, a trend that is likely to persist in the future. Thus, technology and skills are essential for healthy economic growth and for the financial health of workers and their families. As the economy and financial system become more complex, financial literacy is also increasingly central to family financial well-being. Improved understanding of budgeting, saving, financial products and planning for retirement is not only a high priority for people in their own lives, but also for the Fed with its responsibility for monetary policy. Education thus plays a key role in fostering upward mobility for future generations. All of this underscores the importance of achieving the best possible education for all of Puerto Rico's young people and making lifelong learning and skills development a part of everyone's future. Yet, about half of Puerto Rico's low-income students drop out of high school. Reducing this dropout rate will not be easy, but should also be a priority for the Commonwealth. The private and public sectors both need accurate, timely and comprehensive economic statistics to perform effectively. It is impossible to make good decisions without a solid factual basis for those decisions. For example, the government needs good economic information to develop effective fiscal, economic development and regulatory policy. Likewise, to make the best production, investment and pricing decisions, businesses need accurate and timely information on things such as wages, income and prices. Poor quality information increases uncertainty and this uncertainty inhibits well-considered risk-taking and investment decisions. Although Puerto Rico's statistical system was once a model for other countries, now there are major opportunities for improvement in comparison with the mainland and other countries. In recognition of this need, the government of Puerto Rico recently established the Institute for Statistics to work with its statistical agencies. One key example of these efforts concerns the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a measure of inflation. A recent study by the Institute, aided by the Department of Labor, found that the island's official inflation rate was overestimated by more than double between 2001 and 2006. Overestimating inflation can have tangible consequences, such as excessive wage increases in certain sectors that can damage the island's global competitiveness and cause unnecessary job loss. Also thanks to the Institute, the government of Puerto Rico now has a release schedule, called the “ calendario ,” for its statistical publications. This basic tool helps people, businesses and investors by ensuring that they use the latest available data for their decisions. It also boosts confidence in the data, which reduces economic uncertainty. How the Fed Is Helping There are many challenges ahead, and we are committed to being an active partner in confronting them. The Fed's most important roles in helping Puerto Rico, of course, emanate directly from our responsibilities for economic growth, stable prices and a resilient financial system. We continue to take the actions required to promote maximum sustainable growth in the U.S. economy. These efforts have and will continue to benefit the mainland and the Commonwealth. In addition, we are working very closely with all of the banking supervisors and other key parties to facilitate an effective resolution to the current problems facing the island's banking sector. Some consolidation is likely needed to produce stronger, healthier institutions more able to make the sound lending decisions that support economic growth. Let me also tell you a bit about how we are contributing “on the ground” here in Puerto Rico. I mentioned financial literacy a few minutes ago. The Federal Reserve System and the New York Fed have taken a great interest in economic education and financial literacy and will continue to do even more in the future. I, personally, believe that financial literacy is essential so that households can make the type of good financial decisions that help to ensure better futures. The New York Fed, along with many financial institutions and foundations in Puerto Rico, has created and supported the Economic and Financial Education Alliance of Puerto Rico. Over the past ten years, the Alliance has trained more than 400 high school teachers in economics and financial literacy. I would like to personally thank all the institutions whose devotion to this Alliance has made these education efforts possible. These teachers take what they learned back to the classroom and many of their students enter the Federal Reserve Economics Competition. The students apply analytical skills to a local problem of their choosing and work as a team to create a presentation outlining their solution and responding to questions. The winning team develops skills—in analysis, presentations and teamwork—that will help them in their future studies and careers in the knowledge economy. The New York Fed is also supporting the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions in its two-week expo, where last year 20,000 people saw presentations and received financial counseling. We have also had a productive relationship with our good friends at the Puerto Rico Bankers Association. Each year during “Community Reinvestment Act Week,” our staff highlights new ideas and products especially suited to the Puerto Rican market. For example, this November we held a forum for Puerto Rican and U.S. Virgin Islands financial institutions, state and local governments, and nonprofit organizations to introduce “Bank On,” a financial product proven to attract under-banked people into the financial mainstream. Since then, several local banks have formed a group to explore how to best implement it here. Another example of collaboration is our work with the Bankers Association and local universities. During the fall, we held a “Financial Awareness Video Contest” for college students. This pilot project explores building peer-to-peer financial awareness among young adults by having contestants create a 90-second video. We look forward to hosting the first place winners during their trip to New York in the spring. To improve our understanding of the Puerto Rican economy, the New York Fed has joined a group of local businesses—including some represented here—to sponsor and fund a household survey, undertaken by the Center for the New Economy, our hosts today, to benchmark Puerto Rican consumer finances. As of today, the data have been collected and Fed economists are collaborating with the CNE to provide technical assistance, to make the results of this study public and to make these data available for further research. To help businesses and government in Puerto Rico, we have also been providing technical assistance to Puerto Rico's new Institute for Statistics. We recognize the importance of this work and applaud its efforts to improve Puerto Rico's inflation measures, national income accounting and business activity measures, just to name a few. All of these activities, from monetary policy and financial regulation to fostering community development and economic literacy and measurement, complement and reinforce each other. Our policy actions are most effective when people understand how financial markets work. Our decisions are always better when we are well informed about the concerns of families and businesses. Thus, outreach to the region and communities we serve is an important part of my job. Thank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.

We need to ensure that no financial institution is “too big to fail.” This means we need Congress to enact a resolution mechanism that allows large, complex financial firms to be wound down smoothly, without the need for extraordinary interventions. In addition, we need to take steps to make the financial system as a whole more resilient and robust. This requires many steps—some already in train—including higher capital requirements for large banks, bigger liquidity buffers, and changes to ensure that compensation practices are consistent with safety and soundness and financial stability. It's a long list—there is no single silver bullet—and it will take time, but the regulatory community and the political leadership will fail to meet our shared responsibility as stewards if we do not implement the necessary reforms in a timely and effective manner.\n\nOutlook for the Recovery and Risks from the Financial Sector The U.S. economy has begun to recover. Growth in the second half of 2009 was a bit stronger than expected and the pace of layoffs has diminished. We currently expect that the economy will keep expanding, but at a somewhat slower growth rate than during the second half of 2009 as the temporary boost from the inventory cycle fades and the effects of the stimulus bill gradually weaken. With modest growth, we expect price pressures to remain well contained.\n\nNonetheless, it's far too early to pop the champagne corks. While the U.S. economy is growing, unemployment remains unacceptably high and certain impediments could restrict growth in the near term. One set of challenges are current conditions in the financial system. The initial stages of the financial crisis have been widely attributed to a rapid rise in residential mortgage defaults. Many large financial institutions turned out to have direct exposure—and often indirect exposure through complex linkages—to residential real estate, and found themselves facing severe funding problems as the value and liquidity of their assets sharply diminished. As the real economy slipped into recession in 2008 and unemployment began to rise, other financial instruments came under stress, including commercial real estate loans and instruments based on these loans. Commercial real estate loans are frequently originated by medium-sized regional banks that have significant expertise in their local areas and are often held in the lending bank's portfolio. In many parts of the United States, including Puerto Rico, these commercial real estate loans have now soured, and many banks are seeing the value of their assets decline and their revenues shrink. In extreme cases, some banks have become insolvent. Finding ways to address problem assets and the health of the exposed banks is fundamental to restoring the banking industry to the firm footing that is needed to properly support economic growth. To bring this point home, let me step back and offer some observations on the importance of a well-functioning financial system. A healthy banking sector is crucial for economic growth because banks and other parts of the financial system play a key role in determining how savings are allocated among competing projects and users of credit. If households and businesses cannot get credit on reasonable terms, then the economy sputters. To underline this point, the Fed and Treasury did not intervene during the recent crisis to save the financial system (and with it, some big financial firms) for its own sake. We intervened because a collapse of the financial system would have done irreparable harm to Main Street. With the limited tools at hand, we made our choices (often between unattractive options) with the goal of supporting the economy, households and small businesses. A well-functioning financial system is also crucial in fostering economic development. History shows that substantial risks to the economy come from a persistently weak banking sector. Economists have debated whether healthy banks drive real economic growth, or vice-versa, but a wealth of recent evidence suggests that the causality runs at least partly from banks to growth, and not just the other way around. So, from my perspective, getting Puerto Rico's banking system back onto solid footing is “job one” for supporting growth here. Preparing Puerto Rico to Benefit from Recovery in the World Economy Of course, that isn't the whole story. Growth may also be impeded by factors that are specific to particular regions or policies. I work in New York and live in New Jersey, where we know a thing or two about fiscal problems. Puerto Rico's large public debt has the potential to reduce its growth prospects as the world economy recovers. Puerto Rico's fiscal situation has deteriorated sharply over the last five years as the Commonwealth's recession has deepened. Throughout this period, public debt has risen quickly as revenues that are sensitive to economic activity—such as income taxes—have declined. But the fiscal problem in Puerto Rico pre-dates the current crisis. Even when the economy was growing, public debt was growing even faster. This structural imbalance is difficult to sustain in the long run, and requires attention if Puerto Rico is to prosper. A critical factor here is ensuring that the Commonwealth's tax system is designed to generate the revenue required to sustain government operations. Furthermore, any good tax system should satisfy three important criteria: simplicity, fairness and neutrality. The current system suffers from some problems that make it difficult to meet these tests and generate adequate revenue. In particular, high rates are levied on a narrow tax base. One of the key public services funded by these taxes is education. Workers need skills to produce the complicated technological products of the future. There is clear evidence that workers with the sort of flexible thinking skills not easily duplicated by computers have seen their productivity and earnings rise, a trend that is likely to persist in the future. Thus, technology and skills are essential for healthy economic growth and for the financial health of workers and their families. As the economy and financial system become more complex, financial literacy is also increasingly central to family financial well-being. Improved understanding of budgeting, saving, financial products and planning for retirement is not only a high priority for people in their own lives, but also for the Fed with its responsibility for monetary policy. Education thus plays a key role in fostering upward mobility for future generations. All of this underscores the importance of achieving the best possible education for all of Puerto Rico's young people and making lifelong learning and skills development a part of everyone's future. Yet, about half of Puerto Rico's low-income students drop out of high school. Reducing this dropout rate will not be easy, but should also be a priority for the Commonwealth. The private and public sectors both need accurate, timely and comprehensive economic statistics to perform effectively. It is impossible to make good decisions without a solid factual basis for those decisions. For example, the government needs good economic information to develop effective fiscal, economic development and regulatory policy. Likewise, to make the best production, investment and pricing decisions, businesses need accurate and timely information on things such as wages, income and prices. Poor quality information increases uncertainty and this uncertainty inhibits well-considered risk-taking and investment decisions. Although Puerto Rico's statistical system was once a model for other countries, now there are major opportunities for improvement in comparison with the mainland and other countries. In recognition of this need, the government of Puerto Rico recently established the Institute for Statistics to work with its statistical agencies. One key example of these efforts concerns the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as a measure of inflation. A recent study by the Institute, aided by the Department of Labor, found that the island's official inflation rate was overestimated by more than double between 2001 and 2006. Overestimating inflation can have tangible consequences, such as excessive wage increases in certain sectors that can damage the island's global competitiveness and cause unnecessary job loss. Also thanks to the Institute, the government of Puerto Rico now has a release schedule, called the “ calendario ,” for its statistical publications. This basic tool helps people, businesses and investors by ensuring that they use the latest available data for their decisions. It also boosts confidence in the data, which reduces economic uncertainty. How the Fed Is Helping There are many challenges ahead, and we are committed to being an active partner in confronting them. The Fed's most important roles in helping Puerto Rico, of course, emanate directly from our responsibilities for economic growth, stable prices and a resilient financial system. We continue to take the actions required to promote maximum sustainable growth in the U.S. economy. These efforts have and will continue to benefit the mainland and the Commonwealth. In addition, we are working very closely with all of the banking supervisors and other key parties to facilitate an effective resolution to the current problems facing the island's banking sector. Some consolidation is likely needed to produce stronger, healthier institutions more able to make the sound lending decisions that support economic growth. Let me also tell you a bit about how we are contributing “on the ground” here in Puerto Rico. I mentioned financial literacy a few minutes ago. The Federal Reserve System and the New York Fed have taken a great interest in economic education and financial literacy and will continue to do even more in the future. I, personally, believe that financial literacy is essential so that households can make the type of good financial decisions that help to ensure better futures. The New York Fed, along with many financial institutions and foundations in Puerto Rico, has created and supported the Economic and Financial Education Alliance of Puerto Rico. Over the past ten years, the Alliance has trained more than 400 high school teachers in economics and financial literacy. I would like to personally thank all the institutions whose devotion to this Alliance has made these education efforts possible. These teachers take what they learned back to the classroom and many of their students enter the Federal Reserve Economics Competition. The students apply analytical skills to a local problem of their choosing and work as a team to create a presentation outlining their solution and responding to questions. The winning team develops skills—in analysis, presentations and teamwork—that will help them in their future studies and careers in the knowledge economy. The New York Fed is also supporting the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions in its two-week expo, where last year 20,000 people saw presentations and received financial counseling. We have also had a productive relationship with our good friends at the Puerto Rico Bankers Association. Each year during “Community Reinvestment Act Week,” our staff highlights new ideas and products especially suited to the Puerto Rican market. For example, this November we held a forum for Puerto Rican and U.S. Virgin Islands financial institutions, state and local governments, and nonprofit organizations to introduce “Bank On,” a financial product proven to attract under-banked people into the financial mainstream. Since then, several local banks have formed a group to explore how to best implement it here. Another example of collaboration is our work with the Bankers Association and local universities. During the fall, we held a “Financial Awareness Video Contest” for college students. This pilot project explores building peer-to-peer financial awareness among young adults by having contestants create a 90-second video. We look forward to hosting the first place winners during their trip to New York in the spring. To improve our understanding of the Puerto Rican economy, the New York Fed has joined a group of local businesses—including some represented here—to sponsor and fund a household survey, undertaken by the Center for the New Economy, our hosts today, to benchmark Puerto Rican consumer finances. As of today, the data have been collected and Fed economists are collaborating with the CNE to provide technical assistance, to make the results of this study public and to make these data available for further research. To help businesses and government in Puerto Rico, we have also been providing technical assistance to Puerto Rico's new Institute for Statistics. We recognize the importance of this work and applaud its efforts to improve Puerto Rico's inflation measures, national income accounting and business activity measures, just to name a few. All of these activities, from monetary policy and financial regulation to fostering community development and economic literacy and measurement, complement and reinforce each other. Our policy actions are most effective when people understand how financial markets work. Our decisions are always better when we are well informed about the concerns of families and businesses. Thus, outreach to the region and communities we serve is an important part of my job. Thank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.

Each year during “Community Reinvestment Act Week,” our staff highlights new ideas and products especially suited to the Puerto Rican market.\n\nFor example, this November we held a forum for Puerto Rican and U.S. Virgin Islands financial institutions, state and local governments, and nonprofit organizations to introduce “Bank On,” a financial product proven to attract under-banked people into the financial mainstream. Since then, several local banks have formed a group to explore how to best implement it here.\n\nAnother example of collaboration is our work with the Bankers Association and local universities. During the fall, we held a “Financial Awareness Video Contest” for college students.

    "text": "As I see it, we need to reexamine how central banks should respond to potential asset bubbles. After all, recent experience has underscored the fact that poorly regulated financial systems are prone to such bubbles and that the costs of waiting to respond to an asset bubble until after it has burst can be very high.\n\nToday, I will try to define some of the important characteristics of asset price bubbles. I will argue that bubbles do exist and that bubbles typically occur after an innovation that has created uncertainty about fundamental valuations. This has two important implications. First, a bubble is difficult to discern and, second, each bubble has unique characteristics. This implies that a rules-based approach to bubbles is likely to be ineffective and that tackling bubbles to diminish their potential to destabilize the financial system requires judgment.\n\nDespite the fact that it is hard to discern bubbles, especially in their early stages, I conclude that uncertainty is not grounds for inaction. Instead, the decision whether to act depends on whether appropriate tools can be deployed to limit the size of a bubble and whether the benefits of acting and deploying such tools are likely to exceed the costs.\n\nThat cost-benefit calculus, in turn, depends crucially on the tools we can deploy to limit the growth of bubbles and the consequences when they burst. In this respect, I will argue that, in most cases, use of the bully pulpit and macroprudential tools, such as rules limiting loan-to-value ratios or leverage, are likely to prove superior to monetary policy.\n\nTurning to the first issue of whether there are asset bubbles, I am going to be a bit of a heretic and argue that there is little doubt that asset bubbles exist and that they occur fairly frequently. By an asset bubble, I mean price increases (or declines) that become unmoored from fundamental valuations. I want to be clear that I am distinguishing this from price movements that are tied to changes in fundamentals. I know this runs afoul of the efficient markets hypothesis—which in this context would argue that if a bubble were obvious, then people would take the other side and the bubble would not occur in the first place.\n\nThere are several reasons why this argument does not hold in practice. First, it is not always easy to take the other side. There may be constraints on the ability to short the asset in question. Such limits on the ability to short sell can arise for many reasons. For some assets, short selling in size might simply not be possible because the markets are not sufficiently developed. Also, even if there were instruments that can be used to go short, it may not be an easy trade to undertake. For example, if a bubble builds up over many years and market participants’ compensation is based on year-to-year performance, there may be disincentives to take the short side. Compensation schemes and other practices that skew incentives may create a bias to simply “trade with the market.”\n\nSecond, bubbles may simply emerge from the way market participants process information and trade. Experimental work done by behavioral economists has shown that people often trade in ways that generate price bubbles. In many carefully controlled experiments in which the intrinsic value of the asset could be determined with certainty, participants still bid prices up far above fundamental valuations, with the bubbles being followed by sharp declines in prices.\n\nLet me give you an example of one of the seminal studies of this type. In this experiment, all investors start with an identical asset that pays the same dividend generated from a known probability distribution at the end of each trading period. 1 This means that all participants know the expected value of the dividend stream with certainty. The participants are allowed to buy and sell these assets from one another. In this framework, if all participants were fully rational, then trading should occur only at intrinsic values based on the expected dividend stream. But this is not what happens in practice. In 14 of the 22 experimental runs, prices rose significantly above fundamental valuations and these price bubbles were followed by crashes. When traders in these experimental runs were “experienced,” meaning that they had participated in the experiment before, the probability of a bubble was reduced, but not eliminated. The authors conclude: “What we learn from the particular experiments … is that a common dividend and common knowledge thereof is insufficient to induce initial common expectations. …” The lack of common initial expectations leads to a willingness to trade to try and earn capital gains above fundamental value. 2 Relaxing the conditions in these types of behavioral studies to admit more uncertainty about fundamental asset valuations works to enhance the propensity for bubbles by increasing the degree of divergence in participants’ initial expectations.\n\nLastly, over the past few decades, there simply have been too many episodes in which asset prices have dramatically overshot on the upside and then violently corrected to suggest that the behavioral studies conducted in the laboratory do not also have real world counterparts. In the United States, these include the run-up in the value of the dollar in the mid-1980s, the stock market rise and crash in 1987; the compression of spreads due to convergence trades in the run-up to the Long-Term Capital Management debacle in 1998; the technology stock market boom of the late 1990s; and the credit and housing price bubble and crash of recent years. All these episodes were marked by spectacular price booms, followed by subsequent collapses.\n\nAn examination of some of these recent bubbles suggests that while asset bubbles are idiosyncratic in terms of their causes, institutional features, duration and severity, they often share several significant features. These shared features are important in assessing how policy might be used to temper incipient bubbles in the future.\n\nIn my view, asset bubbles often come about through a particular sequence of events. First, there is typically an innovation that changes the fundamental valuation in a meaningful, but uncertain way. 3 Asset valuations associated with the innovation change (as they should), but there is significant uncertainty about how valuable the innovation will turn out to be. This leads to a divergence in expectations concerning how much the fair value of the assets should increase. I believe that this uncertainty about what constitutes fair value is important in fueling the bubble.\n\nFor example, the technology stock market boom in the late 1990s coincided with the development of the Internet, which fostered the reorganization of many business processes and generated significant productivity improvements. At the time, it was unclear just how significant the innovation would be or how successful the companies would be that sought to take advantage of it. On the one hand, there were companies such as Cisco, which sold the “shovels”—the routers that enabled the Internet to work—that were very successful. On the other hand, there were companies such as Webvan, which sought to use the new technology to revolutionize the delivery of grocery supplies and services, and that failed miserably.\n\nSimilarly, the recent housing boom was driven by two innovations: (1) in housing finance, where subprime lending made mortgage credit available to households that were much less creditworthy, and (2) in structured finance instruments such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The first innovation significantly broadened the availability of mortgage credit to households. The second innovation reduced the cost of this credit. Cash flows from the underlying mortgage assets were apportioned among senior and junior tranches. These tranches, which had been rated by the rating agencies, were then distributed to a wide range of investors. This structured finance innovation, in turn, was supported by innovations in the shadow banking system. Securities lenders, structured investment vehicles and conduits bought the highly rated tranches of the structured financed products and financed these assets in the wholesale short-term funding markets.\n\nThe second element common to many asset bubbles is a surge in economic activity in the particular sector associated with the innovation. In the case of the technology stock market boom, there was a surge in business investment in technology goods and services. In the subprime/structured finance boom, there was a surge in demand for housing as credit availability increased sharply. This surge in activity is important because it reinforces the notion that the innovation is indeed significant and that “this time is different.”\n\nThird, there is often a positive feedback mechanism that tends to reinforce the belief system that underpins the extreme valuations associated with the boom. Without this, the boom isn’t likely to persist for long or push valuations far above what is justified by the fundamentals. As a result, the asset price movements are unlikely to be big or broad enough to threaten financial and macroeconomic stability.\n\nDuring the technology stock boom there were a number of reinforcing mechanisms. One important reinforcing mechanism was the strong notion that those who got to the market with their new Internet innovations would achieve large first-mover advantages. This perception was due to the fact that successful Internet-based models could expect to achieve strong network effects, which created significant barriers to entry and the prospect of extraordinary profits. Amazon might be a good example of a company that (eventually) succeeded at this.\n\nIn this environment, many firms—both well-established companies and start-ups—invested heavily in the new technology. The ensuing sharp rise in investment in technology equipment and software led in turn to rapid earnings growth, which helped (for a time) to sustain stratospheric valuations.\n\nIn addition, the sharp rise in stock prices led to a re-assessment of the appropriate equity risk premium. The higher that stock prices rose, the more people thought that equities had little risk. Everyone could become a millionaire with little risk or effort. 4\n\nSimilarly, in the subprime/structured finance boom, there were several important positive feedback mechanisms. In particular, the surge in credit availability drove up the demand for housing and pushed up housing prices. This increase in demand caused the default experience associated with such lending to be very low, reinforcing the notion that subprime lending was not very risky. It also reinforced the demand for the complex CDOs secured by such assets. During the boom, the structured finance models appeared to be sound because losses on the underlying subprime mortgage loans were low and because the correlation rates in performance across different assets in the pools were low, just as the models had assumed.\n\nFourth, the proportion of market participants who believe that a particular episode of asset price increases are justified by the innovation tends to rise as the boom persists. Those that had doubts about the importance of the innovation or the persistence of the gain in asset prices lose confidence in their opinions as they underperform and lose business and market share. Those who believed that the large gains in asset prices were justified by the innovation and who benefited from those beliefs become more dominant. Casual investors see the large rise in prices and jump in. This shift is important because, in markets, prices are driven by the marginal investor. As new and often less well-informed investors plunge in to participate in the boom, they can overwhelm the so-called “smart money” that gets frustrated after having lost repeatedly trying to take the other side.\n\nIn this respect, a bias toward optimism may also play an important role. Studies have found that most people believe that they are above average in terms of their acumen, be it as investors, car drivers or in other activities. 5 This overconfidence may cause some people to keep investing in the asset, even when they are skeptical about its valuation because they are overly confident that they will anticipate the end of the bubble and be able to get out in time.\n\nFifth, asset bubbles occur more easily when it is difficult to short the assets. For example, the technology stocks associated with initial public offerings were very difficult to short because the available supply or “float” was small—a high proportion of the shares in the companies were held by the original venture capital investors and subject to lock-up periods before the shares could be lent out to short sellers or sold. Similarly, housing is notoriously difficult to short. The option of selling one’s home in order to rent is expensive not only in terms of time and effort, but also in terms of transaction costs. And, shorting complex structured finance products was difficult because there were no standardized instruments; the securities rarely traded and were very difficult to value. It was not until the development of the ABX indexes—which allowed investors to buy and sell credit default swaps on pools of structured finance obligations—that investors had a vehicle that allowed them to short subprime mortgage-backed securities more easily. 6\n\nAsset bubbles often come to an end when the basic belief system is contradicted by events. This can happen very naturally as a matter of course because economic fundamentals deteriorate, or because there is a change in rules or regulations that disrupts the balance between supply and demand. In the technology boom, this might occur because each company cannot get to the market first. So even if there is a first-mover advantage, not everyone will be able to take advantage of it. Over time, the failure to achieve first-mover status becomes evident and valuations adjust to reflect this, or lock-up provisions on Internet stocks expire, leading to a large increase in supply that leads to a sharp fall in prices. 7\n\nIn the housing boom, the end came about for several reasons. One limiting factor was that the rise in home prices outstripped income growth. Thus, for the boom to persist, underwriting standards had to be continually relaxed; only in this way could a new cohort of first-time buyers qualify for big enough mortgages to be able to “afford” to buy their homes. The difficulty in replenishing the pool of new home buyers limited how fast demand could keep rising. In addition, the rise in home prices led to an explosion of supply especially in areas like Arizona, Florida, Nevada and inland California, where buildable land was plentiful.\n\nAs supply caught up to demand, this led to a downturn in prices. Once this occurred, the poor underwriting standards associated with subprime mortgage lending became apparent. Subprime borrowers could no longer easily refinance or sell the house at a higher price and repay the original mortgage. As Warren Buffett reportedly once quipped: “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who has been swimming naked.”\n\nSo what does this analysis imply for a central bank that might want to limit the development of such bubbles? The first conclusion is that assessing whether there is a bubble or not or the size of the prospective bubble is going to be very challenging. Because there is an innovation, asset values should rise, but by how much? It is difficult to assess what is the new, appropriate valuation after an important innovation. For example, consider some questions that might have arisen relative to the technology bubble: What does the Internet mean for technology investment? How many of the new business startups will survive and prosper? Is an Amazon rare? How fast will the volume of Internet traffic grow and for how long?\n\nSimilar questions arose with respect to the recent housing bubble: How much will subprime lending increase the demand for housing? How will this increase in demand translate into prices? What will the default rate be once demand growth slows? What is the appropriate correlation rate in terms of the loss experience across the different subprime and Alt-A mortgage pools that should be used in assessing the value of collateralized debt obligations? How are such correlations likely to differ in the boom versus in the bust?\n\nThis uncertainty means that policymakers can never be sure about the existence, size or persistence of an incipient asset bubble. As a result, this task of dealing proactively with bubbles will be very difficult!\n\nSo what should the policymaker do? I think the first step is for the policymaker to work hard to investigate what is generating the sharp rise in prices for the asset in question. Sustained price increases are a symptom of changes in demand and supply. The policymaker needs to develop a perspective about whether these demand and supply changes are realistically sustainable to the extent implied by market prices. In particular, carefully analyzing the assumptions that underpin sustained increases in asset prices—which might be symptoms of a bubble—and considering the risk that these assumptions might be wrong is important. Also, looking carefully at the dynamics of the system on which the beliefs are based may be useful. In particular, are the dynamics of the system reinforcing or dampening? If the dynamics are reinforcing, then there is greater likelihood of an asset bubble.\n\nThe next step is for the policymaker to evaluate what tools might be available to curb the imbalances that have been identified. The idiosyncratic nature of the innovations and belief systems associated with particular bubbles implies that the tools used to respond to each bubble will likely have to be different and tailored to the features of the particular bubble in question.\n\nFinally, the policymaker needs to conduct a careful cost-benefit analysis, weighing how successful a particular policy might be in restraining the rise in asset prices versus how costly it would be to remain passive, letting the bubble grow and then potentially burst disruptively. Many factors will affect the outcome of this analysis including the magnitude of the potential asset bubble and whether the potential asset bubble is occurring in the equity or debt markets.\n\nIn this analysis, the policymaker is likely to find that compared with equity market bubbles, credit market bubbles are more prone to generate higher costs when they burst. Thus, the benefits of preventing credit bubbles from forming and collapsing are likely to be higher.\n\nCredit bubbles that burst threaten the stability of the financial system much more directly than equity bubbles. 8 That is because much of the debt is held by banks and securities dealers that are highly leveraged. As a result, when the bubble deflates, it can take the financial system with it. In contrast, because most equities are held on an unleveraged basis by investors, such as pension and mutual funds, a sharp decline in equity prices will not typically threaten the entire financial system. A comparison of the consequences of the technology stock market crash in equities versus the mortgage debt market crash strongly supports this thesis. Although the wealth loss was roughly comparable, the bursting of the housing bubble had a much greater negative effect on the financial system and the macroeconomy.\n\nIn this cost-benefit analysis, the central bank must understand that it will make mistakes. On one hand, it may fail to temper bubbles that turn out to be disruptive when they collapse. Or, on the other hand, it may try to temper price movement that it thinks are bubbles but are not bubbles at all. The costs of these types of errors much be weighed against the potential benefits of tempering an asset bubble and limiting the damage from its subsequent collapse. 9\n\nSo what are the tools with which the policymaker should respond? As I see it, there are three broad sets of tools available: 1) The bully pulpit; 2) macroprudential tools; and 3) monetary policy. Let me now discuss each of these in turn.\n\nThe first tool available is to simply lean against the wind of conventional wisdom by speaking out about the dangers associated with the incipient bubble. The policymaker could point out the assumptions embedded in the rapid rise in asset prices and question the accuracy of the assumptions. Obviously, the policymaker might be ridiculed by true believers about the lack of understanding about the important nature of the innovation. But I suspect that over time, a proactive central bank that laid out the risks clearly would gradually gain credibility with market participants. Use of the bully pulpit would allow the central bank to signal its concern. This might shift the risk/reward trade-off by raising the risks that the talk might foreshadow more forceful action. That, by itself, could temper behavior. Announcement effects can be very powerful, especially when they can be followed by changes in policy.\n\nThe second set of tools includes those that are macroprudential in nature. I would define macroprudential tools as regulatory and supervisory actions that are not applied on a firm-specific basis. These include tools designed to temper demand or increase supply in the asset subject to the bubble or to increase the ability of skeptics to take the other side of the market in which the bubble may be occurring. For example, to counteract a housing bubble, tools available might include limiting loan-to-value ratios, limiting debt service-to-income ratios or increasing the taxes on housing transactions. Several Asian and some European countries have used such tools to limit speculative real estate activity, apparently with some success, although the counterfactual cannot be known by definition. 10 To limit a subprime lending boom, the authorities might wish to enforce strict underwriting practices, including verifying purchasers’ incomes and enforcing rigorous appraisal valuations. Increasing the ability of investors to short the assets in question might also be helpful.\n\nIn terms of macroprudential tools, I’d also include tools that influence how the financial system operates and functions. Such tools might include supervisory measures that set liquidity and capital requirements for financial institutions and other intermediaries. They might also include tools that try to limit the overall buildup of leverage in the financial system. For the equity market, macroprudential tools might include margin rules for cash, options, futures and equity over-the-counter derivatives. For the fixed income market, such tools might include raising the haircuts charged to securities dealers on their repo financing; raising the haircuts that the securities dealers assess against the collateralized borrowings of their customers as part of their prime brokerage business, or raising initial margin requirements on OTC derivatives transactions.\n\nMacroprudential tools are undoubtedly difficult to use effectively in practice. For example, it is difficult to judge their impact. If, for example, loan-to-value ratios for single-family mortgages are lowered by 5 percentage points, how big an impact will this have on housing demand? There also is a risk that the rules or regulations will simply be circumvented. For example, investors might move to instruments or to off-shore regimes with less stringent margin and leverage restrictions. Thus, it is important that the authorities have the ability to apply the macroprudential tools broadly throughout the financial sector. 11\n\nNone of this is going to be easy. A lot more work will be required to develop a portfolio of tools that could be used, that would be effective and would not be subject to significant evasion or unintended consequences.\n\nIn terms of the use of macroprudential tools, let me briefly take note of another issue that requires significant consideration—the issue of governance. Who controls all these tools? Who decides when the tools will be deployed and how extensively or intensively? Having a sufficient toolkit seems like a good idea. But lodging all this authority within a single entity or institution might not be practical or desirable.\n\nThe final tool available to the central bank is monetary policy. This tool is not likely to work as well as macroprudential tools because it is too broad. Typically, monetary policy will not address specifically the sources of the changes in supply and demand that are driving the bubble and, obviously, monetary policy will have big effects elsewhere.\n\nSome argue that monetary policy should “lean against” incipient asset bubbles. The notion is that by pursuing a slightly tighter monetary policy, the central bank would take out insurance against the risk that the rise in asset prices is a bubble and that its busting would be disruptive. Although this sounds attractive, it critically depends on how expensive the insurance is relative to the losses that the insurance protects against. It is not clear to me that a modest tightening in monetary policy beyond that needed to achieve full employment and price stability in the absence of a bubble would represent a favorable cost-benefit trade-off. The costs of the deviation from the optimal monetary policy in terms of lost output and employment might be high relative to the benefits of a somewhat smaller bubble. This seems likely to be the case in most instances. Historical experience does not suggest that bubbles are very sensitive to the level of short-term interest rates.\n\nThat said, there is some evidence that a tighter monetary policy will reduce desired leverage in the financial system by flattening the yield curve and reducing the profitability of maturity transformation activities. 12 To the extent this is true, that may imply a somewhat more favorable trade-off in “leaning against” a bubble. More research is needed on this subject. For now at least, monetary policy appears to be inferior to macroprudential tools that seek either to limit the size of prospective bubbles or to strengthen the financial system so that it is more resilient when asset prices fall sharply.\n\nIn conclusion, let me underscore the challenge that central bankers face in combating asset price bubbles. Doing so effectively requires us to be successful in both identifying the incipient bubble and in developing and implementing a response that will limit bubble growth and avert a destructive asset price crash. This is not easy because asset bubbles are hard to recognize in real time and each asset bubble is different. However, these challenges cannot be an excuse for inaction. Recent experience strongly suggests that asset bubbles exist and that their collapse can be very damaging to the financial system and the macroeconomy.\n\nIn my view, a proactive approach is appropriate when three conditions are satisfied: First, circumstances should suggest that there is a meaningful risk of a future asset price crash that could threaten financial stability. Second, we have identified tools that might have a reasonable chance of success in averting such an outcome. Third, we are reasonably confident that the costs of using the tools are likely to be outweighed by the benefits from averting the prospective crash. When these three conditions are satisfied, we should be willing to act.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n__________________________________________ 1 See Vernon L. Smith, Gerry L. Suchanek, and Arlington W. Williams. 1988. “Bubbles, Crashes, and Endogeneous Expectations in Experimental Spot Asset Markets . ” Econometrica 56, no. 5 (September): 1119-51. 2 In a more restrictive experiment in which speculation is not possible, bubbles and crashes still occur. See Vivian Lei, Charles N. Noussair, and Charles R. Plott. 2001. “Nonspeculative Bubbles in Experimental Asset Markets: Lack of Common Knowledge of Rationality vs. Actual Irrationality.” Econometrica 69, no. 4 (July): 831-59. 3 One might argue that an innovation is not a necessary condition for an asset bubble. For example, the run-up of the dollar in the mid-1980s was not associated with any particular innovation. Instead, a sharp shift in fiscal policy led to high real interest rates that stimulated a strong demand for the dollar, which caused the dollar to appreciate sharply. This eventually unwound as the dollar's rise undercut U.S. trade competitiveness. This caused the U.S. economy to slow, interest rates to decline and the dollar to fall. The lack of experience with a floating exchange rate regime undoubtedly played a role here. The world moved to a floating exchange rate system in the early 1970s. There was not much experience with how an expansive fiscal policy would affect exchange rates. This undoubtedly increased uncertainty about the sustainability of the dollar's appreciation. 4 In fact, one book, Dow 36,000, which was published in 1999 shortly before the stock market peaked, argued that “fair value” for the Dow Jones Industrial Average should be 36,000 because the appropriate risk premium for the equity market versus Treasury bonds should be zero. 5 Overconfidence actually applies to a broad range of activities, not just investing. For a more general treatment of this issue of overconfidence and other ways in which economic agents depart from complete rationality, see Richard Thaler. “From Homo Economicus to Homo Sapiens.” 2000. Journal of Economic Perspectives 14, no. 1 (Winter): 133-41. 6 This is not to argue that short positions could not be established at all. Monoline guarantors, AIG Financial Products and some securities dealers were willing to sell protection in the form of credit default swaps on some of these assets. Michael Lewis examines how some investors managed to take positions that benefitted from a collapse of the housing bubble in The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine. 7 See Eli Ofek and Matthew Richards. 2003. “Dotcom Mania: The Rise and Fall of Internet Stock Prices.” Journal of Finance LVIII, no. 3 (June): 1113-37. 8 This argument has been made by many others. See, for example, Frederic Mishkin. How Should We Respond to Asset Bubbles? May 15, 2008. 9 An example of a sustained rise in asset prices that was not a bubble is the bull market in U.S. equities that began in the 1950s. At the start of the sustained rise in equity prices, stock dividend yields exceeded the yields on Treasury bonds and this was perceived as normal, partly reflecting the searing experience of the Great Depression. Instead, corporate earnings rose relatively steadily, supporting dividend growth. This observation led investors to bid up stock prices and push down dividend yields and this proved—more or less—sustainable. Even today, the yield on the S&P 500 index is below the 10-year Treasury note yield. 10 However, in the recent crisis, the different outcomes in the United States and Canada might be instructive. Canada had a tougher regime in terms of mortgage underwriting standards. Also, Canada had imposed an overall leverage limit on its banks, which helped to limit the amount of gearing in the financial system. Both of these differences may help to explain why the Canadian financial system and macroeconomy were less affected by the global financial crisis than the United States. 11 Imposition of tighter rules and regulations may also be politically unpopular. 12 Adrian, Tobias, Arturo Estrella, and Hyun Song Shin. 2010.

Parker Willis was a professor here in  Lexington.  Instead, I’m addressing this  issue because of the ongoing debate about the role of the Federal Reserve and  its structure and governance.  My purpose  is to demystify the nation’s central bank and to respond to some of the  critiques that we continue to face.  I  see this as necessary because there is a risk that the Federal Reserve could be  changed in ways that might impair our ability to achieve our primary objectives—namely,  full employment and price stability.  As  always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily  those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe current debate surrounding  this nation’s central bank is not new, but rather dates back to our nation’s  independence from Great Britain.  The  notion of a central bank in the United States has nearly always been  controversial—in concept, design and practice.   So much so that the charters of the first two U.S. central banks, the  First and Second Banks of the United States, were allowed to lapse.\n\nThe United States, in contrast  to many of our European counterparts, had no central bank from 1836 to  1913.  During this period, the economy  was prone to financial panics.  The rapid  development of the 19th century American economy, including the  westward expansion made possible by railroads, outstripped the ability of the  private banking system to satisfy the nation’s needs for an elastic currency  and a stable supply of credit.  Ultimately,  the Panic of 1907―in which J.P. Morgan, the leading financier of the day,  played an outsized role in responding to the crisis―was the catalyst that  turned the tide back in favor of establishing a central bank.\n\nThe debate preceding the passage  of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 was protracted and intense.  Early drafts of reform proposals were careful  not to even mention a “central bank”—the 75-year-old scars from the Second  Bank’s failed reauthorization battle had still not fully healed.  Although there was a strong recognition that  the country needed a central bank to forestall and mitigate financial panics,  there was considerable disagreement about how it should be structured.  Important considerations included what role  should be played by private bankers versus government officials, how  centralized the new bank should be and the extent of its powers. 2\n\nDuring this period, the U.S.  economy was susceptible to financial panics.   Lacking a central bank, the country had no reliable lender of last  resort that could provide currency and credit on demand against high-quality  assets.  Banks had to self-insure against  bank runs by holding a high fraction of deposits as cash, and by entering into  private liquidity agreements with other banks.  Self-insurance was not only expensive relative  to the cost of a public backstop provided by a central bank, but it was also  limited in its effectiveness.  When the  business cycle turned down and financial stress intensified, bank runs often  ensued as bank customers rushed to convert their deposits into cash.  Without a true lender of last resort, cash  that banks individually and collectively kept in reserve often proved  inadequate to meet demand.  At that  point, a bank under duress had to either close its doors or quickly sell  assets.  Of course, either action worked  to intensify the panic and to increase the stress on the economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve was  established so that there would be a lender of last resort that could lend  against high-quality collateral and provide a reliable and elastic currency. 3 The knowledge that such a lender of last  resort existed reduced considerably the incentives for depositors to race to  their banks to make withdrawals at the first sign of trouble. 4 At that time, the provision of an elastic  currency was especially important because the agricultural sector represented a  significant proportion of the U.S. economy.   As a result, the demand for credit increased significantly each fall  when farmers incurred the costs associated with harvesting their crops.  Prior to the establishment of the Federal  Reserve, accommodating this seasonal demand necessitated a flow of currency and  credit from the major financial markets such as New York and Chicago that put  upward pressure on interest rates.  With  its ability to provide an elastic currency, the Federal Reserve would be able  to dampen such seasonal swings in interest rates.\n\nAt its inception, the Federal  Reserve differed from central banks in Europe in that it was decentralized.  The design reflected long-standing concerns in  our country about the concentration of power in a single authority.  These concerns are reflected in the federated  system established by the Constitution in 1787.  Similarly, the design adopted for the central  bank in 1913 was also federated, with twelve independent Reserve Banks, each  with its own capital and board of directors, overseen by a seven member Federal  Reserve Board in Washington, with the Secretary of the Treasury serving as chair  of the Board.  This decentralized  structure allayed the prevailing fear of concentrating power in either New York  or Washington and, especially within the banking community, of ceding too much  power to the federal government.\n\nPaul Warburg was an American banker who had emigrated to  the United States from Europe.  He was  deeply involved in the debate about the appropriate structure of the central  bank and described the concern as follows:\n\nThe view was generally held that centralization of banking would  inevitably result in one of two alternatives: either complete governmental  control, which meant politics in banking, or control by “Wall Street,” which  meant banking in politics. 5\n\nImportantly, the Federal Reserve  was designed to have budgetary independence from the federal government.  The System funds itself through its business  operations, and not through Congressional appropriations. 6 This formed an important foundation in  ensuring that the conduct of monetary policy would be independent from  political influence.  A wide range of  research has shown that central banks achieve better outcomes with respect to  employment and inflation when they are insulated from short-term political  pressures in their conduct of monetary policy. 7\n\nThe Federal Reserve System was  soon tested, first by the Depression of 1920-21, and then by the Great  Depression.  The searing experience of  the Great Depression, including the 1933 Banking Holiday and thousands of bank  failures, revealed significant shortcomings.   This led to the Banking Act of 1935, which made two important  changes—establishing a federal deposit insurance system and making the Federal  Reserve System more centralized.  The  Great Depression made it clear that having a lender of last resort was not  sufficient for preventing bank runs.  Deposit  insurance, which had been debated but not adopted during the drafting of the  Federal Reserve Act, was instituted with the creation of the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation.\n\nA second lesson was that  monetary policy would be more effective if it were coordinated at the national  level, rather than conducted individually by the Reserve Banks. 8 To accomplish this, the Banking Act  replaced the Federal Reserve Board with the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System, and established the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to  oversee the conduct of monetary policy.   The governors in Washington were made dominant because they were given  the majority of votes on the FOMC. 9 Over time, the role of the executive branch  and the U.S. Treasury was reduced.  Beginning  in 1936, the Secretary of the Treasury no longer served on the FOMC.  The Federal Reserve Board moved to its own  building in 1937, and the Federal Reserve gained independence in the setting of  monetary policy with the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord in 1951.\n\nA century following the Panic of  1907, another financial crisis led to the Great Recession.  As was the case following the Great  Depression, weaknesses exposed by the crisis led to further changes to the  Federal Reserve System.  Some of these  changes were legislated while others were initiated by the Federal Reserve  itself.\n\nBefore discussing the lessons  learned from the financial crisis and the changes that ensued, I think it is  important to recount the Fed’s efforts to support the U.S. economy during this  recent period of severe economic and financial distress.  As you may recall, the Federal Reserve  responded to the financial crisis in two ways.   First, it intervened to prevent the failure of several systemically  important institutions, including firms that it did not supervise―namely Bear  Stearns and AIG. 10 Second, it established a number of special  liquidity facilities to ensure that domestic banks, securities dealers,  commercial paper issuers, money market mutual funds and foreign banks had  sufficient access to dollar liquidity so they could sustain their lending and  investment activities, and thereby continue to supply credit to households and  businesses.\n\nI strongly believe that these  interventions were necessary to prevent a systemic collapse of the global  financial system.  If such a collapse had  occurred, I am convinced that the consequences would have been a global  depression.  If the Federal Reserve  hadn’t done everything in its authority to prevent a collapse, we would have  been derelict in our duty to the country.\n\nLet me be clear: The  interventions by the Federal Reserve during the crisis were designed to  safeguard the economy, for the benefit of all Americans, while protecting the  taxpayer.  I am proud of our record on  both accounts.  In the end, the Federal  Reserve’s extraordinary interventions achieved their intended purposes to  support economic activity and, incidentally, taxpayers were compensated for the  risks undertaken in these interventions.   Total profits from these interventions were more than $30 billion. 11 One important condition for lending in these programs was that the loan needed  to be secured to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve Bank extending the  loan.  Despite the degree of dislocation  in the financial system at the time and the severity of the Great Recession,  there were no losses for any of the Fed’s programs.\n\nAt the same time, I agree with  those critics who argue that there was something fundamentally unfair about the  disparity in treatment between the few large financial institutions that were  saved versus the millions of individuals who lost their homes or their  jobs.  My response is not particularly satisfying.  Recessions inflict considerable pain on  innocent bystanders in the economy.  Depressions  greatly compound this pain.  Given the  Federal Reserve’s role and authority, what we knew at the time and the powers  and tools that were available to us, I think we made good choices.  If the large systemic banking organizations  had failed, the hardships inflicted on households and small business would have  been far worse. 12\n\nFrom my perspective, I believe  that any critique of the Fed or other agencies should be focused more on the  regulatory and supervisory shortcomings—some of which, I admit, were ours—that  created the economic and financial market circumstances in which the Fed’s  extraordinary interventions proved necessary.  This leads me back to some of those lessons  learned and the changes that have resulted.\n\nThe crisis showed that the  regulatory community did not fully grasp the vulnerability of the financial  system.  In particular, critical  financial institutions were not resilient enough to cope with large scale  disruptions without assistance, and problems in one institution quickly spread  to others.  In response, the Federal  Reserve has made significant changes in how we regulate and supervise financial  institutions.  We have raised capital and  liquidity requirements, put banks through annual stress tests, established the  Large Institution Supervision Coordination Committee (LISCC) to enable us to  evaluate the largest firms collectively and relative to one another, and set up  the Office of Financial Stability to enable us to look at the financial system  more holistically.  Financial stability  now receives the attention it deserves.   For example, there are now regular briefings and discussions on  financial stability at FOMC meetings.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the Federal  Reserve has the responsibility to be the lender of last resort.  In normal times, this occurs through discount  window lending to depository institutions.   During the financial crisis, Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act  enabled extensions of credit in “unusual and exigent” circumstances to  individuals, partnerships and corporations. 13 The extraordinary interventions that were  undertaken using our emergency powers under Section 13(3) of the Federal  Reserve Act were warranted and within our authority.  However, I suspect that the scale and scope  of these interventions went considerably further than envisioned by the public  and Congress prior to the crisis.\n\nIn response, Congress narrowed  the scope of Section 13(3) with the Dodd-Frank Act.  In particular, Dodd-Frank limits the Federal  Reserve’s authority to extend credit through facilities with broad-based  eligibility, and constrains the Federal Reserve’s authority to extend credit to  a single company.  The Dodd-Frank Act  also modified the governance that would apply to any future intervention in an  effort to increase public accountability.\n\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act  addressed the broader issue exposed by the crisis―that some large financial  institutions had become “too-big-to-fail” (TBTF).  To end TBTF, Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act  established a process to ensure that any financial firm could be resolved  without threatening the viability of the financial system and without putting  taxpayer funds at risk. 14 In addition, financial intermediaries  designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight  Council are subject to tougher prudential standards and enhanced supervision by  the Federal Reserve.  The intent behind  these measures is to reduce the likelihood of a failure of a large financial  firm, and the consequence of such a failure for the financial system, should  one occur.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act left intact  the decentralized structure of the original federated Federal Reserve  System—the twelve Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors in Washington.  Each Reserve Bank continues to operate as a  separately capitalized corporation with its own Board of Directors. 15 But, to limit the role of bankers on the  Federal Reserve Bank boards, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibited the bankers on each  board from participating in the selection of its Reserve Bank president. 16\n\nEven prior to the Dodd-Frank  Act, it is important to emphasize that the directors played no significant role  in setting policy. 17 Instead, their role has been to advise the  Reserve Bank president about economic, community and business developments in  the District, and to ensure that the Bank is a well-governed and well-managed  institution. 18 And, although member banks hold capital in  the Federal Reserve and receive a dividend set by law against this capital,  member banks do not influence the Fed’s monetary and regulatory policy  decisions, how policy is implemented or the supervisory oversight of  banks.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also  addressed the need for enhanced transparency by establishing disclosure  requirements for participation in Federal Reserve facilities.  In terms of transparency, I do think it is a  fair critique that, in the past, the Federal Reserve has not always been  sufficiently transparent.  For example,  prior to 1994, we typically didn’t even announce changes that were being  implemented in monetary policy.  Market  participants had to infer what we were doing from our daily open market  operations and where the federal funds rate was trading.  During the crisis, I also believe we could  have done more to explain the motivations for our extraordinary  interventions.  At times, while the  motivations and objectives might have been obvious to us, they weren’t always  as readily apparent to Congress or to the public.  I think this created uncertainty about what  we were trying to accomplish, and made it more difficult for outside observers  to assess the appropriateness of our actions and our motives.\n\nToday the situation is quite  different.  We have made significant  enhancements with respect to transparency.   After each meeting, the FOMC issues a statement that sets the current  target range for the federal funds rate and explains its monetary policy  decision.  Four times a year, the chair  holds a press conference explaining the decision and the FOMC releases its  Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).   The SEP provides the FOMC participants’ forecasts for key economic  variables and the federal funds rate over the next few years.  In addition, the FOMC participants give  numerous speeches explaining their views on monetary policy and other issues,  and the chair regularly testifies about monetary policy and the Federal  Reserve’s other activities before Congress.   Overall, I have found that this move towards greater transparency has  held us in good stead. Nearly six years since the  enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, there still remains considerable debate about  whether further changes to the role and structure of the Federal Reserve System  are warranted.  Some of the issues being  debated include how much discretion the Federal Reserve should have in the  conduct of monetary policy, whether the Federal Reserve is sufficiently  transparent in how it operates, and the role of the New York Fed.  I would caution that any further changes to  the Federal Reserve System should be grounded on what we learned from the  crisis and based on the needs of our evolving economy.  Changes should be undertaken if they would  make the Federal Reserve more effective in its mission.  In contrast, changes based on an emotional,  unreasoned response in reaction to the pain associated with the financial  crisis and the Great Recession would likely be counter-productive.\n\nSome argue that the Federal  Reserve has too much discretion in its implementation of monetary policy and,  consequently, would have the Fed stick to a formal rule in its conduct of  monetary policy.  This is a poor idea  because adherence to a simple rule would undoubtedly lead to significant policy  errors.  The world is simply too complex  to put monetary policy on autopilot. 19\n\nConcerns over the FOMC’s degree  of discretion in monetary policy likely reflect, in part, innovations in  monetary policy enacted in recent years that added accommodation at a time when  short-term interest rates were stuck very close to the zero lower bound.  In particular, the Federal Reserve’s balance  sheet grew substantially as the Federal Reserve enacted a series of large-scale  asset purchase programs designed to support economic activity.  With respect to the argument that these programs  have distorted financial markets, I would simply respond that monetary policy  always affects financial markets and financial asset valuations.   The expected path of the federal funds rate  is an important factor influencing the level of bond yields, and the level of  bond yields and bond term premia have implications for the valuations of other  financial assets, such as equities, and influence the foreign exchange value of  the dollar.\n\nOf course, the impact of  monetary policy may have been greater this time.  But this is mainly because more monetary  policy stimulus has been required during the current economic cycle in order to  push the U.S. economy towards the Fed’s dual mandate objectives.  I believe that if we had not responded as  forcefully, the recovery would have been slower, the unemployment rate would  have been higher and there would have been a greater risk of deflation.\n\nWhile it is much too soon to  claim success, the U.S. economy today is in a relatively good place compared to  most other countries.  The economic  expansion is in its seventh year and we have made considerable progress  relative to our employment and inflation objectives.  Also, the tools that we designed to control  monetary policy even with a very large balance sheet have been shown to be  effective.  In December, when we raised  our target range for the federal funds rate to 25 to 50 basis points, we also  raised the interest rate we pay on bank reserves to 50 basis points and the  rate we pay on our overnight reverse repo facility to 25 basis points.  Not only have these new tools been effective  in moving the federal funds rate up into the middle of its new target range,  but the entire complex of money market rates has moved up as well.\n\nAlso, the fears expressed by  some that the Federal Reserve’s very large balance sheet would lead to runaway  inflation have proven to be unwarranted.   Now that we have demonstrated that we have monetary control even with a  very large balance sheet, I would hope that this issue has been put to rest.\n\nAs I noted earlier, I am a  committed advocate for enhanced transparency and we are always looking for ways  to improve.  But, of course, there are  limits.  One could argue, for example,  that a live broadcast of a Federal Open Market Committee meeting would be more  transparent.  But, such a broadcast would  do considerable harm by constraining candor and debate over the appropriate  monetary policy decision.  I believe it  would likely lead to less informed decisions and, consequently, poorer  execution of our monetary policy responsibilities.  Similarly, disclosing in real time who was  borrowing from the Federal Reserve’s Discount Window would likely undercut the  efficacy of the window.  Banks might be  reluctant to borrow if it were immediately made public because such borrowing  might be construed in the market as a sign of weakness. 20 Stigmatizing Discount Window use by banks  would make this tool less effective as a lender of last resort backstop for  bank liquidity needs.  While there  obviously is a point of diminishing returns in terms of increased transparency,  I think it’s reasonable to evaluate what further steps the Federal Reserve  could make in this direction, judging whether additional steps would enhance  versus diminish the effectiveness of our tools and policies, and our ability to  achieve our objectives.\n\nWith regard to the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York, which I have the responsibility of leading, I’d  observe that the New York Fed, like the other eleven reserve banks, serves to  support the overall mission of the Federal Reserve System.  But, by virtue of its location, the New York  Fed has a unique responsibility on behalf of the System—namely to serve as the  operational arm of the Federal Open Market Committee with respect to the  implementation of monetary policy.  This  separation of the policy arm and the operational arm of monetary policy in two  distinct institutions is a very unusual setup among central banks. 21\n\nThere are good reasons why these  important functions are assigned to the New York Fed.  Monetary policy works by affecting financial  market conditions in order to promote the economic outcomes consistent with the  Fed’s dual mandate.  As such, effective  and efficient monetary policy execution requires a practical and thorough  understanding of the broad range of the financial markets through which  monetary policy operates.\n\nNew York City is the nation’s  principal financial center.  By locating  the duties related to the execution of monetary policy at the New York Fed, the  System gains a number of benefits. These include the New York Fed’s ability to  develop expertise in and understanding of the broad spectrum of financial  markets and institutions, and its access to a deep pool of specialized  financial talent in the place where it is most concentrated.\n\nThe New York Fed’s institutional  knowledge and experience in financial markets and its related disciplines are a  critical input at all times, but never more so than during periods of duress.  This was evidenced during the financial  crisis, when the New York Fed’s unique insights and expertise helped the  Federal Reserve respond quickly and effectively to unfolding events.\n\nThe authors who crafted the  Federal Reserve Act such as Carter Glass—assisted by H. Parker  Willis—deliberately created a central bank structure that fits the U.S. political  system, with a series of important checks and balances—between Washington and  the rest of the country, between Washington and New York, and with respect to  the role of the federal government versus the private sector.  These checks and balances exist to ensure  that the central bank acts in the broadest interests of the nation, and is  appropriately insulated from short-term political pressures and  considerations.  In this construction,  New York does have a special role, but one that stems from where it sits, in  New York City, the nation’s most important financial center. The Federal Reserve exists to  serve Main Street, not Wall Street.  The  dual mandate objectives established by Congress—full employment and price  stability—are clear on this point.  There  is no mention of Wall Street.  At the  same time, it is broadly recognized that without a well-functioning financial  system it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Federal Reserve to  achieve those objectives.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has evolved  considerably since its inception in 1913.  This evolution has been informed by lessons  from past financial crises.  The goal has  been to make the Federal Reserve even more effective in carrying out its  mission.  This process of learning from  experience is as critical for institutions as it as individuals.  To paraphrase Winston Churchill: People always  make mistakes, but only wise ones learn from their mistakes.\n\nThank you for your kind  attention.  I would be happy to take a  few questions.\n\n1 Kenneth Garbade, Jack Gutt, Joyce Hansen, Michael Held and Joseph Tracy assisted  in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 See America’s Bank: The Epic Struggle to  Create the Federal Reserve , Roger Lowenstein, 2015.\n\n3 President Wilson, who signed the Federal Reserve Act, described this new  feature for the currency. “Suffice it here to say that it provides a currency  which expands as it is needed and contracts when it is not needed: a currency  which comes into existence in response to the call of every man who can show a  going business and a concrete basis for extending credit to him, however  obscure or prominent he may be, however big or little his business  transactions.” Letter to Congressman Oscar Underwood, October 17, 1914, Wilson Papers , vol. 31.\n\n4 In addition, the Federal Reserve was given the  authority to clear checks on a nationwide basis.  This helped knit the country’s commerce  together better and ensured that checks would be payable at par rather than  discounted by differing amounts depending on how far one was from the bank of  issue and how little one knew about a particular bank’s financial condition and  viability.\n\n5 Paul Warburg, The Federal Reserve System:  Its Origins and Growth , vol. 1, 1930.\n\n6 The Federal Reserve Banks are funded through their respective operations. The  Federal Reserve Board―and later, the Board of Governors―is funded through semiannual  assessments on the Banks [Section 10(3) of the Federal Reserve Act]. The  Board’s financial independence was strengthened in the 1933 Banking Act  [Section 6(b)] which stipulated that these semiannual assessments “[…] shall not  be construed to be Government funds or appropriated moneys.”\n\n7 For  example, see Alesina and Summers, “Central Bank Independence and Macroeconomic  Performance.” Journal of Money, Credit  and Banking , vol. 25, no. 2 pg. 157-62, 1993.\n\n8 H.  Parker Willis described this independence given to the Reserve Banks in the  conduct of policy. “There is nothing, either in the Federal Reserve Act or in  the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, to indicate that the reserve  banks are to be operated in groups or through communications with one another,  resulting in the establishment of a single policy as to detail.” H. Parker  Willis, The Federal Reserve , pg. 128,  1915.\n\n9 This assumes no vacancies on the seven-member Board of Governors.  Currently, with five members of the Board of  Governors and five votes among the Reserve Banks, the balance is split  equally.\n\n10 The Federal Reserve was unable to prevent the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.\n\n11 For example, see “Federal Reserve: Emergency  Lending,” Marc Labonte, Congressional Research Service, January 6, 2016.\n\n12 In retrospect, I believe more government support could have been provided to  homeowners.  Although the Federal Reserve  did not have the authority to implement a mortgage modification loan program,  we did implement a mortgage-backed securities purchase program to lower  mortgage interest rates.\n\n13 Several other conditions had to be satisfied as well.\n\n14 Although considerable progress has been made in ending TBTF, I think it is  premature to declare victory.  Some banks  still have work to do to make their resolution plans credible, and there needs  to be more work on cross-border issues to ensure that such a resolution would  proceed smoothly.\n\n15 Each Board is made up of nine members divided evenly into Class A, B, and C  directors.  The Class A directors  represent the banks of the District that are Federal Reserve member banks, the  Class B and C directors represent the broader public interest.  Only eligible Class B and Class C directors can participate  in the process for selecting Reserve Bank presidents.\n\n16 The selection of the President consists of two steps: Appointment of the  Reserve Bank president by the Board of Directors, and approval of the  appointment by the Board of Governors. For details see: http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/how-is-a-federal-reserve-bank-president-selected.htm\n\n17 There is one exception, but it has little actual significance.  Boards of Directors do make recommendations  concerning changes in the primary credit (discount) rate.  However, these recommendations only go into  effect by an affirmative vote by the Board of Governors.  Also, if the Board of Governors wanted to  change the primary credit rate and no recommendations were available to act  upon, the Board legally could move unilaterally.  In fact, what would likely happen in this  unlikely circumstance would be a phone call to one or more Reserve Banks to ask  for the desired recommendation and rapid compliance with the Board of Governors’  request.\n\n18 The Board of Governors plays an important role in the oversight of the Reserve  Banks.  The Board of Governors regularly  evaluates Reserve Bank operations and each Bank’s budget The Reserve Banks  conduct supervision under delegated authority from the Board of Governors.  Reserve Bank directors continue to have no  role in bank supervision.\n\n19 See The Fed at a crossroads, Where to go  next? Brookings Institution panel remarks, October 15, 2015.\n\n20 A  historical example was the disclosure of Reconstruction Finance Corporation  loans to banks in the Great Depression. This disclosure often created runs at  the respective banks. See James Butkiewicz, “The Reconstruction Finance  Corporation, the Gold Standard, and the Banking Panic of 1933,” Southern Economic Journal , vol. 66, no.  2, October 1999, pg. 271.\n\n21 In the case of the European Central Bank, the member national central banks are  involved in policy implementation.",

    "text": "James Rosener:\n\nDistinguished  guests, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen: good morning. My name is James  Rosener. I'm President of the European American Chamber of Commerce, and  managing partner of the New York Office of Pepper Hamilton. First, let me thank  Thomson Reuters for hosting this event and our own partnership with them  together.\n\nOn behalf  of the European American Chamber of Commerce, it's a great pleasure to welcome  you today to a program on \"Banking Culture: Room for Improvement?\", which  brings together three of the foremost thinkers on the subject. Here with us  today are William Dudley, President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank;  William Rhodes, President and CEO of WR Rhodes Global Advisors, and author of Banker to the World ; and Ellen Alemany,  Chairwoman and CEO of CIT Group, who also brings us a European perspective from  her tenure in London.\n\nAmong our  esteemed guests, we also have Stuart Mackintosh, Executive Director of the  Group of Thirty. And moderating today's panel is Rob Cox, editor of  Breakingiews, of Reuters News.\n\nThis  panel discussion is particularly important as many consumers are still with the  process of rebuilding wealth and financial services firms continue to struggle  with consumer mistrust as well as regulatory compliance issues.\n\nWe all  remember the crisis of 2007 and 2008, and how it shook the foundations of the  exciting economic system. People all over the world became increasingly angry,  cynical, and distrustful. Stock markets plummeted, companies collapsed,  individuals watched their savings evaporate, and unemployment rose to levels  unseen in decades.\n\nIn the  aftermath of the global crisis, regulators introduced a wide range of measures  and began implementing stricter micro- and macroprudential policies intending  to strengthen the resilience and stability of the economic system.\n\nAlthough in  the years since the financial crisis, authorities have increased investigative  and enforcement capabilities, punished business for misconduct, and addressed  violations, we've learned from a number of scandals and corporate abuses  regularly making the headlines that malfeasance, reckless business practices  and behavior are a common and widespread phenomenon across business sectors  worldwide.\n\nAlmost  every active observer acknowledges that the state of affairs represents a  bigger problem and calls for drastic change in culture—how employees and  management interact and handle business affairs.\n\nJust last  Friday, the Fed made it clear to the entire banking system that it will hold  boards of directors responsible for conduct and impose limitations on growth  where financial institutions have not shown sufficient progress in implementing  the kind of risk management that is expected.\n\nAt the  same time, we're hearing from the administration about increased deregulation. Thankfully,  there's growing and spirited debate on culture and conduct. A majority of banks  and institutions are active participants in the debate. They employ  consultants, host workshops and conferences, and adopt culture-oriented mission  statements. Everyone agrees there's plenty of room for improvement. Creating a  virtuous business culture is not an easy task and presents some serious  challenges.\n\nWe hope  this discussion will shed some light on how banks and financial institutions  can benefit from corporate governance best practices—specifically culture  change—and overcome the widespread negative perceptions that continue to rattle  the sector.\n\nI  encourage all participants to engage in the discussions. Do not hesitate to ask  questions, not only of our panelists but to one another, and make this a truly  interactive event. Thank you for your attention, and I hope you enjoy this  important discussion.\n\nWith  that, I'll handle it over to Rob Cox.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nThanks  Jim. Good morning everybody. Thank you for braving the incipient snow and  getting yourselves away from your screens, showing us reds and greens in the  stock market. It's hard to believe it's only Wednesday. But I can only surmise  from your participation here that you also see a link between culture, banking  culture, and the global economy, as I think these panelists that we have up  here do, and have done quite a bit to champion our thinking in that regard.\n\nThey  don't need any introduction. You've got their bios. Their reputations precede  them. I thought I'd just start with you, Bill D. I'm going to go with Bill D,  it could be your hip-hop name when you retire next year. But we have two Bills  here.\n\nSo, four  years ago, you kicked off this conversation with a conference on banking  culture, and forming banking culture. It's gone global. Are you happy with the  progress that's been made up to now? What's the state of affairs in our  understanding of good bank culture?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I  guess I would say I'm pleased that there's been substantial progress, but I'm  not satisfied with the progress. In other words, there could be even more  progress. I think in the United States, for example, we could do more in terms  of having an industry-wide survey that actually allows firms to benchmark their  results versus one another—we have that in the U.K.\n\nWe could  probably do more to address the so-called \"rolling bad apple  problem.\" This is where someone leaves a firm after bad behavior, and then  gets hired by another firm that's completely unaware of why that person was let  go.\n\nSo we  proposed—the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has proposed a banking registry,  where you could actually keep track of why people actually were dismissed.\n\nThere is  something similar to that in the U.K., so I think they've actually made a bit  more progress than we have. The good news, though, is I think bankers are  taking this a lot more seriously. A number of bank leaders have endorsed  working on culture. A number of boards of directors have set up committees on  culture. So, I think—have we gotten as far as we need to go? No. Have we made a  lot of progress? Yes.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYou're  speaking as the New York Fed President, but what is your sense of other folks  around the world, whether it's the Bank of England who are starting the Financial  Conduct Authority, or whoever it might be in the U.K. and Europe.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think  there's a pretty broad acceptance of the notion that regulation and compliance  only takes you so far, and that bad conduct really does undermine the  effectiveness of the financial system, because it basically reduces trust.\n\nWe saw in  the middle of the financial crisis that it was the breakdown of confidence in  the system that really led to the severity of the Great Recession. And I'm not  sure how much conduct played into that, but I think it probably played a role.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nBill R, a  question for you. Maybe stepping back, what are we talking about when we talk  about culture? It's not yogurt, right? As someone who has been a banker for  many years, and now has spent a lot of time looking at this issue from the vantage  point of the G30, how do you characterize culture?\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nI think  culture is really made up of the history, tradition, and values of a given  institution. Each institution is different, and it must look to those three  elements, and it can't be imposed by the supervisors and regulators, which they  understand. I mean, this isn't something like capital, where you can say—or liquidity—\n\nRob Cox:\n\nWhich is  a number?\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nExactly. At  the end of the day, though, it's the most important element of all, because if  you don't have a good culture and you don't enact it in the sense of conduct,  you're going to ruin your reputation. And once an institution, particularly a  financial institution, loses its reputation, then it is a very, very difficult  road to slog back.\n\nAnd this  is why the Group of Thirty decided to get into this area in the first place. We've  been working on it for five years. We are now finalizing with our third report,  and as we go around the world in all areas of the world, we are finding that  financial institutions, mainly banks, understand the importance of this thing.  And if we needed to have a reminder, it was the Great Recession, and what  occurred there.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nOne of  the things that's come out of this discussion, I think it was Baroness O'Neill in  the U.K., her argument was that you have to ask yourself as an institution,  what are you for?\n\nAnd I  think that's a pretty interesting—I think any company, it doesn't have to be a  bank, but certainly a bank—there are certain other social imperatives to make  sure that you know what you are for. How would you, Ellen, describe what CIT is for?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nSure,  actually CIT has a very long  history, but it's a 110-year-old company that started out as a commercial  finance company in St. Louis, as Commercial Credit and Investment Trust, which  then became Commercial and Investment Trust, CIT.\n\nIt had a  lot of different owners. It was unregulated, and what happened was it took TARP  money during the crisis, filed bankruptcy, and then reemerged, and then  acquired OneWest Bank.\n\nSo when I  took over the company, it definitely had \"who are we?\" And I think  one of the first things we had to do with employees was really come up with a  specific \"this is our strategy,\" which is to give loans and leasing  to small and middle-market companies on a national basis, funded by deposits. And  a very clear statement.\n\nWe also—because  of all the different ownerships, and unregulated/regulated et cetera—really  didn't have a value set at the company. And so another exercise I did with the  team was we did a cultural survey, and it was really telling what came out of  the cultural survey, but as a result of that, we said \"what are the top  behaviors that we want for the company going forward?\"\n\nAnd we  came up with six behaviors. The first was straight talk. In the institution, we  found that people were just really afraid to be open and to talk about bad  news. And so straight talk was the first.\n\nThe  second was collaboration. Everybody just wanted to be left alone. That was one  thing that came out loud and clear in the survey, it was just \"leave me  alone.\" They felt if they were doing their piece of the project, that was  enough. No one was looking at the enterprise-wide or the full picture.\n\nAccountability  was another one. When 15 people sign a credit memo, who's really accountable?\n\nAnd then  we also came up with customer-focused, risk-disciplined, and high-performing. And  so these are our six values. And we have to constantly reinforce these values  in the company.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYou had  to do a fair amount of pruning and pairing back of some of the businesses. You  had an international business, aircraft leasing. Does that tell us anything  about the difficulty of actually imparting culture across borders, or was it just  too difficult to pull all those things together?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nNo, I  mean we put a strategy in place that we wanted to be a leading small and middle-market  domestic lender, and we did a strategic review of the company, and we saw that  we were in many countries. These businesses were underperforming. There was no  connectivity with any of the other businesses.\n\nWe also  felt that an aircraft leasing company shouldn't be in a bank because of the  capital requirements on the forward order book. So, this was all part of a  clear, crisp strategy for the employees, for our shareholders, and then  executing against it.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nBill  Rhodes, you were at Citigroup for many, many years. It in many ways it defines  sort of the international banking culture. Just thinking about that culture—not  necessarily Citigroup—but when do you think it lost its way a bit? That  American banking culture, the global culture of banking?\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nWell,  when I started out in banking, which was obviously a long time ago, we had  embedded in us three things. First of all, the reputation of the bank. That was  number one. But also along with that was the need to look after your customer,  and also work with the community.\n\nThese  were the three basic values that were embedded in us. Along the way,  unfortunately, I think it shifted to short-term profitability, and those early,  let's say \"commandments\" tended to be forgotten. And what was the result of  this? The financial institutions—again, we're talking banks here—lost the trust  of the public, the shareholders, and even of their own staff. And we can see  this in some of the more recent cases like Wells Fargo. All three of them are  there.\n\nThe other  point which people tend to forget, and this is just basic business logic for  success, is that if you have a good culture and you act in the proper way,  conduct-wise, you are going to do better in your business. It's something that  Mario Draghi always says, and he's correct. It's that good business practices,  in the sense of culture and conduct, makes your customer feel better, loyal,  and people want to bank with an institution that has that.\n\nSo at the  end of the day, this is something that pays off to the so-called bottom line. The  whole idea of having a proper culture and conduct, embedding it, monitoring it,  and very, very importantly, what do you do if someone crosses the line?\n\nI think  first of all, you have to look at compensation for the individual. Take a hit  compensation-wise, and if that doesn't do it, then you look at termination. I  think these are all basic points that we've seen, and pretty much agreed to in  our surveys of the Group of Thirty.\n\nAs I  said, we are finalizing that now. There are a lot of other things we came forth  with. But this is basically what I think happened along the way. And if  institutions, banks are smart, they will never allow themselves to go back to  that.\n\nForget  about what the regulators and supervisors say. The institution itself is the  first line of defense. And it's always easy when the problems come up, to say,  well, the rating agencies gave us triple-A on this particular instrument, and  the supervisors, regulators didn't pick it up. And oh, by the way, the  politicians were pushing us to make those mortgage loans. No matter what it  took.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nWhen I  think about what you just said, it sounds to me like the cult of shareholder  value may have been more influential in forcing companies to think, or banks—companies  generally, but let's keep it to banks—in thinking about short-term reward, or  short-term incentives.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nWell,  that was all part of the short-term profitability. And that was, as you know,  for a period of time the most important metric, and the press built it up. You  know, what's the shareholder value and—\n\nRob Cox:\n\nBut I'm  wondering how do you balance this need to serve shareholders who can turf out a  CEO or the boards of directors? At any time, you always have that barometer of  the stock price. Bill, you want to answer this? I also want to ask Ellen: how  do you manage this? You've got on the one hand your investors, and on the  other, you've got this need to build a long-term, stable, culturally good  institution.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nYes, but  if your customer does not trust you and the public does not trust you, it's  going to fall to the bottom line. So, good business practices like the ones  I've mentioned actually help the bottom line. And when you don't have that, you  can see the consequences.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYes, yes.  Bill Dudley?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYou asked  the question, why does this happen? I think there are a lot of reasons, but  there are two things that I guess I would talk about. Number one is business  became more transactional rather than client-focused, and that's partly the  growth of the capital markets.\n\nThe  second thing is scale. The scale of the institutions got a lot larger. And so I  think it became much harder for people at the top to actually—for their views  to penetrate deep into the organization.\n\nI really  do have a question about whether it's actually possible to manage organizations  of several hundred thousand people effectively. Time will tell. One reason to  work on culture, though, is to actually get the views of the CEO, and the  executive suite, to penetrate down into the organization. It's really difficult  the bigger you get and the more complex you get.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nSo how do  you manage this balance? Milton Friedman on the one hand and Bill Rhodes on the  other, in making sure you're delivering for shareholders but at the same time  delivering for the long term and not creating problems down the road?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nSure,  before I answer that question, though, I think if there's any one takeaway from  today, it is the point that Bill made, is that having a good culture is good  business. And it's the tone from the top and believing that if your colleagues  are engaged, if your customers are satisfied, if the communities you do  business with prosper, then business is going to prosper, which in turn turns  into shareholder value.\n\nAnd it's  always that balance between the short and the long term. And we manage that  through lots of different ways. Compensation is only one piece. But in  compensation we make sure that we have a balanced business scorecard for the  senior managers.\n\nSo, a  percentage is based on the financial results, and it's not just one financial  measure, it's several financial measures. And then the other piece is  qualitative. We break it up into three buckets—strategic/operational, risk, and  then people/culture. Does this employee demonstrate the CIT  values?\n\nWe also  have clawback, and by having this qualitative, too, if something does go bad or  someone doesn't do something that we think is appropriate, you have enough  flexibility there to manage the compensation.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nI want to  delve further into incentives because I think it's really critical to this  conversation. But just sort of stepping back a little bit to my first question  to you, Bill Dudley, which was about the progress we've made. A corollary to  that is the President has talked quite a bit about his deregulatory efforts. We've  certainly seen some measures from the House Financial Services Committee that  probably will never see the light of day in the Senate. But we also have seen  the Senate with its bill to soften, shall we say, parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Is  there a danger that this whole cultural discussion gets thrown out with this  deregulatory swing back of the pendulum?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell,  first of all, I guess I don't think that the deregulatory swing is going to be  that great, thankfully. I've been talking about this for many months about how  it's really important, while we can make regulations simpler and more  efficient, that makes a lot of sense, we don't want to go back to where we were  in 2007, 2008. So higher capital requirements, higher liquidity requirements,  better resolution regime, the ability to centrally clear over-the-counter  derivatives, regulate the entities that we clear these through, all of those  things need to be kept. Orderly liquidation authority. And so far I'm actually  pretty optimistic that the regulatory reforms are going to be around the edges  as opposed to wholesale.\n\nThe  second thing I would just say, though, is that regulation and culture—these are  complements, not substitutes. If you think that regulation can somehow  substitute for culture, I think you're really mistaken. In fact, in some ways,  the more intense the regulatory regime, it can actually undermine culture,  because people can actually say, well, the regulators are saying what I can and  cannot do, and so as long as I stick within the confines of those regulations,  it's all fine.\n\nBut  that's actually not true. Just because a regulation sets this frame or field of  scope, there may be things within that that you actually don't want to do. There  are number of examples, as we saw, during the financial crisis. One of the most  famous ones was Repo 105, which Lehman Brothers did to dress up their balance  sheet to misrepresent their balance sheet to the public. That was legal under  the accounting rules, but very deceptive. So that was an example where if you  just go by what's regulatory-appropriate, you can actually have very bad  outcomes.\n\nSo I  think that it's not one or the other. You need a good regulatory regime  supplemented by various good conduct and culture in the organizations.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nBut I was  recently in London speaking to the CEO of a big U.K. bank, and he was saying, \"I'm  really worried that they're going to relax the Volcker Rule,\" for instance, and  \"If those guys are trading using their balance sheet, how are we going to  compete?\" And so there's definitely a fear about this.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nOh,  you're right, there's always a little bit of pressure that regulation gets  rolled back in one regime and everyone says, oh, now these people are more  competitive than our people. And so the \"race to the bottom\" problem  is obviously all something we have to be aware of.\n\nThat's  one reason why I think that the U.S. involvement in Basel with the Bank for  International Settlements is important because that helps establish minimum  standards that are implemented across the world, to essentially lean against that  pressure to race to the bottom in terms of regulation.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nBut some  things—for instance, relaxing the threshold at which you're a G-SIFI, things  like that—that would help CIT, I  would imagine. In other words, you can hold less capital as a result of some of  these rule changes.\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nWe're in  an interesting situation because we're actually the first bank in the U.S. that  actually raised our hand and said we want to become SIFI. And then we decided  to sell the aircraft—we would have been about $80 billion in assets, and we  decided to sell our aircraft leasing business, and now we are right at the  cusp. We're around $50 billion in assets.\n\nAnd I had  gotten so many questions from investors, our board, et cetera. \"Do you  de-SIFI?\" \"Will you save a lot of money if you de-SIFI because you don't  have to spend money doing these things?\"\n\nAnd we  sat there as a management team and we said, you know what? We needed to improve  our capital planning process at the company, and that a lot of what is required  for a SIFI bank, and if we want to build a strong foundation to grow the  company going forward, we needed to invest in.\n\nSo, if  the threshold changes, it's really not going to impact what we do day-to-day,  because the Federal Reserve Bank still requires us to have a capital planning  process that meets the new standards. The standards have been raised for the  industry. And we want to build a strong foundation for the company.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nSo, does  that mean if you don't have to, even if you don't have to hold an extra one basis  point of capital, you would?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nNo, it's  more of—the whole capital plan—what's involved with the capital planning  process. And we also want to maintain capital that's appropriate for the risk  profile of the company. And just because the regulators demand a certain level,  it's our assessment of what capital is appropriate for the risks that we're  taking as a company. It's a guideline.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nWhat is  your sense of the regulatory environment? How has it changed with the examiners  or whoever it is that are sort of crawling around the bank? Are they now  smiling, offering lollipops? [CROSSTALK] Pretend Bill is not here. Is there a  mood music change of some sort?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nI think  that the tone at the top is different in terms of what people are saying—how it  actually flows down and impacts us on a day-to-day basis. It really hasn't  changed yet in the regulations. For us, there's been more of a tone change at  the OCC rather than the Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nPeople  act like this is sort of this big giant fight between firms and the supervisors.  In a lot of ways, the interests are actually very well aligned. We want to have  good risk management. We want to have good governance. We want to have adequate  capital, adequate liquidity. The firms presumably want all of the same things. So  this idea that we're all going head-to-head, I just don't think that is really  actually how good supervision and good private sector engagement with that  supervision actually works.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nSo you  don't have grumpy examiners on your staff?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI'm sure  we have some grumpy examiners on our staff.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nI mean  this actually goes back to the question—you mentioned it before, Ellen—which is  good culture being good business. Bill, you wrote a column for us over the  summer in which you pointed out that misdeeds and bad behavior and settlements  have cost the industry something like $330 billion since the crisis. I mean,  that's coming right out of shareholder value.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nNow it's  somewhere north of, I think, $350 billion. Those are Boston Consulting figures.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYes, but  of course, you know, everything is doing well, everybody is making tons of  money now. Is there a risk that these settlements and fines that we've seen  meted out are basically just seen by bankers as a cost of doing business over  the cycle?\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nI  certainly don't think so, because in addition to what fines you're paying,  you're getting very bad publicity. And it doesn't make the shareholders, your  staff, or your customers very happy when they see something like this. Forget  about the impact on the bottom line.\n\nAnd I  think Ellen commented on the tone at the top, which is key. But it must go  right down to middle management, or right down to the teller level. Everyone  has to be a believer in this, and they have to practice it. It has to be  embedded and monitored throughout.\n\nAnd as I  said, and then when you have bad players—bad apples, as Bill said—compensation  is a first hit. But eventually you're going to have to go to termination. And I  think this has to be understood all the way from the top down to the bottom.\n\nThe other  point is that if, in fact, we see let's say less regulation and supervision  across the system, that gives even more importance to the culture and conduct  area. Because the last thing an institution wants to do is to repeat some of  the failures that we've seen over the last decade or more.\n\nAnd I  think these things built up over the last 20 years or so—it didn't happen  overnight. And the price to pay, with loss of trust—forget about the financial  settlements—I think has been significant. Because what do you find today? The  area of trust has still not I think fully been given by any of the constituents,  as I mentioned, to the institutions. Plus the politicians around the world—particularly  in the United States, Canada, Western Europe—are still very I'd say antsy about  the banking system, as you can see. So I think we still have a lot of work to  go in this area. We've made progress but it's like a stop on a train. You've  got more distance to go.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nHow do  you feel?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nTwo  things that I think are important. Number one, the fines have gotten a lot  bigger. At times there's been actually a risk to firms that's existential. The  risk of actually losing your charter. So, I think that's causing the senior  management to take this a lot more seriously. So I think that's an important  change from what we had before.\n\nI think  the second thing is the industry is held in not such high regard now. And that  has actually consequences for their ability to attract talent. So we've been  having a number of business school deans come in and talk to us at New York Fed  over the last few years, and what they say is that there are people who will  actually not go into the financial services industry because of this bad  conduct. That's not a good cycle. If the most ethical people coming out of the  business schools decide that they are not going to go into this industry, that  means there's quite a bit more work to do.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nThey're  all going into journalism.\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nBill D. actually  makes a really good point. By the year 2020, 50% of our workforce is going to  be millennials, and the millennials prioritize different things than we did  coming up in our careers. They want corporate social responsibility. They want  culture, they want values. And so if you have a good culture, it's really a  competitive advantage in terms of attracting the millennials to your workforce.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nSo, Bill,  you said in one of your speeches on this topic that incentives shape behavior,  and behavior drives culture. If you want a culture that will support your  long-term business strategy, you need to align incentives with the behaviors  that will sustain your business over the long haul.\n\nThis is  for all of you, but I'll start with you, Bill D. What specifically has been  done around the issue of compensation? What are you seeing when you look at  comp plans, and not just for the CEOs and CFOs, but throughout the  organizations?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nThe  reason why I stress that, because people always say, culture is sort of a soft  subject, so what can we actually do about it as leaders in banking  organizations. Well, you can look at how you compensate people, how you promote  people. Those are things that you can actually set. And by having an  appropriate set of incentives, you're probably going to get the behaviors that  are more consistent with what you desire. And if you get that, over time, that  will actually establish the culture of the organization. That will sort of set  the social norms that define the organization.\n\nSo, the  reason why I stress incentives is this is something that senior management  actually has control over. There are things that they can actually do in terms  of how people are compensated, how they are evaluated, how they are promoted. And  that's why I really—\n\nRob Cox:\n\nWell,  what are those things? If you were to trace back to 2006—\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLook, I  think we've made some progress on the compensation front, in the sense that  there's more deferral of compensation, and there's more scope for clawbacks. But  I personally think that there's scope for doing even more on this front.\n\nIf you go  back to the old partnership model where people actually had their capital tied  up in the firm, and couldn't get their capital back until years after they  retired, they had strong incentives to make sure that the firm didn't—\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYou were  at Goldman when it was a partnership, right?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I  wasn't a partner when it was a partnership. But, yeah, I think that culture was  helpful in terms of risk management. The willingness to take risk. So, one  thing you could look at for example is do we really want to have all these  deferrals in the form of stock grants? Maybe we should have these deferrals in  the form of total loss-absorbing debt.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nLike a  hybrid coco or whatever those things are?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, or  just something that basically if the firm does badly in the future, and fails,  the compensation that has been deferred in the form of debt gets converted to  equity, and the management actually has to suffer some of the consequences.\n\nAnother  thing that I think would be really worth looking at a little bit would be who  pays the fines when firms have bad conduct and behavior. Why does it always  come out of the shareholder's pocket? The shareholders may not have even been  shareholders at the time of the bad behavior. Maybe there should be a device  that could actually reach down and grab some money out of the pockets of the  managers who actually were responsible for the bad behavior and the bad  conduct.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nWhat have  you done Ellen? Do you have specific formulas? Is there something you can tell  us about the contours of your incentive schemes that are designed to do exactly  what Bill is talking about?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nSure, I  just touched on some of it before, but at least for the senior team, we put a  balanced business scorecard in place that's—a percentage of it is financial  performance, with financial targets. And then there's a qualitative piece. We  also have deferral through performance stock units and restricted and stock  units. And then we also have clawback.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nHave you  had to ever claw anything back?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nNot at my  current firm, but in a prior firm that I worked at, yes, we have used the  clawback for employees. And I actually think that the European banks use it a  little more aggressively than the American institutions, and they were really—the  European banks were the first to implement clawback.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nIs that  right? When you were at Citi in the '80s and '90s, you probably didn't have all  of these kinds of highfalutin bells and whistles on compensation then.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nWell, the  compensation was a lot lower to start off with.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nOh,  that's true.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nI want to  just pick up some of the things that Ellen and Bill have said. I think it's  very important that your staff—we talk about those at the top, the middle  management down to the teller—have pride in the institution that they are  working for. And this then spills over to the client and the customer. And I  think that's when we're going to get the trust level back. And then when you  talk about pros and cons of rating people, for compensation, one of the things  that has become somewhat controversial is the role of the whistleblower.\n\nA lot of  institutions don't even call it whistleblowing, they call it—I think in CIT, Ellen told me it's a hotline. And the  responsibility that if you're sitting next to somebody, or you see something  that is not correct, that you will speak up in some form or fashion. And I can  run through some institutions where this did not happen, or where the employee  tried to speak up and was suppressed or even fired.\n\nAnd so I  think it's key to maintain the pride of the employees and the trust of your  customers, that you have some sort of mechanism where if an employee sees something  that's being done incorrectly, he or she will speak up. And it makes a lot of  sense that this be done really right up to the board level, because what do you  want to do? Read about it in the newspaper? Or have your friendly supervisor  call you and say, \"We just got a call from someone in your organization  saying they've seen this or that.\"\n\nAnd I  think that has been another problem. This was suppressed during this period of  time. The whole idea of people in the institutions speaking up, and that also  has to go back to pride in the institution, that they will do so because they  think it's wrong and they don't want to be with an institution that does bad  things.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nAnd then  senior management has to be receptive to that employee.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nExactly,  exactly. Right up to the board level. Because too often—in our first report, as  Stuart knows, we worked on, and Bill—was the role of the Board. Because too  often boards either didn't want to know, or frankly didn't push senior  management to let them know what was going on.\n\nAnd in  the most recent cases that I've seen—it's out there. A number of board members  of Wells Fargo said we were never told, we didn't know. And it's not just  Wells. All of the institutions involved in this in the United States and Europe  went through the same bit. So I think this is key.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nLet's  talk about Wells. Wells is a living and breathing case study, really, in some  of this stuff. I mean Bill Dudley—the Fed last week issued an order forbidding  Wells from growing its balance sheet further until they say \"sufficient  improvements\" in governance and risk management are made.\n\nAs Bill  Rhodes points out, four directors, concomitant with this announcement, were  leaving the board. I mean if culture is improved broadly across the industry,  how are we to interpret what's happened with Wells, which, prior to this last two  years, was considered the sort of paragon of good banking culture?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell,  that goes back to the discussion we were having before on incentives. They had  really bad incentives in terms of how they evaluated and compensated their  employees. So you were compensated on the basis of how many accounts you  opened. And that was sort of problem number one. So the incentives were wrong. And  then two, when people complained about it—employees complained about it—and  went up the chain of command, that was essentially not heard or ignored.\n\nTo Bill's  point, you want to have a culture where people are willing and comfortable  raising their hands. But that willingness and comfort at raising your hand  depends on how that's received in the organization. So at Wells Fargo,  apparently, people did raise their hands, or tried to raise their hands, and  the message just wasn't received by senior management, and I think it never  really got to the board of directors.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nHas  enough been done on Wells Fargo? I will just say, we've called for a full  change of management, CEO level, pretty much since this thing came. We didn't  think it was—given the level of cultural rot, that you could have someone who had  come from that culture running the place. You think they should fire Tim Sloan?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI don't  have a view on that. That's way beyond my pay station. I think Wells Fargo  understands that they have to change their culture. I mean, I think they  completely understand that. Betsy Duke is the lead director at Wells Fargo, and  I've worked with her when she was at the Board of Governors.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nShe's chair  now.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYes,  she's chair now. And I think they get that they have to do some pretty  substantive things to change the culture there. So, the proof of the pudding  will be in meeting those, so they actually have to do it. And, you know, it's  hard to change culture in very large, complex organizations. It's not something  that one can do overnight. The problem that people always talk about is that  the people at the top of the house may have the greatest intentions. But how  can they actually reach down into the middle layers of management and sort of  change how people perceive the organization?\n\nYou can  have a lot of cynicism at the mid-level and lower levels. Like, \"Yeah, the  senior management is doing this, but they're just doing this because they are  under regulatory pressure. They don't really mean it.\" So it is hard to  actually change in these large, complex organizations.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nThere are  successful precedents. One could say JPMorgan and Jamie Dimon, there is a sort  of inculcated culture at all levels. Of course, we'll see what happens. Headlines  may pop at any time and ruin our view of that. But Ellen, you wanted to say  something?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nI just  want to pick up on that point that cultural change just doesn't happen  overnight. And a lot of the studies say it's at least a three-year process, and  it's also just not about the regulatory and the compensation. There's what do  you do on a day-to-day basis to make sure that the values and behaviors really  flow through the entire organization, and that it's living and breathing within  the organization.\n\nAnd some  of the things that we do—in every town hall and through all our communication  and messaging to our employees, we talk about culture and we talk about our  values.\n\nI do town  halls where I give out a chairwoman's award for employees who demonstrate that  they're living our core values and behaviors. And it doesn't sound like a lot,  but it really is very meaningful inside the organization. Through some of our  corporate programs, like even wellness, to show that we care about our  employees. Or we look at our customer complaints. We have a new product  approval process where we sit and we talk about, well, gee, what does this  product do for the customer?\n\nWe look  at business practices, or do you have any financial results that are outsized? I  remember taking over a leasing business, and I couldn't figure out—it was a  business that when I was at Citi, that Citi had acquired, and I couldn't figure  out why they made so much more money in their business versus our business. And  so we tried to look at the whole process, front end to back end, and realized  that this company we bought had really egregious end-of-lease practices, and we  immediately terminated those. Because those things aren't sustainable in the  long term.\n\nWe have a  hotline. I can't tell you how important the hotline is, and it's important that  employees feel like they have a safe environment. And we have my head of human resources,  my general counsel, and my head of audit chair the ethics committee, and they  look at all of the hotline reports that come through and say is there anything  here we think we need to investigate further?\n\nSo, as I  said, there's just so many things you need to do in the company. Having a  diverse board, so that there are board members that are more sensitive to some  of these types of issues and ask the questions at the board meeting. There's  just a long list of things that need to be done.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nI want to  pick up on the Board question, I mean—\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nI would  say that that is key—tone at the top, but all the way down, as I said, to  middle management and the teller, because often this gets shipwrecked at the  middle-management level. But one of the things that we recommended in our last  report, which came out in July 2015, was an incident—\n\nRob Cox:\n\nThis is  the G30?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nThe G30 report,  yes. One of the things we recommended is that boards take a look at forming  separate committees to look at culture and conduct, because the norm usually  was to put audit and risk together. First of all, audit and risk never should  have been put together, because the tendency was to spend all the time on the audit  side and nothing on the risk side.\n\nBut in  addition to having an audit committee and a separate risk committee, a number  of institutions have picked up—or some institutions—have picked up on our  recommendation to form a separate committee on culture and conduct.\n\nAnd the  reason why this is so important is so you don't get this point that you were  making where the board says \"we didn't know what was going on\" type  thing. Because they are then responsible for seeing that the culture—whatever  it is in the institution—is embedded, is monitored, and then action be taken  when an employee does the wrong thing.\n\nSo, I  think there have been improvements along the way of getting the board more  involved. And Ellen was talking about the hotline, which was very important, in  the sense of getting the staff involved right down to the teller level. That  everyone feels it's his job, because the whole idea here is when you enter an  institution, no matter what level, you want to have some pride in your job. I  mean that's the whole idea, to have pride in what you're doing.\n\nAnd the  reasons that we're getting a lot of college graduate, MBAs, whatever, not  wanting to go into the industry is they don't feel this is an area where they could  have pride. And that's the whole area of trust that we've got to bring back on  the table. And it's not an easy job. As I said, we're like on a train and we  made a couple of the right stops, but the journey isn't over.\n\nAnd as I  mentioned before, it will be even more important if the politicians decide that  they want to reduce regulation, supervision, the authority of supervisors and  regulators—then it's even more important to make sure you have a strong culture  and conduct in a positive fashion.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nI've got  a couple more questions before I open it up to the audience. One is this  question about are you guys anxious at all about some of the financial  innovations we've seen. One of the stories yesterday was about the sort of  anti-VIX product that Credit Suisse was selling, and actually, it is redounding  negatively on the reputation of Credit Suisse, arguably. Or you see the way  banks or some of the exchanges have gotten into bitcoin futures. Bill Dudley,  are these appropriate products for banks to be selling? Are they culturally  appropriate?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nI think  it's really a question of the suitability of the clients that the products are  being sold to, and their understanding of the risks associated with the  products. I don't have a problem with a product being sold to someone as long  as that person is a suitable investor for that product and understands the  risks of the product. Because you have to be careful here—you don't want to  discourage innovation, and you don't want to discourage offering products that allow  a lot of people to hedge risk in various ways, adjust their portfolio for risk.\n\nBut you  have to make sure that they are appropriate and well designed. I think the  thing that we worry about when we look at the financial system and we worry  about financial stability risks—where are there cases where there are feedback  loops?\n\nSo right  now with the stock market having a little bumpy ride over the last few days,  there's a question: As volatility goes up, is that going to cause people to  sell stocks because they have a strategy of investing that's tied to the level  of volatility in the stock market? If that were the case, then that could cause  the stock market to be bumpy in the future.\n\nSo, it's  those feedback loops that we focus on very intensely, when we analyze financial  markets for financial stability risk. And I think that firms when they design  products, they need to be cognizant of that.\n\nI mean  the classic example is the stock market crash in 1987, when people had this  product called portfolio insurance, which meant that when the stock market went  down, you had to sell stocks. So as the stock market went down, portfolio  insurance kicked in, you had to sell, and that caused the stock market to go down  even further.\n\nThat  probably was not a very well designed product, and people I don't think had  thought through what the implications were, how that product would actually  work in practice.\n\nSome of  these VIX products, I think people are going to now look at this with the  benefit of hindsight and say, \"Were these really well designed?\"\n\nThis  wasn't that big a bump in the equity market, and these products actually blew  up. So you have to sort of ask yourself the question, \"Were these products  well-designed?\"\n\nRob Cox:\n\nAre there  are other elements out there, things that worry you, whether it's risk parity  trades or some ETFs? I mean when you look at what's happened in the last couple  of days with the stock market, what keeps you up at night?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLook, I  think the stock market had a remarkable rise over a very long time, with  extremely low volatility. I, and many others, had observed that the valuation  of the equity market is elevated. And so having a bump like this has virtually  no consequence, in my view, of the economic outlook.\n\nMy  outlook hasn't changed just because the stock market is a little bit lower than  it was a few days ago. I mean it's still up sharply from where it was a year  ago. That said, if the stock market were to go down precipitously, and stay  down, then that would actually feed into the economic outlook, and then that  would affect my view in terms of the implications for monetary policy.\n\nBut so  far, this is a big story in the press. It's a big story for financial market  participants. But I don't think it's a big story at all at this point for  central bankers.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nGo ahead  Ellen.\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nWhat  concerns me is really what's being done in the unregulated bank space. So for  example, the fintech space. We bought a fintech company, Direct Capital, a  couple of years ago. And it took a lot of work to have it work within a bank  environment, including significantly reducing the amount of pricing that we  earn on the product, the transparency of the terms we give to customers, but  they can get a 30-minute credit approval from us.\n\nBut there  are other companies out there that, if customers don't understand the fine  print, they're being charged 35, 40% on some of these products. It's the  business of BDOs out there that are lending to middle-market companies at terms  that we haven't seen since before the financial crisis. And my concern is that  this is the whole shadow banking system that hurt us during the last crisis,  and if interest rates rise substantially, these companies are going to get into  trouble, and guess who finances them? Banks. Banks are giving lines of credit  to these companies. So I am worried about this whole shadow banking system, and  I think that our regulators should look more at some of these, into these.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nCan I ask  just sort of one corollary, something you raised a minute ago, which was  diversity of boards. But let me ask, where does the whole \"Me Too\" movement fit  into this discussion about banking culture? I'll start with you, Ellen. Or, how  should it?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nNo, it  does, and I've gotten a lot of questions of, well, gee, why hasn't—we haven't  seen financial services companies, fortunately, in the press a lot. And as an  industry, we faced this 20 to 30 years ago. The old boom-boom room at Salomon  Brothers. I think that the industry, to give it credit, was terrific in terms  of sensitivity training, making sure you have a proper code of conduct, actually  having public firings, if somebody demonstrated inappropriate behavior, et  cetera.\n\nAnd I  think that it's really positive that people are feeling they can come out and  talk about things right now, but I think as an industry, in financial services,  we took a lot of steps to avoid that.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nDo you agree  with that, Bill Dudley? That's sort of been the premise that we've written—the  sort of \"they went through this.\" The financial industry went through  this and created a lot of safeguards.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYou know,  I hope so. I hope that's right.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYes.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nYou never  know what's unknowable, but I hope that's right. It should be right.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nAll  right, I'm going to open this up to questions from the audience. Please, no  filibustering. Ask your question, state your case. We'll start here with the  gentleman. I think we have mics.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nJust to follow  up on the shadow banking question. If you could elaborate more with respect to  the potential risks as far as shadow banking globally. Of course we have it  here, but China has a rather large shadow banking situation, and although we  can contain it here in the United States, what happens with the risks overseas  that might impact the U.S. economy?\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYou want  to take that Bill?\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nWell, I  would just say I think it's a very good question, and I'm very concerned, and  Ellen brought it up right now, shadow banking. And you mentioned China, where  it's a particular problem.\n\nIt's not  clear to me that they've gotten their hands around it either, because every time  they close something up, they come up with something else. Trust companies—I  could run through all of the instruments, because the Chinese business  community is very adept at innovation. And we have to remember that China is  the world's second largest economy. In fact, if it hadn't been for China in  2008, when they put a stimulus package in, anywhere from $850 billion to $1  trillion, we would have had a Great Depression, not a Great Recession.\n\nAnd so  I'm very concerned about that. And China is probably where it's most serious. But  as Ellen brought up there are problems here, there are problems in Europe also.  When you talk to bankers in Europe, and there was an article in the Financial  Times and Reuters the other day about this whole question of regulation of shadow  banking in Europe.\n\nI think  it's a major challenge, this whole question of shadow banking, because here we  spend the time on supervising, the regulatory side, and what the banking  community is doing. And the tendency is you don't see that same effort in the  shadow banking area. So I think it's most important.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nI have a  question really for Bill, just because on a really good day my currency and  fixed-income portfolio managers complain about the lack of liquidity in the  market, let alone on Friday and Monday. So I'm just wondering how much you view  liquidity as an issue and how concerned you are about a liquidity crunch.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell,  people have been looking at the issue of what have the changes in regulation  done to liquidity in various fixed-income markets. I think there's probably  been some consequence, for example, in the repo market, and a few other  markets.\n\nBut I  think generally, I would say market functioning actually seems to be pretty  good. I mean there was a period on Friday where there was a very sharp movement  downward around three o'clock in the equity market. So there's something that  we have to look at and evaluate what really caused that.\n\nBut I  think generally, liquidity actually is pretty good. If you look at things like  bid-offer, bid-ask spreads, more people can execute. I think it's not as good  as it was back in 2006, 2007. But there's a lot of reasons not to want to  return to 2006, 2007.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nWhen you  say \"not as good,\" you mean bid-ask spreads—\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell, I think there's probably not as much depth in the market. In other words, if you want  to do a large transaction, you're probably going to have a little bit more of a  price concession now than back then.\n\nPeople  talk about the corporate bond market as one area where dealers have reduced the  amount of corporate bonds that they hold on their balance sheets because of  capital charges against those corporate bonds have gone up.\n\nSo, I  think there has been some consequence, but in general, I think markets are  functioning quite well. I think the ability of savers to meet borrowers  efficiently in the financial system is very much intact. And actually what we  care about is, is the financial system able to supply credit to small  businesses, to households, in an efficient manner to support economic growth? And  I think if you look around the world, the answer is yes. I mean we have a  global synchronized recovery now, which I think is quite positive.\n\nSo, it's  something that we're going to continue to look at. There is no question we want  to continue to focus on what's the appropriate level of regulation, what are  some of the consequences of regulation for things like liquidity? But so far, I  would say, we have a much safer financial system, and that's able to perform its  function throughout the business cycle.\n\nNow the  other thing is, if you have looser requirements for things like capital and  liquidity, it might lead you to have a little bit more free flow of credit at  the top of a boom. But what happens if the system then breaks in the economic  downturn? So you really want a system that's actually sustainable throughout  the business cycle. And I think we have a much better system now to ensure  that.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nTo what  extent might banking culture improvement include a reduction in the pay gap  between the C-suite and the average worker?\n\nRob Cox:\n\nEllen?\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nI don't  think they have to worry about my pay ratio. No, just kidding. But, you know I  think I'm going to pass that to one of the Bills. I'd have to think about that.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nLook, I  think the issue of income inequality and the issue of income mobility in this  country is really important. I think that some of the things that you see  happening in the political space is a consequence of U.S. poor performance in  both those regards.\n\nI've been  surprised at how high the pay is at the very top of the house. It seems like  people would be willing to do the jobs for probably considerably less money. But  how we got this result, that's something that people very much debate. People  talk about the winner-take-all society.\n\nI think  that as a country we need to do a lot better on working on both the income  distribution issue, but even more importantly, in my mind, is income mobility. You  know there's a lot of work that Raj Chetty and a number of his associates have  done about income mobility, and what they find is where you're born has a huge  consequence in your ability to have income mobility through your lifetime.\n\nSo it's  not about you, it's actually literally where you were born physically. That  says that in the United States we have a lot of work to do, to create a much  more even set of opportunities for people so that it doesn't matter where  you're born. It depends on your work ethic. So I think there's a lot more we  can do in the United States in this realm.\n\nAudience Member:\n\nI was  just wondering if changing the culture seems like a very noble attempt at  changing the industry. But how will you avoid poaching your talent if there are  firms that are not on the same objective as you are? You know it happens all  the time. It happens with traders, it happens with—they're just going to want  to go to a Goldman rather than a Citi if Citi is not paying them.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nEllen,  you brought this up a little bit, the issue of shadow banking is part of that I  suppose.\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nYes, I  mean so maybe I'm being a little idealistic here, but I don't think it's all  about the money. I mean there are some individuals that it's about the money,  but I think for the most part, our employees, it's about working for a firm  that they can be proud of, that has a good culture, that is interested in  long-term shareholder value, et cetera. And I think if you have a good employee  proposition, it will prevent some of your employees from being poached. And in  institutions where they are having troubles right now, it's actually an  opportunity for us because they want to come work for a company where they feel  that the employee proposition is very positive.\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nAnd if it  is all about the culture for those individuals, maybe they don't actually fit  in with your culture.\n\nEllen Alemany:\n\nYes,  exactly.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nYou know  we're talking about banking culture. But there are a lot of other industries  that have—we've given them a social license with our data, for instance. Big  tech is a great example. I don't see conversations like this being promulgated  by whatever it is—the regulators, should there be any—of the Googles and the  Facebooks. It's great that we're all focused on this, but as a society, are we  focusing on the wrong industry right now?\n\nPresident Dudley:\n\nWell,  let's take care of the financial industry first, before we start moving out.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nI'm  trying to figure out what you're going to do next, Bill.\n\nBill Rhodes:\n\nWell, you  know, the answer to that, I think this goes back to the shadow banking and  comments that were made here. I think some of these real large, enormous  high-tech firms are eyeing, as you read in the newspaper all the time, are  eyeing the entrance into the financial sector. And we brought up China before,  and this is a big issue now on China, with Alibaba, and the others. How much  are the supervisors, regulators going to be allowing them to get into what  amounts to virtual banking?\n\nSo it all  really goes back to that. And I think it's going to be one of the major issues  in the financial system going forward. And the question is, has this really  been thought out by the politicians, the supervisors, regulators? Not clear. And  very importantly, by the banking industry itself so that it can remain  competitive? And so I think it is a major issue going forward, without a doubt.\n\nRob Cox:\n\nI think  that is all we've got time for. I want to thank you all for coming out in this—and  hopefully you can get out of here, it looks like it's coming down like cats and  dogs now. Please thank my panelists, and thank you for coming.",

    "text": "The past few years have been an extraordinary time for policymakers. We have been very aggressive in providing support to the economy and it now appears that we are emerging from a deep and protracted recession. Economic activity expanded over the second half of 2009, suggesting that a recovery has begun. While we continue to receive encouraging news, growth is likely to be muted compared with the early stages of past recoveries. As a result, the unemployment rate is likely to decline over the near term at a very gradual pace, if at all.\n\nIn the labor market, employment has begun to expand. We hope this is the beginning of a sustained period of job growth. Total employment shrank by roughly 8 million jobs since the peak of the cycle, and the current unemployment rate of 9.7 percent remains unacceptably high.\n\nAt the regional level, here in the New York—New Jersey region, the labor market was not hit as hard as in many areas in the country, and the pace of job losses in our region has eased. Nevertheless, the unemployment rate in New York and New Jersey has risen to levels not seen in almost two decades.\n\nIn New York City, employment has typically recovered more than a year later than the recovery of national employment and has, in the past, been led by a recovery of Wall Street employment. Although Upstate New York has seen little overall job growth for the past several decades, job losses in this downturn were not as severe as losses for the nation, in part, because the upstate metro areas did not experience a boom-and-bust housing cycle. In addition, Puerto Rico, which is also part of our District, has experienced a considerably longer and deeper downturn than the mainland or this region.\n\nBefore I continue, it is important to explain the integral role of the Federal Reserve System in regional economies across the country. One of our key responsibilities here at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is to connect the Federal Reserve System to Main Street across our District. Real activity takes place on Main Street in the form of the millions of decisions made every day by households and businesses around the country. When we talk to them, we learn how firms and consumers are experiencing the economy.\n\nThat essential insight from Main Street informs the policy decisions that we make in pursuit of our goals of stable prices, full employment and financial stability. Staying connected with Main Street is also important because the effectiveness of our policy actions is enhanced when private actors have a clear understanding of what our actions are intended to accomplish. For these complex policy decisions, the Federal Reserve System needs accurate and timely information on business and financial conditions, and the perspectives of participants in markets throughout the United States.\n\nEconomic conditions often differ in various parts of the country, and it is important that the Fed takes all of this into account when it formulates policy. This input is particularly important for the Second District of the Federal Reserve, where we sit today, because the forces that drive economic conditions here often do not mirror the forces driving other regional economies.\n\nIn order to monitor and understand the various aspects of local economic conditions, we utilize a number of different measures. Two of these measures we have developed here at the New York Fed—a survey of manufacturers and indexes of economic activity. We regularly produce the Beige Book and report information on local credit conditions. These measures supplement and extend the understanding gleaned from public data sources. We also seek input from regular meetings with several advisory groups representing different facets of the District’s economy—such as our Small Business, Upstate New York and Thrift Institutions panels—and from interactions with key academic researchers at local universities and public policy organizations.\n\nWe recognize that timely and accurate information about our region, which is highly valuable to us, can also help to reduce uncertainty and inform the economic and financial decisions of regional residents, businesses, communities and governments. To that end, we make our various regional measures and analysis available to the public through our website and a variety of outreach activities. These activities include making presentations on topics of current concern to business and community organizations throughout the District.\n\nWe welcome you here today to brief you on our views of the current state of activity and employment in the regional economy and to review the rich portfolio of resources that we make available to help monitor economic conditions across the region.",

    "text": "In my remarks today, I will  focus on why global growth has been so anemic following the financial crisis  and what we can do about it. 1\n\nI think it is fair to say that  the global recovery following the financial crisis has been disappointing.  Growth is below pre-crisis levels for the  United States, Europe, Japan and China.  For example, in the U.S., real GDP growth has averaged only about 2.2  percent per year over the period from 2010 to 2015, below the pre-crisis  average of 2.4 percent from 2003 to 2008.   This slower growth performance has been accompanied by relatively low  inflation rates—persistently below the objectives of the monetary policy  authorities in the United States, Europe and Japan.\n\nAs I see it, there are many  causes for these persistent shortfalls in growth, and they vary across regions  and countries.  Let me focus on the  reasons for the United States in the post crisis period.\n\nGrowth has been weaker than expected  for many reasons.  The financial crisis  was a searing experience that damaged household and business confidence in a  profound way—with a more lasting effect than the typical economic downturn.  The housing bust created both a large housing  supply overhang and a large number of households that were underwater on their  mortgages.  Households needed to repair  their balance sheets and bring down their debt service burdens to more  manageable levels.  Higher levels of  unemployment further depressed demand.\n\nCredit availability  contracted.  The tightening of credit  standards occurred quite broadly—in housing credit, consumer credit cards and  business lending.  Some of the credit  supply restrictions were imposed by banks that needed to repair their balance  sheets, deleveraging by building up capital and working down their bad  assets.\n\nFiscal outlays were not high  enough to compensate for the contractionary impulse from these first three  sources.  The crisis led to a significant  deterioration in the U.S. federal budget deficit and put pressure on state and  local budgets.  After the federal budget  deficit reached around 10 percent of GDP at the peak, fiscal consolidation  occurred at the federal level, as well as at state and local levels,  restraining economic activity instead of supporting growth.\n\nProductivity growth has also  been quite low.  In the period before the  crisis (2003 to 2008), U.S. nonfarm productivity growth averaged 2 percent per  year.  Since 2010, productivity has been  closer to 1 percent.  While some of this  decline can be explained by lower capital spending, the decline is difficult to  fully explain.\n\nAnother explanation some have  offered is that there is a measurement problem—we are understating output  growth and overstating price inflation.  This type of issue, long flagged as a hedonic adjustment, seems most  credible in particular market segments, such as in healthcare.  Alan Blinder has posed this question:  Would you rather have 1970 healthcare at 1970  prices or 2016 healthcare at 2016 prices?  Based on the measurement of prices, 1970 healthcare is a much better  deal.  Yet, when offered this choice,  almost all choose 2016 healthcare.  Why?  The reason is that people  highly value the advances in healthcare technology, such as in cardiac care, or  in the procedures that are practical today, such as hip and knee replacement,  that simply weren’t available 50 years ago.\n\nU.S. economic performance has  also been held back by developments in the rest of the world.  Growth outside of the United States has  slowed.  In the euro area, comparing the  period from 2003 to 2008 to the period from 2010 to 2015, annual real GDP  growth slowed from 1.9 percent to 0.8 percent.  Japanese growth has remained muted over these periods at 0.1 percent and  1.0 percent respectively.  In China,  reported growth rates over these two periods slowed from 11.3 percent to 8.3  percent.  These developments, along with  policy and risk events that have increased demand for U.S. assets, have  contributed to significant U.S. dollar appreciation over the last two  years.  This dollar strength has created  competitive challenges for U.S. exporters, especially in manufacturing, and has  caused the trade sector to be a drag on U.S. economic activity.\n\nLooking forward, despite the  fact that U.S. economic growth has been disappointing, we have actually made  considerable progress toward our monetary policy objectives.  The United States is quite close to its  employment and inflation objectives.  On  employment, there still seems to be a bit of slack in the U.S. labor  market.  But, that margin has shrunk  greatly over the past few years.  Payroll  gains have been at least as robust as anticipated.\n\nOn inflation, we are still  somewhat below our 2 percent objective.  But, even here, I think there has been progress.  Despite the strengthening of the dollar and  the decline in energy prices, core PCE inflation has been quite stable over the  past year—currently running at around 1.6 percent.  That is not a tremendous difference from our  2 percent objective.\n\nSo why has the United States  done a bit better compared to Europe and Japan in terms of achieving our  monetary policy objectives.  I think  there are a number of contributing factors.\n\nFirst, U.S. household balance  sheet repair occurred relatively quickly.  This is in part because the housing foreclosure process wiped out many  mortgage debts.  Part was accomplished by  a long period of very slow household debt growth.  And part was accomplished by the sharp fall  in interest rates that helped cut debt servicing costs.\n\nSecond, in the U.S., the banking  system was recapitalized and deleveraging occurred quite quickly following the  financial crisis.  Capital from the  Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, was put into the large banks and soon  many of them replaced this TARP capital by raising new equity.  The SCAP stress test in 2009, and the annual  CCAR stress tests that followed, worked to constrain the rate of bank capital  distributions and, thereby, helped to build up bank capital ratios.  And, U.S. banks worked hard to clean up their  balance sheets.  Poor assets were managed  down or run off, and underwriting standards were tightened.\n\nThird, the Federal Reserve was  particularly aggressive early on in its pursuit of monetary policy  accommodation in order to keep inflation expectations well-anchored.  This is a necessary condition, in my view, to  maintain the efficacy of monetary policy.  If inflation expectations were to get unmoored to the downside, then it  becomes more difficult to pursue a stimulative monetary policy.\n\nCould things have been done  differently in the U.S. in such a way that would have led to better  outcomes?  Absolutely.  With the benefit of hindsight, we could have  and should have been even more aggressive on the monetary policy side.  While we made progress with some of the  innovations on monetary policy that we eventually introduced—such as the  open-ended purchase of $85 billion of Treasury and MBS securities per month—it  would have been better if we had done this sooner. There is a lot as well that is outside the  Fed’s purview that could have been done to make the U.S. economy perform  better.  This includes tax reform, job  retraining programs and infrastructure investment. So, what can we do to bolster  global growth in the future?  The first  is to undertake the necessary structural reforms to make our economies more  efficient.  Productivity growth is not  preordained.  The steps we take as  countries to eliminate and lessen bottlenecks and improve our human and  physical capital are important.  The  second is to ensure that our financial systems are well-functioning.  Tremendous progress has been made globally in  implementing higher capital and liquidity standards post-crisis.  But we still see some important banking  systems impaired by bad loans, low profitability and inadequate capital. The population aging in the  developed world does imply that, purely from the productive factor side, less  of the global growth contribution is likely to come from Japan, Europe and the  United States.  And economies like China  are likely to continue to slow as their per capita income increases and they  make the transition from investment-to consumption-led growth.  But this doesn’t imply a bad outcome.  There are many other countries with tremendous  potential for growth in areas such as Africa, Asia, and South America.  Take, for example, the surge in growth that  we are seeing out of India. I am an optimist.  To a large degree we do control our destiny.  It is up to us to seize those opportunities. 1 Linda  Goldberg, Jonathan McCarthy and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\nThere is a lot as well that is outside the  Fed’s purview that could have been done to make the U.S. economy perform  better.

    "text": "It is a  great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here this evening at the Lotos  Club, one of America’s oldest and most distinguished literary clubs.  I am, of course, very happy to participate in  tonight’s public affairs dinner and to accept the Lotos Award of Distinction.\n\nTonight I  would like to take a moment to discuss some of New York City’s recent history  and its return from the economic brink.   Aside from being a story of historical interest, I believe there are  lessons embedded in New York City’s experience that are relevant to other cities  and municipalities that find themselves struggling today.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own  views and not necessarily the views of the Federal Open Market Committee or the  Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nGiven the  historical relevance of today’s date, it seems appropriate to start by  recalling what happened on this day 29 years ago.  In what has come to be known as “Black Monday,”  the U.S. equity market suffered one of its steepest one-day drops in history, with  the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 508 points—a decline of more than 20  percent.  This capped one of the worst  weeks ever for the U.S. stock market.   Many feared the worst for the U.S. economy—and especially for New York  City.  After all, the stock market crash  in 1929 was followed by the Great Depression.\n\nAs a young  economist working on Wall Street, I certainly was worried—the situation didn’t  seem consistent with future job stability.   I went out that evening and bought myself a leather jacket.  If I lost my job, I wanted to leave with  something on my back, something tangible.   As it turned out, although the city’s economy and Wall Street did indeed  sustain a steep downturn, both were able to recover and to prosper.  Not only was there no depression, the economy  avoided falling into recession.  And,  importantly to me, I was able to keep both my job and my leather jacket.\n\nIn  retrospect, the 1987 crash was just a hiccup in what ultimately turned out to  be a remarkable upturn in the city’s performance and prospects.  However, to really understand this story of  the city’s resilience, we need to take a look back at one of the darkest periods  in New York City’s history: the 1970s.\n\nI remember  New York City in the 1970s from my freshman days at Columbia University.  Columbia was a great place to be a young  student.  There were engaging professors  and I had the opportunity to read the great books of the university’s core  contemporary civilization curriculum.   Recognizing the strong literary traditions of the Lotos Club, I would  also note that I had the fortune of reading some of the great works of Middle  English, including Chaucer.  I also  enjoyed being on both the freshman wrestling and golf teams—even if it was an  odd pairing and our teams were not very good.\n\nIn contrast  to Columbia, the city seemed much less attractive.  From my perspective as a naïve 17-year-old  from suburban Massachusetts, it seemed outright dangerous and dirty.  The danger was driven home immediately.  One of my roommates was robbed his first day  during a walk through one of the nearby parks.   He didn’t understand, nor did I at the time, that certain places near  Columbia weren’t very safe, even during daylight hours.\n\nWhile you  could avoid the crime by being careful where you went in the city, there was no  avoiding the pollution.  During this  period, New York City still had considerable manufacturing activity, many  apartment buildings burned low-grade oil and incinerated trash, and this was  before the days of automobile catalytic converters.  This confluence meant that grit was  everywhere, and even for the non-fastidious—which I admit I was one—showers  were an absolute necessity on a daily basis.   Sometimes it was so bad that you couldn’t see across the Hudson River,  which was just a few blocks away!\n\nIn order to  understand the situation the city faced in the 1970s, we have to look back a  decade earlier.  The 1960s were a time of  hope and promise for New York City, with the World’s Fair, the opening of the  Verrazano Bridge, and the beginning of construction of the World Trade Center.  The city benefited from a booming stock market  and strong overall job growth.\n\nMy memories  of New York City during that period were very glowing.  Visiting from Massachusetts, I remember going  to the World’s Fair and to a Mets game at the new Shea Stadium—heady stuff for  an 11-year-old.  As a boy who planned to  be a nuclear physicist when he grew up, I particularly recall the General  Electric exhibit at the World’s Fair that highlighted the potential of hydrogen  fusion as a future power source.  Although  that turned out to be like flying cars—always somewhere just over the  horizon—it was exciting to contemplate as an aspiring scientist.  Unbeknownst to me,there were also some ominous signs for the city.  The city’s manufacturing sector was losing  jobs at a worrisome pace, population growth had slowed to a crawl, crime was on  the rise and racial tensions were growing.\n\nAs the  sixties unfolded, there were also a number of major strikes affecting public  services, most notably the 1968 teachers’ strike.  Perhaps most importantly, the city’s finances  were on a reckless path.  Despite growth  in the economy and the tax base, the city was taking on more short-term debt,  relying increasingly on state aid and grossly underfunding its pensions.  This is a familiar story where the seeds of future  fiscal problems are sown during better economic times.  In effect, a combination of a strong U.S.  economy, a bull market on Wall Street and various forms of fiscal gimmickry  masked the increasing underlying fiscal stresses that the city was experiencing.\n\nBy 1970,  when I arrived, some of this good fortune ended when the U.S economy was hit by  recession and a bear market in equities began.   What followed was a massive economic slump in New York City—what would  generally be described as a depression.   Some of the numbers are staggering: from 1970 to 1975, New York City saw  a 6 percent decline in its population, a 15 percent drop in employment and a 50  percent surge in the murder rate.  The  combination of the need to roll over debt from the prior two decades, a  shrinking tax base and increased costs of debt—which sometimes had been used to  finance operating expenses—caused fiscal problems that forced the city to cut  services and raise taxes.  A continued  bear market on Wall Street exacerbated the situation.  In effect, New York City looked to be in a  vicious cycle with companies shrinking, closing or moving out.  The result was fewer jobs, an exodus of  people, declining property values, rising crime rates and eroding tax revenues.   This meant fewer firemen, police and  teachers, which led, in turn, to more crime and poorer educational  opportunities.  Put simply, it was a horrible  dynamic that looked difficult to reverse.\n\nAt the end  of 1975, New York City faced perhaps its darkest moment and greatest challenge  of the modern era when it ran out of money to pay for basic services.  The city’s persistent deficits caused the financial  sector to lose confidence in the city’s ability to repay its debts, and the city  lost its ability to borrow.\n\nYet, this  moment—when the outlook appeared bleakest—turned out to be an historic turning  point for the city.  The reforms that  were subsequently imposed by the state and federal governments through the  Emergency Financial Control Board were quite tough in many ways.  There was plenty of pain to go around, and  just about every stakeholder―including city officials, lenders, city workers  and residents, to name just a few―shared in the sacrifice.\n\nThe city’s  extraordinarily large level of short-term debt was refinanced into long-term  debt owed to the newly formed Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC).  To make this debt marketable to the public,  MAC was given control over the city’s sales tax.  Revenues from that tax were dedicated to  repayment of the MAC debt, and the city could keep only what was left over.\n\nFundamental  to the deal was the creation of the Emergency Financial Control Board, which  was empowered to monitor proposed city budgets to ensure that they were in  balance.  This change alone was very  consequential: taxes increased and spending fell sharply over the latter half  of the 1970s.  By 1982, the city’s  inflation-adjusted wage bill had fallen by almost 30 percent, and real  investment in the city’s infrastructure fell by more than three-quarters and  didn’t reach its 1974 levels until the early 1990s.\n\nThe city  gave up a significant amount of its autonomy in exchange for the relief it  received.  Ultimately, however, the  reforms that were forced on the city created a responsible and transparent  budgeting process that has served the city well to this day.\n\nBy early  1976, the U.S. economy was recovering from a deep recession, and employment in  New York City’s financial sector was once again on the rise.  Overall employment in New York City began to  recover by 1977, and unemployment began to decline.  By the end of the decade, there were signs of  hope, but it wasn’t at all clear yet whether the city was back on solid  footing.  While employment did rebound  modestly, the city’s population was still declining, crime was still rising and  the city was still having trouble borrowing.   It would be 10 years after the initial crisis before the city was able  to borrow again on its own in the public markets.\n\nBy the  mid-1980s, the resiliency of the city’s economy was becoming more  apparent.  City-wide employment barely  declined during the wrenching recessions of the early 1980s—the first time in a  long while that the city’s economy had out-performed the nation’s.  In the next few years, job growth picked up  sharply and real estate markets soared, a clear sign that a growing number of  people had regained confidence in the city.   But, even during the booming 1980s, crime rates continued to increase—it  wasn’t until 1990 that crime rates peaked and began a long downward trend.\n\nI returned  to New York in 1983.  The draw was an  employment opportunity in finance.  At  the time, the city’s circumstances were improving but crime was still high, and  there were still lots of problems caused by years of underinvestment.  For example, I recall that the New York City  subway system at the time was a near-wreck, with train speeds sharply reduced  in many areas due to poor track conditions and dilapidated infrastructure.\n\nBut, the  seeds of improvement were in place.  The  financial services industry was beginning a long boom marked by financial  market innovation and the rapid development of the nation’s debt capital  markets—a boom that ended with the financial crisis.  When I arrived, the build-out of the Battery  Park City neighborhood was just starting.   My first year, I lived at Gateway Plaza, which was the first big  apartment complex in Battery Park City.   However, it was early days and the nearest grocery store was about half  a mile away north on West Street!\n\nAlthough a  major economic downturn throughout the Northeast in the early 1990s took its  toll on New York City—especially on employment and home prices—the city’s  population continued to grow and its crime rate began to decline.  While the city has had a number of ups and  downs since the early 1990s, in tandem with the United States, the general  trend has been upwards.  The city  withstood a terror attack, financial crisis and natural disaster.  Following the attack on the World Trade Center  in 2001, there was uncertainty over whether this would be a permanent setback  for the city.  However, the city rebuilt  and recovered and Lower Manhattan has evolved into a vibrant commercial,  cultural and residential area.  Gateway  Plaza is still there, but the Battery Park City neighborhood today is now fully  developed and well-established.  There  are even several grocery stores!\n\nThe city  weathered the recent financial crisis and the Great Recession far better than  many would have anticipated.  Although  employment in the securities industry has stagnated after the decline due to  the Great Recession, the city has found new sources of dynamism, including  rapid growth in the technology sector and the further development of  tourism.  The number of technology  workers in New York City has doubled to about 125,000 in the past decade.  That sector is now is nearly as big as the  securities industry.  And New York City  had 56 million visitors last year, nearly double the total of 25 years  earlier.\n\nIn 2011, an  important milestone was reached: payroll employment surpassed its previous  all-time peak, from 1969, and it has grown strongly since then.  Crime rates have fallen significantly across  the city since 1990, and real estate values have surged.\n\nOne  consistent source of strength for the city has been immigration.  Over this period, New York City benefited from  a sizable influx of immigrants, which more than offset out-migration in many  neighborhoods.  To illustrate this, let’s  take a look at one such neighborhood in Brooklyn, Sunset Park, that was losing  residents to the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s.  As property values fell, new migrants from  Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Central America moved in.  By 1990, Hispanics comprised about half of  all Sunset Park residents.  These new  residents developed a thriving community, which boosted property values.  There was also an influx of Chinese  residents, and part of Sunset Park has come to be known as Brooklyn’s  Chinatown.  There are many other examples  where immigrants revitalized whole neighborhoods: Russian and Ukrainian  immigrants in Brighton Beach; Chinese and Korean immigrants in Flushing; and  Indian immigrants in Jackson Heights, just to name a few.\n\nSo, has it  been all good news for New York City in recent years?  Certainly not.  Many challenges remain.  One by-product of a strong economy and real  estate market has been a decline in housing affordability, and an increase in  homelessness.  It is estimated that there  are over 60,000 homeless people in New York City today—almost double the number  from 10 years ago and more than four times as high as in the early 1980s.  Moreover, poverty rates remain high in many  parts of the city, and the education system can certainly be improved.  Yet, a strong economy and a sound fiscal  position at least provide the means to devote resources to help address these  ongoing problems.\n\nThis turnaround  of New York City illustrates that reviving a city in trouble is indeed  possible. There are some useful lessons from New York City’s experience.  First, it is often darkest before the dawn.  Cities in fiscal distress are like individuals  suffering from addiction: they often have to hit bottom and reach out to others  for help before they can begin to recover.  New York City hit bottom in 1975, and that created  the impetus for reform.  Second, in such situations,  cities often have to give up fiscal control for a time.  Accepting a Control Board and operating under  its mandates was a painful, but necessary, step toward rebuilding the city’s fiscal  health and regaining access to financial markets.  Third, when sound reforms are implemented it  still takes a long time to achieve fruitful results, so it is important to stay  the course.  Fourth, although a strong  economy, good fiscal position and transparency in government will not  automatically solve every problem, they provide a strong foundation.\n\nSo, what  does the future hold for New York City?   An important aspect of a city’s vitality is the ability of its residents  to develop the skills necessary to be successful and to achieve their dreams.  A big asset for the city is its access to  affordable education.  Each year, tens of  thousands of low-to-moderate-income New Yorkers—many of them immigrants—send  their children to one of the city’s specialized high schools.  When it comes time for college, many of these  same students have access to universities in the CUNY and SUNY systems.  A recent highly regarded study assessed how  much of an opportunity kids born to less advantaged families in different parts  of the United States have of moving up in the world.  New York City ranked 10th out of the  50 largest U.S. metro areas. 2 The Big Apple should strive to be number one  in this ranking by continuing to improve access to quality and affordable education  and to job training.  We should all do  our part to help make this happen.\n\nAlso, it is  important to remember that the measure of a city’s well-being is much broader  than how many are employed and the level of economic activity.  As Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, explained:\n\nIn my own  philanthropy and business endeavors, I have seen the critical role that the  arts play in stimulating creativity and in developing vital communities…the  arts have a crucial impact on our economy and are an important catalyst for  learning, discovery, and achievement in our country.\n\nThrough the  fiscal crisis, into the 1980s and to the present day, the city maintained its  status as a center of culture and the arts.  The efforts of the city and the state,  starting in the mid-1980s, to redevelop the Theatre District and Times Square  area played an important role in revitalizing tourism.  But, of course, the city’s well-deserved  reputation for culture and arts goes well beyond Broadway—to the hundreds of Off-Broadway  and neighborhood theaters, museums, music venues and organizations like  yours.  Supporting this cultural  infrastructure is important to maintaining a vibrant economy and a bright  future.\n\nThe experience of  New York City, which has gone from crisis to vibrancy, shows that the past need  not be prologue for the future.  It also  shows that a well-managed regime of fiscal control can help begin the process  for future recovery.  Other cities and  regions are at different points in this journey.  Puerto Rico, for example, which has been in  recession for many years and which defaulted on its debt obligations earlier  this year, is at a particularly critical juncture.  On the positive side, the fact that Congress  has enacted legislation, the Puerto Rico  Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA, does provide a way  forward.  The prospect for good fiscal  stewardship has improved and this is an essential first step in the Island’s  recovery.  As I have noted elsewhere,  there are significant opportunities for action that can leverage the Island’s  strengths to foster economic growth.  These  include its bilingual adult population, an open economy occupying a central  position in the Caribbean, wide experience as host to international corporations  and close economic ties to the U.S. mainland.  However, much as New York City took time to  recover, so too will it take time for Puerto Rico to recover from its crisis of  the last decade.\n\nThe future of  Puerto Rico is yet to be determined.   However, the experience of New York City suggests that a turnaround is  possible even when underlying conditions appear dire.  New York City is a compelling example of what  is possible when you leverage your citizens’ ingenuity and capacity for reinvention.  It shows what can be achieved with the  appropriate discipline and effort.\n\nThank you for  your kind attention.\n\n1 Jason Bram, Andrew Haughwout, Joseph Tracy and Luis Uranga assisted in  preparing these remarks.\n\n2 Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren,

    "text": "Good morning.  It is a pleasure to be here in Minneapolis today and to have the chance to speak to all of you.  As chairman of the Economic Club of New York, I particularly appreciate the role that the Economic Club of Minneapolis has played in organizing this event.\n\nIn my remarks, I am going to focus on the economic outlook and the implications of that outlook for monetary policy.  Today, I come before you as the proverbial two-armed economist.  On one hand, the economy’s forward momentum has slowed sharply during the first half of the year and inflation remains below the level the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) views as consistent with price stability.  On the other hand, I think it is also fair to say that we are still making progress towards our dual mandate objectives.  However, recent solid job gains and a further decline in the unemployment rate have occurred only because productivity growth has slowed markedly.\n\nDuring the remainder of the year, I expect growth to pick up somewhat.  However, productivity growth will also likely rise.  So there remains some uncertainty about whether growth will be strong enough to lead to further improvement in the labor market.\n\nWith respect to inflation, as long as growth remains strong enough to lead to further improvement in labor market conditions—and this is an important caveat—I am becoming more confident that inflation will move up toward the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  The firming of inflation that I anticipate reflects my expectation that resource utilization will increase and the fact that some of the factors that have pulled down inflation, such as lower oil and gas prices and a firmer dollar, have already stabilized or partially reversed.\n\nPutting this all together, I still think it is likely that conditions will be appropriate to begin monetary policy normalization later this year.  But the likelihood and timing will depend on the economic outlook, and that will be largely shaped by the incoming economic data.\n\nWhen the FOMC begins to raise short-term interest rates, this will occur in a very different environment than in the past.  Reserves in the banking system are very plentiful, reflecting the large increase in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over the past few years.  But this circumstance should not adversely affect our ability to push the federal funds rate into a higher target range.  We have the appropriate tools to push up short-term interest rates.  However, lift-off may not go so smoothly in terms of the impact on financial asset prices.  After all, lift-off will represent a regime shift after more than six years at the zero lower bound.\n\nMore important for financial market asset prices than the precise timing of lift-off is the expected trajectory of short-term rates over the next few years following lift-off.  Most likely, this will be a shallow, upward path.  Because of the persistent headwinds associated with the recent financial crisis, the level of real short-term interest rates consistent with a neutral monetary policy seems considerably lower now than in the past.  And, if potential GDP growth is much lower—due to slower labor force growth and productivity growth—the long-run equilibrium real short-term rate is also likely to remain lower than normal in the future even after those headwinds fully dissipate.\n\nBut there must be considerable uncertainty about the path for short-term interest rates.  After all, the economic outlook is uncertain.  Moreover, the appropriate stance of monetary policy will be influenced by how financial market conditions respond to the Federal Reserve’s actions.  All else equal, if financial conditions tighten sharply, then we are likely to proceed more slowly.  In contrast, if financial conditions were not to tighten at all or only very little, then—assuming the economic outlook hadn’t changed significantly—we would likely have to move more quickly.  In the end, we will adjust the policy stance to support the financial market conditions that we deem are most consistent with our employment and inflation objectives.\n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nTurning first to the economic outlook, the real GDP growth rate appears to have slowed sharply during the first half of 2015.  Based on the revision we received last week, first-quarter real GDP fell by 0.7 percent at an annualized rate. Although most projections anticipate a pickup in growth to around 2 percent or slightly higher in the current quarter, there is little question that economic growth has slowed significantly from last year’s second-half pace.\n\nWhat’s going on?  Why has growth slowed and what does this portend for the remainder of the year?\n\nAs I see it, the contraction in GDP growth in the first quarter represents a mix of factors.  These include another unseasonably cold and snowy winter, a sharp contraction in oil and gas investment, a deterioration in the trade balance due—in large part—to the stronger dollar and sluggish foreign demand, and a slowdown in consumer spending growth after a very strong fourth quarter.\n\nAfter adjusting for weather effects, I think seasonal adjustment issues probably also played some role.  For example, real defense spending has declined eight times in the past nine years in the first quarter, suggesting there is a seasonal adjustment issue.  But I judge that this has had only a modest effect on measured real GDP growth.\n\nBecause weather effects are by their nature temporary, the widely held expectation coming into the second quarter was that there would be a sharp rebound in growth similar to what took place last year. But current data suggests that the rebound has been relatively muted.  I think this is because some of the non-weather factors evident in the first quarter—such as the drag from the sharp drop in oil and gas investment—have persisted into the second quarter.  Also, real disposable income growth has slowed over the past three months as aggregate hours worked have grown more slowly and crude oil and gasoline prices have partially recovered.  This means that the fundamentals for consumer spending are not as strong as they were at the beginning of the year.\n\nNonetheless, my view is that growth will likely pick up further during the remainder of this year.  This judgment reflects several factors.  First, some of the forces that have been restraining growth are likely to fade later this year. For example, consider oil and gas investment.  The U.S. oil and gas rig count dropped precipitously during the first quarter, but the rate of decline has slowed during the current quarter.  Combined with the partial recovery in crude oil prices, this implies that oil and gas investment is likely to stabilize during the second half of the year.\n\nSecond, business fixed investment outside of oil and gas seems likely to advance, reflecting strong fundamentals.  For example, the cost of capital remains low and cash flows are high.\n\nThird, there is plenty of room for further gains in residential investment.  Housing starts have been running at an annual pace of only about one million so far this year.  This is low relative to both the rate of household formation that one would expect given underlying demographics and the rate of job formation.  Moreover, continued improvement in mortgage credit availability should support the demand for new housing.  Household credit worthiness is improving as the scars of the financial crisis heal, and underwriting standards may be relaxed somewhat in response to the excellent performance of recent mortgage vintages.\n\nFourth, household finances generally are in good shape with debt service burdens at historically low levels.  Nonetheless, household borrowing has been rising only very slowly, and the personal saving rate is somewhat elevated relative to what one would expect given the level of household net worth relative to income.  This suggests that if households become more confident about their finances, consumer spending should grow at least as fast as income growth over the remainder of the year.\n\nBut, I can’t be completely confident about this forecast.  After all, several times during this expansion we have been fooled by sharp rises in the growth rate that appeared to presage a sustained pickup, but that subsequently proved fleeting.  Moreover, faster consumption growth is not a given.  It will depend, in part, on the pace of employment and wage growth. A downside risk is that wage growth remains subdued, which would undercut consumer spending. And, the trade sector looks likely to remain a drag on growth over the remainder of the year.  Although the dollar has depreciated slightly on a broad trade-weighted basis recently, it still is more than 10 percent higher than it was a year ago. Despite the sharp slowdown in growth evident during the first half of the year, we have seen continued job gains and further falls in unemployment so far this year.  Consequently, we still seem to be making progress toward our objective of maximum employment in a context of price stability.\n\nToday’s payroll and household employment reports indicate that this progress continued into May.  Even with a weak month in March, job gains this year have been averaging almost 220,000 per month.  The gain in May was even stronger at 280,000 and was widespread across industries.  Although the 12-month change in average hourly earnings is still low at 2.3 percent, it is a bit higher than we have seen in recent years.  At the same time, there is still some ways to go.  The unemployment rate has changed little in the past four months at about 5½ percent, with the levels of part-time workers for economic reasons, and long-duration unemployed, remaining elevated.\n\nThis combination of slow output growth and continued job gains has meant that productivity growth has been unusually weak, with non-farm business productivity declining significantly during the past two quarters and rising by only 0.3 percent over the past year.  It also implies that the future path of productivity growth will be important in determining the outlook for employment growth and the prospects for further progress in U.S. labor market conditions.\n\nBecause it is unclear exactly why productivity growth has slowed recently, it is difficult to be confident about what it will do in the future.  One reading of the data is that some of the slowing seems likely to be persistent.  For instance, the weakness in capital spending evident during much of this economic expansion means that the contribution to productivity from capital deepening has dropped sharply in recent years. 2 Also, the U.S. labor market appears to have become less dynamic—perhaps due, in part, to an older workforce.  Less movement of workers across jobs could lead to a less efficient allocation of workers’ skills, which would hurt productivity growth.\n\nThat said, it seems unlikely that productivity growth will remain as weak as it has been over the past year.  There is considerable evidence that technological progress continues at a healthy pace.  Just look at the advances that have occurred in health care, oil and gas extraction and the development of smartphones.  Moreover, because it takes time for technological advances to be adopted broadly throughout the economy, it seems unlikely that the productivity gains from recent innovations have yet been fully realized.\n\nBecause I am uncertain about the near-term trends of GDP growth and productivity growth, I am also uncertain about whether we will see further progress in the labor market over the remainder of the year.  There are many possible outcomes to consider.  For example, if real GDP growth were to pick up more than productivity growth, then employment growth would likely remain sufficiently firm to lead to further tightening of the U.S. labor market.  But, if the reverse occurs, then payroll gains could slow even as GDP growth strengthens.\n\nIn contrast to my uncertainties about growth and the labor market, I am becoming more confident that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term, as long as the labor market continues to improve—an important caveat.  The reasons here are straightforward.\n\nFirst, a number of factors that threaten to keep inflation below our 2 percent objective appear to be transitory.  In this camp, I put the sharp decline in oil and gasoline prices that began in mid-2014, and the weakness we have seen in nonpetroleum import prices due to the strength in the dollar.  When the effects of these transitory influences wane, inflation will begin to move closer to our 2 percent objective for the personal consumption expenditures deflator.\n\nSecond, the tightening of the labor market may soon lead to some strengthening in the labor compensation trend.  Although the recent data are as a whole inconclusive, I find it noteworthy that the four-quarter change of the Employment Cost Index for all civilian workers, which I view as the most reliable indicator of labor cost trends, rose by 2.6 percent as of the first quarter of this year, up from around 2 percent in the first quarter of 2014.  Also, work done by my staff suggests that we are at that point in the labor market recovery where, in the past, we have typically seen a pickup in wage compensation.\n\nThird, the risk that inflation expectations, which are important in influencing inflation outcomes, might become unanchored to the downside seems to have diminished.  In particular, anxieties created by the decline in breakeven inflation compensation measures based on the relative yields of nominal Treasuries versus TIPs have lessened.  For example, the 5-year forward, 5-year inflation compensation measure has climbed by about 25 basis points from its low point in late January. 3\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nSo what are the implications of the economic outlook for U.S. monetary policy?  As the FOMC noted in its most recent statement in late April, the Committee is looking for two conditions to be satisfied for the normalization of monetary policy to start: “further improvement in the labor market” and that the Committee “is reasonably confident” that inflation will return to the FOMC’s objective over the medium term.  I think these are reasonable criteria.\n\nI would note that these criteria are not independent.  All else equal, for example, further improvement in the labor market should make one more confident about the inflation outlook.  But improvement in the labor market, while necessary, is not a sufficient condition.  For example, if labor market improvement were not accompanied by a meaningful uptick in wage compensation and if inflation expectations also fell, then one likely would not be reasonably confident about inflation returning to 2 percent over the medium term.\n\nFor me, at present, the uncertainties rest more on the outlook of the labor market.  If the labor market continues to improve and inflation expectations remain well-anchored, then I would expect—in the absence of some dark cloud gathering over the growth outlook—to support a decision to begin normalizing monetary policy later this year.\n\nWhen the normalization process starts and we raise the target range for the federal funds rate, what should we anticipate?  I anticipate a smooth lift-off in terms of the ability of the FOMC to push the federal funds rate up into a higher range.  Less clear is what the financial market reaction will be.  Will it be more like the turbulent taper tantrum of 2013 in response to Chairman Bernanke’s remarks that we might at some point begin to taper our asset purchases, or the benign response when the FOMC actually tapered in 2014?  Let me consider these two issues in turn.\n\nI am very confident that the Federal Reserve has the tools in place to ensure that the FOMC can successfully raise the federal funds rate into a new, higher target range when the time comes to do so.  This reflects several factors.  Most importantly, we have demonstrated that the interest rate paid on banks’ reserve balances (IOER)—which is our primary tool to raise the federal funds rate target—and daily overnight reverse repo (ON RRP) operations—which is a supplementary tool to help put a floor under money market rates—have been effective in keeping the federal funds rate well within the FOMC’s desired target range.  Moreover, in the unlikely event that the rates we initially selected for the IOER and ON RRP were insufficient to move the federal funds rate into the desired range, we could alter the level of these rates and/or the spread between these rates so as to move the federal funds rate into the desired range.  Finally, we also have other tools, such as the Term Deposit Facility and term reverse repo that could be used if needed to help achieve the targeted range for the federal funds rate.  While I don’t expect that these tools will prove necessary, it is nice to have them available should we need to deal with unanticipated contingencies.\n\nHow will financial markets react to the onset of normalization?  My own view is that there likely will be some turbulence.  After all, lift-off will represent a regime change after more than six years at the zero lower bound.  Recognizing this, we have a responsibility to minimize the amount of potential turbulence by communicating clearly in order to reduce uncertainty about conditions surrounding lift-off and the likely aftermath of lift-off.  This means being clear about what factors are important in driving the timing of lift-off.  However, this does not mean providing advance notice about precisely when lift-off will occur because the timing should depend on the incoming economic news and how this influences the economic outlook.  Instead, if you pay attention to the incoming economic news and listen to our assessment about how the outlook is evolving, then I think you will be able to judge for yourself when lift-off is likely.\n\nWhat also matters for financial asset prices is the likely post-lift-off trajectory of short-term rates over the medium- to longer-term. In fact, this should be more important than the particular month in which the normalization process starts.  On this score, I think it is hard to be precise about the expected path of short-term rates.  That is because it depends on two important factors: (1) how the economic outlook evolves, which depends, in part, on how loose or tight monetary policy actually is at a given level of short-term rates, and (2) how financial conditions broadly react to changes in the level of short-term rates.\n\nMy own view is that the upward trajectory of short-term rates is likely to be relatively shallow.  This reflects several factors.  First, the lack of strong forward momentum in the economy despite the low level of short-term interest rates suggests that U.S. monetary policy is not as accommodative as one might think.  In particular, the lack of strong momentum suggests that the real equilibrium federal funds rate today is considerably lower than the 2 percent rate assumed in the standard Taylor Rule formulation.  Work done by my Federal Reserve colleagues, Thomas Laubach and John Williams, suggests that the so-called neutral real federal funds rate today may be close to zero. 4 This presumably reflects still-persistent headwinds from the financial crisis, such as the constraints on mortgage credit availability to prospective borrowers with lower FICO scores.  Second, one might expect that it will still take additional time for these headwinds to fully subside.  This implies that the neutral short-term rate may be depressed for some time.  Third, my assessment is that the long-run equilibrium real federal funds rate is lower now than in the past, reflecting the likelihood that potential real GDP growth is lower due to slower growth of the labor force and more moderate productivity growth performance.\n\nAnother important factor that will affect the trajectory of short-term rates is how financial market conditions respond to a rise in short-term rates.  Monetary policy works on the economy through how it affects financial market conditions.  Economic conditions at any point in time warrant a particular set of financial market conditions so the FOMC can best achieve its objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  The FOMC chooses a policy stance to help support financial market conditions that will lead to economic outcomes consistent with its objectives.\n\nAn important aspect of current financial market conditions is the very low bond term premia around the globe.  If a small rise in short-term rates were to lead to an abrupt increase in term premia and bond yields, resulting in a significant tightening in financial market conditions, then the Federal Reserve would likely move more slowly—all else equal.  As an example, consider the experience of the 1994-95 tightening cycle.  Bond yields rose sharply and the Federal Reserve tightened less than what was ultimately priced in by market participants.  Conversely, if term premia and bond yields were to remain low and the economic outlook suggested that financial conditions needed to be tighter and a rise in short-term rates did not generate this outcome, then the FOMC would likely need to raise short-term rates further than anticipated.  The 2004-07 tightening cycle might be a good example of this.  The FOMC ultimately pushed the federal funds rate up to a peak of 5.25 percent, in part, because the earlier rise in short-term rates was generally ineffective in tightening financial market conditions sufficiently over this period. 5\n\nThis means that there is uncertainty about the trajectory of short-term rates from two distinct sources: (1) the economic outlook and what setting of financial conditions this implies is appropriate, and (2) what setting of short rates is consistent with the financial market conditions that the FOMC is seeking to generate.  This also suggests that market participants should be cautious in interpreting the Summary of Economic Projection “dot plots” that show the FOMC participants’ modal outlooks for the short-term rate trajectory.  If the participants were to provide confidence bands around their paths, they probably would be very wide because the economic outlook is uncertain and the linkage between the instrument of monetary policy—the federal funds rate target range—to financial market conditions is loose and variable.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the FOMC is continuing to make progress towards our dual mandate objectives.  However, I have become somewhat more uncertain about the growth outlook given the lack of a sharp rebound in economic activity in recent months from the weak first quarter.  With respect to inflation, as long as we see further improvement in the labor market and anchored longer-term inflation expectations, I am somewhat less worried that inflation will stay too low.  Thus, I continue to expect that monetary policy normalization is likely to begin later this year.\n\nLonger-term, I expect that the trajectory of short-term interest rates after lift-off will likely be relatively shallow.  This is due, in part, to my reading that monetary policy today is not as accommodative as one might think judging just from the level of short-term rates.  But, the path will ultimately be determined by how the economic outlook evolves and how financial market conditions respond to monetary policy.  I expect that there will be many twists and turns in the road ahead.  As we make this journey, I will do my best to explain what I am seeing and how I think I might react as conditions change in the future.\n\nThank you so much for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 Jonathan McCarthy, Richard Peach, Paolo Pesenti and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 For example, see Alan Blinder, “The Mystery of Declining Productivity Growth,” Wall Street Journal , May 14, 2015.\n\n3 The data on inflation compensation come from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors website at www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2008/ and is based on Refet Gurkaynak, Brian

Federal Reserve should have raised short-term interest rates more aggressively over this period.",

    "text": "Carla Hesse : It’s wonderful to  see a sea of blue in this beautiful space here, and to be here for such a  wonderful occasion. When we planned this event, I didn’t think we realized we’d  be in such an exciting moment, but I couldn’t be more thrilled to be here to  have a conversation with Bill Dudley, who graduated from Cal with his Ph.D. in  1982.\n\nI  want to mention that he got an undergraduate degree from a very small liberal  arts college, and that’s meaningful because I think that the depth of having a liberal  arts education underneath a very specialized advanced degree really helps  people go to the distance in life, and to show the kind of leadership that Bill’s  career has exemplified.\n\nAt  Berkeley, he studied with Professor James Pierce, who was a beloved professor,  and who I didn’t realize until tonight had launched him at the Fed for his  first job, having gotten his Ph.D. He then went on to Goldman Sachs and then  back to the Fed eventually, in 2009, where he succeeded Tim Geithner. And has  been there until now, and now we’re in a very exciting moment of wondering  where he’s going next.\n\nSo  I’d like to invite him up here and ask him a few questions, and then we’re  going to be sure to leave some time so that you can have at him too, because I’m  sure he has thoughts that you’re curious to hear his views on.\n\nI  thought we’d just start with the elephant in the room. How disruptive do you  think this transition event is going to be?\n\nPresident Dudley : I don’t think it’s going to be disruptive. A couple of things I guess I  would point out. First of all, so far so good. I mean the quality of the  appointments has been excellent. Jay Powell is a really capable, good pair of  hands. I think Janet’s done a fabulous job, but if it wasn’t going to be Janet,  Jay’s a really, really good choice to be the Chair of the Fed. And Randy Quarles,  who has been appointed to be the Vice Chair of Supervision, is also extremely  well qualified for his position. So, if things stay in that sort of vein,  everything’s going to be really great.\n\nThe  second thing I would say is that it’s a committee. When you think about  monetary policy, you are really talking about, if you have a full complement,  19 participants on the Federal Open Market Committee. So it’s also important to  recognize that changing out one or two people like me isn’t going to change  what the committee thinks, because it is truly developing a consensus among the  committee members that I think is important in terms of driving policy.\n\nAnother  aspect of this is that the committee really is very united right now in terms  of what the appropriate policy path is. So if you look at this summer when we  announced that we’re going to go and start to normalize the balance sheet,  every participant on the FOMC subscribed to the principles of how to normalize  the balance sheet over time. There weren’t any dissents.\n\nSo  you change out a few people, but I think the committee is really going to stay  together.\n\nThe  last thing I would just say—two final things I would say on that point. One thing  I think is really important is that the Fed’s mission doesn’t change. We have a  mandate from Congress: maximum sustainable employment and price stability. So,  whoever you are and whatever background you come from, when you come to the  Board of Governors or you become a president of one of the Federal Reserve  Banks and then serve on the FOMC, your mission is to try to achieve those dual-mandate  objectives. It’s not like you can just go off and do something totally  different. That mandate doesn’t change.\n\nAnd  then finally, it’s not just about the principals. People put so much focus on  the Chair and the Vice Chair. The Federal Reserve has thousands of really  qualified professionals working every day to help make the people at the top  well informed and to help in their decision-making. And all those people are  still going to be there, they’re still going to be working really hard.\n\nSo  I think people—when you watch the movie “Too Big To Fail,” there’s no staff in  the movie. There’s the Bernanke character, the Geithner character, the Paulson character  around a table. That is not how policy is made. There’s just hundreds of people  involved in thinking about what’s happening in the economy, what’s happening in  financial markets. Thinking about various options of how you might respond. And  that’s also true in the monetary policy realm.\n\nThe  staff is still going to be there, they’re still highly qualified and very much  committed to the mission. So, I’m really not worried at all.\n\nCarla Hesse : That’s great. We’re all happy to hear that, I’m sure. So, what I thought we’d  do is start with some broad questions, and then we’ll hone in and get a little  more insider baseball.\n\nThe  first question I wanted to ask you was about your views of the Trump  Administration’s policies that are making it more difficult to secure H-1B  visas and to limit legal immigration from several countries. Now, what impact  do you think this will have on the United States economy, and what immigration  policies should the United States have in place?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well, we are completely apolitical, so I don’t have any views on any policies  of the Trump Administration. That said, I think that when you educate people in  the United States, you’re developing a lot of human capital, and I think it’s  really logical that you’d want to have that kind of capital stay here in the  United States.\n\nI  mean, the spots at our leading universities—there are not that many spots. So, if  you look at the economics program at Berkeley—when I went there, there were  about 30 Ph.D. candidates per class. And about maybe half of them actually  finished and got their Ph.D.’s. So, in my class, maybe 15 people actually got Ph.D.’s.  Those are pretty scarce resources. If you’re going to educate someone to get a Ph.D.  in the United States, wouldn’t it be better to try to encourage that person to  stay in the United States and take advantage of that human capital that you  poured all these resources into to develop?\n\nI  don’t think you want to go quite so far and say if you get a Ph.D., you  automatically get to stay in the United States, because obviously you do want to  have secure borders. And you do care about any people who might have bad intent  with respect to the U.S. So you certainly have to do the appropriate background  checks, and things of that sort.\n\nBut  I think the presumption should be more the default that if you do get a Ph.D.  in the United States, the presumption is that you get to stay as opposed to  that you have to leave. That’s just good public policy, in my view.\n\nCarla Hesse : Yes, I mean you might be interested to know that the Berkeley Economics  Department now graduates over a thousand BA’s a year.\n\nPresident Dudley : I know it’s a very big—I actually spoke to the undergraduates a number of years  ago. And it’s done in the stadium now.\n\nCarla Hesse : There are five top-ranked programs in the country, but what really differentiates  Berkeley is this incredible multiplier effect of the education that delivers at  that very high level. It is a lot of human capital, and precious. So, staying  with this sort of broader vein for a minute, I thought we’d ask a little bit  about globalization, and what you see are the benefits and risks of  globalization, trade, and increased competition.\n\nPresident Dudley : Well, we could be here for several hours to really answer that question with  any detail. Look, I think first of all, we have to recognize that globalization  has had huge benefits for the world. I mean, literally, hundreds of millions of  people have been wrested out of poverty over the last couple of decades. So  that’s number one. That’s probably a good thing, net-net.\n\nNumber  two, I think you have to recognize that globalization has benefits but it also has  costs. The benefits for the U.S. have been low-cost goods and services from the  rest of the world. But some of the costs in are the adjustment process that has  to occur when businesses that were sheltered from competition are no longer  sheltered from competition, and therefore have trouble actually carrying on.\n\nI  think the big mistake is to think that putting up trade barriers is going to  somehow make you better off. I do not believe that putting up trade barriers  will make you better off. I think what it will do is it will force you to  produce things that you are less good at producing. It will also risk the  retaliation by those who you put the trade barriers up to, which will probably  make you both worse off.\n\nIn  terms of the whole debate about the benefits and costs of globalization, I  think what we should be focused on is how to reduce the adjustment cost to  those that are hurt by globalization, or by technological change.\n\nFor  all the talk we have about globalization, I think technological change is  probably actually more important in terms of the amount of stress it puts on  certain segments of our citizenry. And I think we legitimately need to do a  better job of helping those people adjust, rather than just saying, “Well, too  bad, tough luck. Your plant closed down, you’re living in a small rural  community, you don’t have many prospects for employment, and that’s just too  bad.”\n\nSo  I think that we need to temper the sharp edge of capitalism at times, and that  means workforce development, job retraining, trade assistance adjustment. We  could do a lot more on that front, and if we did that, I think there’d be more  acceptance of the benefits of globalization and of free trade, and then you’d  have a stronger political consensus for the regime in which we have operated  for the last few decades.\n\nCarla Hesse : One more question in this vein of global dynamics and their relationship to the  economy. What do you think about the role of U.S. monetary policy in the global  setting and its effect on the rest of the world? Is there a need for, in a  similar vein, greater coordination between U.S. monetary policy and…?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well, there is certainly a need for good communication. I go to Basel,  Switzerland five times a year, at least. Basel is where all the central bankers  get together to talk about the economy, and monetary policy, and regulatory  policy. And that’s actually a really important venue because you get to know  your counterparts. So, if you’re in the middle of a financial crisis, and you  pick up the phone to speak to someone, you actually know who’s on the other  end, and you actually have built up some trust and a relationship with them. So  that’s really important.\n\nI  think that it’s important to communicate well and clearly. It’s important to  have those personal connections. In the middle of the financial crisis, when we  were negotiating the foreign exchange swap lines with my counterparts at the  ECB, the Bank of Japan, and a number of other central banks—having met the  people and having interacted with them on many occasions made it much easier to  get to a good place. So it’s really important to have those personal  relationships.\n\nIn  terms of coordination, I think there’s a limit to how far you can go, though. The  mandate that’s set for the Federal Reserve on monetary policy by Congress is  about maximum sustainable employment in the U.S. and price stability for the  U.S. It says nothing about the rest of the world. So you have to recognize that  the monetary policy that we pick here is the policy that we think is best for  us.\n\nThat  said, if we do the monetary policy well and we communicate well, we can also  minimize the disruption to everybody else.\n\nSo,  a good example is to compare and contrast the “taper tantrum” in 2013 and 2014  with the balance sheet normalization process this year. When we rolled out the  balance sheet normalization process, we were very, very, very cautious in terms  of how we communicated and how we actually implemented the program.\n\nWe  started to talk about what we were thinking about long before we actually  enacted the program, and then when we actually pulled the trigger and said we’re  going to enact the program starting in October, it was a program that built  very, very gradually. And it won’t be fully in place for another year.\n\nAnd  so, there were no big surprises. And I think that was very, very helpful in  making it so the markets adjusted to this change in policy very smoothly.\n\nSo  we learned some lessons from the taper tantrum. I think communicating clearly,  foreshadowing what you’re going to do, explaining why you’re doing what you’re  doing, I think can not only be helpful to the U.S. and U.S. financial markets,  it can also be helpful to the rest of the world.\n\nClearly,  U.S. monetary policy is important for the rest of the world. What we do in the  United States does affect financial markets all over the world. And we want to  have financial markets globally that behave more well than badly, and to the  extent that we can communicate clearly so that the adjustment process is  smooth, I think that’s good for everybody.\n\nCarla Hesse : So, let’s move onto the regulatory environment. You had the coverage in the Times,  you’ve expressed some views on this, and maybe this will be an opportunity to  elaborate a little bit more on what’s been covered already in the Times. Let me  just start with asking you about how you view the unfolding of the Dodd-Frank  Act. We all know that in response to the recession and financial crisis,  Congress enacted much greater regulation in the financial industry. Recently,  there have been calls to reassess that decision, and particularly to reassess  and maybe even repeal the Dodd-Frank Act—or at least modify it in some form. How  effective do you think Dodd-Frank has been, and can it be improved? Should it  be reformed? Or is repeal a justified decision?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well, I certainly wouldn’t want to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act, and go back to  the regime that we had in place prior to the financial crisis. I think we  learned a lot during the financial crisis about a lot of inadequacies within  our financial system. Banks didn’t have enough capital, they didn’t have enough  liquidity. A lot of over-the-counter derivatives were cleared bilaterally,  which created a huge mess when firms actually got into difficulty. We didn’t  have particularly good oversight of the major financial market utilities. So  large, systemically important firms weren’t required to have higher levels of  capital and liquidity available to smaller firms.\n\nSo  there’s a lot of really good things in the Dodd-Frank Act. Title II basically  provides a mechanism though which you can actually resolve a large,  systemically important firm, probably in a way that wouldn’t necessarily  threaten to take down the entire financial system. I think there’s a lot more  good than bad in the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThat  said, could it be improved? Yes, I think it could be improved. I’ve been on  record saying very clearly that I think that some relief for smaller banking  organizations probably makes sense, because small banking organizations are not  systemic. A failure of a small banking firm is not going to threaten to take  down the entire financial system. So, differentiating between how you regulate  large institutions and small institutions I think makes a lot of sense.\n\nAnother  change is the Volcker rule. The Volcker rule, as it has been implemented, has a  pretty heavy hand of regulatory compliance to it. You could probably get most  of the benefits of the Volcker rule with a lot less cost. But it’s important  not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think that capital liquidity  requirements do need to be higher on a permanent basis for large, systemically important  institutions.\n\nI  do believe that the central clearing of over-the-counter derivatives  transactions actually reduces risk in the financial system. I think it’s  important to have a viable resolution regime so you actually can resolve a firm  or allow a firm to fail without necessarily taking down the rest of the  financial system.\n\nI  hope in my lifetime we will never have to have the kind of interventions that  we had in 2008, with Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG. Those are not  interventions that were politically popular. They weren’t interventions that  were comfortable to do. But it was really a question—I really viewed that  officials that were making those decisions had a Hobson’s choice, and the  Hobson’s choice was to rescue the firms to prevent violent failure or let the  financial system collapse.\n\nAnd  I think they made the right choice in preventing the violent failure of some of  the major financial firms. Because I think if we hadn’t done that rescue, I  think we would probably have had a Great Depression.\n\nSo  I think the right choices were made. They just weren’t pleasant choices. You  need the Dodd-Frank Act to never get to that situation again, where we’re  forced to make such difficult choices. So hopefully, in my lifetime, we’re  never going to see anything like this again.\n\nCarla Hesse : One of the big concerns that is lingering from the way the economy has emerged  from the Great Recession has to do with the labor market and employment. And  even though the country is now approaching low—record low—unemployment rates,  we haven’t seen wages bounce back and improve at the same rate that one might  expect if you were really in a full recovery.\n\nYou  touched on this a little bit earlier, but maybe you could amplify a little bit  more on how much you would see that as a consequence of globalization and the  way in which it’s affecting wage deflation in the United States, or changes in  the structure of labor markets nationally. And where are we with discussion of  the sharing economy? And we’ll continue to talk a little bit more in the next  question, too, about inequality in a growing economy.\n\nPresident Dudley : Well, the unemployment rate right now is 4.1%, which is a low unemployment rate  relative to what we’ve had historically. We think it’s pretty much at full  employment. And what we mean by that is the level of unemployment where if you  go any lower, you’re actually going to have, over time, an inflation problem.\n\nBut  we don’t really know precisely where full employment is. So, if inflation doesn’t  go up, sitting at a 4.1% unemployment rate, that means that you can actually  let the unemployment rate go lower still.\n\nA  lot of people are sort of wringing their hands about, gee, where’s the  inflation? We’re at a 4.1% unemployment rate and there’s no inflation. That’s  not actually a bad thing. It actually is a pretty good thing, because it means  that you should be able to probe, and go to an even lower unemployment rate,  which is actually a good thing for all those people that could actually be  employed and have jobs and develop skills and grow their human capital.\n\nSo,  I’m not particularly concerned about the fact that inflation’s a little bit  lower than our target. I don’t really completely understand why inflation is as  low as it is right now. We would have thought that at this unemployment rate,  we would be seeing more pressure on wages, and that that would be ultimately filtering  into prices. It may just be that it takes some time—that you have to be at this  unemployment rate for six months or a year or two years to actually see the  consequences for wages and prices. But it’s not a bad place to be.\n\nI  mean if you told me that you have to live in a world where the unemployment  rate is 4.1% and inflation is about 1.5%, and you have to stay there for  eternity—most central bankers would say “sign me up.” So, it’s important not to  overstate the degree of the problem.\n\nI  think what’s going to happen is that the economy is going to continue to grow at  an above-trend pace. I think that’s going to continue to gradually tighten the  labor market further. I think as that happens, we’ll see a little bit more wage  inflation, and as that occurs, that will eventually filter into prices.\n\nWhen  you look at—people talk about the so-called Phillips Curve. The Phillips Curve  is the relationship between wage inflation and the unemployment rate. People  saying, well, there’s no wage inflation, therefore the Phillips Curve doesn’t  work. I don’t agree with that. If you look at the economy, instead of looking  at the economy on a national basis, if you look at state by state, and you look  at those states with a lower unemployment rate, you actually tend to have a  higher wage inflation in those states with lower unemployment rates. So that’s  suggesting the Phillips Curve is alive and well, it’s just not visible yet on a  national basis.\n\nCarla Hesse : You’re not overly worried about what many, many economists—including some of  the most notable ones at Berkeley—are worrying a lot about, which is growing  inequality?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well, I am worried about that. In fact, what I’m worried about— so, people  having jobs doesn’t mean they necessarily have good jobs. That’s problem number  one. Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve and monetary policy can’t do that much  about income inequality and can’t do much about income mobility, because  monetary policy is really about the business cycle and trying to keep the  economy at full utilization of resources.\n\nObviously,  if we keep the economy operating at a full utilization of resources, that will  help people—because people will have jobs, and they’ll develop skills, and they’ll  grow their human capital. But monetary policy is pretty limited on this  particular front.\n\nI  personally think that people talk a lot about income inequality. I actually  think the bigger issue in the country is income mobility. The work that Raj Chetty  and others have done basically shows that where you are born affects your  lifetime earnings. Not what your family’s background is—literally, where you  live as a child. That’s pretty damning. That actually seems fundamentally  unfair.\n\nSo,  I think there’s a lot of work we need to do to try to address creating greater  opportunities for people regardless of where they’re born, who they’re born to,  did their parents go to college, did their parents not go to college, were they  born in the rural South, were they born in New York City. I mean, the  differences are quite vast, and they don’t have anything to do with the  endowment of the individual. They have to do with the native environment—where  they were brought up. And I think that really tells you that we have a lot of  work to do on this front.\n\nSo,  I’ve been talking about this and I think the Federal Reserve is paying a lot of  attention to this. We have a research institute at the Minneapolis Fed that’s  looking at this issue very closely. And we in the New York Fed very much  support that work. I think it’s hugely important. I mean, the whole American  dream is based on the idea that anyone can be very successful if they really  apply themselves. We’ve got to make that true—in fact, not just in theory.\n\nCarla Hesse : And so, the issue of low interest rates you don’t think intersects in any  meaningful way, at least for people who rely on, for example, fixed incomes, or  the elderly who are relying on pensions?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well—look, my mom is 94 years old, and she would like to have higher interest  rates. But, the reality is that our job is maximum sustainable employment and  price stability, and at the end of the day, I think that the country as a whole  is better off having an easier monetary policy and a lower unemployment rate. I  think that’s more consistent with our mission over time than to have interest  rates somewhat higher today, and unemployment higher, because that will  probably lead to lower interest rates in the future.\n\nIt’s  not interest rates at a particular point in time. It’s interest rates over  years and years and decades and decades. And I think the best way you can have  the highest sustainable level of interest rates is to get the economy to full  employment. And that’s really been what our goal has been over the last seven  or eight years. And we’re finally in the vicinity of full employment. As a  consequence of that, we’re gradually now removing monetary policy accommodation,  and interest rates are going up.\n\nIt’d  be really sad to tell people, “I’m really sorry, but I’m keeping you unemployed  for a while longer because we need to have higher interest rates for savers.” I’m  not sure that that would feel right. It certainly doesn’t feel right to me.\n\nSo,  my mom has had to do without. She’s doing fine. And I just think that’s—and the  mandate that Congress has given the Fed—it’s maximum sustainable employment and  price stability, and so we’re following the monetary policy designed to best  achieve that mandate.\n\nCarla Hesse : And so you don’t worry, like some people—let’s say Ben Bernanke—about interest  rates falling so low that it leaves us with very little room to maneuver?\n\nPresident Dudley : No, I do worry about that. I mean, this is the issue of let’s imagine that  interest rates this cycle peak at a relatively low level, 4 or 5%. That would  mean that in the next recession, the Federal Reserve wouldn’t have that much  room to reduce interest rates before you got back to zero. And the issue there  then is, OK, what would monetary policy do at that point? Would you have the  tools in place to actually lift the economy out of recession?\n\nAnd  that’s a legitimate issue. But two things I would say about that. Number one,  we have a better toolset today to deal with the zero lower bound for interest  rates than we did 10 years ago. We actually learned a bunch of things through  this last episode—forward guidance, large-scale asset purchases, open-ended  large-scale asset purchases until our goals were actually achieved—which means  that the toolset is actually quite a bit better now than it was before.\n\nAnd  it’s not as if monetary policy has to do all of the lifting. You can imagine  the next recession, fiscal policy can also provide supports to the economy if  you’re trapped at the zero lower bound for interest rates.\n\nI  think that’s a real issue. How big an issue it is at this point, I think it’s  really too early to say. We’ve only had one episode in history of being trapped  at the zero lower bound for interest rates. How often this is going to happen  in the future, I think it’s really, really too soon to say.\n\nCarla Hesse : I’m going to ask you one more question, then we’re going to open it up, and it’s  a big question. I’m going to ask you to be brief in your response to it. But it’s  such an important one, and I’d really be curious to have your thoughts about it.  What do you think the work of the Fed in the last decade has had an impact on in  the culture and ethics of the business community, the financial community in  general? And how do you assess the state of things now? Do you think that there’s  been a taking in of some of the more—let’s call them ethical or cultural  questions—that were raised by the financial crisis?\n\nPresident Dudley : Look, I think there was a lot of bad behavior in the financial industry in the  run-up to the financial crisis, and even in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  The classic example I always use is the LIBOR issue, where people were calling  up their treasury functions and saying, “Could you change the bid that you  submit for your LIBOR submission because that will benefit me in terms of the  trading positions I have outstanding?”\n\nCompletely  illegal, unethical, should never have happened. The treasury function should  have said, “No, I’m not going to do this.” They should have reported the person  to compliance. Compliance should have done an investigation. The traders should  have been fired. That’s how it should have worked. It didn’t work that way on  all occasions.\n\nSo,  clearly there’s a lot of work to be done in the banking industry—work on  culture, in conduct, and in ethics issues. And this has been a priority for me  to talk about this issue over the last number of years, and I think we’ve  actually had pretty good take-up from the banking industry, that they really do  understand now that this is important for them. That if they don’t address the  culture and conduct issue, this could be potentially existential for them.\n\nBecause  what’s happened is, number one, the reputation of the industry has been really  hurt, and so it makes it hard for them to attract people, good people, into the  industry.\n\nWe  had a conversation with a number of deans from business schools a couple of  years ago, and a number of them said that they have a number of students that  won’t into the financial services industry because they don’t view it as  ethical enough. And that’s not a really good self-selection process. So, if you’re  not getting the people that think ethics is important, you’re only getting all  the other people. That suggests that you have a lot of work to do. So I think  that the banking industry now gets this—I mean obviously to different degrees,  at different institutions—and I think they’re working a lot harder on this  issue.\n\nSo  I think we’ve made a lot of progress. I think we need to do more, though. I  think there could be more industry-wide efforts, where banks actually have a  valuation of their culture and ethics, a questionnaire that evaluates—they all have  the same questionnaire. They get each other’s results anonymously, see how they  are doing relative to their peer group, and learn where they actually need to  improve.\n\nThis  is being done in the U.K. There’s a Banking Standards Board that’s actually  doing work on—they actually have a questionnaire and they share the results,  and it really allows you to sort of benchmark yourself, “How am I doing  relative to others?”\n\nWhat  they’ve also found is they are getting better, more honest answers. So on the same  question asked through this questionnaire that’s anonymous from the Banking  Standards Board, they get slightly more pessimistic answers than when the bank  has just done its internal engagement survey.\n\nSo  I think that we made quite a bit of progress, but I think there’s still more to  do.\n\nCarla Hesse : I’ll just circle back to the beginning, saying I think this is another area  where educational institutions have to play a really big role. And one of the  things that I’m very proud of at Berkeley is the liberal arts foundation. Our  business majors have to start in letters and science, and they get a very broad  formation before they specialize in any particular technical area. And I just  think that this is going to be the long-term solution.\n\nPresident Dudley : Can I add just one thing? One thing on that where I think academic institutions  can do even better is to embed the ethics stuff in the course material for all  the different subject matters. A lot of times the ethics course is off to the  side. So, you take your finance, you take your marketing, and then over here is  the ethics course. I think you really need that ethics material embedded in  each course so that people can see some of the tricky decisions they might be  faced with.\n\nCarla Hesse : I absolutely agree with that. In fact, I wrote a sentence just like that this  morning to a member of our advisory board about the need to have very broad  domain-specific ethics curriculum, whether it’s in STEM or the sciences, where  also so many important ethical questions are emerging.\n\nPresident Dudley : You know, a lot of them are not black and white. A lot of them are gray. And  so, to really draw them out by a particular example, where it’s something that’s  not abstract, I think makes it much more real to people. Just to give you an  example about how you can effect change: there’s always an issue with cybersecurity  and phishing. And one of the things that you want to do is sensitize people to  phishing.\n\nSo  one of the things we did at the New York Fed to sensitize people to phishing is  I sent a message to everybody in the New York Fed, with a line in the message: “New  York Fed restructuring.”\n\nAnd  so that really made people really curious. And so people went in to open the e-mail.  And the e-mail had a lot of things that made it very clear that it wasn’t from  me. For example, in the e-mail my name was signed “William.” I never sign my  name “William” in an e-mail. I always sign my name “Bill.” And there was a  bunch of other things. But a lot of people clicked through because they just  couldn’t help themselves to find out what was on the other side of the “New  York Fed restructuring.” And I think that was actually pretty effective at  making people much more sensitized to the phishing. It’s no longer abstract. It’s  something where they could actually see how they could get fooled.\n\nAnd  so you’ve got to get people engaged, where they internalize it. It’s like the  difference between taking a class and auditing a class. I audited statistics in  graduate school at Berkeley. It was a prerequisite for econometrics. It was a  disaster. I’d nod my head through all of the audit, and then when it came down to  when they handed out the final exam, and I had to ask myself to actually answer  all these questions, I couldn’t answer any questions. Because I wasn’t being  forced to actually internalize it by the problem sets, and all of the hard work  that it takes to understand a subject like statistics.\n\nCarla Hesse : Yes, learning by doing. OK, so now we’re going to open it up, and I see this  gentleman right here first. But just feel free to raise your hand. We don’t  have a roving mike, so if you can, speak up.\n\nAudience Member : Are you concerned that the increase in debt-to-GDP over the last 16 years in  the U.S., but also in other developed economies, is potentially an enormous  problem as rates start to go up? And how are we going to get out of that  problem?\n\nPresident Dudley : I think that your question is well taken in the sense that right now, the U.S.  debt-to-GDP ratio is quite a bit higher than it was prior to the financial crisis,  number one. Number two, our deficit is quite a bit higher now than it was at  the same point in this business cycle during the last cycle. So, in 2007, our  budget deficit was 1.1% of GDP. Last fiscal year, which ended September 30th,  it’s 3.5% of GDP.\n\nAnd  the baby boom retirements and Medicare and Social Security are right ahead. And  as you point out, interest rates are rising. So, debt-service costs, which had  been held down by the low level of interest rates, are going to rise as we go  forward.\n\nSo,  this is an issue that is going to be a significant one at some point in time. It’s  really not a market focus at all right now. It’s sort of surprising to me how  relaxed the financial markets are about the whole issue of fiscal sustainability.   It just doesn’t seem to be an issue that  people are concerned about. But ultimately, debt can’t grow faster than GDP  indefinitely. So, eventually, you’re going to have to get on a more sustainable  fiscal track. I have no idea when the market is really going to focus on that  point, but it seems to me that that’s something that’s relevant, not just in the  United States, but in a lot of other countries.\n\nAudience Member : Crypto-currencies: Is it a medium of exchange, is it a commodity, is it a roulette  wheel, or is it a tool?\n\nPresident Dudley : Time will tell. I’m not going to fixate too much about crypto-currencies,  except to say that a good medium of exchange has stable store of value. And it’s  also widely accepted as a medium of exchange. I personally think the U.S.  dollar has those attributes much more than the crypto-currencies that we see  outstanding.\n\nI  essentially feel like if the Federal Reserve does its job properly, and keeps  inflation at a lowest sustainable level, confidence in the dollar as a currency  will remain high. And the dollar will do just fine as a medium of exchange.\n\nIs  there a possibility down the road that central banks will get more involved in  offering digital currencies as a substitute for cash—for the actual physical  currency? I think that’s something that could happen potentially down the road,  and certainly central banks are thinking about that.\n\nSo  what do digital currencies mean for—would that be a more efficient medium of  exchange than cash? With cash, there’s danger that you could lose your cash. The  cash could get stolen. So maybe there are other forms of currency that might be  a better medium of exchange than cash. So I think that’s something that central  banks should be looking at. I think it’s a legitimate question.\n\nAudience Member : You spoke of the ethical unease among students. Do you think any of that may be  linked to the fact that there was not a single prosecution that arose out of  the financial crisis? Do you think one day we may look back and rue that even  more than perhaps some of us do now?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well, I’m not a lawyer, so I don’t have a good basis for judging what was  actually possible in terms of successful prosecution. The problem, of course,  is that doing dumb things is not against the law. Doing illegal things is, and so  the question is where is that line between just doing dumb things versus doing  illegal things.\n\nBut  I think that people that have broken the law should be prosecuted and held to  account. I absolutely agree with that. I’m just not a lawyer, so I can’t really  make a good judgment about whether the judicial branch of our government could have  been more effective in that realm. I just don’t know enough to give you a  really informed answer.\n\nAudience Member : I’m glad you brought up tech and disruption and potential massive unemployment  due to tech disruption of the workforce. The response to this has been the idea  of universal basic income. What is the feeling among policy makers of this  concept, and what are your personal opinions on how it might affect both the country’s  economy and the world economy?\n\nPresident Dudley : Well, before we get to the question of the basic income support, I’m not that  worried about technology eliminating all the jobs and us having no employment  opportunity—at least not in the near term. I mean, what percent of the U.S.  workforce was in agriculture 100 years ago—70, 80% of the workforce?\n\nAnd  now what percentage? It’s 1 or 2% of the workforce. It seems to me that there’s  always new things that come along, new things for people to, new services to provide.  So I’m not convinced at all that we’re on the cusp of this new thing. We’ve  been having this conversation about what’s going to come next for several  hundred years now. I’m just not convinced that all of a sudden there’s going to  be no job opportunities for anyone.\n\nIf  there aren’t job opportunities, presumably it’s going to be because we’re just  so incredibly productive and rich. And I suppose if we’re really in that  environment, where all the robots are doing everything, the robots are making  more robots, which are making more robots, that we’re going to actually have a  pretty high standard of living.\n\nAnd  so, I imagine in that regime we’re probably going to be able to afford  something like a minimum income support payment. Right now, to do it would be  very, very expensive, and I’m not really sure that people’s satisfaction in  life would necessarily be higher if they were given minimum income as a choice  versus being forced to seek out employment opportunities.\n\nThey  might in the short run think it’s better to just take the income stipend, but I  always wonder whether in the longer term, whether the quality of life and how  they experience life would actually be better in that kind of regime.\n\nI  think the big question, though, in the short run, is just the fiscal costs,  which would be pretty large. This is being debated in some smaller European  countries right now. I think that if it happens, they’re certainly going to go  first. I think the U.S. would be quite a bit further behind. And so I think for  the people who decide to go down this path, we’ll sort of see how it works, and  then we’ll learn more about how feasible this is in practice. And does it  generate the quality of life that the people hope it will.\n\nBecause  at the end of the day, that’s what we really care about, right? It’s people  having a good quality of life. And it may be that having a stipend improves your  quality of life. But it may be having a stipend doesn’t improve your quality of  life, because it makes your life empty and less fulfilling. So I think it’s an  experiment, and we’re going to have to see.\n\nAudience Member : My question is back on the fiscal side. This is of course an important month  ahead of us, with regard to tax policy. So, it’s sort of a two-part question: Do  you see a need for tax stimulus to the economy at the present moment, and if  you had your druthers and could design a tax policy that would encourage a  healthy growth in the U.S. economy, what would be a couple of key features of  it?\n\nPresident Dudley : I definitely am in favor of tax reform. I’d love to see the tax code  simplified. I’d love to see the base broadened. I’d love to see it much easier  to comply.\n\nMy  spouse does our tax returns every year. We don’t send them out to an accountant  or anybody. And I watch her slave through the tax returns, and I watch how much  time it takes to do the tax return. That can’t be efficient, it can’t be  productive. So I think a much simplified tax code with a broader tax base would  be very, very desirable. And I think that also applies to the corporate taxes.\n\nSo  I’m definitely in favor of tax reform. I’m not as in favor of tax stimulus at  the current time because the economy, as your question implies, doesn’t really  need that. So the tricky part, though, is what’s the trade-off between if I can  get tax reform, but it requires a bit of fiscal stimulus to develop the  consensus—is that a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nSo  I think that the devil is in the details. And so I think everybody has their  own view. We’ll see actually emerges from Congress. And everyone will have  their own view about is that trade-off a good trade-off, or not a good trade-off,  in terms of how much is done on the tax reform side versus how much is done on  the fiscal stimulus side.\n\nFiscal  stimulus—we don’t really need fiscal stimulus from an economic perspective. And  as a question before came up, we do have to worry about the long-term fiscal  sustainability of the U.S. But on the other hand, if there’s a price to pay to  get tax reform, maybe that price is worth paying. So I think you sort of have  to judge the whole package and whether you think those trade-offs are  appropriate or not.\n\nAudience Member : This somewhat relates to the previous question. What is your view of the  movement to increase the minimum wage or the living wage—however one wants to  define it—versus unemployment, versus, I don’t know, interest rates, whatever—it’s  kind of a triumvirate of factors.\n\nPresident Dudley : Well, I’ve been very clear for a long time in what I’m for in the minimum wage.  It’s very simple. I want the minimum wage set as a ratio to the median wage. And  none of this, minimum wage flat for X years, and then a debate about how big an  increase are we going to have.\n\nIf  you actually had a minimum wage indexed to some percentage of the median wage—and  what that percentage is a political decision that needs to be made by  politicians—then you actually would have better plans for businesses. They’d  know what the minimum wage was going to be over time—it was going to be X  percent of the median wage. And it would also be better for the minimum wage  earners, because rather than have a period of fallowness, where minimum wage is  stuck at a very low level for a long time, then all of a sudden the minimum  wage goes up a lot, they’d be compensated at a fairer proportion relative to  the median wage.\n\nSo  I think that’d be a much better improvement in the regime. The problem with  that proposal, of course, is the legislature gets to make that decision once. And  that may make it hard for people to reach agreement. I think it’s a political  decision, where you set that minimum wage relative to the median wage. Different  states could decide to set it at different attachment points. That’s a  political decision.\n\nCongress  is not very good about equity. Congress is very good about efficiencies. Telling  me that minimum wage should be 50% of the median wage or 45% of the median  wage, or 60% of the median wage—that’s really a political decision. Congress isn’t  going to do very well at telling you one is better than the other.\n\nNow  presumably, the higher the minimum wage is relative to the median wage, the  more there’s going to be a consequence in terms of unemployment. And so you’re  going to have to weigh how you’re going to pay that cost in terms of  unemployment for having a higher minimum wage.\n\nIt’s  not going to be free. There’s going to be a trade-off there, and you’re going  to have to decide where you want to set that trade-off. But indexing the  minimum wage to the median seems to be a definite improvement over the current  regime. Better for the minimum wage earner, and better for business in terms of  planning what their costs are going to be over time. It seems to me that it’s a  win-win for both sides.\n\nAudience Member : Bill, you’ve done an amazing job. It’s probably the system in terms of meeting  the mandates of full employment and price stability. But if you were to step  back as Berkeley economist and say what should the mandate be—if you had a  magic wand, what should the mandate be for the central bank?\n\nPresident Dudley : I’m not uncomfortable with the current mandate. I think the current mandate is  completely reasonable. First of all, it doesn’t really matter what I say. This  is something for Congress to decide, and the Federal Reserve is supposed to  carry out the mandate.\n\nSo  first thing is, it really doesn’t matter what I think. But I think the current  mandate has been really good. You want a little bit of inflation in the system  because that actually helps lubricate the wheels of the economy. It helps lead  to more efficient allocation of labor resources, because otherwise you have  less flexibility in the labor market.\n\nI  think George Akerlof and others have done work showing that maybe about 2%  inflation is probably better than zero percent inflation, just because it  allocates labor resources more efficiently. You also want to have a little bit  of inflation because you probably want to be a little bit off the—you want to  reduce the risk of the zero lower bound problem. So, I’m very comfortable with  2% inflation as a target.\n\nAudience Member : What about the full employment? President Dudley : I don’t think the two goals are inconsistent. I think if the Federal Reserve is  doing their job properly, the two goals are actually compatible with one  another. So if we go to maximum sustainable employment—and the important word  there is sustainable. Yes, you could drive the unemployment rate lower for a  short period of time, but that would generate inflation, and then the Federal  Reserve would have to slam on the brakes, and you’d be worse off than if you  actually stayed at a level of unemployment that was consistent with 2% inflation  over time. I think the two goals are very compatible with one another. I don’t  think there’s a huge tension between those two goals.\n\nPresident Dudley : I don’t think the two goals are inconsistent.

    "text": "Introduction to the New York Fed As many of you know, this is my first chance to speak at Cornell University since I became president of the New York Fed. So, by way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New York Fed is, what we do and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, and was created by Congress in 1913. With this act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the money supply—and designed it be decentralized, representative of all of America and independent of the political process. The Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 autonomous Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each Reserve Bank is autonomous, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made us independent so we can make decisions in the national interest free from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe FOMC meets in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy. As New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings and have a permanent vote. At these meetings, the 16 other members (the Board of Governors and the other Reserve Bank Presidents) and I each present our current outlook for the economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders. You may know that one of my councils, the Upstate New York Regional Advisory Board, is designed specifically to provide me with timely information from this area. In this way, decisions by the FOMC are continually informed by views gathered from all parts of the country, including Upstate New York.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. Let me tell you about some of them. We, alone, implement monetary policy. At the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world. Finally, I must mention that the New York Fed's district could be the most diverse in the System: ranging from the urban density of Manhattan to the forested sparseness of the northern Adirondacks, to the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. All in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nThe Crisis and Response Of course these are anything but normal times. The financial crisis that broke in mid-2007 and intensified dramatically following the failure of Lehman Brothers has been among the most virulent ever. And it was followed by the longest and one of the deepest recessions since World War II, called by many the \"Great Recession.\"\n\nThe Fed responded aggressively and creatively in an effort to pursue our dual mandate. Our actions fell into two broad buckets.\n\nFirst, we took steps to supply liquidity to the financial system, so that financial markets could continue to function properly and to enable households and businesses to maintain access to credit. Carrying out an age-old central banking role, we loaned funds to financial firms, secured against their high-quality collateral.\n\nTraditionally, such loans were only made to depository institutions, such as banks. Of course, the modern U.S. financial system includes many lenders that are not banks. These companies and markets provide vital financing for credit card loans, short-term business needs and many other activities. Many years ago, Congress gave the Fed the emergency authority to lend to nonbanks in \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\" During the crisis—in order to limit damage to the wider economy—we exercised this authority to lend to a wide variety of financial firms and markets.\n\nA handful of times, we made the difficult decision to make emergency loans to prevent the disorderly failure of particular firms. We did so not because we wanted to help the firms, but because allowing them to collapse in a disorderly fashion in the midst of a global crisis would have harmed households and business throughout the United States. All the Fed's loans were collateralized and we are confident they will be repaid in full.\n\nSecond, we took aggressive steps to ease monetary policy in order to support economic activity and employment. By the end of 2008 we reduced short-term interest rates to virtually zero—the lowest level in the history of the Fed. In order to provide still further support for the economy, we bought more than $1.5 trillion of long-term assets—principally mortgage bonds guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with the support of U.S. Treasury—between December 2008 and March 2010.\n\nWhen the Fed buys long-term assets, it pushes down long-term interest rates. This supports economic activity in a number of ways, including by making housing more affordable and boosting consumption in households that can refinance their mortgages at lower rates. In addition, low long-term rates reduce the cost of capital for businesses, thereby fostering more hiring and investment spending (on equipment, construction and machinery, for example) for any given economic outlook.\n\nNational Economic Conditions So where are we today? Let me start my discussion of economic conditions with a few comments about national economic conditions. As I discussed in a recent speech, the Great Recession has been followed by a tepid recovery. Since June 2009, economic activity has grown—but not robustly.\n\nIn recent months, the momentum has slowed. After rising at a 3.25 percent annual rate during the second half of 2009, real gross domestic product growth has slowed. With demand growth barely keeping pace with firms' ability to increase productivity, job creation has been too weak to significantly reduce unemployment, which stands today at 9.6 percent. And, as is typical in such circumstances of considerable slack, the rate of inflation has declined.\n\nWhy are we experiencing this soft patch now? There are several reasons:\n\nThe slow recovery of consumer spending and housing in the face of very substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus reflects the painful unwinding of the dynamics at work during the expansion that preceded it. Beginning around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in home prices. The rise in home prices helped support more borrowing as households used lines of credit and second mortgages to tap into their rising home equity. This also fueled a strong boom in home construction. But house price increases could not be sustained without limit. When home prices peaked and started to turn down, the dynamic linking house prices, credit and consumption went into reverse.\n\nLet's consider first what this means for consumption. Consumption of goods and services rose at a slow 2 percent annual rate over the first half of 2010 and with no sign of a rebound. Several factors are inhibiting families from spending, including: job or income losses, low confidence and declines in wealth as real estate and stock prices dipped. Households have been saving more and paying down their debts. Of course, lenders have also reinforced this tendency with tightened underwriting for credit relative to prerecession standards. Have households completed their deleveraging, so they will soon spend more? Although we believe that substantial progress has been made, it is hard to tell how much further this process has to run.\n\nNow, let's consider why housing market activity—both new construction and sales—remains depressed. One reason for this is that many existing homes stand vacant. We estimate that there are roughly 3 million vacant housing units more than usual. This stock of vacant homes will shrink when foreclosures fall and more empty homes are sold or rented out.\n\nOn the sales side, even though low mortgage interest rates and falling home prices have together boosted housing affordability to its highest level in 40 years, the current pace of sales is quite sluggish. Impediments to home sales include tight lending standards, a weak job market and continued uncertainty about home prices. Importantly, the large drop in home prices between 2006 and 2008 also reduced homeowner equity broadly, making it more difficult to \"trade-up\" and move into better homes.\n\nWith lower home prices, many families now owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. This means that they cannot refinance or sell their homes easily if they experience a crisis such as a job loss or a serious illness. Foreclosure completions are at an all-time high, although the initiation of new foreclosures may be finally slowing. Recently, attention has focused on cases where some of the documentation used in the foreclosure process may have been flawed. The Fed actively encourages efforts to find viable alternatives to foreclosure. Not many people know this, but a team of New York Fed officials work with mortgage counselors and community activists to support distressed homeowners, and our lawyers support legal aid programs for people facing foreclosure. At the same time, it is important that foreclosures that comply with the law can ultimately take place. This is a necessary part of returning the housing market to more normal conditions.\n\nAlong with two other agencies, the Fed is reviewing the foreclosure practices at the major bank mortgage servicers. We are also keeping an eye on banks' potential liabilities where they made representations about mortgages bought by investors that may not have been correct in all cases. We want to ensure that the housing finance business is supported by robust back-office operations—for processing of new mortgages as well as foreclosures—so that homebuyers and investors have full confidence in the process. We are monitoring developments closely in order to evaluate any potential impact on housing or financial markets and the overall economy.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Upstate New York Now let me turn to economic conditions in Upstate New York. It is no secret that this region has struggled with weak economic growth and population loss in recent decades. The region has experienced some very painful economic restructuring, particularly as it lost so many of its high- paying manufacturing jobs. Yet the process has yielded a productive and more diversified economy, with a larger service sector. For this and other reasons I will discuss, the Upstate New York economy has weathered the Great Recession relatively well.\n\nWhile the Upstate economy generally underperformed the nation during the 1980s and 1990s, its recent experience has been quite different. During the Great Recession, Upstate New York's job losses began later than they did for the United States as a whole, and those losses were generally less severe.\n\nThe relatively strong economic performance of the region of late is clearly tied to its stable housing markets. Upstate New York's relatively slow economic performance and lack of population growth during the expansion in the 2000s supported only modest increases in home prices and sales during the housing boom. When home prices and sales began to decline quite rapidly in many parts of the nation, they held steady across the region. As a result, Upstate New York has largely been spared the boom-and-bust cycle in housing that occurred in other parts of the country. In fact, many of Upstate New York's metropolitan areas even experienced home price appreciation during the housing bust, making these places among the best performing in the country during this period. Many parts of the country experienced severe housing busts, with sharp drops in housing-related activity (such as construction and purchases of major appliances). For example, in fast-growing places such as California and Florida, construction jobs grew to be a large share of employment, but the number of these jobs then plummeted during the recession. This dynamic did not occur in places like Ithaca, where the housing sector was small and thus, had few jobs to lose.\n\nAnother part of the story is that homeowners in Upstate New York did not take on as much debt, and households have been less strained here than elsewhere. One reason is that home prices did not appreciate rapidly here, so homes remained affordable. Moreover, there was generally lower penetration of risky nonprime loans into the region's housing markets. So, Upstate New York's home loans have generally performed better than elsewhere in the country, with fewer delinquencies and foreclosures. Indeed, much of the region was spared the worst effects of the nonprime mortgage boom and bust.\n\nThus, compared with other parts of the nation, the Upstate economy has performed well over the past few years. As a large and growing sector, local colleges and universities have surely contributed to the region's economic stability over the past few years. Indeed, Cornell provides a clear example of how a university can play a key role in its local economy. The benefits of the higher education industry go beyond their direct economic contributions, such as employment and spending, for a very important reason: they can increase a region's stock of human capital—that is, the total supply of knowledge and skills in its workforce.\n\nA region's human capital contributes to its economic success and resiliency. The educational activities of a region's colleges and universities help build the skills of the local workforce. In addition, the knowledge created by colleges and universities through research activities can play a key role in starting and supporting local businesses. Businesses can use university expertise, infrastructure and research findings to help them develop cutting edge products and services. Furthermore, universities often employ local businesses to develop and commercialize products that arise from their research activities. This dynamic can expand local economic activity and consequently create new jobs for high-skilled workers in a region.\n\nThese dynamics are clearly visible in Ithaca, where a large number of local companies—in industries ranging from information technology to medical equipment to agriculture—are closely tied to Cornell. Many of these companies were started by Cornell's faculty and students and have remained in the local economy to stay connected to the university. Other companies have been attracted to the region because of the access afforded to specific knowledge or new products and processes invented at Cornell. Higher education institutions such as Cornell play a vital role in upstate New York's economy.\n\nThe relative stability of the higher education industry has, not surprisingly, contributed to a strong economic performance in recent years. Ithaca's housing market is among the healthiest in the state, and it has experienced relatively strong employment growth during and since Great Recession. Indeed, unlike most of its Upstate peers, Ithaca has gained population throughout the past decade.\n\nWhat Is the Fed Doing Now? Since the beginning of the downturn, the Fed has actively used monetary and regulatory policy to help support economic activity and improve economic outcomes—here in Ithaca and across the nation—relative to what would have happened in the absence of this support.\n\nWith regard to monetary policy, the Fed has in place a highly accommodative stance. The FOMC has said that it will keep short term interest rates at exceptionally low levels for an extended period of time. The Fed also retains large amounts of mortgage-backed bonds acquired in order to support the housing market and help bring down mortgage and other long-term interest rates to the historically low rates in place today.\n\nThe FOMC and the Chairman have stated their commitment to take further actions to bring interest rates down further should economic conditions warrant. In a recent speech, I said that both the current levels of unemployment and inflation and the timeframe over which they are likely to return to levels consistent with our mandate are unacceptable. I said that I thought further Fed action was likely to be warranted unless the economic outlook were to evolve in a way that made me more confident we would see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before too long.\n\nTurning to regulatory policy, the biggest lesson of the financial crisis is that severe financial disruptions can inflict very large and persistent costs on people's lives and jobs. Over the past year, with Fed leadership and support, important new regulatory initiatives have been advanced to create a global financial system where the players cannot slide back into the risky \"business as usual\" that created this crisis. These include the recent agreement with international bank regulators (sometimes called \"Basel III\") to impose stricter standards for globally active banks and the considerable regulatory changes embodied in the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThese measures recognize that to avert or contain future financial crises, we need a financial system that can withstand large negative shocks. First, market participants must not have incentives to take excessive risks. Instead, incentives should reward actions that support economic growth and financial stability. And financial firms must set aside enough capital and liquidity so that when things go wrong they can absorb losses with their own resources. Finally, if these buffers prove inadequate and a financial firm veers toward failure, the official sector needs the tools to wind them down in an orderly manner without having to make the terrible choice between a chaotic failure that harms the whole economy and a taxpayer-funded rescue.\n\nConclusion I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about how my job at the New York Fed ties in with your lives and work here in Upstate New York. The links are many, including\n\nTo summarize conditions at the moment: after a recession that was milder in Upstate New York than in many parts of the country, the region is showing signs of a modest recovery. A more diversified, more knowledge-based economy and a relatively small housing sector helped to limit the recession's impact on many communities. Nevertheless, the Great Recession spread much pain throughout this region and unemployment remains much higher than we would like.\n\nThe Fed cannot wave a magic wand and make the problems remaining from the preceding period of excess vanish immediately. But we can provide essential support for the needed adjustments. Even with our best efforts, the road to full recovery here in Upstate New York and across the nation is likely to be long and bumpy. But I am confident that we will make it. And, the dynamism that is represented in this room—the private sector combined with academic learning and research—will provide a strong underpinning for future prosperity.",

    "text": "Good morning.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to open this workshop and discuss key developments in the tri-party repo market.  In my remarks, I would like to give a brief overview of some of the problems that surfaced in this market during the financial crisis of 2008, recognize the improvements that have occurred since then, and most importantly, highlight significant vulnerabilities that still persist despite the progress we have made.  While we can feel proud of the enhancements that are currently underway in the tri-party repo market, today I want to underscore the fact that significant work remains to be done.\n\nThe tri-party repo market constitutes a vital component of the U.S. financial system.  It plays an important role in providing financing for broker-dealers that make markets in Treasury and agency securities, and is an important mechanism that supports dealer intermediation of credit.  The market also provides a secure investment vehicle for those that manage large amounts of liquidity and need an investment vehicle to park these monies.  We care about the health and stability of the tri-party repo market both because of our interest in promoting stable and liquid financial markets and because we use it to implement monetary policy.\n\nThe recent financial crisis showed us that the tri-party repo market was inherently unstable due to deficiencies in the settlement infrastructure.   Prior to 2008, there was limited recognition of the ways in which adverse developments in this market could quickly transmit risk to other parts of the financial system with unforeseen consequences.  We now know, with the benefit of hindsight, that the market was overly reliant on massive extensions of intraday credit by the clearing banks to the broker-dealers, that market participants did not adequately appreciate the magnitude of the risk embedded in the role played by the clearing banks, and, as a result, market participants underpriced risk in ways that undermined the market’s resiliency during periods of stress.\n\nThese vulnerabilities were made apparent in the spring of 2008 when the events surrounding Bear Stearns demonstrated the run risk that existed more broadly in the tri-party repo market, prompting the Federal Reserve to intervene in order to restore confidence and market functioning. This intervention took the form of the creation of a Primary Dealer Credit Facility in March 2008, and a subsequent expansion of the facility in September 2008.  The scope and scale of the market disruption were clearly very troublesome.\n\nAs many of you are aware, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published a white paper in May 2010 that highlighted three critical sources of instability associated with practices in the tri-party repo market:  (1) the market’s excessive reliance on intraday credit from the clearing banks; (2) weaknesses in the liquidity and credit risk management practices of cash lenders and clearing banks that left them vulnerable to stress environments; and (3) the lack of a mechanism or process for liquidating collateral during periods of stress in a manner that did not destabilize other segments of the financial system.\n\nAfter the crisis, we asked the industry to help develop a plan to reengineer the tri-party repo settlement infrastructure to mitigate these risks.  The industry responded by identifying key changes that could be made to the platform to eliminate market reliance on intraday credit, thereby removing a key source of fragility observed in 2008.   This process was challenging at times, and ultimately required our intervention as a supervisor to move forward.  But the industry successfully developed a roadmap for reform that is the basis for the changes now being implemented.  The clearing banks are making substantial investments to reengineer their tri-party repo settlement processes, while lenders and borrowers are making adjustments to their business practices and technologies to ensure they are ready for changes that are occurring in the market.  When completed at the end of next year, we expect that these changes will substantially improve the stability of the market.  Indeed, the work completed to date has already reduced the amount of activity being financed on an intraday basis from 100 percent to about 70 percent, and we project that intraday credit usage will decline to no more than 10 percent by the end of next year.  By removing the clearing bank from the role of substantial intraday lender, and making tri-party repurchase exposures truly bilateral, we expect that market participants will have better incentives to manage their liquidity and credit risks more prudently.\n\nWhile these changes represent positive developments that will enhance the stability of the tri-party repo market, an important challenge remains.  Current reforms do not address the risk that a dealer’s loss of access to tri-party repo funding could precipitate destabilizing asset fire sales, whether by the dealer itself, or by the dealer’s creditors following a default.  Industry participants have yet to fully embrace the role they must play in finding a solution to this problem.  As a result, I would urge industry participants to begin work on this issue without further delay.  In fact, this is one of the motivations for convening today’s workshop—to start the dialogue.\n\nAs several of the speakers will discuss in greater detail today, when fire sales occur they can undermine the stability of other markets beyond the tri-party repo market.  The transmission of instability typically occurs as a consequence of increased margin calls and mark-to-market losses that strain firms’ liquidity and capital positions and put additional pressure on firms to further deleverage.  Such scenarios can have material adverse repercussions on other market segments and market participants.\n\nIt is vital that we take steps to address this risk now, during a period when markets are functioning without stress, in order to improve the resiliency of this market before the next crisis occurs.  This is especially important in light of the heightened threshold established by the Dodd-Frank Act for future central bank interventions in the event of a market disruption.  Even if this constraint did not exist, the experience of the recent financial crisis has served to strengthen our resolve to ensure that the market is structured in a way where risk is accurately priced and resilient to stress on a day-to-day basis, without the need for official sector intervention as a first resort.\n\nAs many of you know, the Federal Reserve has been calling for action on this issue over the past two years, and all three Financial Stability Oversight Council annual reports have highlighted this as a significant issue worthy of our attention.  However, the diversity of participants in the tri-party repo market has made it difficult to move forward quickly with a market solution that addresses the risk I have outlined.  Industry leadership is absolutely critical to overcoming these challenges.  If industry is unable to play its role in achieving a holistic solution, regulators may find themselves forced to employ the specific policy tools at their disposal in their respective purviews to address the fire sale risk.  While such an approach may indeed enhance the overall stability of this market, it could also lead to unintended consequences that include reducing the efficacy of the critical role played by this market in supporting the broader financial system.\n\nI am glad that you are all here today to work with us to begin to identify the best solutions to the problem of fire sale risk in the context of the tri-party repo market.  I urge you to participate actively and express your ideas candidly.  I am confident that we will come up with the best solution to this problem by working together.",

    "text": "Good morning and welcome once again to the New York Fed’s Regional Economic Press Briefing.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with the journalists covering our region—and through you to the people in our District.  This morning I will briefly discuss conditions in the national economy and then focus on regional economic conditions, with particular attention to the question of whether recent college graduates are finding good jobs.  We will examine the trends and see how they are playing out in the region.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nI would like to begin by taking stock of where we are at the moment.  Then I will address my expectations for the performance of the economy over the remainder of 2013 and into 2014.\n\nSince the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009, we have had 15 consecutive quarters of positive growth of real GDP.  However, the average annual growth rate over that period has been just 2.1 percent.   Although the unemployment rate has declined by 2.5 percentage points from its peak of 10 percent in October of 2009, much of this decline is due to the fact that the labor force participation rate has fallen by 1.5 percentage points over this period.  Recall that discouraged workers who do not actively look for work are regarded as not participating in the labor force and so are not counted as unemployed even though they are without jobs. Using an alternative measure, the employment to population ratio, which is not influenced by changes in the number of discouraged workers, there has been limited improvement in labor market conditions.  Job loss rates have fallen, but hiring rates remain depressed at low levels.  Taken together, the labor market still cannot be regarded as healthy.  Numerous indicators, including the behavior of labor compensation and household assessments of labor market conditions, are all consistent with the view that there remains a great deal of slack in the economy.\n\nThat being said, I see persuasive evidence of improved underlying fundamentals for much of the private sector of the U.S. economy.  Key measures of household leverage have declined and are now at the lowest levels they have been in well over a decade.  Household net worth, expressed as a percent of disposable income, has increased back to its average of the previous decade, reflecting rising equity and home prices and declining liabilities.  Banks are beginning to ease credit standards somewhat after a prolonged period of tightness.  As a result, we are now experiencing a fairly typical cyclical recovery of consumer spending on durable goods.  For example, light-weight motor vehicles sold at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 15.3 million in May, not far from the 16.1 million sales in 2007.\n\nSimilarly, after five years in which housing production was well below what is consistent with underlying demographic trends, it now appears that we have worked off the excess supply of housing built up during the boom years of the last decade.  Housing starts and sales are now on a clear upward trend, and a widely followed national home price index is up around 12 percent over the twelve months ending in April. 1 Indeed, anecdotal reports suggest that this higher-than-expected increase in home prices is due to a lack of homes for sale.\n\nUnfortunately, the improvements in consumer spending on durable goods and housing are not yet showing through in the overall GDP growth rate due to the significant headwinds that we continue to face.  First, federal fiscal policy has recently become quite contractionary.  Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicate that this fiscal restraint is on the order of 1.75 percentage points of potential GDP this year.  In the period since 1960, there have been only two previous episodes of fiscal contraction of this order of magnitude—1969 and 1987—both of which occurred when the economy was on a more solid footing than it is today.  Second, the euro area is experiencing a protracted recession and growth in many of the largest emerging economies has slowed. This has resulted in a very sharp slowing of U.S. exports, with an associated slowing in production and employment growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector.\n\nThus, I continue to see the economy as being in a tug-of-war between fiscal drag and underlying fundamental improvement, with a great deal of uncertainty over which force will prevail in the near-term.  This tug-of-war is clearly seen in the monthly employment data.  Over April and May, the average monthly gain in employment in the private service-providing sector has been well maintained at 175,000. In contrast, employment in the manufacturing sector and the federal government declined a combined 20,000 per month.  And the resulting uncertainty is, I believe, an important contributing factor behind the relatively sluggish pace of business investment spending.\n\nMy best guess is that growth for all of 2013, measured on a Q4/Q4 basis, will be about what it has been since the end of the recession. But I believe a strong case can be made that the pace of growth will pick up notably in 2014.  The private sector of the economy should continue to heal, while the amount of fiscal drag will begin to subside.  I also see some indications that growth prospects among our major trading partners have begun to improve; for example, the rise in the June euro area composite Purchasing Managers’ Index.  And this combination of events is likely to create an environment in which business investment spending will gather strength.\n\nFinally, I believe this tug-of-war analogy is useful in explaining the recent inflation dynamics.  As is well known, total inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, has slowed sharply over the past year and is now running below the FOMC’s expressed goal of 2 percent.  Much of the slowing of total inflation is due to declining energy prices resulting from the weakening of global growth mentioned earlier combined with increased energy production here in the U.S.  However, it is also the case that core inflation, that is, excluding food and energy, has slowed sharply as well.   A decomposition of the slowing in core inflation reveals that some of it is due to slowing in the rate of increase in prices of non-food and non-energy goods.  This probably is due in large part to the softening of global demand for goods and the modest appreciation of the dollar that has occurred since mid-2011.\n\nIn the service sector, the rate of increase in prices of medical services and “non-market” services—the latter includes some financial services—also has slowed notably recently.  In contrast, the rate of increase in prices for other non-energy services has been relatively stable.  Comparing this set of conditions to that in 2010, the recent slowing of inflation has been less widespread across core goods and core services, and inflation expectations so far have declined less appreciably than they did in 2010. Thus, my best guess is that core goods prices will begin to firm in the months ahead as global demand begins to strengthen and inventories get into better alignment with sales.\n\nAs is always the case, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding this forecast. Moreover, there is always the possibility of some unforeseen shock. Thus, we will be monitoring U.S. and global economic conditions very carefully and will adjust our views on the likely path for growth, inflation and the unemployment rate accordingly in response to new information.\n\nAt its meeting last week, the FOMC decided to continue its accommodative policy stance.  It reaffirmed its expectation that the current low range for the federal funds rate target will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent, so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well-behaved.  It is important to remember that these conditions are thresholds, not triggers.  The FOMC also maintained its purchases of $40 billion per month in agency MBS and $45 billion per month in Treasury securities, with a stated goal of promoting a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook in a context of price stability.\n\nIn its statement, the FOMC said that it may vary the pace of purchases as economic conditions evolve.  As Chairman Bernanke stated in his press conference following the FOMC meeting, if the economic data over the next year turn out to be broadly consistent with the outlooks that the FOMC sees as most likely, which are roughly similar to the outlook I have already laid out, the FOMC anticipates that it would be appropriate to begin to moderate the pace of purchases later this year.  Under such a scenario, subsequent reductions might occur in measured steps through the first half of next year, and an end to purchases around mid-2014.  Under this scenario, at the time that asset purchases came to an end, the unemployment rate likely would be near 7 percent and the economy’s momentum strengthening, supporting further robust job gains in the future.\n\nHere, a few points deserve emphasis.   First, the FOMC’s policy depends on the progress we make towards our objectives.  This means that the policy—including the pace of asset purchases—depends on the outlook rather than the calendar.  The scenario I outlined above is only that—one possible outcome.  Economic circumstances could diverge significantly from the FOMC’s expectations.  If labor market conditions and the economy’s growth momentum were to be less favorable than in the FOMC’s outlook—and this is what has happened in recent years—I would expect that the asset purchases would continue at a higher pace for longer.\n\nSecond, even if this scenario were to occur and the pace of purchases were reduced, it would still be the case that as long as the FOMC continues its asset purchases it is adding monetary policy accommodation, not tightening monetary policy.  As the FOMC adds to its stock of securities, this should continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, making monetary policy more accommodative.\n\nThird, the Federal Reserve is likely to keep most of these assets on its balance sheet for a long time.  As Chairman Bernanke noted in his press conference last week, a strong majority of FOMC participants no longer favor selling agency MBS securities during the monetary policy normalization process.  This implies a bigger balance sheet for longer, which provides additional accommodation today and continuing support for mortgage markets going forward.\n\nFourth, even under this scenario, a rise in short-term rates is very likely to be a long way off.  Not only will it likely take considerable time to reach the FOMC’s 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold, but also the FOMC could wait considerably longer before raising short-term rates.  The fact that inflation is coming in well below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective is relevant here.  Most FOMC participants currently do not expect short-term rates to begin to rise until 2015.\n\nSome commentators have interpreted the recent shift in the market-implied path of short-term interest rates as indicating that market participants now expect the first increases in the federal funds rate target to come much earlier than previously thought.  Setting aside whether this is the correct interpretation of recent price moves, let me emphasize that such an expectation would be quite out of sync with both FOMC statements and the expectations of most FOMC participants.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nLet me turn now to the regional economy, the focus of our presentations today.  Our last briefing on the regional economy took place at a difficult time—soon after Superstorm Sandy.  While economic life has returned to normal across most of the metro area, some of the hardest-hit areas are still struggling to recover and rebuild.  Just blocks from here, in fact, the South Street Seaport business district is still far from business-as-usual.  And there are many such neighborhoods across the metropolitan region, from the low-lying and coastal areas of New Jersey to Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island; from Staten Island to southern Connecticut.  One encouraging sign, though, is that our broader regional economy has shown remarkable resilience.  It has been growing and adding jobs at a reasonably good pace.  Moreover, the rebuilding effort appears to be giving a bit of a boost to the job market in industries such as construction.\n\nAs we’ve discussed before, the New York Fed produces economic activity indexes to help monitor the performance of New York State, New York City and New Jersey.  Based on these measures, New York City has continued to grow strongly, and New Jersey’s economy has seen some pickup in growth since the beginning of this year.  However, growth in New York State has slowed, and Puerto Rico’s economy is not faring well at all; the activity index produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico shows that the Island’s economy has yet to show any signs of bottoming out.\n\nThe job situation has varied somewhat across our region.  Improvement has generally been broad-based, with New York City and Long Island doing particularly well, though Puerto Rico continues to weaken.  Both Connecticut and New Jersey have recently been growing roughly in line with the nation thus far in 2013.  Unemployment rates across the region are roughly matching the national rate, with the exception of the relatively high rate that has characterized Puerto Rico’s labor market for some time.  Housing continues to be a focus of our regional monitoring efforts and home prices in our region appear to have bottomed.  Our economists will elaborate on these points this morning.\n\nAre Recent College Graduates Finding Good Jobs?\n\nThe special topic of today’s press briefing is a look at how well recent college graduates are faring in the job market, both nationally and here in our region. A college education represents an important investment in one’s human capital , meaning the knowledge and skills people build. Historically, it’s been pretty clear that those who’ve invested in a college education have tended to earn a sizeable economic return. And the benefits of college-educated citizens go well beyond the individual. Regions with a higher concentration of college graduates tend to be more innovative, have higher living standards and experience more rapid economic growth. 2 So a college education plays an important role in helping individuals prosper, as well as in strengthening the broader economy.\n\nMore recently, though, rising costs, increasing student debt and widespread reports of recent college graduates not being able to find good jobs have raised some troubling questions about whether going to college is still a good investment. In fact, some of our own research, including material that we discussed at our last press briefing, has shown the dramatic increase in student debt over the past decade. 3 In today’s briefing, we’re going to take a close look at the question of just how weak today’s labor market is for new college graduates by putting their recent experience into context using some hard data.\n\nIt is important for us to undertake this kind of analysis because, as we’ll show, newly minted graduates always take some time to transition into the labor market and find jobs that utilize their education. And young people with college degrees still fare far better than those without. At the same time, with the sluggish jobs recovery from the recession, it’s clear that the transition of recent graduates into the labor market is taking longer, and they’ve experienced higher unemployment and higher underemployment than in years past. 4 Still, while times have gotten tougher for recent graduates, we shouldn’t be too hasty in concluding that getting a college education won’t help people find good jobs.\n\nI will now ask Jason Bram to present an update of economic conditions in our region.\n\n1 CoreLogic Report Shows Home Prices Rise by 12.1 Percent Year Over Year in April\n\n2 See, for example, Edward L.

    "text": "Good afternoon.  I am pleased to be here with the Business Council of Fairfield County.  I am told that your meetings are very inclusive—that you routinely invite education professionals, executives of local not-for-profit agencies and community leaders as well as business leaders.  In doing so, you assemble the type of broad Main Street audience that I most enjoy addressing. So, thank you for inviting me here today.\n\nToday I want to talk a bit about the outlook for the nation and the region.  As many of you know, I was scheduled to speak at this forum on October 29 of last year but that meeting had to be postponed because of the arrival of Superstorm Sandy which hit on that very day.  The region covered by the New York Fed was at the center of the storm, and Fairfield County, as well as parts of the Connecticut shoreline suffered extensive damage.\n\nImmediately following the storm, our Regional and Community Outreach function worked with all of the affected areas as part of a needs assessment.  We asked: \"How can the New York Fed best leverage our resources to help our community?”  We heard that it could be challenging to find key recovery information and advice online. So we pulled key resources under one roof—or I should say under one URL.  We developed our Sandy Information Center with the best information we could find for residents and businesses impacted by Sandy—including key deadlines along with expert legal, finance and insurance guidance.\n\nConditions are not entirely back to normal, and restoration and repair activities continue in a number of hard-hit neighborhoods.  Connecticut, along with New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Rhode Island, have been appropriated federal funding for relief efforts and this should help move the area’s recovery forward. I am confident that these areas will recover over the course of the year.  The legislation also contains funding for helping coastal communities to prepare to weather future storms better.\n\nMy meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy.  Let me offer a few examples from this trip.  Yesterday evening I met with some of Stamford’s business leaders to discuss the local state of economic and business conditions.  This morning I met with Mayor Finch and key economic development staff to discuss Bridgeport’s redevelopment initiatives. Local efforts such as these and your business council are essential complements to the Fed’s support for economic recovery. I applaud the efforts of state and local governments and community leaders to bolster the recovery in Bridgeport, Stamford and elsewhere in the district.\n\nI also met with Joan Carty from the Connecticut Housing Development Fund. We discussed innovative approaches for addressing the foreclosure crisis here and across the state. Housing has been a major impediment to a more rapid economic recovery and we at the Fed have been working hard to help homeowners and the overall housing market recover.  Afterwards, I spoke with small business leaders about the opportunities and challenges they are facing today.  I traveled to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation with several goals in mind.  I wanted to learn how sequestration was affecting ground-level operations, to understand the local and regional economic impact of Sikorsky, and to view state-of-the-art manufacturing at work.\n\nAfter this program, I will be meeting with Joseph Carbone of The Workplace to discuss best practices and emerging approaches to workforce development, particularly his innovative program for the long-term unemployed which I understand he is piloting in five different cities across the nation.  At the end of the day I will be meeting with University of Connecticut (UConn) Stamford campus staff, your own executive director Chris Bruhl and other officials to learn about the ecosystem that is being created to spur further economic development locally.  I’ll end the day with a meeting with Governor Malloy to better understand the complex issues and opportunities facing the state.\n\nThe agenda for these visits is always packed, but that’s part of the point—to meet with a diverse array of representatives in order to get a comprehensive picture of what’s happening on Main Street and its interaction with state and national developments.  At the end of my talk I will be happy to answer any questions you have about the economic outlook from my perspective.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nI would like to begin by taking stock of where we are at the moment.  Then I will address my expectations for the performance of the economy over the remainder of 2013 and into 2014.\n\nSince the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009, we have had 15 consecutive quarters of positive growth of real GDP.  However, the average annual growth rate over that period has been just 2.1 percent.  Although the unemployment rate has declined by 2.5 percentage points from its peak of 10 percent in October of 2009, much of this decline is due to the fact that the labor force participation rate has fallen by 1.5 percentage points over this period.  Recall that discouraged workers who do not actively look for work are regarded as not participating in the labor force and so are not counted as unemployed even though they are without jobs. Using an alternative measure, the employment to population ratio, which is not influenced by changes in the number of discouraged workers, there has been limited improvement in labor market conditions.  Job loss rates have fallen, but hiring rates remain depressed at low levels.  Taken together, the labor market still cannot be regarded as healthy.  Numerous indicators, including the behavior of labor compensation and household assessments of labor market conditions, are all consistent with the view that there remains a great deal of slack in the economy.\n\nThat being said, I see persuasive evidence of improved underlying fundamentals for much of the private sector of the U.S. economy.  Key measures of household leverage have declined and are now at the lowest levels they have been in well over a decade.  Household net worth, expressed as a percent of disposable income, has increased back to its average of the previous decade, reflecting rising equity and home prices and declining liabilities.  Banks are beginning to ease credit standards somewhat after a prolonged period of tightness.  As a result, we are now experiencing a fairly typical cyclical recovery of consumer spending on durable goods.  For example, light-weight motor vehicles sold at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 15.3 million in May, not far from the 16.1 million sales in 2007.\n\nSimilarly, after five years in which housing production was well below what is consistent with underlying demographic trends, it now appears that we have worked off the excess supply of housing built up during the boom years of the last decade.  Housing starts and sales are now on a clear upward trend, and a widely followed national home price index is up around 12 percent over the twelve months ending in April. 1 Indeed, anecdotal reports suggest that this higher-than-expected increase in home prices is due to a lack of homes for sale.\n\nUnfortunately, the improvements in consumer spending on durable goods and housing are not yet showing through in the overall GDP growth rate due to the significant headwinds that we continue to face.  First, federal fiscal policy has recently become quite contractionary.  Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) indicate that this fiscal restraint is on the order of 1.75 percentage points of potential GDP this year.  In the period since 1960, there have been only two previous episodes of fiscal contraction of this order of magnitude—1969 and 1987—both of which occurred when the economy was on a more solid footing than it is today.  Second, the euro area is experiencing a protracted recession and growth in many of the largest emerging economies has slowed. This has resulted in a very sharp slowing of U.S. exports, with an associated slowing in production and employment growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector.\n\nThus, I continue to see the economy as being in a tug-of-war between fiscal drag and underlying fundamental improvement, with a great deal of uncertainty over which force will prevail in the near-term.  This tug-of-war is clearly seen in the monthly employment data.  Over April and May, the average monthly gain in employment in the private service-providing sector has been well maintained at 175,000. In contrast, employment in the manufacturing sector and the federal government declined a combined 20,000 per month.  And the resulting uncertainty is, I believe, an important contributing factor behind the relatively sluggish pace of business investment spending.\n\nMy best guess is that growth for all of 2013, measured on a Q4/Q4 basis, will be about what it has been since the end of the recession. But I believe a strong case can be made that the pace of growth will pick up notably in 2014.  The private sector of the economy should continue to heal, while the amount of fiscal drag will begin to subside.  I also see some indications that growth prospects among our major trading partners have begun to improve; for example, the rise in the June euro area composite Purchasing Managers’ Index.  And this combination of events is likely to create an environment in which business investment spending will gather strength.\n\nFinally, I believe this tug-of-war analogy is useful in explaining the recent inflation dynamics.  As is well known, total inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, has slowed sharply over the past year and is now running below the FOMC’s expressed goal of 2 percent.   Softness in energy prices, resulting from the weakening of global growth mentioned earlier combined with increased energy production here in the U.S. has contributed to the slowing of total inflation.  However, it is also the case that core inflation, that is, excluding food and energy, has slowed sharply as well.   A decomposition of core inflation reveals that some of the decline is due to slowing in the rate of increase in prices of non-food and non-energy goods.  This probably is due in large part to the softening of global demand for goods and the modest appreciation of the dollar that has occurred since mid-2011.\n\nIn the service sector, the rate of increase in prices of medical services and “non-market” services—the latter includes some financial services—also has slowed notably recently.  In contrast, the rate of increase in prices for other non-energy services has been relatively stable.  Comparing this set of conditions to that in 2010, the recent slowing of inflation has been less widespread across core goods and core services, and inflation expectations so far have declined less appreciably than they did in 2010. Thus, my best guess is that core goods prices will begin to firm in the months ahead as global demand begins to strengthen and inventories get into better alignment with sales.\n\nAs is always the case, there is substantial uncertainty surrounding this forecast. Moreover, there is always the possibility of some unforeseen shock. Thus, we will be monitoring U.S. and global economic conditions very carefully and will adjust our views on the likely path for growth, inflation and the unemployment rate accordingly in response to new information.\n\nAt its recent meeting, the FOMC decided to continue its accommodative policy stance.  It reaffirmed its expectation that the current low range for the federal funds rate target will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent, so long as inflation and inflation expectations remain well-behaved.  It is important to remember that these conditions are thresholds, not triggers.  The FOMC also maintained its purchases of $40 billion per month in agency MBS and $45 billion per month in Treasury securities, with a stated goal of promoting a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook in a context of price stability.\n\nIn its statement, the FOMC said that it may vary the pace of purchases as economic conditions evolve.  As Chairman Bernanke stated in his press conference following the FOMC meeting, if the economic data over the next year turn out to be broadly consistent with the outlooks that the FOMC sees as most likely, which are roughly similar to the outlook I have already laid out, the FOMC anticipates that it would be appropriate to begin to moderate the pace of purchases later this year.  Under such a scenario, subsequent reductions might occur in measured steps through the first half of next year, and an end to purchases around mid-2014.  Under this scenario, at the time that asset purchases came to an end, the unemployment rate likely would be near 7 percent and the economy’s momentum strengthening, supporting further robust job gains in the future.\n\nAs I noted last week in our regional press briefing, a few points deserve emphasis.   First, the FOMC’s policy depends on the progress we make towards our objectives.  This means that the policy—including the pace of asset purchases—depends on the outlook rather than the calendar.  The scenario I outlined above is only that—one possible outcome.  Economic circumstances could diverge significantly from the FOMC’s expectations.  If labor market conditions and the economy’s growth momentum were to be less favorable than in the FOMC’s outlook—and this is what has happened in recent years—I would expect that the asset purchases would continue at a higher pace for longer.\n\nSecond, even if this scenario were to occur and the pace of purchases were reduced, it would still be the case that as long as the FOMC continues its asset purchases it is adding monetary policy accommodation, not tightening monetary policy.  As the FOMC adds to its stock of securities, this should continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, making monetary policy more accommodative.\n\nThird, the Federal Reserve is likely to keep most of these assets on its balance sheet for a long time.  As Chairman Bernanke noted in his most recent press conference, a strong majority of FOMC participants no longer favor selling agency MBS securities during the monetary policy normalization process.  This implies a bigger balance sheet for longer, which provides additional accommodation today and continuing support for mortgage markets going forward.\n\nFourth, even under this scenario, a rise in short-term rates is very likely to be a long way off.  Not only will it likely take considerable time to reach the FOMC’s 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold, but also the FOMC could wait considerably longer before raising short-term rates.  The fact that inflation is coming in well below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective is relevant here.  Most FOMC participants currently do not expect short-term rates to begin to rise until 2015.\n\nTo reiterate what I said last week, some commentators have interpreted the recent shift in the market-implied path of short-term interest rates as indicating that market participants now expect the first increases in the federal funds rate target to come much earlier than previously thought.  Setting aside whether this is the correct interpretation of recent price moves, let me emphasize that such an expectation would be quite out of sync with both FOMC statements and the expectations of most FOMC participants.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nTurning to the regional economy, my colleagues and I at the New York Fed continually track conditions in our District, and we have a number of tools we use for that purpose.\n\nTo promote growth in our local communities, we publish extensive data and analysis on the local economy.  We provide outreach initiatives, such as our workshops on access to global markets to help small businesses learn about loan programs and sources of credit enhancements. We also run an annual video festival for college students in the Second District.  In this program student teams produce videos aimed to help young adults make sound personal financial decisions. A panel of advertising and video professionals selects winning video productions for screening in local movie theaters.\n\nAs you know, even states as wealthy as Connecticut have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some of our work specifically to low- and moderate-income groups.\n\nWe have worked hard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates.  This work is important obviously because foreclosures are a terrible event for those who lose their homes.  But beyond that, this work is important because high levels of foreclosures affect neighbors’ home values, the local tax base and economic vitality more broadly. We have provided housing counselors and community groups with the latest information on mortgage conditions via mortgage briefs, roundtables, presentations and an interactive web tool that shows very local monthly delinquency and foreclosure conditions. This past fall we hosted a conference on distressed residential real estate to share new expert analysis with senior policymakers and practitioners from across the nation.  Your new Commissioner of Housing—whom I note, formerly worked at the New York Fed—attended that conference.\n\nWe also conduct a periodic poll about the credit needs of small businesses, which are an important source of new jobs in the District.  If you represent a small business and would like to participate in our next poll, please pass your business card to my colleagues, who are in the audience, or see me after the speech.  And if your business is somewhat larger, I urge you to consider becoming one of our business contacts—just indicate your interest to us on your business card.\n\nSo how is the region doing?  I want to begin by pointing out that Fairfield County has a number of strengths, beginning with a highly-educated workforce:  Two in five adults in the county hold a college degree, nearly twice the nationwide average.  It also has an array of fine educational institutions, including Fairfield University, UConn Stamford, the University of Bridgeport, Sacred Heart University, Western Connecticut State University, Housatonic Community College and Norwalk Community College.\n\nThe industry mix here is quite diverse, with a good representation of jobs in the high-paying finance sector.  In fact, roughly 35,000 jobs in the county, about 9 percent of total employment, are in the finance and insurance industry, a share almost twice as large as in the nation and even slightly higher than in New York City.  Although the sector has shed jobs over the past two years, it remains an important and valuable component of the local economy.  There are also numerous corporate headquarters in the county and a notable manufacturing presence, particularly in the pharmaceuticals, electrical equipment and aerospace industries.\n\nIn addition, the whole tri-state region has benefited from its proximity to New York City, where the rebound in the economy—and also in employment—has been much stronger.  Fairfield County’s connection to New York City is not quite as strong as Long Island’s or the lower Hudson Valley:  About 7 percent of working residents in the county commute to New York City compared to about 20 percent in those areas.  Still, the city’s strong pace of job creation during the current recovery is supporting incomes in the county.\n\nTurning to the recent performance of the economy, this area is growing pretty much in line with the nation, at least in terms of employment.  That’s a bit of an improvement from 2012 when, after solid gains in 2010 and 2011, job creation in both Fairfield County and Connecticut had stalled.  Some sectors, such as education, health, and professional and business services were adding jobs; but those were offset by job losses not only in finance, but also in the goods-producing and distributing sectors.\n\nAnd at the end of October, Superstorm Sandy hit the region, causing major damage and disruption.  While most of the news focused on New York City, Long Island and New Jersey, parts of Fairfield and New Haven counties—cities and towns like Bridgeport, Stamford, Milford, and Fairfield—were severely affected as well.  Thankfully, Sandy’s disruptive effect on the region’s economy seems to have been short-lived.  Fairfield County did see some job losses during the winter months, and Sandy likely contributed to that.  But, in the spring this area saw a strong and broad-based rebound in employment.  In fact, in May employment in Fairfield County surged to a more than four-year high.\n\nEven with this recent surge in employment, however, the county has recouped only about 60 percent of the 36,000 jobs lost during the last downturn, whereas the nation has recouped close to three-quarters of its job losses and New York City has more than fully rebounded.  And, at more than 7 percent, the county’s unemployment rate remains high.\n\nAnother dimension of the local economy where we have seen modest improvement is housing.  Homebuilding, as measured by housing permits issued, languished from 2008 through 2011; but last year, multi-family construction picked up noticeably, and this year single-family construction has begun to move up as well.  Home values have also begun to recover.  After falling about 25 percent between 2006 and early 2012, home prices have risen by 5 percent in Fairfield County and 3 percent across Connecticut overall.  While this upturn in home prices is encouraging, it has been considerably weaker than in other parts of our region and also weaker than nationally.\n\nThe New York Fed’s measures of regional credit conditions suggest continued financial challenges for families here. As of the first quarter of 2013, average debt per person was about $60,000 in Connecticut and over $90,000 in Fairfield County—little changed over several years. The county’s delinquency rate on that debt is now 5.7 percent, similar to the national average.  And the mortgage crisis continues to take a toll on local homeowners.  As of the first quarter, about 6 percent of mortgage debt in Fairfield County was 90-plus days delinquent, slightly higher than the national delinquency rate.\n\nIt is also important to recognize the county’s strengths that will support recovery and the rise in household income over the longer term—over and above just being close to a thriving New York City.  In particular, the above-average educational attainment of residents and the numerous educational institutions position the area well to move into the expanding knowledge-based economy.  Also, its diverse industry mix has a good representation of jobs in high-paying sectors and the area maintains its attractiveness as a location for corporate headquarters.\n\nThank you for your kind attention and I will now be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 CoreLogic Report Shows Home Prices Rise by 12.1 Percent Year Over Year in April",

    "text": "Thank  you for having me here to speak today.  It is a real pleasure to have this opportunity to discuss the economic  outlook and the challenges that face the Federal Reserve in terms of monetary  policy going forward. As always, my  remarks reflect my own views and opinions and not necessarily those of the  Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMy  assessment of where things stand today is mixed. On the positive side, the financial markets  are performing better and the economy is now recovering. In fact, the improvement in financial  conditions has caused usage of the Fed’s special liquidity facilities to fall  considerably. Consistent with their design,  these facilities have become relatively less attractive as market conditions  have improved. Also, the Federal Reserve  has begun to taper its rate of asset purchases.  The Treasury purchase program will end this month and the agency mortgage-backed securities purchase program by the end of the first quarter of 2010.\n\nOn  the negative side, the unemployment rate is much too high and it seems likely  that the recovery will be less robust than desired. This means that the economy has significant  excess slack and implies that we face meaningful downside risks to inflation  over the next year or two. Also, there are those who express anxiety about  whether the Fed has the tools and the will to raise the federal funds rate when  the time is appropriate. I want to  assure you that the Fed has the tools to tighten monetary policy regardless the  size of its balance sheet. Moreover, we  have the will to do so in order to keep inflation in check.\n\nTurning  first to the developments in financial markets, there is little doubt that we  have seen a vast improvement over the past six months. The major equity indices have risen sharply,  credit spreads have narrowed and bank equity prices have generally shown a  substantial recovery. Many large financial and nonfinancial firms have found it  relatively easy again to tap the debt and equity markets.\n\nThe  recovery in financial asset prices has been mirrored—albeit with a lag—in the  economy.  Industrial production has  begun to rebound as the pace of inventory liquidation has slowed. Housing prices and activity have recovered  somewhat—aided by the improvement in housing affordability and the first-time  homebuyer tax credit. Fiscal stimulus is  providing support to consumption and to state and local infrastructure  spending. The  vicious cycle we had a year ago—in which the deterioration in financial markets  led to economic weakness and that weakness reinforced the tightening of  financial conditions—has been broken. In  fact, to some extent, it has been replaced with a virtuous cycle. As financial markets have recovered, that has  led to an improvement in business and consumer sentiment that, in turn, has  helped to lift the economy, spurring further gains in financial asset  prices.\n\nIn  the same way that the improvement in market conditions is helping to support a  sustainable economic recovery, the fact that the recovery in economic activity  is a world-wide phenomenon helps mitigate the risk of a so-called  “double-dip.” The recovery in foreign  demand should help to support the U.S. economy even if U.S. domestic demand  grows more slowly than anticipated.  Given these developments, the consensus forecast of about 3 percent  annualized real GDP growth in the second half of the year appears reasonable. However,  I also suspect that the recovery will turn out to be moderate by historical  standards. This is a disappointing  outcome in that growth will likely not be strong enough to bring the  unemployment rate—currently 9.8 percent —down quickly.\n\nI  see three major forces restraining the pace of this recovery. First, households are unlikely to have fully  adjusted to the net wealth shock that has been generated by the housing price  decline and the weakness in share prices.  Peak to trough, home prices nationwide have declined by 11.5 percent measured  by the FHFA (Federal Housing Finance Agency) index and by 32 percent according  to the 20-city Case-Shiller index. With  respect to stock prices, the S&P 500 index has recovered by more than 50  percent from the trough reached in March.  But this should be put in context.  The S&P 500 index is still about one-third below its recent peak in  October 2007.  Moreover, compared with  its level ten years ago, the S&P 500 index is down by about 20  percent.\n\nThe shock to household net worth seems  likely to have several important implications for household behavior. The shock creates a risk that the household  saving rate could increase further. For  example, during the period from 1990 to 1992, the household saving rate  averaged about 7 percent of disposable personal income, considerably higher  than the 4.3 percent average rate during the first half of this year. If the household saving rate were to rise,  then consumption would rise more slowly than income, making it more difficult  for the economy to develop strong forward momentum. In addition, it seems likely that some  workers will respond to the wealth shock by postponing their retirement. This suggests that the labor force  participation rate may rise once labor market conditions improve. This would tend to push up the unemployment  rate, all else being equal.\n\nThe  second force that could restrain the recovery is the fiscal outlook. The fiscal stimulus that is currently  providing support to economic activity is temporary rather than permanent. This has to be the case if we are to ensure  that fiscal policy is on a sustainable path over the long-run. This means that the positive impulse from  fiscal stimulus will abate over the next year.\n\nThe  third, and perhaps most important factor, is that the banking system has still  not fully recovered. Bank credit losses  lag the business cycle and are still climbing.  Thus, while banks’ access to the capital markets has sharply improved,  banks are still capital constrained and hesitant to expand their lending. Most importantly, some significant classes of  borrowers—namely commercial real estate and small business—are almost wholly  dependent on the banking sector for funds, and those funds are not easily  forthcoming.\n\nThe  commercial real estate sector is under particular pressure because the  fundamentals of the sector have deteriorated sharply and because the sector is  highly dependent upon bank lending. In  terms of the fundamentals, there are two problems. First, the capitalization rate—the ratio of  income to valuation—has climbed sharply.  At the peak, capitalization rates for prime properties were in the range  of 5 percent. That means that investors  were willing to pay $20 for a $1 of income.  Today, the capitalization rate appears to have risen to about 8  percent. That means that the same dollar  of income is now capitalized as worth only $12.50. In other words, if income were stable, the  value of the properties would have fallen by 37.5 percent. Second, the income generated by commercial  real estate has generally been falling.  For example, as the recession has pushed up the unemployment rate, the  demand for office building space has declined; as the recession has led to a  reduction in discretionary travel, hotel occupancy rates and room prices have  declined; and as retail sales have weakened, this has reduced the demand for  prime retail property space.\n\nThe  decline in commercial real estate valuations has created a significant amount  of “rollover risk” when commercial real estate loans and mortgages mature and  need to be refinanced. The slump in  valuations pushes up loan-to-value ratios.  This makes lenders wary about extending new credit, even in the case  when these loans are performing on a cash flow basis. This means that more pain likely lies ahead  for this sector and for those banks with heavy commercial real estate  exposures.\n\nFor  small business borrowers, there are three problems. First, the fundamentals of their businesses  have often deteriorated because of the length and severity of the  recession—making many less creditworthy.  Second, some sources of funding for small businesses—credit card  borrowing and home equity loans—have dried up as banks have responded to rising  credit losses in these areas by tightening credit standards. Third, small businesses have few alternative  sources of funds. They are too small to  borrow in the capital markets and the Small Business Administration programs  are not large enough to accommodate more than a small fraction of the demand  from this sector.\n\nAll  of these factors will tend to inhibit the pace of the economic recovery. Given that the recovery is starting with an  abnormally large amount of slack, and the pace of recovery is not likely to be  robust, this means the economy is likely to have significant excess resources  for some time to come. As a result, the  balance of risks to inflation lies on the downside, not the upside, at least  for the next year or two.\n\nTo  see why this is the case, it is useful to note that inflation dynamics are  mainly driven by two factors—the degree of capital and labor resource  utilization relative to sustainable levels, and long-run inflation  expectations. The degree of resource  utilization is essentially driven by the business cycle and, and to some  extent, by the Fed’s success in achieving the “maximum sustainable growth”  component of its dual mandate. Inflation  expectations, on the other hand, are driven by a combination of actual  inflation outcomes and the credibility of the central bank’s commitment to  price stability. If inflation is low and  the central bank is credible, then long-run inflation expectations are likely  to remain well anchored.\n\nIn  practice, the relationship between the inflation rate and the level of resource  utilization is very difficult to estimate accurately. This stems, in part, from the fact that the  data on inflation and resource utilization are “noisy” and because sustainable  levels of resource utilization are not directly observable. The fact that there is often not much  resource slack in the economy also makes it hard to discern a clear empirical  relationship. Unfortunately,  in this episode, we don't need a precise estimate of slack to be highly  confident that the level of slack in the labor market is at or above the record  of the post-World War II period.  Although the headline unemployment rate of 9.8 percent is about one  percentage point below its level at the end of the 1981-82 recession, other,  more indicative measures paint a bleaker picture. For example, the prime age male unemployment  rate is at a record high, by a significant margin. The labor market data released last Friday  showed the September value at 10.4 percent, an increase of 6.5 percentage  points from the start of the recession.  In contrast, in the 1981-82 recession the prime age male unemployment  rate peaked at 9.3 percent, rising by 4.2 percentage points from the start of  that recession.\n\nOver  the post-World War II period as a whole, it was only in the wake of the 1981-82  and 1990-91 recessions that the prime age male unemployment rate remained above  6 percent for more than just a few months. In  addition, during all post-war expansions, the prime age male unemployment rate  has fallen below 5 percent, even during the short expansion of 1980-81. Currently, even under very optimistic  forecasts for the economy, it appears very unlikely that the prime age male  unemployment rate will dip below 6 percent before 2011.\n\nAlongside  the current unusually high degree of labor market slack, we have a situation in  which core inflation levels are low by historical standards. Continuing the comparison with the recession  of 1981-82, it is worth noting that the core inflation rate today is almost 5  percentage points lower than it was toward the end of that episode. In addition, historical experience shows that  the slack generated during a recession typically pushes core inflation lower in  the early stages of recovery. So far,  this cycle looks little different. As  the degree of slack in the economy has climbed over the past year, measures of  core inflation, particularly of core services inflation, have moderated. The tendency for service price movements to  be persistent, coupled with the current unusually large amount of slack in the  economy, suggests that the core inflation rate is more likely to fall than it  is to rise over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nIn  summary, I believe the current balance of risks around the inflation outlook  lie to the downside due to the very low level of resource utilization and the  fact that long-run inflation expectations remain stable. This balance of risks is problematic because  the current level of inflation is already so low—the core PCE (personal  consumption expenditures) deflator has increased only 1.3 percent over the past  12 months. Thus, we would not need much  of a decline in inflation to run the risk of an outright deflation. Outright deflation, in turn, would be a  dangerous development because it would drive up real debt burdens and make it  much more difficult for households and businesses to deleverage.\n\nSo  what are the implications of all this for monetary policy?\n\nThe  first implication is that the federal funds rate target is likely to remain  exceptionally low for “an extended period.”  The desired policy outcome is a robust recovery in the context of price  stability.\n\nThe  second implication is that the Federal Reserve needs to ensure that market  participants and the public understand that the FOMC has the tools to exit  smoothly from the very low federal funds rate, and that it stands ready to do  so when the time comes. On this point,  let me be perfectly clear: An enlarged  balance sheet and the high level of excess reserves in the banking system will  not delay or prevent a timely exit. The  angst about the Fed’s ability to exit smoothly stems from the rapid growth of  its balance sheet over the past year. In  September 2008, on the eve of Lehman Brothers’ failure, the consolidated  Federal Reserve balance sheet was about $900 billion. Today it is about $2.15 trillion, and it is  likely to peak at around $2.5 trillion early next year.\n\nSome  observers are concerned that this expansion will ultimately prove to be  inflationary. Proponents of this view  say that the monetary base, the broad monetary aggregates, and total credit  outstanding have historically tended to move together with inflation, at least  over longer time periods. Thus, if the  monetary base is growing rapidly, as it has been over the past year with the  growth in the Fed’s balance sheet, the argument is that this growth will  ultimately lead to inflation.\n\nThis  concern is not well founded because the Federal Reserve now has the ability to  pay interest on excess reserves (IOER), and this tool allows us to prevent  excess reserves from leading to excessive credit creation. It works as follows. Because the Federal Reserve is the safest of  counterparties, the IOER rate effectively becomes the risk-free rate. By raising that rate, the Federal Reserve  raises the cost of credit because banks will not lend at rates below the IOER  when they can instead hold these excess reserves on deposit with the Fed. Because banks no longer seek to lend out  their excess reserves, there is no increase in the amount of credit  outstanding, no increase in economic activity and no risk that excessive credit  creation will fuel an inflationary spiral.\n\nIn  the event that the ability to pay interest on excess reserves for any reason  proved insufficient or the excess reserves themselves had unanticipated side  effects that the Fed wished to mitigate, we are developing a number of tools  that can be used to drain reserves. Two  such tools are large reverse repos with dealers and other investors and term  deposit facilities for banks. Finally,  the Federal Reserve could always drain reserves the old-fashioned way, by  selling assets. The vast bulk of the  Fed’s portfolio is highly liquid—currently we hold $769 billion of Treasury  securities, $692 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities, and $131 billion  of agency debt against about $900 billion of excess reserves. All the excess reserves could be mopped up by  asset sales alone if that proved necessary.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve has been very aggressive in responding to the financial crisis. We have rolled out numerous new liquidity  facilities and have engaged in lending activity under Section 13(3) of the  Federal Reserve Act for the first time since the Great Depression. These actions have been successful in  mitigating the risks of financial collapse and a more severe contraction in  economic activity. The financial system  is now healthier and the economy is recovering.\n\nBut  despite these successes, we need to be clear that what has happened to our  financial system and the economy is wholly unsatisfactory, and that a broad  range of regulatory policies and practices need to be recalibrated to address  the shortcomings of our financial system.  With inflation low and long-run inflation expectations stable, and our  ability to remove monetary accommodation in a timely manner intact, our  near-term focus should be to keep significant monetary accommodation in place  for an extended period in order to achieve our dual objectives of maximum  employment and stable prices.\n\nThank you for your  kind attention. I would be very happy to  take a few questions.",

    "text": "As prepared for delivery\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak at this NABE (National Association for Business Economics) conference today. Having spent more than 20 years as a business economist working in the private sector before joining the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2007, I feel right at home here today.\n\nMy remarks will focus on the economic outlook. I do this with some trepidation, of course. In the private sector there are two adages about forecasting that underscore the need to be humble in this endeavor: First, forecast often. Second, specify a level or a time horizon, but never specify both, together.\n\nBut more seriously, despite the difficulties in making accurate forecasts, we still need to understand as best we can why the economy is performing the way it is, what that implies about the economic outlook, and, how policymakers can respond to generate better outcomes. We live in a highly complex and uncertain world, but we need to make as much sense out of it as possible. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMy attention today will be on three important questions:\n\nThe disappointing recovery Turning to the first question, U.S. economic growth has been quite sluggish in recent years. For example, annualized real GDP (gross domestic product) growth has averaged only about 2.2 percent since the end of the recession in 2009. As a consequence, we have seen only modest improvement in the U.S. labor market.\n\nNot only has growth been slow, it has also been disappointing relative to the forecasters' expectations. For example, the Blue Chip Consensus have been persistently too optimistic in recent years. This is illustrated in Exhibit 1 which shows how private sector forecasts for 2008 through 2013 have evolved over time.\n\n,\n\nIn contrast, as shown in Exhibit 2 , there has been no notable pattern of forecast misses for inflation. Sometimes, inflation has been a bit higher than expected, other times a bit lower. On balance, inflation has been very close to our 2 percent longer-run objective.\n\nAlthough I have focused on the private forecasting record here, the FOMC participants' forecasts show a similar pattern. It is on the growth side where there have been chronic, systematic misses.\n\nIn my view, the primary reason for the poor performance of the U.S. economy over this period has been inadequate aggregate demand. There are several explanations for this. Although some were well-known earlier, others have only become more obvious as the recovery has unfolded.\n\nOne reason is the nature of economic recoveries following financial crises. On that basis, the poor performance of the U.S. economy is not unusual—historical experience shows clearly that recoveries following financial crises typically are very slow and difficult. 1\n\nDuring the credit boom, finance is available on easy terms and the economy builds up excesses in terms of leverage and risk-taking. When the bust arrives, credit availability drops sharply and financial deleveraging occurs. Wealth falls sharply, precautionary liquidity demands increase, desired leverage drops further. In the U.S. case, there were some idiosyncratic elements, such as subprime lending and collateralized debt obligations. But, in the end, the U.S. experience included the major elements of most booms: Too much leverage, too little understanding of risk, too easy credit terms, and then a very sharp reversal.\n\nWhen the bust arrives, over-indebted households and businesses want to increase their saving and liquidity buffers, and financial intermediaries want to raise credit standards. Both responses restrain demand and make a cyclical rebound more difficult. In the U.S. case, because the bust was concentrated in housing, the scope for a strong cyclical recovery was particularly constrained because the interest-rate sensitive sector that would typically lead such a rebound could not recover until the overhang of unsold homes and the impairment of housing finances was corrected.\n\nThe U.S. recovery has also been subpar because it has been taking place in the context of a weak global economy. Historically, after a country experienced a financial crisis, growing foreign demand and currency depreciation have often led to a sharp improvement in the trade account that has put a floor under economic activity. In such circumstances, rising exports substitute for domestic consumption in supporting aggregate demand. This demand, in turn, encourages businesses to hire and invest.  In contrast, this time the shock generated by the U.S. housing bust had global consequences, exposing economic vulnerabilities outside of the United States, especially in Europe. Under these circumstances, the scope for trade as a support for U.S. growth, while positive, has been very limited.\n\nThese two factors—the dynamics following financial crises and the weakness of foreign demand—help explain why U.S. growth has been weak, but I don't think these factors explain why it has been consistently weaker than expected.\n\nAfter all, on the other side of the ledger, the policy response following the crisis has been much more aggressive than is typical. On the monetary policy side, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates close to zero, communicated that short-term rates were likely to stay exceptionally low far into the future, and undertook a series of large-scale asset purchases in order to ease financial conditions further.\n\nOn the fiscal side, in 2009 the Congress and Administration enacted the largest fiscal stimulus program in history and some of these fiscal actions were renewed (e.g., extended unemployment compensation benefits) and new initiatives undertaken (e.g., the payroll tax holiday) once it became clear that the recovery was faltering.  Also, there were significant policy actions taken to strengthen the banking system, including forcing banks to recapitalize so that they would have the capacity to sustain their lending.\n\nSo why has the recovery disappointed?\n\nOne possibility is that the negative dynamics of a post-bubble environment are even more potent than had been appreciated. Feedback loops may be more powerful and frictions may be larger. In the U.S. case, this is particularly germane with respect to housing and mortgage finance. For example, we have found significant shortcomings in those institutional structures available to support the workout of the overhang of mortgage debt in an efficient and timely manner.\n\nA second reason may be the series of additional negative shocks experienced since the initial phase of the financial crisis. The largest of these relate to the crisis in the eurozone. But one could also add the periodic commodity price shocks, the disruptive impact of the tragic Japanese earthquake and tsunami on global trade and production, and the effect of the uncertainties around the impending fiscal cliff on hiring and investing.\n\nThat said, the shocks since the acute phase of the crisis in the United States were not uniformly negative. Take, for example, the sharp increase in U.S. oil and natural gas production stemming, in part, from the innovations in drilling and extraction technologies. Not only does this rising production directly boost real GDP, but also the large drop in natural gas prices has significantly improved the industrial competitiveness of U.S.-based businesses.\n\nA third reason for the weaker than expected recovery likely lies in the interplay between secular and cyclical factors. In particular, I believe that demographic factors have played a role in restraining the recovery. The developed world's populations are aging rapidly. In the United States, for example, the baby boom generation, which is a particularly large cohort, is now beginning to retire. As the population ages, this has two consequences. First, the spending decisions of the older age cohorts are less likely to be easily stimulated by monetary policy. That is because such age groups tend to spend less of their incomes on consumer durables and housing. Second, as the population ages and the number of retirees climbs, the costs associated with Social Security, government pensions, and healthcare retirement benefits increase. This creates budgetary pressure and leads to a choice of raising revenue to fund these costs, cutting other government programs, or cutting benefits.\n\nNow if this all had been fully anticipated by retirees and near-retirees, then this would already be factored into their spending and saving decisions. But, I doubt that this has been the case. I suspect that many have been surprised by the swift change in economic circumstances as the housing boom went bust. I doubt that many fully anticipated the budget crunch and the prospect that their future retiree and healthcare benefits would likely be curbed or their taxes would have to rise in the future. When households begin to anticipate this, they reduce their assessment of their sustainable living standards. This downward reassessment then feeds back to current spending and saving decisions.\n\nA fourth reason why the recovery has been slower than expected may be that we overestimated the capacity for fiscal policy to continue to provide support to growth until a vigorous recovery was achieved. On the fiscal side, the authorities can cut taxes or increase spending to support income and demand during the deleveraging phase that follows the financial crisis. But the ability of such stimulus to continue to support economic activity ultimately encounters budgetary limits. For example, the need to keep the long-term fiscal trajectory on a sustainable path limits the size and duration of federal fiscal stimulus measures. For state and local governments, the statutory requirements for balanced budgets meant that fiscal policies turned restrictive relatively quickly once budget surpluses and rainy day funds were exhausted, and this was only temporarily mitigated by federal transfers to the states as part of the initial fiscal stimulus program.  Fiscal policy is now a drag rather than a support to growth in the United States, and this will likely continue.\n\nMonetary policy I would give each of these four explanations some weight for why the recovery has been consistently weaker than expected. But I would add a fifth, monetary policy, while highly accommodative by historic standards, may still not have been sufficiently accommodative given the economic circumstances.\n\nNow let me be clear. I believe the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that our monetary policy has been effective in easing financial conditions and supporting economic activity. After reducing the traditional policy tool, the target for the overnight federal funds rate, to close to zero, the Fed has aggressively employed two complementary types of non-traditional tools—asset purchases and forward guidance on the policy rate—to provide additional stimulus through their effects on long term rates and various risk premia.\n\nEffective forward guidance on interest rates causes market participants to lower their expectations and uncertainty about future path of interest rates and to anticipate that easier financial conditions will persist well in to the future. This pushes down the yield curve and leads to easier financial conditions.\n\nFederal Reserve asset purchases also make financial conditions more accommodative. Such purchases, by taking duration out of private hands, push down term premia and lead to lower long-term rates than would otherwise be the case for any given economic outlook. Agency MBS (mortgage-backed securities) purchases absorb prepayment risk and reduce secondary and primary mortgage rates, stimulating demand for housing and increasing purchasing power through refinancing. Lower long-term rates support the prices of equities and housing, boosting wealth and easing balance sheet constraints, while an accommodative monetary policy stance reduces downside risks for the economy and this leads to lower default risk premia on corporate debt. Our  two tools work in a complementary manner. Asset purchases strengthen the credibility of the forward guidance on interest rates, while forward guidance provides information about how long the FOMC is likely to hold on to the assets it purchases.\n\nMy conclusion is that the easing of financial conditions resulting from non-traditional policy actions has had a material effect on both nominal and real growth and has demonstrably reduced the risk of particularly adverse outcomes.  Nevertheless, I also conclude that, with the benefit of hindsight, monetary policy needed to be still more aggressive. Consequently, it was appropriate to recalibrate our policy stance, which is what happened at the last FOMC meeting.\n\nAs I argued in a recent speech, simple policy rules, including the most popular versions of the Taylor Rule, understate the degree of monetary support that may be required to achieve a given set of economic objectives in a post-financial crisis world. That is because such rules typically do not adjust for factors such as a time-varying neutral real interest rate, elevated risk spreads, or impaired transmission channels that can undercut the power of monetary policy. 2\n\nOne reason that monetary policy may have been less powerful than normal is that one of the primary channels through which monetary policy influences the real economy—housing finance—has been partially impaired. This has both quantity and price dimensions. Credit availability to households with lower-rated credit scores remains limited and households with homes that have fallen sharply in value have lost most or all of their home equity and this makes it very difficult for them to refinance these mortgages.\n\nFederal Reserve MBS purchases have succeeded in driving down mortgage rates to historically low levels. But these purchases would have had still more effect on the economy if pass-through rates from the secondary market to the primary market had been higher. As can be seen in Exhibit 3 , the Federal Reserve's purchases significantly narrowed the spread between agency MBS and Treasury yields, with the latest round of purchases notably effective in this regard. But, as shown in Exhibit 4 the spread between primary mortgage rates and agency MBS yields 3 has widened and this has limited the drop in primary mortgage rates.\n\nThe incomplete pass-through from agency MBS yields into primary mortgage rates is due to several factors—including a concentration of mortgage origination volumes at a few key financial institutions and mortgage rep and warranty requirements that discourage lending for home purchases and make financial institutions reluctant to refinance mortgages that have been originated elsewhere. On a related note, higher guarantee fees charges by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have increased the fixed cost of originating loans and this has also increased the spread between primary and secondary mortgage rates. Factors limiting pass-through warrant ongoing attention from policymakers.\n\nAnother reason why monetary policy has become less effective in stimulating the economy is because the impetus from a given level of monetary accommodation likely has become attenuated—that is, less powerful—over time. Historically, attenuation has not been important because monetary policy typically has not stayed exceptionally easy for long periods of time. But this time is different and that difference may be important.\n\nSo how might the monetary policy impulse on economic activity have become attenuated over time? I would suggest two potential channels.\n\nThe first channel is that monetary policy works, in part, by changing the timing of purchase decisions. If interest rates decline, the drop in financing costs may induce some households to buy a motor vehicle or purchase a home now rather than in the future. Of course, if the car or home is purchased today, this will borrow at least a portion of those sales from the future. There is a limit to how many cars and homes most people will want to buy, given their budget constraints. In this case, as the stimulus from the policy stays in place, the impulse on economic growth will gradually \"wear off\" as there are fewer and fewer households who can be induced to pull their future planned purchases forward to the present. The same argument applies to mortgage refinancing activity. The stimulus comes from the refinancing activity, which increases the amount of income that borrowers have available for other expenditures. The impetus to growth wears off unless mortgage rates keep dropping, stimulating additional rounds of refinancing activity.\n\nThe second channel is that low interest rates will gradually reduce the interest income of savers and this could eventually affect their consumption. Household interest income has fallen considerably over the past few years.\n\nThis effect is likely to work quite slowly. The fact that interest rates are low for six months or a year probably does not have much impact on households' expectations of their long-term interest income and thus, does not have much of an impact on consumer spending. But, as low interest rates are sustained, this could eventually lead to a downward adjustment in households' assessments of their interest income over time and influence their spending.\n\nOne way to look at this is through the prism of forward real interest rates. If interest rate expectations many years forward have fallen, then expectations about the permanent level of interest income should have declined as well. As shown in Exhibit 5 , forward real rates five years ahead have declined notably over the past few years. This could be a reasonable proxy for savers' expectations. Note that the decline in Exhibit 5 has not been precipitous, it has occurred very gradually over time.\n\nHowever, policymaking is about making choices between available alternatives.  In the long run, even savers would be better off in a world in which aggressive monetary policy generates a strengthening recovery that eventually permits the normalization of interest rates, than they would be compared to a circumstance in which the United States allowed itself to fall into a Japan-style trap of low growth and low rates for decades. So I do not view the effect of low rates on savers as a reason to be less accommodative.\n\nRather, in my view, the potential for the monetary policy impulse to be attenuated over time, is an additional reason to be aggressive in terms of the policy response. A more front-loaded program would avoid greater attenuation compared with a policy that started out  less aggressive but added stimulus gradually over time. This has two benefits. First, it would likely be more successful in generating the desired recovery more quickly. Second, relative to a more back-loaded program, less would ultimately need to be done to achieve the desired set of outcomes.\n\nThe fact that there are asymmetric payoffs from an economy that is weaker than expected versus one that is stronger than expected, given that we are at the zero lower bound reinforces this conclusion. In particular, if the economy were to continue to underperform, and experienced a severe shock, there would be some  risk of getting stuck in a deflationary situation in which monetary policy would be even less effective.\n\nAt the present time there is no conflict between our employment objective and our inflation objective, as I expect inflation to be at or below our 2 percent longer-run objective over the coming years. But shouldn't we also consider the costs associated with a more aggressive monetary policy of the kind adopted at the last FOMC meeting, especially when we are using non-traditional monetary policy tools?\n\nAbsolutely. We have carefully evaluated three potential sets of costs and will continue to review them.\n\nThe first set of costs stems from the risk that the current monetary policy regime could distort asset allocations and lead to renewed financial asset bubbles. We look at this issue on an ongoing basis. To date, there is little evidence of problems or excesses, but this could change as the recovery proceeds. If these costs were to rise, we would need to examine what steps could be taken on the macro-prudential front in response. Also, such developments would need to be  incorporated into the monetary policy decision-making process.\n\nThe second set of costs stems from the risk that exit from this regime could prove difficult. In particular, some observers worry that the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet could ultimately prove inflationary. If that were the case, then I would regard the costs as exceptionally high.\n\nFortunately, I am confident that such fears are misplaced. That is because we now have the ability to pay interest on excess reserves (IOER). This means we can keep inflation in check regardless the size of our balance sheet. If the recovery got underway in earnest and credit demand surged, we could slow down the rate of credit creation by raising the interest rate we pay on excess reserves. Banks wouldn't lend out funds at lower rates than what they can earn from holding reserves with us. As a result, a hike in the IOER would raise the level of interest rates throughout the economy and this would dampen any expansion of credit. Our ability to pay interest on excess reserves is an essential tool that we can use to avoid future inflation problems. 4\n\nWe are mindful of the fact that there could still be confusion about how exit will take place. This could increase financial market volatility. To reduce this risk, the FOMC has published a set of exit principles. These principles lay out a roadmap about how exit is likely to occur: First, the end of reinvestment of maturing securities; second, an increase in short-term interest rates, and, third, the gradual sale of mortgage backed securities to shrink the magnitude of excess reserves in the system and ultimately to restore the Fed's balance sheet to a predominately all-Treasury portfolio.\n\nA degree of humility is appropriate given the lack of experience as to how markets will respond when economic conditions eventually cause investors to anticipate exit. When asset purchases are anticipated to end or when asset sales begin to be anticipated, this will affect term premia in ways that cannot be precisely predicted in advance. That said, I do expect the repricing will prove manageable. We will seek to communicate so as to avoid generating sharp shifts in term premia and in long-term interest rates. Also, we will play close attention to ensure that financial institutions are managing their interest rate risks appropriately.\n\nThe third set of costs is the impact of higher short-term rates on the Federal Reserve's earnings and balance sheet when exit occurs. When we ultimately raise short-term interest rates, this will squeeze the Fed's net interest margin. Also, when the Fed sells long-term assets, there is some prospect for losses on these sales depending on the level of long-term interest rates at the time when such sales occur. This means that the Fed's earning could fall sharply or even turn negative in a given year. We look at this issue very closely to understand the risks here. The good news is that a very large proportion of our liabilities—those associated with currency outstanding—has no interest cost. This mitigates the risk of a sharp net interest margin squeeze. Moreover, our analysis shows that the cumulative income generated over the period in which the balance sheet has been unusually large is likely to exceed normal levels under a wide range of scenarios.\n\nIn my view, while the costs are real and need to be carefully evaluated, they pale relative to the costs of not achieving a sustainable economic recovery. A failure in that regard would lead to widespread chronic unemployment. Not only would that be tragic for millions of people, but it also would generate chronic shortfalls in the nation's potential output and fiscal capacity. Relative to the costs outlined above, the benefits from avoiding such an outcome seem overwhelming.\n\nCyclical and structural policy Although I favor an aggressive monetary policy in the current situation, I also recognize that monetary policy is not a panacea. We all know that in the long run money is neutral—that is, that while monetary policy can help the economy return to full employment following a shock, the full employment level of output, employment and real income depends on factors outside of monetary policy. Also, we must recognize that the strength of the current cyclical recovery will depend importantly on non-monetary policy choices.\n\nOther steps are needed to secure the best available economic outcome. In particular, attention should be paid to what could be done to capitalize on the recent stabilization in house prices to improve access to mortgage credit and to foster competition in mortgage origination to ensure a more complete pass-through of low secondary mortgage rates to households. Indeed, if balance sheet dynamics are more important and frictions around housing more powerful than we initially understood, then there should be strong payoff to policies that ease them.\n\nAt the same time, Congress and the White House should take steps that reduce the short-term and long-term uncertainty over fiscal policy. Currently, households and businesses face elevated short-term uncertainty as to what will happen to tax and spending policies in 2013 and how this will affect the economic outlook. I believe this is restraining hiring and investment today.\n\nBut families and businesses also face long-term uncertainty about how the country's fiscal challenges will be addressed.  Providing greater clarity about the scope and terms of Social Security and Medicare must be helpful, especially in correcting those expectations that are unduly pessimistic. On this score, Social Security is particularly noteworthy. According to a 2011 Pew Research Center poll, more than 40 percent of people aged 18 to 30 believe they will receive no retirement income from Social Security, even though Social Security receipts are estimated to equal about 75 percent of benefits on a sustainable basis under the current regime. 5\n\nCongress and the White House should enact a fiscal program that starts with mild restraint, but credibly builds that restraint over time so as to put the nation's debt burden on a clearly sustainable course. Ideally, the program would have broad bipartisan support and provide clarity not just on the near-term outlook, but also about how the major entitlement programs would be adjusted.\n\nAlso, steps could be taken to increase the productive capacity of the economy over time. Such actions are desirable because a more productive economy will generate higher living standards and have greater fiscal capacity.\n\nLet me briefly mention a few steps that could be taken to increase the economy's potential over time—immigration policies that attract workers with scarce skills to the United States; education policies and job retraining programs that build and replenish human capital; spending on infrastructure to remove bottlenecks; tax simplification and the elimination of tax policies that distort investment and saving decisions; regulatory policies that are attentive to costs and benefits and that emphasize getting the incentives right.\n\nCounter-cyclical policies and structural policies are not substitutes, they are complements. We need both. The strength of demand today is importantly influenced by expectations about future living standards.  The lower the expected path of national income, the less favorable the distribution of that income is expected to be, and the greater the uncertainty over the mix of tax rates and benefits a person or business expects to pay and receive, the less they will spend or invest today.  Thus, policies that improve the long-run outlook make a cyclical recovery easier to achieve today.\n\nConversely, a monetary policy that promotes a cyclical recovery supports the economy's long-run prospects. Left for too long, long term unemployment will eventually lead to permanent atrophying of skills that will restrain the economy's growth potential. This is also true for the cohort of young workers who are stuck in jobs for which they are overqualified and who are having trouble securing the professional experience that would make them increasingly productive over time.\n\nAlthough the outlook for the U.S. economy remains somewhat cloudy as we look into 2013, I remain a long-run optimist about where we are headed. The long term prospects of the U.S. economy are excellent. The United States leads the world in higher education, technology and innovation and has recently acquired new comparative advantages in energy. We have an exceptionally dynamic labor market, high rates of entrepreneurialism, competitive product markets, and a well-capitalized financial system that relentlessly reallocates capital from one sector to the next in search of higher returns.\n\nEven over the next few years, while there are significant downside risks relating to the fiscal cliff and the eurozone, it is possible that the recovery could turn out stronger than expected. The underlying process of balance sheet repair is considerably advanced, housing is recovering and, as that occurs, our newly recalibrated monetary policy could gain additional traction. Thus, if uncertainties about the U.S. fiscal path and the future of the eurozone were resolved in a constructive manner, growth could pick up more vigorously than anticipated.\n\nThis would be a wonderful outcome. The September FOMC statement noted: the Committee expects \"that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the recovery strengthens.\" Consistent with this, if we were to see some good news on growth I would not expect us to respond in a hasty manner.  Only as we became confident that the recovery was securely established, would I expect our monetary policy stance to evolve to ensure that it remained appropriate to achievement of our objective: maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.

    "text": "I think this is a timely topic because it is relevant to several questions that are particularly important in the current environment.  First, if one were to use a Taylor-type rule as a guide to assess the stance of monetary policy, what equilibrium real federal funds rate would one currently use in the formula?  Given the performance of the economy in recent years, I think it would be very hard to justify the typical assumption of a 2 percent rate.\n\nSecond, what will this equilibrium real rate be in the future?  This is particularly germane right now given that short-term forward interest rates derived from the Treasury yield curve have come down sharply since late 2013.  For example, the 1-year forward rate, 9 years ahead has declined sharply over the past year, falling from around 5 percent in December 2013 to just under 3 percent currently.  What can explain such a large shift in forward rates at such a long time horizon?\n\nThird, when U.S. monetary policy is normalized, how fast should we raise short-term interest rates?  In other words, what is the appropriate path back to the long-run equilibrium real federal funds rate, shallow or steep?\n\nIn my view, the paper reaches five major conclusions—conclusions that I find myself broadly in agreement with:\n\nTurning to the first issue of the relationship between real potential GDP growth and the equilibrium real short-term interest rate, the authors find, at best, only a very loose relationship.  I would have welcomed some further work here, more closely focused on the components of real potential GDP growth—such as labor input and productivity—and their potential links to the level and dynamics of the equilibrium real short-term rate.  First, I would look more closely at the demographic factors that influence the amount of labor input.  In my view, it seems plausible that when the labor force is rising rapidly, this might put upward pressure on r* by increasing the demand for capital needed to equip the new army of workers.  This might have been particularly relevant during the late 1970s when the labor supply in the U.S. was rising rapidly due to the influx of the baby boom generation into the workforce and the climb in female participation rates.  Second, the equilibrium real short-term rate might be influenced by the productivity growth rate.  If productivity growth were high, one might expect that the return on capital might also be elevated, putting upward pressure on real rates.  The late 1990s surge in productivity growth during the internet technology boom seems to be a good example of this type of phenomenon.\n\nIf the growth in labor input and productivity were positively related with the equilibrium real short-term rate, then in the current environment this would be consistent with a relatively low r*.  The potential labor force has grown very slowly in recent years (less than a ½ percent annual rate over the past five years), and productivity growth has been subdued—running at only 1 to 1½ percent annual rate on average over the past few years.  In sum, by focusing on the components rather than on the overall real potential GDP growth rate, one might find stronger and more persistent relationships with the equilibrium real short-term interest rate.\n\nThe second issue that I want to briefly explore concerns the degree of uncertainty about the equilibrium real short-term rate and its implications for monetary policy.  The paper argues quite convincingly, I think, that when this uncertainty is high, then an inertial policy rule may be preferable—that is, would lead to higher expected welfare.\n\nThat said, it is important not to overemphasize uncertainty to justify a policy of persistently low short-term interest rates.  There are also risks from too much policy inertia.  An inertial approach works well as long as inflation expectations stay well-anchored.  But, if a delay in monetary policy normalization or a very shallow trajectory in normalizing short-term interest rates were to cause inflation expectations to move meaningfully above our 2 percent inflation objective, then an inertial policy would likely become detrimental in achieving the FOMC’s objectives.\n\nWhile simple policy rules provide useful benchmarks for policymakers, their very virtue—their simplicity—is also a significant shortcoming.  Policy rules, especially those with fixed values for r*, cannot capture all of the information that is relevant for policymaking.  In particular, such rules do not capture the fact that the linkage between the federal funds rate and both financial markets and global conditions can be very loose and shift over time.  This is a critical shortcoming because this looseness affects the stability of the relationship between monetary policy and economic outcomes.\n\nAs an example, one significant conundrum in financial markets currently is the recent decline of forward short-term rates at long time horizons to extremely low levels—for example, the 1-year nominal rate, 9 years forward is about 3 percent currently.  My staff’s analysis attributes this decline almost entirely to lower term premia.  In this case, the fact that market participants have set forward rates so low has presumably led to a more accommodative set of financial market conditions, such as the level of bond yields and the equity market’s valuation, that are more supportive to economic growth.  If such compression in expected forward short-term rates were to persist even after the FOMC begins to raise short-term interest rates, then, all else equal, it would be appropriate to choose a more aggressive path of monetary policy normalization as compared to a scenario in which forward short-term rates rose significantly, pushing bond yields significantly higher.\n\nIn closing, I agree with the authors that it is very much premature to accept the hypothesis that we have entered a sustained period of secular stagnation.  That said, however, I do think that the real potential GDP growth rate will be lower over the medium term, held down by much slower growth of labor input and an anticipated continuation of lackluster productivity growth performance.  If I am correct, this does have implications for the longer-run value of r*.  My point estimate is that the longer-run value of the federal funds rate is 3½ percent, well below its long-run historical level of 4¼ percent.  At the same time, I also have little confidence about the accuracy of this specific estimate.  So you see that I come out in a very similar place as the authors of this year’s Monetary Policy Forum paper.  They suggest that the long-run equilibrium real federal funds rate might be in the range of 1 to 2 percent.  Add on 2 percent inflation, you end up in just about the same place as my current long-term 3½ percent nominal federal funds rate point estimate.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n2015 U.S.

    "text": "Good afternoon and welcome once again to the New York Fed’s Quarterly Regional Economic Press Briefing.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with the journalists covering our region—and through you, to the people in our District.  This morning I will focus on regional economic conditions, with particular attention to job polarization, which I would define as the expansion of the number of jobs at the upper and lower ends of the wage and skill distribution and a shrinking of job opportunities for those in the middle.  We will see how these trends are playing out in our region.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNational Economic Conditions The U.S. economy is continuing to slowly recover from the after-effects of the housing boom and bust and the financial crisis.  But the recovery has been disappointing. Indeed, when we look back at economic forecasts made over the past three or four years it is notable that growth has systematically fallen short of both the Federal Reserve and private-sector forecasts.\n\nDespite what has been an unusually accommodative monetary policy by historical standards, the economy has grown at only a 2.1 percent pace over the last four quarters and the Blue Chip consensus forecast only anticipates a modest acceleration to a 2.4 percent rate over the next four quarters.\n\nThe headwinds retarding recovery are well known.  Consumers have been deleveraging in response to the large losses in wealth generated in large part by the collapse in home prices.  Housing activity remains depressed for many reasons.  These include the large shadow inventory making its way through the foreclosure pipeline, tight underwriting standards for new mortgage origination, and the sharp slowdown in household formation.\n\nAlthough the corporate sector as a whole is now reasonably healthy, there still is a significant constraint on the availability of credit to small business.  Fiscal policy has become restrictive as state and local governments have cut expenditures in response to revenue shortfalls;  and the uncertainty about how Congress and the Administration will address the 2013 federal “fiscal cliff” is likely to inhibit hiring and investment by business.  Global economic growth has slowed as European activity has stagnated and this is capping the demand for U.S. exports.\n\nOn the brighter side, some of these headwinds appear to be subsiding.  Employment growth has picked up somewhat, which should eventually lead to faster household formation and more demand for housing.  U.S. banks are healthier so that credit conditions, while still tight, are gradually easing.  And, households appear quite far along in the deleveraging process by a number of important measures.  For example, the ratio of household debt service relative to income is back to levels last seen in the early 1990s.\n\nFor these reasons, I expect that growth will gradually strengthen over the next few years.  Nevertheless, significant downside risks remain, especially those related to the challenges in Europe and how the potential “fiscal cliff” in the United States will be resolved after the fall elections.  Even if these risks do not materialize, I anticipate only slow progress toward full employment.\n\nOn the inflation side, in recent years our forecasts have been noticeably more accurate than on the growth side, and we have succeeded in delivering inflation very close to our 2 percent price stability objective.  Through March, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures deflator, overall consumer prices have risen 2.1 percent over the past 12 months, and prices excluding food and energy have risen 2.0 percent.\n\nBut price trends have been a bit stickier than one might have anticipated given the large amount of slack in the economy.  To some degree, this likely reflects the anchoring exerted by stable inflation expectations.  But some of the price pressures can be attributed to other, more temporary, factors: • Higher oil and gasoline prices and their pass-through into the costs of other goods and services. • Upward pressure on imputed homeowners rents due to increased demand for rental housing. • Higher import prices for goods, such as apparel.  This reflects many factors including commodity prices pressures and higher wage inflation in countries such as China.\n\nMore generally, there are several reasons to think that inflation will remain moderate and close to our objective. First, and most obviously, the economy continues to operate with significant slack.  Second, measures of underlying inflation show little upward pressure.  In fact, one—the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Underlying Inflation Gauge—is turning down. This measure uses a very wide set of variables to forecast the underlying inflation trend. Third, it is hard to be very concerned about inflation risks when the growth rate of nominal labor compensation is so low and stable.  It is noteworthy to me that the employment cost index has risen only 2.1 percent over the past four quarters and has shown no acceleration.  Fourth, inflation expectations remain well-anchored. This is critically important because inflation expectations are an important driver of actual inflation outcomes. Taking into account the current stance of monetary policy, I anticipate that inflation will decline to slightly below our 2 percent long-run objective over the next few years.\n\nSo what does this all imply for monetary policy?  I currently anticipate that the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate target will remain exceptionally low—that is at the current level—at least through late 2014.\n\nGiven our forecast of stable prices and a still slow path back to full employment, there is an argument for easing further. But, unfortunately, our tools have costs associated with them as well as benefits.  Thus, we must weigh these costs against the benefits of further action.\n\nAs long as the U.S. economy continues to grow sufficiently fast to cut into the nation’s unused economic resources at a meaningful pace, I think the benefits from further action are unlikely to exceed the costs.  But if the economy were to slow so that we were no longer making material progress toward full employment, the downside risks to growth were to increase sharply, or if deflation risks were to climb materially, then the benefits of further accommodation would increase in my estimation and this could tilt the balance toward additional easing.\n\nUnder such circumstances, further balance sheet action might be called for. We could choose between further extension of the duration of the Federal Reserve’s existing Treasury portfolio and another large-scale asset purchase program of Treasuries or agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\nConversely, I would be willing to consider tightening policy at a somewhat earlier stage if growth strengthened sufficiently to materially improve the medium-term outlook and substantially reduce tail risks, or if there was evidence of a genuine threat to medium-term inflation, including a rise in inflation expectations. In such a case, I would anticipate that the first step would be to bring in the late 2014 date of the policy guidance.  This would effectively tighten financial conditions not only by changing the expected path of short-term interest rates, but also by bringing forward the expected start of balance sheet normalization.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions Let me turn now to the regional economy, the focus of our presentations today.  Since our last briefing, the recovery in the region has picked up some steam. As attendees at previous regional press briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces economic activity indexes to help monitor the performance of the regional economy.  Based on these measures, activity in New York State and New York City has expanded at a healthy clip, while New Jersey’s growth continues at a more moderate pace.  In Puerto Rico, the activity index produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico shows that the Island’s downturn appears to have ended, but the pick up that we noted at our last briefing has not persisted and the level of activity there has stalled.\n\nLooking at payroll employment, however, the pattern of recovery is a bit more positive, though mixed across the region.  New York State and New York City saw faster job growth than the nation since our last briefing.  Job creation in the city has been particularly robust and employment in the city is now above its pre-recession peak.  In New Jersey, however, employment stands only slightly above where it was at our last briefing and still is well below its previous peak.   In Puerto Rico, employment continues to fluctuate near its lows, with no sign of a pickup.\n\nJob Polarization Our special topic today is the issue of job polarization. As I have visited different parts of the district—most recently trips to Long Island, Syracuse and Buffalo—employers have told me that they are beginning to add jobs, particularly in high-tech fields.  These jobs can best be characterized as high skilled and technologically advanced.  I have heard similar stories from our small business advisory council, our upstate advisory council and even our community banks.  These anecdotes are reflected in our research on labor market dynamics.  Over the past three decades, job opportunities have become increasingly concentrated in high wage/high skill occupations and low wage/low skill occupations, while job opportunities for those in the middle have been shrinking. At the same time, there has been a growing gap in wages between jobs that pay the most and those that pay the least. Taken together, this phenomenon is often referred to as job polarization.\n\nThe root causes of job polarization appear to be technology and globalization, which have displaced many jobs, particularly those involving routine tasks.  This loss of jobs has been especially pronounced for what we often think of as traditional middle-skilled workers. Its impact is perhaps most evident in the manufacturing sector, where so many jobs have been lost in recent decades. Given the strong history of manufacturing in our region, job polarization has been an important feature in our local economy. No doubt, the widening wage gap and loss of job opportunities for middle-skilled workers has contributed to a rise in economic inequality and created challenges for many workers and their families. More than ever before, jobs are requiring a greater degree of knowledge and skill. In order to adapt to these changes, it is increasingly important for workers to acquire and upgrade their skills, whether through formal education or other forms of training. In addition, it is important for employers to communicate their needs to educational institutions so that they can offer the coursework and programs so that people can develop the right skills to fill the available jobs. For these reasons, we think it is particularly important to highlight these trends in today’s briefing.\n\nConclusion In summary, recent data are consistent with the expectation of moderate growth in 2012 and stronger, but still not robust, growth in 2013.  I also expect both headline and core inflation rates should moderate over the next few months.  In our region, the recovery of activity and employment has continued, though the data indicate relatively stronger performance in New York State and New York City than in New Jersey, while Puerto Rico has yet to show any meaningful improvement. Our special topic shows a trend toward job polarization both in the nation and the region, which focuses our attention on the ever-growing importance for workers to acquire skills and upgrade their skills on an ongoing basis.\n\nI will now ask Jim Orr to present the update of economic conditions in our region.",

    "text": "Thank you, Dean Gautschi, for that kind introduction.  It is a pleasure to be here today at Fordham University and I thank the Fordham Wall Street Council for hosting me.  This morning my remarks will focus on the U.S. economic outlook.\n\nI am also going to discuss a new tool that the New York Fed will  begin to test—an overnight, fixed-rate full allotment reverse repo facility.  I want to dispel any misconceptions about why we are doing this testing.  The introduction of this facility is not a precursor to a change in the stance of monetary policy.  Instead, the goal of this new facility is to improve our control over overnight interest rates to aid us in the implementation of monetary policy.\n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and opinions and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me start by summarizing my main points regarding the economic outlook.  In my view, the economy is slowly healing.  But, while significant progress has been made since the end of the recession, there remain a number of headwinds that have offset the improvement in the underlying fundamentals.  As a result, we have yet to see any meaningful pickup in the economy’s forward momentum.\n\nThe most notable recent headwind, of course, has been the large amount of fiscal drag this year from the payroll and income tax increases and the budget sequester.  Also noteworthy is the tightening of financial market conditions that has occurred since May.  As we move into 2014, the fiscal headwinds should abate somewhat.  As that occurs, the improving underlying fundamentals of the economy should begin to dominate, pushing up the overall growth rate.\n\nBut this is just a forecast, it has not been realized yet.  That is one reason why I supported the FOMC’s decision last week to maintain the current pace of our Treasury and mortgage-backed security purchases.  In my view, the economy still needs the support of a very accommodative monetary policy.  Adjustments to that policy need to be anchored in an assessment of how the economy is actually performing, how financial conditions are evolving, and how this affects the longer-term outlook and the risks around it. Our decisions on how to adjust our policy tools—for example, the pace of asset purchases and forward guidance with respect to the level of short-term rates—must be rooted in the ongoing flow of information that informs our judgments about the prospects for a sustainable recovery.  Decisions on the pace of asset purchase and forward guidance must be based on what is most appropriate to achieve our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment in a context of price stability.\n\nEconomic Outlook Let’s dig a bit deeper into the tug- of-war between improving fundamentals and the drag exerted by fiscal policy and tighter financial conditions.\n\nStarting with the improving underlying fundamentals, one important aspect is the household sector and its balance sheet.  In a number of dimensions, households have made significant progress in repairing their finances.  Prior to the recession, households took on an excessive amount of debt— much in the form of residential mortgages. The process of deleveraging and reducing this debt overhang is now well advanced.  For example, household debt relative to disposable income has declined substantially since it peaked in the third quarter of 2007, bringing it back to levels last seen in early 2003.  Delinquency rates on mortgages, auto loans and credit cards continue to decline. In addition, household wealth relative to disposable income has recovered from the steep decline following the crisis and is now near its 20-year average.  Reflecting this improvement, credit standards are beginning to ease, which should support consumer spending on durable goods.\n\nAnother sector in which the fundamentals have improved is the housing sector.  Most importantly, the excess supply of housing created during the boom appears to have been largely worked off.  As a result, house prices are now rising in most areas of the country and homebuilding activity has strengthened.  Moreover, there is further scope for gains in homebuilding.  After all, the current annualized rate of housing starts—around 900,000—is considerably below the rate consistent with the country’s underlying demographic trends and the expected long-run rate of household formation.  By these metrics, housing starts should ultimately climb back to about a 1.5 million annualized rate.\n\nThe underlying fundamentals supporting business investment are also good.  Profit margins have been high and cash flows strong for some time.  Credit availability has been gradually improving.  For example, the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicates that banks are continuing to gradually ease their lending standards for commercial and industrial loans.\n\nHowever, against these improving economic fundamentals, we have two important offsets.  The first offset is the unusually high degree of fiscal drag, which the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates at about 1¾ percent of potential GDP in 2013. 1 The two most important components of this restraint are the end of the payroll tax holiday and the increase in income tax rates this past January, and, more recently, the government spending cuts resulting from budget sequestration.\n\nAnother new source of drag for the economy is the sharp rise in long-term interest rates, especially residential mortgage rates—that has occurred since May.  So far we don’t have much hard data on how this is affecting the housing sector.  But data through mid-September generally indicate that the rise in rates has cut into the upward momentum of the housing sector.\n\nCurrently, improving economic fundamentals versus fiscal drag and somewhat tighter financial conditions are pulling the economy in opposite directions, roughly cancelling each other. The economy continues to grow and payrolls are rising, but there is little evidence of a pickup in the economy’s forward momentum.  For example, real GDP growth is still stuck close to the 2.2 percent  average annualized growth rate that has prevailed since the beginning of the expansion.\n\nBut, as the degree of fiscal drag and other headwinds lessen, the tug-of-war should begin to shift in favor of higher growth. Absent additional fiscal restraint, a further tightening of financial conditions, or some adverse external shock, I expect the economy to grow a bit faster in 2014.\n\nSo, how compelling is this narrative? In big picture terms, it certainly seems quite reasonable to me. However, no forecast is inevitable and there are some reasons to remain wary.   In particular, although the fiscal drag will likely lessen in 2014, I expect it will still be significant, and the outcome of the current federal budget and debt ceiling debates may affect this assessment.  Moreover, when one drills down and looks at the recent performance and outlook for the economy’s major sectors, additional caution seems warranted.\n\nTurning first to the outlook for fiscal policy, there are two points worth making.  First, the CBO projects that significant fiscal drag will persist into 2014.  Second, the fact that the degree of restraint lessens next fiscal year could understate the actual impact on the economy because the full impact of some of this year’s cuts may not yet have been fully felt. For example, consider university research spending that depends, in part, on federal grants.  As the grant budget falls under sequestration, this will eventually squeeze university budgets over time and likely lead to additional belt-tightening.\n\nNext, let’s take a deeper look at how the major sectors of the private economy that might play a role in the strengthening story are doing currently: consumption, housing, business investment and trade.  When we’re done, I think you’ll agree that there still are some reasons for caution.\n\nTurning first to consumer spending, such spending has remained fairly subdued outside of interest rate-sensitive consumer durables.  In July, for example, real personal consumption expenditures were flat, and it is unlikely that third quarter consumption growth will be much above a 2 percent annual rate.\n\nMoreover, the drivers of consumer spending do not look particularly supportive.  In particular, real disposable income growth has grown at less than a 1 percent annual pace since March.  Furthermore, the recent data do not yet clearly indicate a firming in the income growth rate, or the two important components of labor income growth—hours and compensation.\n\nThe conundrum for consumers is a simple one:  if consumer spending growth is to exceed 2 percent annualized on a sustained basis at a time when real disposable income growth is below 2 percent then this would require the household saving rate to decline persistently.  But there is little reason to expect such a decline given that the current saving rate is at a level consistent with current level of household wealth relative to income.\n\nWe have a chicken-egg problem.  If the saving rate remains stable, then stronger consumption growth will require a pickup in income growth. But for income to rise, demand must increase.  This suggests that there may need to be an impetus to growth from other sectors of the economy to generate a boost in consumer spending growth.\n\nOne possible source is the housing sector.  As noted earlier, housing starts are still quite low relative to what the country’s demographics should support in the long run.  But there are two difficulties here.   First, the strength of the housing recovery may be blunted by the recent rise in mortgage rates.  For example, before last week’s partial reversal, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate had risen by about 120 basis points since May to more than 4½ percent.  For a household considering buying a house and financing the purchase with a $100,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, this rise in mortgage rates would increase their annual payments by more than $800. The increase in financing costs and the rise in home prices has made housing considerably less affordable than it was earlier in the year.  This is illustrated by the National Association of Realtors’ affordability index which has declined by 25 percent over the six months ending in July.\n\nSecond, housing activity has already been contributing significantly to growth.  For example, over the past two years, real residential investment swung from a drag of 1.1 percentage points of GDP to a contribution of 0.4 percentage points.  Together, this suggests that the impetus to growth from housing may moderate rather than strengthen.\n\nPerhaps, the economy can get a boost from business fixed investment.  After all, most of the evidence points towards further improvement.  First, as I noted earlier, profit margins and cash flows are high, and credit availability is improving.  Thus, those businesses with successful track records should be able to readily finance new investments.  Second, business fixed investment is not very high as a share of GDP and overall industrial capacity has been expanding only slowly.  This suggests that this sector is not over extended.  Third, the drop in U.S. energy costs relative to the rest of the world should spur more investment in the U.S. in energy intensive activities such as petrochemicals manufacturing.\n\nHowever, there are also some negatives here as well.   In particular, despite the positive factors I have cited, the growth in manufacturing output has been only moderate, with the overall manufacturing capacity utilization rate still below its pre-recession level.  Thus, outside of the energy intensive sectors, there still appears to be little near-term motivation for firms to invest in order to increase their productive capacity.  Businesses seem to be waiting for stronger demand before they significantly increase their investment outlays.  Thus, we have a second chicken-egg problem.\n\nOn the trade side, the news is mixed.  Although Japanese and European economic activity has picked up recently, the sustainability remains in question.  Even as Europe emerges from its recession, growth is likely to be anemic at best over the next year, constrained by continued fiscal consolidation and tight credit conditions as their banks continue to deleverage. In Japan, the consumption tax is scheduled to increase significantly next year, which is likely to constrain domestic demand.\n\nMoreover, the recent improvement in Europe and Japan has been offset by slowing in some emerging market economies. In fact, some emerging market economies are under pressure because they are running large current account and trade deficits.  Any forced correction among these countries on trade is likely to be a drag on global growth and on U.S. exports over the near term.  On balance, my outlook is that growth in the rest of the world will be roughly the same in 2014 as it is this year, so that the contribution of trade to growth will likely remain quite small.\n\nPutting all these factors together, I still conclude that there is a basis for a pickup in growth as fiscal restraint lessens, but the impulse is not likely to be a particularly powerful one without some unanticipated impetus to growth that solves the chicken-egg problems, especially in the near term.\n\nOn the inflation side of the ledger, inflation remains below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent  longer-run objective for the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator.  The year-over-year change in the total PCE deflator was 1.4 percent in July. This has created some concern that inflation is “too low,” raising real interest rates and making monetary policy less accommodative.  I acknowledge this concern, but I believe it will abate as inflation moves gradually back up towards a 2 percent annualized rate over the next few years.\n\nA number of considerations inform my view. First, a decomposition of core inflation reveals that the most recent slowing in inflation has been largely confined to core goods, whereas the rate of increase of core services has been relatively steady.  Such was not the case in 2010—the previous instance of a significant slowing of inflation.  This suggests that the fall in inflation partly reflects idiosyncratic factors that are not likely to be sustained.\n\nSecond, the recent data suggest that the downtrend in the inflation rate may be coming to an end.  For example, the core personal consumption expenditures deflator rose at a higher rate over the past three months than during any other 3-month period since mid-2012.\n\nThird, measures of longer-term inflation expectations, whether discerned from financial asset prices or from surveys of households or professional forecasters, remain well anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent objective.  This is important because inflation expectations are a major determinant of the inflation process.  As long as inflation expectations stay well-anchored, it will be hard for inflation to fall further.\n\nPutting these factors together along with my forecast of a gradual pickup in real economic activity, my outlook is for inflation to drift back toward our 2 percent objective over the medium term.  However, much like the case of the real growth outlook, there is significant uncertainty around this forecast.\n\nMonetary Policy So what does this all imply for monetary policy?  As you are aware, at last week’s FOMC meeting we made no changes to our monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided to continue to purchase long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at a monthly pace of $45 billion and $40 billion, respectively.   The FOMC statement reaffirmed the Committee’s intention “to continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.” 2\n\nWe also reaffirmed our forward guidance with respect to the federal funds rate.  The statement notes that the Committee, “currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.” 3\n\nSeveral questions have emerged following the meeting.  Most noteworthy was—given that market expectations were skewed towards anticipating the beginning of a taper at this meeting—why the Committee did not begin to reduce the pace of asset purchases.  Although I can’t speak for the Committee, I can provide some reasons for my own decision.\n\nTo begin to taper, I have two tests that must be passed:  (1) evidence that the labor market has shown improvement, and (2) information about the economy’s forward momentum that makes me confident that labor market improvement will continue in the future.  So far, I think we have made progress with respect to these metrics, but have not yet achieved success.\n\nWith respect to the first metric, we have seen labor market improvement since the program began last September. Over this time period, the unemployment rate has declined to 7.3 percent from 8.1 percent. 4 However, at the same time, this decline in the unemployment rate overstates the degree of improvement.  Other metrics of labor market conditions, such as the hiring, job-openings, job-finding rate, quits rate and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, collectively indicate a much more modest improvement in labor market conditions compared to that suggested by the decline in the unemployment rate.  In particular, it is still hard for those who are unemployed to find jobs.  Currently, there are three unemployed workers per job opening, as opposed to an average of two during the period from 2003 to 2007.\n\nWith respect to the second metric—confidence that the economic recovery is strong enough to generate sustained labor market improvement—I don’t think we have yet passed that test. The economy has not picked up forward momentum and a 2 percent growth rate—even if sustained—might not be sufficient to generate further improvement in labor market conditions.  Moreover, fiscal uncertainties loom very large right now as Congress considers the issues of funding the government and raising the debt limit ceiling.  Assuming no change in my assessment of the efficacy and costs associated with the purchase program, I’d like to see economic news that makes me more confident that we will see continued improvement in the labor market.  Then I would feel comfortable that the time had come to cut the pace of asset purchases.\n\nA few other points with respect to monetary policy are worth emphasizing following last week’s FOMC meeting.  First, as I have noted in earlier remarks, a decision to reduce the rate of asset purchases is not a tightening of monetary policy.  If we are purchasing additional securities we are simply adding accommodation at a slower pace.\n\nSecond, any decision to cut the pace of asset purchases should not be taken as signaling an early exit from this period of unusually low short-term rates.  We have established a threshold of 6.5 percent for the unemployment rate as long as we do not expect inflation to exceed 2 ½ percent at a one-to-two year horizon and inflation expectations remain well-anchored.   It is likely to take a considerable amount of time to reach the 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold.  Moreover, because the 6.5 percent unemployment rate is a threshold, and not a trigger, depending on the economic circumstances, we might wait a long time after we breach the threshold before we begin to raise our federal funds rate target.\n\nThe point I wish to emphasize is that any decisions on the pace of asset purchases (the rate at which we are adding accommodation) versus liftoff in terms of the federal funds rate (a tightening of monetary policy) should be viewed as largely independent of one another.   One does not foreshadow the other—certainly not in any mechanical way or with a definitive timeframe.   As Chairman Bernanke noted in last week’s press conference, our actions are data dependent and how the data will evolve is uncertain.\n\nIn addition, it is worth explaining why we anticipate the  federal funds rate is still likely to be quite low relative to what Committee participants consider normal over the longer run, even as the Committee gets close to its employment and inflation objectives.  For example, in the September Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 is 2 percent, far below the median long-run federal funds rate projection of 4 percent, at the same time that the unemployment rate and inflation are close to the Committee’s long-run objectives.\n\nHow does one explain this? As noted by Chairman Bernanke in last week’s press conference, the still low federal funds rate projections for 2016 reflect the fact that economic headwinds—such as tight credit standards and ongoing fiscal consolidation—are likely to take a long time to fully abate.  As a result, monetary policy will have to keep short-term interest rates very low for a sustained period in order for the Committee to achieve its objectives.\n\nMy view is that the neutral federal funds rate consistent with trend growth is currently very low. That’s one reason why the economy is not growing very fast despite the current accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Although the neutral rate should gradually normalize over the long-run as economic fundamentals continue to improve and headwinds abate, this process will likely take many years.  In the meantime, the federal funds rate level consistent with the Committee’s objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability will likely be well below the long-run level.\n\nFixed-Rate, Full Allotment Overnight Reverse Repo Facility Before I conclude, I want to discuss a new tool that the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the New York Fed will be testing and developing in coming months.  The new tool is a fixed-rate, full-allotment overnight reverse repo facility that would be available to a broad range of counterparties—not just open to the primary dealers through which we have historically conducted our open market operations. 5 By being available to a much broader array of counterparties, this should allow the Fed to tighten its control over money market rates.\n\nI’ll first explain in plain English what this facility is.  Then I’ll explain why we are testing it and what having such a facility in place might accomplish.\n\nA fixed-rate, full allotment overnight reverse repo facility is a facility in which the Federal Reserve posts a fixed interest rate and accepts cash from counterparties, which include banks, dealers, money market funds, and some government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), on an overnight basis in return for a security.  If implemented, the facility would be “full allotment”—that means the facility would have no cap on the amount of funds accepted from any of its counterparties at the posted overnight interest rate. 6 The repo facility is “reverse” because the direction in which the funds and securities move—participants are lending funds to the Fed rather than vice versa. Users of the facility are making the economic equivalent of an overnight collateralized loan of cash to the Federal Reserve.   The amount of funds invested in the facility is likely to be sensitive to the posted interest rate.  The higher the interest rate relative to comparable money market rates, the greater the participation is likely to be and vice versa.\n\nThere are several reasons motivating our interest in developing such a facility.  First, such a facility should enable the Federal Reserve to improve its control over the level of money market rates.  By offering a new, essentially risk-free investment, one would expect that anyone with access to such a facility would generally be unwilling to lend instead to someone else at a rate below that posted for the facility.  This should help to establish a floor on the level of overnight rates.   Right now, most short-term rates trade between 0 and 25 basis points, but occasionally T-bill and repo rates go negative, for example at quarter-end or when financial stresses increase the demand for very safe assets.  The full allotment element of the reverse repo facility would increase the availability of a risk-free asset, satisfying the demand when the appetite for safe assets increases.  This should help tighten the relationship between these and other money market rates.  These reverse repos would be available to an expanded set of counterparties that includes many of the money market lenders who are ineligible to earn the interest on excess reserves (IOER), such as GSEs and a number of money market funds. Depending on the facility rate, these lenders who cannot earn the IOER rate might get a better rate by investing in the overnight RRPs compared to lending to banks or to broker dealers. This competitive effect could, in and of itself, put a stronger floor on money market rates.\n\nSecond, this new facility is also likely to reduce the volatility of short-term interest rates.  If a lender that cannot earn the IOER rate has an unexpectedly large amount of funds to invest, this lender currently may have to accept an unusually low interest rate.  But with the overnight reverse repo facility in place, this lender could lend as much funds as desired to the facility at a fixed rate and this should reduce the downward pressure on money market rates.  By tightening control and reducing the volatility of short-term rates, such a facility should reassure investors that the Federal Reserve has sufficient tools to manage monetary policy effectively even with a very large balance sheet.\n\nI have told you what this facility is for.  Now let me emphasize what the testing and development of this facility does not foreshadow.  The testing and the development of the facility is not being undertaken to facilitate or expedite exit from our large balance sheet and should not be considered to be an element of the exit process.  The purpose  of the facility is to establish a floor on money market rates and to improve the implementation of monetary policy even when the balance sheet is large.  Even if our balance sheet increases significantly further and stays very large for many years, it will be useful to have this facility available to improve monetary policy control.\n\nIn coming months we will test the facility with two goals in mind.  First, we want to be assured that there are no glitches operationally with somewhat higher transaction volumes than in previous tests, that we can accept cash from a larger array of counterparties, post collateral in the tri-party repo system and reverse the transactions each day smoothly.  Second, while the limited size of the operations during this exercise will prevent the operations from having a significant impact on market rates, we will observe how the facility impacts individual investor demand relative to other market rates.  Additionally, we can see how sensitive that demand is to changes in market conditions such as quarter-end that increase the demand for safe assets.  These observations will give us some insight into how the facility could affect the entire constellation of money market rates.  Only by testing and learning will we be able to assess how best to use the facility.\n\nIn conclusion, let me turn back to the economic outlook and the role of monetary policy.  I do believe that we are making progress towards our objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.  The economic fundamentals are improving and I expect that the healing process will continue in the coming months and years.  At the same time, it is important to recognize that the financial crisis generated significant headwinds that are only slowly abating.  We must push against these headwinds forcefully to best achieve our objectives.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 This number refers to the change in the high-employment budget deficit for fiscal year 2013 as estimated by the CBO in March.\n\n2 Federal Open Market Committee statement , September 18, 2013\n\n3 Federal Open Market Committee statement , September 18, 2013\n\n4 The 8.1 percent unemployment rate refers to the August 2012 unemployment rate that was the latest information available to the Committee at its September 2012 meeting.\n\n5 The Desk has been conducting operational readiness exercises for the use of reverse repurchase agreements  since late 2009.  At the most recent FOMC meeting last week, the FOMC authorized the Desk to begin another testing program which begins today.  See the Desk’s September 20 announcement of the next round of testing.\n\n6 During the testing phase, a ceiling will be placed on the maximum amount that can be invested per counterparty.",

    "text": "Good morning. I am pleased to be back in Puerto  Rico to speak to you and meet with various communities in the Commonwealth. Each  visit gives me a chance to deepen the Bank's relationship with the island.  Last year I visited La Cantera and met with  community leaders, business people, academics, bankers and government  officials.  This year I visited Goya  Foods—the oldest Hispanic-owned plant in our country with subsidiary  facilities in my home state, New Jersey, and upstate New York.  I will also meet with a similar wide range of  people to talk about what we do and to hear first-hand the economic and  financial issues important to Puerto Ricans so that I can best represent all my  constituents in my work at the Fed. Your beautiful island is unique within the  Second Federal Reserve District. For me, personally, being here also recalls  special memories of my childhood visit with my parents.\n\nI thank the organizers for inviting me to speak  at the Export Trade Basics Forum, to help kick off the week-long summit on  Education, Exports and Entrepreneurship that begins next week. This morning I  will talk about economic conditions in the mainland and in Puerto Rico, paying particular  attention to the developments since my visit last year and to the role of  exports. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not  necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal  Reserve System.\n\nIntroduction to the New York Fed By way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the  New York Fed is, what we do, and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve  System, America's central bank, which was created by Congress in 1913. With this  act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to  manage the supply of money in the nation's economy. Congress designed the  central bank to be decentralized, representative of all regions of the country—including  Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands—and independent of the political process.\n\nThe Fed System is comprised of the Board of  Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency currently led by Chairman Ben  Bernanke—plus 12 regional Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the  district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern  counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands.\n\nEach Reserve Bank is distinct, with its own  charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the  Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made the central  bank independent so that policymakers could make decisions about monetary  policy—such as whether to adjust interest rates—in the national interest,  somewhat insulated from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to  Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for  monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with  price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual  mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and  stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close  attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is  very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe FOMC consists of the Board of Governors plus  the presidents of each of the 12 district Banks. It meets in Washington, D.C.,  eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy. As the current  New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings. At these  meetings, each committee member presents his or her current outlook for the  economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments  with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our  boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders.  My visit to Puerto Rico today is a part of these regional activities, in which  I learn first-hand about the economic and financial conditions important to  Puerto Ricans.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more  interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. For example,  the New York Fed is the Reserve Bank charged with implementing monetary policy.  This means that at the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury  securities. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we  supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate  Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide  banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from  around the world.\n\nFinally, I must mention that the New York Fed's  district could be the most diverse in the System: ranging from the urban  density of New York City to the forested sparseness of the northern  Adirondacks, to here in the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico.   All in  all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal  times.\n\nU.S. Economic Outlook Now, what is the outlook for economic activity, employment and inflation on the  mainland? In particular, what are the areas of vulnerability that we should be  most concerned about?\n\nI am pleased to say that the economic outlook for  the mainland has improved in the past six months. Despite this, we are still  very far away from achieving our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment  and price stability. Faster progress toward these objectives would be very  welcome.\n\nOn the activity side, a wide range of indicators  show a broadening and strengthening of demand by households and production by  firms. For example, on the demand side, after an unusually deep retrenchment  during the recession, consumer spending has begun to recover, and that recovery  strengthened considerably in the final months of 2010. Not surprisingly,  businesses' orders and production are following suit.\n\nThese factors led to a 3.1 percent growth rate  in our most comprehensive measure of national output (real, or  inflation-adjusted, gross domestic product or GDP) in the fourth quarter of  2010. Growth for the first quarter looks likely to be  similar, near 3 percent. In my view, the  revival in demand and production—while not as strong as desired—suggests that  we may be much closer to establishing a virtuous circle that will support  stronger growth. What I have in mind is a cycle in which rising household and business  demand generate more rapid income and employment growth, which in turn bolsters  confidence and leads to further increases in spending. This is why we upgraded  our assessment of the economy at last month's FOMC meeting, noting the economy  is now on a \"firmer footing\". The major missing piece of the puzzle has been the  absence of strong payroll job growth. We will need to see sustained strong  employment growth in order to be certain that this virtuous circle has become  firmly established.\n\nWith respect to the labor market, we have seen  some conflicting signals. On one hand, the unemployment rate has fallen sharply  over the past four months, dropping to 8.8 percent from 9.8 percent in November.  On the other hand, payroll employment gains have been relatively modest.\n\nThe good news is that the data on payroll  employment for the past two months was better than for the prior months. The  economy added a notable 216,000 jobs in March. Particularly encouraging is the  growth of manufacturing jobs. Over the past year we have added factory jobs at  the fastest pace since the 1990s. Other labor market indicators, such as  initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits and the employment  components of both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing business surveys have  also shown improvement recently.\n\nAlthough there is still uncertainty over the  timing and speed of the labor market recovery, I am hopeful that job growth  will increase more rapidly in the coming months. We would welcome this. A  substantial pickup is sorely needed. Even if we were to generate growth of  300,000 jobs per month, we would still likely have considerable slack in the  labor market at the end of 2012.\n\nSo, why is the economy finally showing more  signs of life? In my view, the improvement reflects three developments.\n\nFirst, household and financial institution  balance sheets continue to improve. On the household side, the 2008-09 rise in  the saving rate appears to have stabilized in the 5 percent to 6 percent range.  Meanwhile, the amount of money that households need to service their debt (for  mortgages, cars, credit cards) has fallen sharply to levels that prevailed  during the mid-1990s. Debt service has been pushed lower by a combination of  debt repayment, refinancing at lower interest rates and debt write-offs.  Financial institutions have strengthened their balance sheets by retaining  earnings and by issuing equity. Bank lending standards, while still tight, have  begun to ease somewhat. As a result, some measures of bank credit are beginning  to expand again.\n\nSecond, monetary policy and fiscal policy have  provided support to the recovery. On the monetary policy side, we at the Fed  have maintained unusually low levels of short-term interest rates and engaged  in large-scale asset purchases. These measures have fostered a sharp  improvement in financial market conditions. On the fiscal side (that is,  government spending and taxation), the economy has been supported by the shift  in policy to help support growth. In particular, the temporary reduction in payroll  taxes could have a strong impact on growth during the first part of this year.\n\nThird—and very much linked to the topic of this  meeting—is growth abroad. Much of the rest of the world—especially the emerging  market economies—have been growing strongly. This growth has led to an increase  in the demand for U.S.-made goods and services. Over the four quarters of 2010,  real, or inflation-adjusted, exports  rose 9.2 percent.  All told, real exports accounted for about 40  percent real GDP growth in 2010. In a few moments, I will talk about how this  growth abroad also presents an opportunity for Puerto Rico.\n\nThe firming in economic activity, in short, is  due both to natural healing and past and present policy support.\n\nIn this regard, it is important to emphasize  that we at the Federal Reserve have been expecting the economy to strengthen.  We provided additional monetary policy stimulus via the asset purchase program  to help ensure that the recovery regained momentum. A stronger recovery with  more rapid progress toward our dual mandate objectives is what we have been  seeking. This is welcome and not a reason to reverse course.\n\nYet, we must not be overly optimistic about the  growth outlook. The coast is not completely clear—the healing process in the  aftermath of the crisis takes time and there are still several areas of  vulnerability and weakness. In particular, housing activity remains unusually  weak and home prices have begun to soften again in many parts of the country.  State and local government finances remain under stress, and this is likely to  lead to further spending cuts, tax increases, or job losses in this sector that  will offset at least a part of the federal fiscal stimulus.\n\nMoreover, in recent weeks we have experienced  several shocks from abroad that could have some impact on the economy's forward  momentum, at least in the short term. For example, higher oil prices cut into  household purchasing power, and the tragedy in Japan is leading to supply  disruptions that may dampen growth somewhat in the near-term. Also, conditions in  Japan, the Middle East and North Africa remain uncertain and could worsen, with  negative implications for global economic growth. Furthermore, we cannot ignore  the risks stemming from the longer-term fiscal challenges that we face in the  United States.\n\nBut in the near-term, the most immediate  domestic problems may recede rather than become more prevalent. On the housing  side, stronger job growth should lead to more household formation. For example,  more young people will be able to move out of their parents' homes when they  get jobs. This trend should provide more support to housing demand. On the  state and local side, a rising economy would boost sales and income tax  revenue, and help narrow near-term fiscal shortfalls.\n\nWe also need to remain watchful to ensure that  low interest rates do not foster a buildup of financial excesses or bubbles  that might pose a medium-term risk to both full employment and price stability.  In this regard we monitor interest rates on risky and safer assets.  An unusual narrowing of these differences  could signal that risk is not being appropriately assessed. These differentials for risk on U.S.  assets in general do not seem obviously compressed today.\n\nOn the inflation side of the ledger, the risk of  deflation is greatly diminished. At the moment, both total, or headline,  inflation and core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy  prices, have increased but remain below levels consistent with our dual mandate  objectives—which most members of the FOMC consider to be 2 percent or a bit  less on the personal consumption expenditures measure. Moreover, the rise in  commodity prices is likely to put further upward pressure on headline inflation  in the coming months. Provided commodity prices level off around current  levels, the effect on inflation should be transitory. But we will need to  ensure that commodity price pressures do not cause inflation expectations to become  unmoored. If that were to occur, it would be more difficult to keep inflation  in check.\n\nTo sum up, economic conditions have improved in  the past year. Yet, the recovery is still tenuous. And, we are still far from  the mark with regard to the Fed's dual mandate. In particular, the unemployment  rate is much too high.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Puerto Rico Now let me turn to economic conditions in Puerto Rico. In contrast  to the situation during my last visit, I am pleased to see signs that the  Commonwealth may finally be emerging from this painful recession. Nevertheless,  conditions remain difficult for many families.\n\nThe recession here has been deeper than the downturn  on the mainland. By mid-2010, total employment in Puerto Rico had fallen by 13  percent or 138,000 jobs from its peak in 2005. This is almost double the 7  percent job loss on the mainland from the employment peak to its trough.  Furthermore, the recession in Puerto Rico has lasted about five years—three times  as long as the mainland downturn. The recovery has also lagged that of the  mainland. While the mainland's economy began to recover in mid-2009, Puerto  Rico's economy continued to decline for another year.\n\nBut, since mid-2010 there have been promising  signs: Recently released revisions suggest that job growth on the island, while  still very weak, improved modestly since last summer. And most of the weakness  since then has not been broad-based, but instead concentrated in construction  and manufacturing.  The unemployment rate  has come down by a full percentage point since its peak. However, at just over 16  percent, it remains unacceptably high.\n\nInflation generally remains subdued on the  Commonwealth—although there has been some recent volatility. After a period of  falling prices in 2009, inflation picked up in December 2009 with annualized  rates of around 4 percent for a few months—with medical care a key driver for  these increases. Since June 2010, reported inflation rates have reverted to a  range between 1 percent and 2 percent. However, the rise in food and energy  prices is likely to push inflation somewhat higher over the next few months.\n\nTo help keep track of conditions in Puerto Rico,  we can now look at the Institute of Statistics' new Manufacturing Purchasing  Managers Index (PR-PMI), which is conducted in conjunction with the Puerto Rico  Manufacturers Association and Scotiabank. The survey shows that business  conditions on the island were steady in January, following improvement at the  end of 2010. The PR-PMI has signaled growth for seven of the past nine months.  It will take some time before this new index has a clear track record, but we  welcome this source of timely information on economic activity in Puerto Rico.\n\nNow, what about credit conditions in Puerto Rico:  how much debt do families have and how have they been doing in terms of meeting  their obligations? I needn't tell you how important it has been to monitor these  trends over the course of the Great Recession. Using a new source of  information—the New York Fed's Consumer Credit Panel—we can now track how families  in the mainland and Puerto Rico have managed their credit in recent years.\n\nOverall, compared with the mainland, Puerto  Ricans avoided much of the recent boom and bust in the use of household credit.  Yet, signs of distress are readily apparent, owing to the long and deep  recession here. Unlike the mainland, households on the island did not raise  their borrowing much in the run-up to the recession. Thus, it is not surprising  that Puerto Rico did not see the sharp spike in loan delinquencies that many areas  saw from late 2007 to early 2009. Instead, Puerto Rico's delinquencies on  household debt—that is, the proportion of debt where payments are 90 or more  days late—have risen gradually as the recession has persisted. In 2005,  households were behind on about 5 percent of the total debt. As of 2010, they were  delinquent on about 9 percent of the debt, about the same as the national  average—reflecting the stress imposed on many families by the deep and long recession. The Outlook and Exports Looking ahead to the rest of 2011, I see grounds for cautious optimism. In particular,  exports, which have been so important to the economic recovery on the mainland,  have the potential to contribute to growth here in Puerto Rico as well.\n\nCurrently, Puerto Rico runs a sizeable trade  surplus, selling more products to the world than it buys. In 2009, the latest  year for which full-year data are reported, the value of exports was roughly  $60 billion compared with roughly $40 billion of imports. Based on data through  November, exports grew briskly, by about 10 percent, in 2010.\n\nWhat does Puerto Rico export? Pharmaceuticals  are by far the island's largest export. In addition, Puerto Rico is a  successful exporter of medical equipment, computer and electronic products, and  electrical equipment.\n\nThe mainland is Puerto Rico's primary trading  partner, accounting for half of the island's imports and three-quarters of its  exports. There are many reasons for this. While Puerto Rico interacts with many  other economies, for generations the mainland United States and Puerto Rico  have had a special multifaceted economic relationship. One of the most obvious  of these ties is the free flow of goods between the mainland and the island.  Another link is our common use of the dollar. This means that tourists from the  mainland can visit without worrying about changing currencies. In addition,  businesses can make long-term investments in Puerto Rico without worrying that  currency fluctuations against the dollar will undermine their competitiveness.\n\nThe island runs a surplus with the mainland that  accounts for much of the island's overall surplus. So the signs of a further  pickup in economic growth on the mainland bode well for the island.\n\nPuerto Rico's export markets also extend  overseas. Aside from the U.S. mainland, the top export markets for the Island are  Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and Spain. Exports to these four countries  combined exceeded $11 billion in 2009 and have grown by more than 30 percent  since 2007.\n\nThe success that Puerto Rico has in selling its  goods and services to industrialized countries bodes well for the island's  future. As more emerging economies narrow the gap between themselves and the  more developed countries, the market for Puerto Rico's goods could well expand  accordingly. Going forward, I would not be surprised to see Puerto Rico's  exports rise further as your companies take advantage of the opportunities  presented by the rapidly emerging economies.\n\nAt your upcoming forum and summit, you'll learn  more about how to develop export markets for your products. I applaud your  efforts to do so, as an important component of sustaining the vigor of the economic  recovery in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe Long View and the New York Fed's Role Although the signs I've mentioned suggest that the recession is over, the road  to sustained economic growth is likely to be challenging in the near term.\n\nIn its favor, Puerto Rico has some important  intrinsic advantages. These include natural beauty, a hospitable climate and  unique status as a major U.S. economic and population center in the Caribbean. Perhaps  just as important, the island has a relatively well-educated workforce.  Research shows quite convincingly that abundant human capital is an important  ingredient for a thriving economy.\n\nWe at the New York Fed aim to do our part to  help sustain growth in the Commonwealth. For example, we co-sponsor a financial  awareness video competition for college students here and the Community Reinvestment  Act Week activities with the Puerto Rico Bankers Association. And, as a member  of the Alliance for Economic and Financial Education we promote economic and  financial education via teacher training, a high school economic competition,  and a speaker series. The New York Fed also has several ongoing programs of technical  assistance in Puerto Rico.  We partnered  with other organizations throughout the year to help provide technical training  for community development professionals.   We cover the costs of two to three professors who are engaged in  macroeconomic and monetary policy research to attend our annual symposium on  current economic conditions held at the New York Fed.\n\nWe also recognize that a healthy banking system  and accurate economic statistics are both important components of a favorable  business climate. To improve our understanding of the Puerto Rican economy, the  New York Fed joined a group of local businesses to sponsor and fund a household  survey, undertaken by the Center for the New Economy to benchmark Puerto Rican  consumer finances. To help businesses and government in Puerto Rico, we have  also been providing technical assistance to Puerto Rico's new Institute for  Statistics in launching the new monthly manufacturing survey I mentioned earlier.  We applaud this and other efforts to improve the measurement of economic  conditions in Puerto Rico.\n\nAs a financial regulator, the New York Fed works  to help the financial system run smoothly so that it can support economic  growth. We are working hard to prevent the type of financial crisis that we  recently experienced from recurring in the future, in a way that does not  inhibit businesses from growing and prospering.\n\nWe are working closely with all of the banking  supervisors and other key parties to facilitate an effective resolution to the  problems facing the island's banking sector. Last year, some of Puerto Rico's  banks were consolidated and many improved their balance sheets by selling  underperforming assets.  Both of these  steps are likely to produce stronger, healthier institutions more able to make  the sound lending decisions that support economic growth.\n\nAll of these activities, ranging from effective monetary  policy and prudent financial regulation to fostering economic literacy and  measurement, complement and reinforce each other to help support a strong  economy in Puerto Rico.\n\nConclusion To sum up, the mainland economy experienced a pick-up in activity during the second  half of 2010 that shows signs of continuing in 2011. The recovery in Puerto  Rico has taken longer to get off the ground, but now shows signs of firming. On  the mainland and in Puerto Rico, unemployment remains stubbornly high, but many  indicators suggest that conditions are in place for stronger employment growth  in the coming months.\n\nWith government and business leaders like  yourselves working together to build a better future for Puerto Rico, I am  hopeful that we will soon be able to look back at 2010 and see not only the end  of the island's long recession but also the beginning of an era of growth and  prosperity for Puerto Rico.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be  happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today.  In my remarks, I will focus on the 2015 economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy.  In general, I will paint a reasonably positive picture—an economy that is likely to make further progress towards the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.  In fact, if my own forecast is realized, I would expect to favor raising the FOMC’s federal funds rate target sometime in 2015.  This would be a welcome development, because it would signify that the economy has healed sufficiently to warrant a somewhat less accommodative monetary policy.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Growth Outlook Is Improving\n\nSince the official end of the Great Recession more than five years ago, the U.S. economy has grown at a disappointing 2.3 percent annualized rate.  Several times over that period, it appeared that growth was breaking out on the upside, but each time such hopes were disappointed.  We are again at a similar junction.  Over the past few quarters, the pace of economic growth has picked up and the broad consensus is that the U.S. economy will grow at about a 2 ½-3 percent annual rate over the next year. 1\n\nWill these forecasts once again turn out to be too optimistic?  Subject to a few caveats that I discuss later, my view is that the likelihood of another disappointment has lessened.  The consensus forecast seems like a reasonable expectation, in part, because several of the “headwinds” restraining U.S. economic activity in recent years have subsided.  First, the housing sector is currently in much better balance.  The overhang of housing associated with the housing boom has largely been absorbed, and a recovery in housing prices has significantly shrunk the proportion of borrowers that are underwater on their mortgages—that is, those households that have outstanding mortgage balances higher than the value of their homes.  Also, measures of distress such as mortgage delinquencies and homes entering the foreclosure process have fallen.\n\nSecond, consumers are in better financial shape.  Households are carrying less debt, with total household liabilities roughly $500 billion below their cyclical peak in 2008.  Moreover, lower interest rates have facilitated significant mortgage debt refinancing, which has lowered the household debt service burdens.  Depending on the particular measure used, household debt service burdens relative to income have fallen back to levels last seen in the 1980s and 1990s.  In addition, household net worth has recovered sharply, boosted primarily by higher financial asset valuations, but also by some recovery in home prices.\n\nThird, the fiscal restraint that has held back growth in recent years has ended, with the federal budget deficit now at a level consistent with a stable to slowly declining federal debt-to-GDP ratio.  In the aggregate, state and local governments have also ended their retrenchment.  One important piece of evidence in this regard is the fact that state and local government employment is now rising at between 5,000 and 10,000 per month, after generally contracting during the 2009 to 2012 period.\n\nNow that these headwinds have subsided, buoyant financial market conditions spurred, in part, by a very accommodative monetary policy should do more to support economic activity.  In particular, compared to historical patterns, the current household net worth-to-income ratio is high relative to the personal saving rate.  This suggests some scope for a decline in the household saving rate.  If this were to occur, consumption growth would outstrip income growth.  Similarly, financial market conditions are conducive to sustained gains in business fixed investment.  Equity prices are high, borrowing costs are low, cash flows are strong and corporate balance sheets are healthy.\n\nAnother positive development for both the U.S. and the global economy is the sharp decline in energy prices.  Let’s start with the U.S. perspective.  Despite the impressive recent gains in natural gas and crude oil production, the U.S. still is a net importer of energy.  As a result, falling energy prices are beneficial for our economy.  In economist parlance, falling energy prices are a positive “terms of trade” shock for the U.S.  Over the near-term, this will lead to a significant rise in real income growth for households and should be a strong spur to consumer spending.  Since energy expenditures represent a higher proportion of outlays for lower income households, falling energy prices disproportionately raise their real incomes.  Also, because such households are more liquidity constrained, with budgets that often bind paycheck to paycheck, they have a higher tendency to spend any additional real income.  As a result, much of the boost to real household income from falling energy prices is likely to be spent, not saved.\n\nMore broadly, the decline in energy prices also will be supportive to the global growth outlook in two other ways.  First, by pulling down inflation in many countries it will spur more expansive monetary policy.  We are already seeing this response in Europe and Japan.  Second, the decline in energy prices is also likely to ease the global fiscal stance.  Over the near-term, for oil exporting governments, falling revenue will not be fully offset by reduced expenditures.  This will cause major oil exporters to run either smaller budget surpluses or bigger budget deficits.  In the aggregate, the swing from oil producers to consumers is quite large.  For example, a $20 per barrel decline in global oil prices results in an income transfer of about $670 billion per year from producers to consumers. 2 This understates the total effect because it does not include any knock-on reductions in other energy prices—such as for natural gas—that, outside the U.S., often are linked to oil prices.\n\nObviously, if the oil price declines were to both intensify and persist, this would have negative implications for oil and gas investment in the U.S.  At a minimum, as cash flows fall, some producers will cut back on their drilling activity rather than plug the shortfall with outside financing.\n\nNevertheless, there are several reasons why I don’t think this risk should be overstated, especially if oil prices stabilize around current levels.  First, even after the large gains in recent years, oil and gas investment remains a small fraction of GDP.  Second, domestic natural gas investment should be relatively unaffected because U.S. natural gas prices are largely insensitive to global energy price developments.  This reflects the high costs associated with exporting natural gas and the fact that most of our oil production is used for transportation purposes.  Thus, the ability to substitute lower cost natural gas for oil is limited.  Third, extraction costs vary appreciably across the different major oil fields.  There is not a single critical price that will constrain production or investment.  Fourth, with respect to oil produced by fracking, productivity gains have cut drilling costs and raised oil production, so breakeven costs per barrel have been falling.  Finally, if oil investment were to soften, this would lead to lower breakeven costs as resources currently in short supply—e.g., water, welders, housing and transport—became more available and less expensive.\n\nOf course, as with any forecast, there is some meaningful chance that growth will turn out to be either weaker or stronger than expected.  However, I believe that the risks around this forecast are reasonably well balanced.  The subsiding headwinds that I discussed earlier are the primary reason for seeing the downside risks as limited.  In contrast, the ongoing geopolitical risks remain substantial.\n\nAt the same time, several factors suggest that growth is unlikely to turn out to be substantially stronger than the consensus forecast.  First, the upside from housing relative to the forecast is likely limited.  Although there has been an impressive recovery of multi-family housing starts over the past few years, single-family housing starts are growing only slowly and are unlikely to climb much faster over the next year or two.  The demand for new homes is still hindered by tight credit conditions for homebuyers.  Mortgage lenders continue to be extremely risk averse in extending new credit, and mortgage availability to those with lower credit scores is still significantly constrained.  I don’t anticipate that this situation will change in a material way any time soon.\n\nSecond, because motor vehicle sales are now close to their pre-recession levels, the future growth impetus from this cyclical sector will likely also be restrained going forward.  Third, growth in the rest of the world has slowed slightly and the dollar has appreciated somewhat.  This will limit the growth in U.S. exports, and suggests that the trade sector is unlikely to provide much support to growth over the next year or two.\n\nInflation: Lower Now, but Likely to Drift Gradually Higher Next Year\n\nLet me now turn to discuss the inflation outlook.  Inflation has been running below the Federal Reserve’s objective of a 2 percent annualized rate for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator.  For example, over the past twelve months, the overall PCE deflator has risen by 1.4 percent, and the core PCE deflator, which excludes food and energy, has increased by 1.6 percent.  Recently, the overall index has been pulled down by sharply lower oil and gasoline prices.  Also, I expect that core goods prices will be held down somewhat over the near-term by the recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar.  Nevertheless, I expect inflation will begin to move back towards our 2 percent objective in 2015.  As the economy expands and the labor market continues to tighten, resource slack should decline and this should gradually exert some upward pressure on prices.  Also, despite some softness in market-based measures of inflation compensation, inflation expectations still seem well-anchored and this should also work to pull inflation gradually higher.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nSo, what does this assessment of the growth and inflation outlook imply for monetary policy?  Since the September 2012 announcement of the Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities asset purchase program, there has been substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.  Recognizing its success in meeting the FOMC’s stated objectives, the FOMC decided to end the asset purchase program at the end of October.\n\nNow that we have ended our asset purchase program, attention has turned to the monetary policy normalization process.  There are four important questions regarding this process: When to begin? How to begin? How fast to go? And, how far to go? Let me consider each question in turn.\n\nWith respect to the question of when to begin, it is still premature to begin to raise interest rates, that is, to “lift off” from the zero lower bound.  As the FOMC concluded in its most recent statement: “The Committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month.”\n\nBut this sentence should not be viewed as an iron-clad commitment unaffected by economic and financial developments.  The statement goes on to say: “However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.”  In other words, the FOMC’s monetary policy actions and the timing of lift-off will depend on how the economic outlook evolves, particularly with respect to the labor market and inflation.\n\nIn considering the appropriate timing of lift-off, there are three important reasons to be patient.  First, the Committee is still undershooting both its employment and inflation objectives.  Unemployment is too high and inflation is too low.  Thus, monetary policy needs to be very accommodative in order to close these gaps relative to the Committee’s objectives.  Second, when interest rates are at the zero lower bound, the risks of tightening a bit too early are likely to be considerably greater than the risks of tightening a bit too late.  A premature tightening might lead to financial conditions that are too restrictive, resulting in a weaker economy and, in turn, an aborted lift-off.  This would be problematic in that it would harm the Fed’s credibility and, more importantly, would be difficult to rectify.  The U.S. experience during the Great Depression and the Japanese experience over the past two decades illustrate the risks of raising interest rates too soon, especially when inflation is running below the central bank’s objective.  Finally, given the still high level of long-term unemployment and the outlook for inflation, there could be a significant benefit to allowing the economy to run “slightly hot” for a while in order to get those that have been unemployed for a long time working again.  I believe this can be done without jeopardizing our price stability objective.  If the long-term unemployed are not employed relatively soon, their job skills will erode further, reducing their long-term prospects for employment and, therefore, the productive capacity of the U.S. economy.  This would be a very unfortunate outcome for them, their families and the country.\n\nMarket expectations that lift-off will occur around mid-2015 seem reasonable to me.  Although that could change depending on how the economy evolves, my views on “when” do not differ appreciably from the most recent primary dealer and buy-side surveys undertaken by the New York Fed prior to the October FOMC meeting. 3\n\nI hope the economic outlook evolves so that it will be appropriate to begin to raise interest rates sometime next year.  While raising interest rates is often portrayed as a difficult task for central bankers, in fact, given the events since the onset of the financial crisis, it would be a development to be truly excited about.  When the FOMC begins to raise its federal funds rate target, this would indicate that the U.S. economy is finally getting healthier, and that the Committee believes it is on a sustainable track to achieving its dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  That would be very good news, even if it were to cause a bump or two in financial markets.\n\nSo, when the appropriate time comes, how is the process of monetary policy normalization likely to unfold?  In this regard, the revised policy normalization principles and plans that the FOMC released following the September FOMC meeting are informative. 4 In particular, the Committee will begin to normalize monetary policy by first raising its target range for the federal funds rate and short-term interest rates will be the primary tool used for tightening monetary policy.  After lift-off looks sustainable and the federal funds rate is somewhat above the zero lower bound, the Committee will cease to reinvest those funds generated by maturing Treasury securities and prepayments of agency MBS securities.  The Committee anticipates that the balance sheet will gradually normalize passively as these assets run off, not actively via asset sales.\n\nThe effective federal funds rate will be pushed into a higher target range by raising the interest rate paid on excess reserves (IOER).  The overnight reverse repo repurchase (ON RRP) facility will play a secondary role, in the sense that it will be used “only to the extent necessary” to help put a floor under the federal funds rate, and it will be phased out when it is no longer needed.\n\nWith respect to “how fast” the normalization process will proceed, that depends on two factors—how the economy evolves, and how financial market conditions respond to movements in the federal funds rate target.  Financial market conditions mainly include, but are not necessarily limited to, the level of short- and long-term interest rates, credit spreads and availability, equity prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  When the FOMC adjusts its short-term federal funds rate target, this does not directly influence the economy since little economic activity is linked to the federal funds rate.  Instead, monetary policy affects the economy as the current change in short-term interest rates and expectations about future monetary policy changes influence financial market conditions more broadly.\n\nDevelopments in financial market conditions are thus an important element in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy.  Changes in financial market conditions influence economic growth through a number of channels.  For example, a stronger equity market raises household wealth and lowers the desired personal saving rate—lifting consumer spending. A stronger equity market also reduces the cost of capital for business, which may help encourage greater investment spending.  Lower long-term interest rates push down business financing costs, which also supports investment spending.  At the same time, lower mortgage rates support housing demand and reduce household interest outlays.  A weaker dollar supports growth by making imports more expensive and by increasing export competitiveness.  The combined effect is to increase net exports.\n\nIf the linkage from the federal funds rate to financial market conditions were stable over time, there would be no need to focus on financial market conditions.  In a world in which the linkage was solid and unchanging, adjustments to the short-term interest rate and communication about future policy would have a predictable and reliable effect on financial market conditions.  Central bankers, then, could keep their focus narrowly on their policy rate.\n\nHowever, as has been very clear, especially in recent years, this linkage is not stable.  Thus, how much one pushes on the short-term interest rate lever depends, in part, on how financial market conditions respond to such adjustments.  Imagine driving a car where the connection between the gas pedal and the engine speed was variable and uncertain.  The driver would have to constantly monitor and adjust the pressure on the gas pedal to achieve the desired speed.  Similarly, we will have to monitor and adjust short-term interest rates to achieve financial market conditions consistent with achieving our labor market and inflation objectives.  All else equal, less responsiveness implies larger interest rate adjustments and vice versa.\n\nQuickly, let me give two examples that illustrate how variable this linkage can be.  First, during the 2004-07 period, the FOMC tightened monetary policy nearly continuously, raising the federal funds rate from 1 percent to 5.25 percent in 17 steps.  However, during this period, 10-year Treasury note yields did not rise much, credit spreads generally narrowed and U.S. equity price indices moved higher.  Moreover, the availability of mortgage credit eased, rather than tightened.  As a result, financial market conditions did not tighten.\n\nAs a result, financial conditions remained quite loose, despite the large increase in the federal funds rate.  With the benefit of hindsight, it seems that either monetary policy should have been tightened more aggressively or macroprudential measures should have been implemented in order to tighten credit conditions in the overheated housing sector.\n\nSecond, during the financial crisis, especially during the fall of 2008, financial market conditions tightened dramatically even as the FOMC was cutting its federal funds rate target to zero.  Monetary accommodation turned out to be insufficient to produce an easing of financial market conditions, and the economy fell into a deep recession.\n\nOver time, financial market conditions have become a much more important factor in evaluating the appropriate setting of monetary policy and the level of short-term interest rates.  This reflects several factors.  First, over the past few decades, as the U.S. capital markets have grown in size and scope, the U.S. financial system has become much less bank-centric.  This has loosened the linkage between the federal funds rate and financial market conditions.  Second, the U.S. economy and financial markets have become more interconnected globally.  Thus, the impact of U.S. monetary policy has become more diffused, and financial market conditions have come to depend increasingly not only on developments in the U.S., but also on developments elsewhere.  As an example, the low level of U.S. 10-year Treasury yields presumably is due, in part, to the fact that long-term interest rates in Europe and Japan are much lower.\n\nSo, if the effect of short-term rate changes on financial market conditions has become less predictable and more variable over time, what implications does this have for U.S. monetary policy?  From my perspective, there are three major implications that deserve attention.\n\nFirst, when lift-off occurs, the pace of monetary policy normalization will depend, in part, on how financial market conditions react to the initial and subsequent tightening moves.  If the reaction is relatively large—think of the response of financial market conditions during the so-called “taper tantrum” during the spring and summer of 2013—then this would likely prompt a slower and more cautious approach.  In contrast, if the reaction were relatively small or even in the wrong direction, with financial market conditions easing—think of the response of long-term bond yields and the equity market as the asset purchase program was gradually phased out over the past year—then this would imply a more aggressive approach.  The key point is this:  We will pursue the monetary policy stance that best generates the set of financial market conditions most consistent with achievement of the FOMC’s dual mandate objectives.  This depends both on how financial market conditions respond to the Fed’s policy actions and on how the real economy responds to the changes in financial conditions.\n\nThe second major implication is to be cautious about overreliance on simple monetary policy rules, such as the Taylor Rule, that do not include measures of financial market conditions in their formulation.  As you may recall, in a Taylor Rule the nominal federal funds rate depends on an equilibrium or neutral real rate of interest—which is assumed to be constant over time—the deviation of the level of economic activity from estimates that would be consistent with long-run price stability and the deviation of inflation from the central bank’s target.\n\nAs I have noted elsewhere, the Taylor Rule formulation has a number of characteristics that make it a useful input into the policy-setting process.  First, it very explicitly focuses on the two parameters—the long-term inflation objective and the level of potential output consistent with that objective—that map directly to the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives.  Second, standard Taylor Rules are self-equilibrating.  They respond to economic shocks and forecast errors in a way that pushes the economy back toward the central bank’s objectives.  Market participants incorporating information about the rules in their price-setting decisions helps keep inflation expectations well-anchored.  Third, academic research shows that Taylor-type rules typically perform quite well across a wide range of economic models.  This is important because we want guides to policy that are robust; that is, guides that are not overly sensitive to model-specific assumptions about how the economy works, or how households and businesses alter their expectations and behavior in response to changes in monetary policy. 5\n\nDespite these attractive features, I do not believe that simple policy rules can take the place of in-depth analysis of economic and financial market conditions.  While simple policy rules provide useful benchmarks to policymakers, their very virtue—their simplicity—is also a significant shortcoming.  Policy rules cannot capture all of the information that is relevant for policymaking.  In particular, such rules do not capture the fact that the linkage between the federal funds rate and financial market conditions can be very loose.  This is a critical shortcoming because this looseness affects the stability of the relationship between monetary policy and economic outcomes.  If the relationship between monetary policy, financial conditions and the real economy were stable over time, then following a relatively simple and unchanging policy rule would likely generate acceptable results.  However, if the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy is more variable and uncertain, as I believe it is, then an approach that takes this explicitly into consideration will be more effective.\n\nThe third implication that stems from the fact that financial market conditions matter in the conduct of monetary policy pertains to the so-called “Fed put” with respect to equity prices.  The notion here is that because the Federal Reserve cares about unanticipated and undesired changes in financial market conditions, the Fed will respond to weakness in equity prices by easing monetary policy—essentially providing a put to equity investors.  The expectation of such a put is dangerous because if investors believe it exists they will view the equity market as less risky.  This will cause investors to push equity market values higher, increasing the likelihood of an equity market bubble and, when such a bubble bursts, the potential for a sharp shock that could threaten financial stability and the economy.\n\nLet me be clear, there is no Fed equity market put.  To put it another way, we do not care about the level of equity prices, or bond yields or credit spreads per se.  Instead, we focus on how financial market conditions influence the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy.  At times, a large decline in equity prices will not be problematic for achieving our goals.  For example, economic conditions may warrant a tightening of financial market conditions.  If this happens mainly via the channel of equity price weakness—that is not a problem, as it does not conflict with our objectives.  In contrast, when we want financial market conditions to be extremely accommodative—as has been the case in recent years when we have been far away from our employment and inflation objectives—then we will take into consideration a broad set of developments with respect to interest rates, the stock market and other measures of financial conditions in choosing the appropriate stance for monetary policy.\n\nBecause financial market conditions affect economic activity only slowly over time, this suggests that we should look through short-term volatility and movements in financial markets.  We should not respond until we become convinced that the movements will likely, without action on our part, prove sufficiently persistent to conflict with achievement of our objectives.  Often, financial markets can be quite volatile and move a lot without disturbing underlying economic performance.\n\nFinally, let me turn to the issue of “how much,” in other words, what federal funds rate target over the long term is consistent with our employment and inflation objectives.  This issue is more difficult to judge for a number of reasons.  First, it depends on how financial conditions evolve in response to our monetary policy adjustments.  Second, it depends on other factors, such as potential real GDP growth, which in turn, depends on the growth of the labor force and productivity growth trends.  My current thinking, in this regard, is that the equilibrium federal funds rate consistent with 2 percent inflation will be somewhat lower in the future than in the past.  In part, this reflects the likelihood that potential real GDP growth will likely be somewhat lower going forward due to slower growth in the labor force.  But my confidence in this conclusion may change on the basis of incoming empirical evidence.  In fact, I suspect my views will evolve as I see how the economy responds over time to higher interest rates and tighter financial market conditions.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn my remarks today, I have provided my current thinking about the U.S. growth and the inflation outlook, and the implications for monetary policy.  To sum up, the U.S. economic outlook looks brighter, with growth likely to be somewhat above the trend of the past five years.  The risks to growth appear generally balanced, without unusually high risks that growth will either be much stronger or weaker than my forecast.  On inflation, I remain confident, despite the recent softening, that inflation will begin to move up towards our 2 percent objective next year.  This move will not likely happen immediately, however, given the recent weakness in energy prices and the fact that non-energy import price trends are also likely to soften a bit over the near-term.\n\nWith respect to monetary policy, I believe that market expectations as captured by the most recent New York Fed’s surveys of primary dealers and market participants are reasonable—with lift-off expected to take place sometime around the middle of next year.  But, life is uncertain and my judgment of the appropriate timing could change in response to incoming data and other factors that change the economic outlook.  When we do begin to tighten monetary policy, the pace of tightening will depend not only on the outlook but also on how financial market conditions respond as we begin to remove monetary policy accommodation.  Financial market conditions are an important transmission mechanism of monetary policy.  This is why I don’t favor indiscriminately adhering to simple policy rules that exclude financial market conditions.\n\nI hope the FOMC can begin to raise its federal funds rate target next year.  This would signify that the economy has made sufficient progress towards the FOMC’s objectives and that the time had finally come to begin to unwind the current high degree of monetary policy accommodation.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 See, for example, the latest Blue Chip consensus survey (volume 39, no. 11, November 10, 2014).

    "text": "Good morning, I am pleased to be at Pace University to address the university community of students, alumni, faculty and university supporters.  It is always a pleasure to speak with academic audiences who I find to be particularly well-informed and attentive. I thank you for inviting me here today.  In a timely note, I also want to commend Pace University for fielding an excellent Fed Challenge team this year.  As many of you know, Pace won the Second District College Fed Challenge this year and has just returned with an honorable mention from competing in the nationals at the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.\n\nToday, I want to talk a bit about the Fed—what we do and why we do it. Then I’ll provide some thoughts about the national and local economic outlook and monetary policy.\n\nIn covering the region and the nation, I will discuss the terrible impact of Sandy on the region and the implications for the national economy. I know I will fall short in fully acknowledging all the hardship that our fellow citizens have endured—including devastating losses of loved ones, homes, communities and livelihoods—as well as widespread misery caused by flooding and disruptions to power, fuel, food, transportation and other services across the region.  Nor will I be able to fully commend the ways in which family members, neighbors, co-workers and strangers have helped those in need. I am deeply moved by the evidence of people reaching out and pulling together across the region.\n\nAt the New York Fed we are committed to supporting the recovery process. In addition to our economic analysis, we are convening our advisory groups and other regional contacts to receive first-hand accounts of the impact on communities, families and businesses and to assess other ways in which we may help. For example, we are holding a clinic in Staten Island to help people obtain information about different types of financial support that is available. We’re also encouraging banks to show appropriate flexibility when dealing with small business and other borrowers impacted by the storm.\n\nAfter my remarks, I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about what the Fed does and why, and about the economic outlook. But I won’t comment specifically on the upcoming FOMC meeting next month.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC.\n\nWhat the New York Fed Does By way of introduction, I will briefly review what my colleagues and I do at the New York Fed. The New York Fed is one of 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks that, together with the Board of Governors in Washington D.C., make up the Federal Reserve System, our nation’s central bank.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is independent within our government. By law, we are charged with managing the nation’s monetary policy—taking actions that raise or lower interest rates to promote full employment and price stability. The Federal Reserve is also charged with promoting financial stability, without which we cannot achieve our economic objectives. We play an important role in the nation’s payments and settlements system, which some people call the financial system’s “plumbing.”  For example, we help ensure that banks’ ATMs have cash and that the checks you write move the money to the recipient. In addition, we have a specific mandate to promote economic development in each of our regions.\n\nAs president of the New York Fed, I serve as the vice chair of the FOMC, the Federal Reserve committee that meets eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make decisions about monetary policy.  The members of this committee all strive to achieve our statutory mandate of full employment and price stability.  Sometimes we have different views on the specific policy choices at hand, and our policy decisions reflect a full discussion of these differences. This diversity of viewpoints is a key strength of the FOMC.\n\nIn fact, I believe we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike. But we are united in our commitment to our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability and in our belief that preserving the independence of the Federal Reserve in making monetary policy decisions is very much in the public interest. That independence allows us to make tough decisions based on data and analysis—insulated from short-term political considerations.\n\nAt FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her District and for the nation. In formulating these assessments, we consult with many sources—our boards of directors, regional advisory councils, community leaders and other key stakeholders.  My meeting with you today is part of this systematic effort to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy.\n\nTo add to what I learn from my conversations, my colleagues and I at the New York Fed continually track conditions in our District, and we have created special tools for that purpose. For example, my staff tracks local household credit conditions, including the amount and type of personal debt and whether repayments are timely.\n\nWe also conduct a periodic poll about the credit needs of small businesses, which are an important source of new jobs in the District. If you represent a small business and would like to participate in our next poll, please pass your card to my colleagues, who are in the audience, or see me after the speech.\n\nTo promote growth in our local communities, we publish extensive data and analysis on the local economy. We provide outreach initiatives, including workshops on access to global markets and to help small businesses learn about loan programs and sources of credit enhancements. We also run an annual video festival for local college and university students. In this program student teams produce videos that aim to help young adults make sound personal financial decisions. A panel of advertising and video professionals selects winning video productions for screening in local movie theaters.\n\nAs you know, even regions as wealthy as ours have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some of our work specifically to low- and moderate-income groups.\n\nWe have worked hard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates. This fall we hosted a conference on distressed residential real estate to share new expert analysis with senior policymakers and practitioners from across the nation. Later today, colleagues from our Research department will provide a press briefing on the housing outlook in our region as a whole. Next week, we will be holding a workshop so we can better understand the factors that are limiting the pass-through of lower yields on agency mortgage bonds into primary mortgage rates offered to borrowers.  We will then be in a better position to evaluate what steps if any might be taken by the relevant authorities to contribute to greater pass-through.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions Our region's economy was on a moderate upward trajectory before Sandy struck, and while the storm had many severe effects—more on that in a few minutes—I do not expect it to derail the region’s ongoing economic expansion.\n\nNew York City's economy has been performing quite well.  Employment in the city reached an all-time high at the beginning of this year and it has continued to grow briskly since then, even without help from its key finance sector.  While job growth has been considerably more subdued in the surrounding areas, such as Long Island, northern New Jersey, Fairfield County and the lower Hudson Valley, many workers in these areas commute to New York City for their jobs, so the strength here in the city is helpful to the region as a whole. Still, the unemployment rate in the city remains high, above 9 percent, and this is something that needs to improve.  Upstate New York's economy is also on a generally positive trajectory, although some areas have fared better than others.  Albany, Buffalo, and especially, Rochester and Ithaca have recouped many of the jobs lost during the recession, whereas Syracuse and Binghamton have lagged.\n\nLooking beyond the employment statistics, I see other encouraging signs across the region.  Housing markets here have improved.  There has also been a noticeable pickup in multi-family construction in both New York and New Jersey this year.\n\nHowever, the New York Fed's measures of regional credit conditions suggest continued financial challenges for families here.  Data that we just released for the third quarter of 2012 show that for those individuals with a credit report, average debt per person in New Jersey was about $61,000, and about $49,000 in the state of New York. Overall debt per person peaked in 2008.  Although balances nationally have fallen by over 11 percent, consumers in New York and New Jersey have brought down their indebtedness more moderately, by 5 percent and 6 percent respectively.\n\nWhile the overall delinquency rates are decreasing nationally, delinquent balances in our region have remained stable or even increased a bit. In both New York and New Jersey, nearly 9 percent of balances are 90 or more days delinquent, higher than the 6.5 percent national rate.\n\nAlthough there are some recent signs that home prices are starting to firm, the housing crisis continues to take a toll on our homeowners. Delinquency rates on mortgages, at 9.4 percent and 9.7 percent in New York and New Jersey, respectively, remain considerably higher than the 5.9 percent national rate.\n\nBefore discussing the national outlook let me talk briefly about the possible effects of “Superstorm Sandy” on the U.S. and regional economy.  The damage and disruptions from the storm appear more extensive and longer-lasting than first anticipated.\n\nOf course, there is the physical damage, which was geographically widespread, but particularly devastating in some communities right here in New York City, including Breezy Point, the Rockaways, and portions of Staten Island, and in so many cities and towns along the Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut waterfronts, such as Long Beach, Seaside Heights, Spring Lake and Hoboken.\n\nEstimates of the costs of disruption to economic activity—that is, services that couldn't be rendered and goods that couldn't be produced because of protracted transit shutdowns, power outages and other such damage produced by the storm—are particularly difficult to pin down.  Thus, it will be some time before concrete figures are available.  However, the early read from recently-released data confirm these disruptions have been widespread.  Every one of the New York City area firms that responded to our recent Empire State Manufacturing Survey—fielded one to two weeks after the storm—indicated that the storm disrupted activity at their firm, and 40 percent of them indicated that they were completely shut down or severely crippled for at least five days. Furthermore, the number of workers filing initial claims for unemployment insurance in both New York and New Jersey surged to more than triple their pre-storm levels in the week after Sandy hit, suggesting at least 70,000 storm-related job losses in these two states thus far.\n\nThese data suggest that the disruptions that we have seen, and continue to see, could be substantial.  We can quantify the losses in terms of days of lost output.  Given the regional GDP of $1.4 trillion, a rough calculation yields a loss of $3.8 billion for each full-day equivalent of lost output in the region.\n\nA considerable part of this lost activity will be offset over time or be replaced by a temporary shift of activity from hard-hit areas to less-affected places. But, in a services-based economy, much activity cannot be shifted in time: restaurants, for instance, can’t serve six meals a day to make up for lost business. The fact that many people who would have dined in lower Manhattan in the weeks following Sandy are instead patronizing restaurants near their homes or near temporary work sites represents an offset for the regional economy as a whole.  But that’s little consolation for the original restaurant, which may in turn need to lay off some of its people or could even possibly go out of business. And, of course, this applies even more dramatically to businesses in hard-hit places along the regional shoreline.\n\nAgainst this, reconstruction began soon after the storm was over and has likely intensified since then.  The repair and replacement of damaged or destroyed infrastructure, homes, and businesses is likely to continue for some time. Programs will need to be well designed in order to achieve maximum beneficial impact. For instance, on the housing front, it will be important to ensure that program design and funding recognize that our region has a wide variety of housing types—including multifamily and public housing—that are in need of repair post-Sandy.  In other words, one-size-fits-all solutions may not work well here.\n\nPast studies suggest that reconstruction spending provides a powerful stimulus to local economies, both in its direct effects and its associated multiplier effects.  Thus, I expect that reconstruction will provide a similar sizeable boost to our regional economic activity, and one that is likely to continue well into 2013.\n\nAll this analysis must be viewed as early and provisional.  Putting all the factors together, at present I expect that economic activity in our region was adversely affected in October and November, but will show a noticeable rebound starting in December.\n\nIn addition to the economic costs in terms of lost activity there are, of course, the costs in terms of human suffering to the millions of people who were adversely affected—above all those who lost homes and loved ones, but also the many others who were cold and without power for days on end, spent hours getting to and from work, waited on long gas lines, and experienced the stress of not knowing what lies ahead.\n\nWe are also tracking the impact of Sandy on schools and students. In New Jersey, 60 percent of schools were closed more than one and a half weeks. The storm shut down all New York City schools for a full week, and many schools across the region remained closed the following week. Hardships borne by students and families are also reflected in record low post-storm attendance rates. The New York City Department of Education moved quickly to relocate schools from damaged buildings to temporary premises, enabling children to resume their studies.  But even two weeks after the storm, schools that had to be relocated had attendance rates below 70 percent, a huge drop from their regular rates of over 90 percent. Research shows that lost school days and relocations can significantly impair student learning.\n\nThe good news is that the situation is getting closer to normal every day. Today, only 9 out of a total of 1,750 New York City schools remain relocated. Also of particular importance is that their leaders—administrators, teachers, principals and others—have agreed to make up three and a half days of the lost time.  It is impressive that so many districts across the region are working hard to make up for much of the lost time.\n\nOur region must learn the right lessons from this experience. The storm revealed significant shortcomings in the resilience of our public and private infrastructures in three critical areas: power, transport and communications.  This vulnerability must be addressed.\n\nNational Economic Conditions Turning to the storm’s effects on the national economy, I expect a modest negative effect on the annualized growth rate of real GDP for the fourth quarter of 2012. It is impossible to calibrate this precisely at this juncture, but I would guess this would be in the region of 0.25 to 0.50 of a percentage point. It is important to note that the storm affected much of the Northeast Corridor, a densely populated area responsible for about 15 percent of GDP. Normal economic activity in the final days of October and the first few days of November was severely disrupted. The disruption then began to subside, but only recently has life begun to feel normal again. The negative effects of this disruption have already been noted in economic indicators such as industrial production for the month of October and initial claims for unemployment insurance during the second and third weeks of November.\n\nYet, some of the economic disruption experienced here was offset to some extent by stronger than normal activity elsewhere.  For example, plants in Ohio or South Carolina making portable generators may have worked overtime to fill the increased demand.  Second, some types of disrupted activity, such as the purchase of a car or a housing start, can be made up before the fourth quarter is over. Lastly, as I mentioned before, repair and replacement of damaged property is already underway, offsetting some of the earlier disruption. This rebuilding will continue well into 2013, likely providing for somewhat stronger growth than otherwise would have been the case. Indeed, economic studies of disasters in the U.S. and other advanced economies find that the longer-term effects on national economies have typically been negligible.  Given the resilience of the U.S. economy, I expect the long-run effects of Sandy to be similarly small.\n\nEven before the storm, though, the pace of U.S. economic growth was disappointing—averaging only slightly above a 2 percent annualized growth since the recovery began in mid-2009.  As a consequence, the national unemployment rate remains unacceptably high, and its decline during the recovery has been grudging. In addition, too many people are discouraged from looking for work. This has depressed the participation rate and held down the official unemployment rate. Moreover, 5 million workers have been unemployed for six months or more. While job growth has picked up some recently, its pace has been insufficient to materially change the labor market picture.\n\nIn terms of activity, there are a few bright spots.  For example, the growth rate of consumer spending was a bit firmer in the third quarter.  Another area showing improvement is the housing market.  Housing starts and sales of new and existing single-family homes are trending up gradually. Nationally, home prices have finally begun to rise.\n\nHowever, on a more negative note, business fixed investment spending fell some in the third quarter and new orders for nondefense capital goods suggest continued softness.  Overall, manufacturing activity remains weak. This manufacturing slump stems from slower growth abroad and uncertainties about how the fiscal cliff in Washington will be resolved.\n\nOn the inflation side of ledger, despite sharp rises in energy prices in recent months, overall inflation, as measured by year-over-year changes of the consumer price index, is still around 2 percent—significantly lower than last year. The signals from underlying inflation pressures, compensation trends, and longer-term inflation expectations are all fully consistent with our longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent.\n\nAs you all know, in September, the FOMC took additional action to promote a more robust recovery in a context of price stability—a decision that was reaffirmed in October. In addition to the $45 billion monthly purchases of longer term Treasury securities already scheduled to run through year end, the FOMC commenced buying additional mortgage-backed securities at a rate of $40 billion a month. The Committee said: “If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. 1\n\nIn terms of rate guidance, the Committee said it anticipated that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate would likely be warranted “at least through mid-2015\"—emphasizing that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would remain appropriate for a considerable time after the pace of the economic recovery strengthens.\n\nSo, what does “substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market” mean to me?  A key point is that I will focus on the labor market outlook, not just its current state.  Therefore, I will be looking at the growth momentum within the overall economy and a range of labor indicators, including the unemployment rate, payrolls, the participation rate, the employment to population ratio and job finding rates.  Following the framework we set out in September, I will be assessing the employment and inflation outlook in order to determine whether we should continue Treasury purchases into 2013.\n\nWe will continue to do our part to push the economy towards maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.  Yet, it is important to recognize that our tools are not all-powerful—monetary policy is not a panacea for all that ails our economy.\n\nIn particular, Congress and the administration must address the “fiscal cliff” in a manner that creates a credible framework for long- term fiscal sustainability.  It is widely acknowledged that the large fiscal contraction associated with going “off the cliff” would drive the U.S. economy into recession.  The contractionary impact is likely to be larger than normal when monetary policy is operating at the zero lower bound for interest rates, as is the case today.  Thus, fiscal consolidation must be accomplished in a way that avoids derailing the economic recovery. The best way to do this is to craft a plan that starts small in terms of its near-term impact, then grows very substantially over time as the economy grows healthier. Of course this requires that the longer-term consolidation is truly credible. It is also important that any plan have broad bipartisan support so that that households and businesses understand that it will in fact be carried out.\n\nWe saw in the summer of 2011 when the debt ceiling limit was in play that a failure to come to grips with our nation’s economic challenges and responsibilities can have a large effect on U.S. household and business confidence. We do not want to repeat this experience at the start of 2013.\n\nMoreover, what happens will influence how we are perceived abroad.  When I meet with economic leaders across the globe they do not doubt the underlying strength and dynamism of the U.S. economy, or the entrepreneurialism and inventiveness of our people. Nor do they doubt that we have the resources and capability to overcome the challenges we face. But they do wonder whether our political system is capable of putting the national interest above partisan interests and making the tough choices needed to address these challenges.\n\nIf a credible bipartisan agreement is reached, it will strengthen global confidence in the U.S. and underscore to the world that our country remains a great place to do business and invest in. Failure would suggest a degree of political dysfunction that could undermine U.S. economic leadership and could encourage global corporations and investors to invest elsewhere.\n\nMake no mistake: Credible fiscal consolidation will not be painless, no matter what form it takes.  The burden will be felt across many sectors of the economy and we must expect that the resulting fiscal drag will exert some restraint on economic growth.\n\nNevertheless, there is no reason why a carefully crafted plan would need to put the economic recovery at risk.  A credible plan, after all, would likely have very positive effects on confidence.  In particular, I believe that business investment would respond positively to a credible plan.  More generally, reducing uncertainty over future tax rates, entitlements and other spending programs has to be a positive development in terms of reducing uncertainty that can constrain economic activity.  By clarifying the rules of the road, a credible fiscal plan is likely to reduce the incentive of households and businesses to delay spending and investment. This would likely offset fiscal drag to a meaningful degree.\n\nConclusion To sum up, while it is still too early for a precise estimate of the economic impact of Sandy, I expect a negative impact on fourth quarter national and regional economic growth, but a minimal long run effect nationally and regionally.  This has happened during a period where too many people remain without the jobs that they need to help support their families and themselves. Although the economy continues to expand, we must grow faster if we are to put all of our jobless workers and idle businesses back to work. Meanwhile, price increases are likely to be at or slightly below our 2 percent longer-run objective over the next few years.\n\nMany parts of our region were showing a stronger pace of growth than the country as a whole before the storms hit—and I am hopeful that Sandy will not have pushed us off this trajectory for long. The recovery of housing markets are important part of this renewed growth, although certain communities are still weighed down by lingering high rates of delinquencies and foreclosures and some others have suffered appalling damage from Sandy.\n\nGoing forward, let me reiterate that the Fed will promote maximum employment and price stability to the greatest extent our tools permit, and we will stay the course. When we achieve a stronger recovery in the context of price stability, I’ll view it as consistent with our goals and not a reason to pull back on our policies prematurely. If you’re trying to get a car moving that is stuck in the mud, you don’t stop pushing the moment the wheels start turning—you keep pushing until the car is rolling and is clearly free.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 September 12-13, 2012 Federal Open Market Committee statement .",

    "text": "It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to participate in this panel. To me, the question posed for discussion seems relatively straightforward: Will more reserve currencies strengthen the international monetary system?   My answer can be summed up in one word:  “yes.”  I believe that a reserve currency—or at least an enduring and important one—has to have a number of demonstrated attributes.  These include that the reserve currency country has a strong and credible institutional structure; that its policymakers follow a sustainable fiscal regime as well as a monetary policy that keeps inflation low and stable over time; and that the currency is readily convertible and serves as a stable store of value.  These are good attributes for any country—reserve currency or not. The greater the number of countries that have such attributes, the more stable and sound the global financial system is likely to be.  Also, such a regime is desirable because it provides an environment that should encourage international trade and an efficient allocation of resources, which, in turn should lift productivity and living standards.\n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own view and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nAlthough a reserve currency can formally be defined as any currency that is part of a foreign country’s foreign exchange reserve holdings, I do not think this is what we have in mind when we talk about a reserve currency.\n\nWhile the status of being a reserve currency can be conferred, the stature of being a reserve currency must be earned.  As I see it, a successful reserve currency needs to satisfy a number of conditions.  First, the currency needs to be fully convertible—with no risk of restrictions that could limit the ability to convert such holdings into cash denominated in the investors’ domestic currency.  Second, the reserve currency country needs to have deep, liquid and transparent capital markets so that the sovereign debt instruments and other high-quality debt obligations can be bought and sold at narrow bid-ask spreads and easily converted to and from cash.  Third, the assets in the country must be governed by a well-understood, consistent and enforceable legal regime.  This is to ensure that investors’ rights will be well protected, regardless of short-term political developments or changes in the governing regime.  Fourth, the financial system in the country must be strong and stable to ensure that liquidity will be available even during times of stress.  Fifth, the risk of default on the country’s sovereign debt must be viewed as negligible, to ensure both that the currency is a stable store of value and that continuous, deep liquid domestic markets will be available regardless of the economic circumstances.  Sixth, the country must have a credible central bank that is insulated from political interference and committed to keeping inflation low and stable—a necessary condition for a reserve currency to be a reliable store of value.\n\nI think that the U.S. dollar satisfies these general criteria.  That is why over 60 percent of foreign exchange reserve holdings are denominated in dollars—a share that has been quite stable in recent years.  The dollar’s share has remained steady despite the presence of a number of currencies that broadly satisfy the attributes that I have just discussed.\n\nBut should the U.S. be concerned if more countries satisfy the attributes needed to be successful reserve currencies?  Would it be problematic for the United States if the U.S. dollar share of foreign exchange holdings slipped over time because of progress made elsewhere?\n\nI think the answer to both of these questions is “no.”  It would seem positive to me if a decline in the U.S. market share reflected the following developments: a greater number of stable and effective central banks and fiscal authorities, more investors who are reassured about countries’ institutional arrangements and financial stability, and deeper and more liquid capital markets outside the United States.  These attributes are a prerequisite for a vibrant international financial system and are supportive to global trade.  A regime with many reserve currencies would imply a well-governed international economy.  This should facilitate global investment, resulting in rising productivity growth and improving standards of living.  In other words, I don’t see this as a zero-sum game.  If other countries’ currencies emerge to gain stature as reserve currencies, it is not obvious to me that the United States loses.  This is assuming, of course, that the emergence of alternatives is being driven by their progress, rather than by the U.S. doing a poorer job in satisfying the attributes that I discussed earlier.\n\nHaving more countries achieve the stature of having a reserve currency may also be desirable for other reasons.  First, with more reserve currencies available, portfolio diversification opportunities are enhanced. This is desirable because, all else equal, it would allow investors to move further out on the risk/return frontier.  Second, more currencies are likely to be close substitutes, which could dampen currency volatility.  With many viable reserve currencies available, no particular one would necessarily have to bear the bulk of any adjustment.\n\nThe dollar’s dominant reserve currency status has sometimes been referred to as the United States’ “exorbitant privilege,” implying that the U.S. benefits extraordinarily from this privileged status.  I’d argue that the situation is much more nuanced.  Yes, this status does allow the U.S. to benefit from seigniorage.  More than half of all U.S. currency outstanding is held abroad.  But, there are also costs of being the dominant reserve currency.  For example, this can lead to shifts in the valuation of the dollar that are due primarily to developments abroad that affect risk appetites and international capital flows.  In such cases, the dollar’s valuation can be pushed to levels inconsistent with U.S. economic fundamentals.\n\nFor the United States, I believe that the most important goal must be to keep our own house in order.  If we do this, then I expect that the U.S. dollar will earn the right to remain the most important reserve currency in the world.\n\nThe United States has a number of advantages in sustaining the dominant reserve currency status of the U.S. dollar.  First, there is a first-mover advantage.  As the leading reserve currency in the world, there is no strong incentive for countries to move to other currencies as long as the dollar continues to have the attributes I discussed earlier.  The history of reserve currency usage is characterized by considerable inertia.  The U.S. dollar emerged as the leading reserve currency quite a bit after it became the world’s largest economy.  Typically, the loss of dominant reserve currency status requires either substantial economic decline or political instability that motivates foreign counterparties to shift to a new reserve currency. Second, the U.S. has the deepest and most liquid capital markets in the world.  This is important in making U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities attractive holdings as part of countries’ foreign exchange reserve portfolios.  Third, the U.S. has an independent central bank—the Federal Reserve—which has been successful in keeping inflation low and stable.  As a result, the dollar has been a reliable store of value in recent years.\n\nAnother point in the United States’ favor is the considerable steps taken to shore up areas of weakness revealed by the financial crisis.  In particular, the safety and soundness of our financial system has been enhanced. Capital and liquidity requirements for U.S. banks have been raised significantly.  Stress tests have been imposed to enhance the viability of large systemic institutions even in very adverse economic and financial environments.  Reforms have been enacted to facilitate the recovery and resolution of troubled institutions.  This includes living will requirements for the major systemically-important financial institutions, and the development of an improved resolution regime to ensure that institutions that do get into difficulty can be resolved without disrupting the stability of the financial system.\n\nIn conclusion, I welcome other countries’ progress toward achieving the preconditions necessary for their currencies to attain the stature of a reserve currency.  However, we should not act as if this is sufficient to achieve a well-functioning global financial system.  In particular, the current regime is inefficient in a number of important ways.  Countries have found it necessary to self-insure against the risk of large capital flow reversals.  This has led to a very sharp rise in aggregate foreign exchange reserve holdings.  This form of self-insurance is very expensive—especially when the return on the foreign exchange reserve portfolio is less than the cost of the domestic liabilities that fund these holdings.  As I have said in the past, I encourage more work to examine whether there are other more efficient regimes that, for example, would economize on required foreign exchange reserve buffers.  In this regard, I think expanding the capacity of the IMF’s resources and working to further de-stigmatize drawing on the IMF’s liquidity facilities could be worthwhile steps in this direction.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n1 Linda Goldberg and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.",

    "text": "I want to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York, and to the risk forum we are sponsoring jointly with the Global  Association of Risk Professionals. I  want to thank Rich Apostolik and Rene Stulz for their work in organizing this  forum with us.\n\nBefore  I introduce tonight’s speaker, Pat Parkinson, I’d like to make some brief  remarks.\n\nThe financial crisis underscores the importance of  good risk management practices and systems. Some firms had a better understanding of the risks that they were  exposed to and liquidated positions and bought protection as the housing boom  turned bust. But others took too much  comfort in credit ratings or felt too comfortable operating with very high risk  concentrations. The desire to protect revenue streams also caused some firms to  stick much too long with businesses that were much more exposed to risk than  anticipated.\n\nValue at risk measures proved  inadequate—understating risk in numerous ways—first, by putting too much weight  on historical volatilities, second, by understating tail risks, and third,  overstating diversification benefits in adverse economic circumstances. Also, some firms had difficulty in assessing  their exposures on a consolidated basis. Thus, while risks in particular business units might have looked  manageable, there was a lack of understanding about how the risks aggregated up  at the firm level and how adverse shocks could reverberate more broadly  throughout the firm’s activities and business.\n\nThere has been considerable progress made since the  crisis hit. Risk management practices  have been bolstered, MIS systems improved, and scenario stress analyzes have  become more commonplace. But there is  still much to do. In particular,  transparency into risk management practices remains poor. Investors have little information by which to  assess the competencies of firms as risk managers or how well firms will likely  do in adverse economic circumstances. Also, the ability to discern various basis risk exposures is poor. The large banks have huge books of business  that net down to much more modest net exposures. Investors are uncertain about how to think  about this as they cannot easily discern how solid the hedges, collateral, and  guarantees will turn out to be under stress. Right now, investors are focused on exposures to European sovereigns and  banks. The gross exposures are  sometimes quite sizable, but the net positions are typically small. We need to figure out better ways to present  these exposures and risks in the firm’s disclosures.\n\nTwo more points, I would like to make about risk  management.\n\nFirst, in thinking about risk management, we need to  be cognizant that, at times, that risk management objectives for the firm may  diverge from those of the regulator. In  the spring of 2009, the largest U.S. banks did not want to raise more capital  because in good states of the world they would not need it and raising that  capital in order to have capital for bad states of the world would be very  dilutive for shareholders.\n\nThe regulatory perspective was different. If banks did not prepare for a bad state of  the world, this made the bad state of the world more likely. By forcing the banks to hold sufficient  capital to withstand bad states of the world, the SCAP exercise made a bad state  of the world less likely. This  underscored an important externality—if an individual firm strengthens itself,  this strengthens the financial system and makes everyone better off. I would argue that this issue is relevant  right now with respect to the European bank and sovereign debt crisis.\n\nSecond, there are limits on the ability of good risk  management practices to protect the financial system. We have to recognize that the feedback loops  and contagion channels within our complex financial system are extraordinarily  complex and that risk management modeling will often be inadequate in  describing how such a complex system is likely to perform under stress. For example, I think we can take too much  comfort by focusing on bilateral, direct exposures. As we have seen in the financial crisis, the  lines of contagion can occur in unanticipated ways. Also, I may understand well my exposures to  my counterparties, but what about my counterparties’ exposures to others in the  financial system? I conclude that good  risk management practices are essential, but not sufficient. Appropriate capital and liquidity buffers;  fulsome transparency and disclosure, and incentives that are consistent with  safety and soundness are all also important. Also, working towards a financial system structure in which shocks are  attenuated rather than amplified is important.\n\nI’m  pleased tonight to introduce Pat Parkinson as our keynote speaker. Pat has been Director of the Federal Reserve  Board’s Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation since October 2009. Prior to that, Pat was Deputy Director of the  Board’s Division of Research and Statistics, with responsibility for oversight  of the micro-financial policy. In  addition, from 1993 until 2009 he was the principal staff advisor to the  Board’s Chairman on issues considered by the President’s Working Group on  Financial Markets. He first joined the  Board’s staff in 1980.  During the first half of 2009 Mr.  Parkinson served as  Counselor to Treasury Secretary Geithner and played a leading role in  development of the Administration’s proposals for reforming financial  institutions and markets, including the OTC derivatives markets.\n\nPat is one of our most experienced risk management  experts. His international experience is  extensive. From 1999 to 2004 he  co-chaired the CPSS-IOSCO Joint Task Force on Securities Settlement Systems,  which developed the international standards for securities settlement systems  (including central counterparty arrangements for derivatives). This work has been the basis for the current  effort to update these standards. Pat’s  earlier contributions are an important reason why this work has been moving  ahead smoothly.\n\nFinally, let me  underscore my own appreciation of Pat’s work. He and I worked very closely together during the worst days of the  financial crisis in the fall of 2008 developing some of the special liquidity  facilities such as the CPPF and the TALF. Those were very difficult and uncertain days. I have a great appreciation for his ability  and insight.",

    "text": "It is my pleasure to welcome you to today’s conference on transatlantic economic interdependence and policy challenges.  We have a great program today with many distinguished speakers from academia, and the private and public sectors.  In particular, I would highlight the keynote speech following lunch by Olli Rehn, the vice president of the European Commission.\n\nWe live in a global economy with a global financial system, yet macroeconomic policy and regulation and supervision have a decidedly national orientation.  This creates a challenge for all of us as we seek to balance our domestic needs against the benefits from having a harmonized and integrated global system.  We can do better through international cooperation and coordination both on macro policy and on regulation and supervision, rather than trying to “go it alone.”\n\nAs the two largest economies in the world, the United States and the European Union have a shared stake in the vitality of the global economy.  Without growth in both our regions, the global economy will not prosper and we will not be able to satisfy the aspirations of our citizens.\n\nToday I want to focus on some of the challenges that we both face.  As I see it, significant progress has been made in the United States and Europe in recovering from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and the deep recession that followed, but more still needs to be done.\n\nOn the regulatory side, there is considerable good news worth highlighting.  In particular, substantial progress has been made in strengthening the global capital and liquidity standards for internationally active banks.  This should make the failure of large firms much less likely.  Also, the financial system is being rebuilt to make it more resilient and robust.  For example, the requirement that over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives be standardized and centrally cleared whenever possible should strengthen the global financial system.  Similarly, the global set of principles for financial market infrastructures has been updated and strengthened.\n\nMoreover, some tentative steps have also been made so we can better deal with the failure of systemically important financial firms on a cross-border basis.  Key attributes for resolution regimes have been promulgated by the Financial Stability Board.  Efforts are underway to implement national regimes consistent with these standards and that can work together in a coordinated way on a global basis.\n\nBut more needs to be done.  The impediments to an orderly cross-border resolution still need to be fully identified and dismantled.  This is necessary to eliminate the so-called “too big to fail” problem. The Basel III capital and liquidity requirements need to be fully implemented.  Also, cross-border regulatory cooperation needs to be further enhanced.  This includes greater exchange of confidential supervisory information so that national regulators can be fully informed about the conditions of the banks that operate within their borders.  It also requires efforts to ensure a level playing field across jurisdictions so that the focus is on promoting safety and stability rather than trying to protect, favor, or shield national champions.\n\nIn terms of the macroeconomy, there is both good and bad news.  In the United States, the good news is that the economic outlook appears to be gradually improving.  The household sector is far along in the deleveraging process, the housing sector is recovering, the banking system is healthier and credit conditions are easing, the corporate sector is highly profitable and awash in cash.\n\nMonetary policy has been effective at fostering easier financial market conditions, even with short-term rates pinned at the zero bound. To provide the appropriate degree of accommodation, the Federal Reserve has recently moved to an outcome-based approach in which the use of our tools is explicitly tied to developments in the economy and economic outlook.  Currently, as part of this strategy, we are purchasing $85 billion of longer-term Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities each month. After reviewing the efficacy and costs of this program, I have concluded that that efficacy has been as high or higher than I expected at the onset of the program and costs the same or lower.\n\nNevertheless, the United States could be doing better.  The U.S. fiscal policy program, for example, does not appear well-calibrated to the current set of economic circumstances. We have too much fiscal restraint in the short term, and too little consolidation in the long term. The degree of fiscal restraint this year (about 1¾ percent of gross domestic product [GDP] in 2013) is quite large relative to the forward momentum of the economy.  Thus, we have a tug-of-war between the improving economy and the current large negative fiscal impulse.  How this tug-of-war gets resolved—which force dominates—won’t be known for some time.  In other words, the level of uncertainty about the near-term outlook in the United States remains quite high.\n\nMeanwhile, the long-term fiscal outlook for the United States is still troubling.  So far, partisan divisions in Washington have limited progress in reaching the type of “grand bargain” needed to put the United States on a sustainable long-term fiscal path, though of late we have at least seen some renewed talk about this.  Nor have we yet deployed a comprehensive set of policies to support the rebalancing of the U.S. economy toward a growth path based more on business investment, trade and broad-based income gains than the type of asset price gains and credit-fuelled consumption, which dominated the last business cycle.\n\nFor Europe, the near term macroeconomic outlook seems less bright.  The good news is that the peripheral countries have made substantial efforts to bring down their structural budget deficits. They have also made some progress in improving their international competitiveness, though there remains an opportunity for further structural reforms in labor and product markets—and not just in the periphery—to increase productivity and strengthen long term growth prospects.\n\nThe European Central Bank’s (ECB) introduction of the outright monetary transactions (OMT) program has reduced financial market tensions considerably in the peripheral countries, so that sovereign debt funding costs in those countries are at more reasonable levels.  The risk that interest rates in the periphery could spiral upward has been significantly diminished.  Also, the commitment to European integration remains strong, a factor that U.S.-based analysts and investors do not always sufficiently appreciate.  Over the past few years, when the situation has been the most bleak, the choice in favor of the Union with the euro at its core has always won out.\n\nThe bad news is that the eurozone is still in a recession and the political support for further rounds of budget-tightening has clearly lessened. The eurozone financial system is being fragmented and the partial easing of pressure on peripheral sovereign debt markets has not translated into a corresponding easing in private-sector borrowing costs in these nations.  If growth does not resume relatively soon, then the political support for continued fiscal and structural adjustment could further erode.\n\nIn Europe, a key challenge is to strengthen the economic foundations of monetary union at the system level.  This needs to be done in a way that combines deeper integration with good incentives and governance so that it can be broadly supported by both the core and peripheral countries.  In this respect, it is important to recall that the architects of EMU from the outset defined it as a project of Economic and Monetary Union.\n\nI view the task of transitioning to a pan-European banking union with the ECB as the primary overseer of the European banking system as a critically important next step.  Successfully moving to a pan-European banking union would generate a large number of benefits:\n\nIn short, banking union has the potential to make a powerful contribution to eurozone stability and growth, both in the short term and in the long term.\n\nNow, will moving to a pan-European banking system be easy?  Of course not.  It will require a common set of standards to be applied across the whole system.  This may well reveal shortcomings among particular banks and the burden is not likely to fall evenly across the European Union.  It will be important to identify the sources of capital that will fill any such holes in order to ensure ongoing stability and to avoid constraining the availability of credit.\n\nThe process of banking union appropriately begins with a single supervisory mechanism.  But, a common resolution authority and integrated deposit insurance framework that is both credible and consistent with good incentives are likely to be required, as well.  The task at hand will likely require each country to give up a small amount of sovereignty with respect to banking oversight so that the outcome  is viewed as fully credible.  In my view, this is a critical next step in the “one money, one market” project underlying the EU agenda.\n\nI’d now like to introduce Ambassador Vale de Almeida as our next speaker.  The ambassador has been here in his current role since August 2010.  Prior to his current appointment, he worked as a director general at the European Commission (EC) and has had a long and distinguished career at the EC dating back to 1982.  So he is extraordinarily well-versed to speak on the issues of interdependence and the policy challenges we face.  Welcome Ambassador Vale de Almeida.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to be here today.  Does the implementation of unconventional monetary policies pose a threat to central bank independence?  My short answer, which I will elaborate on, is that while the threat is low, central bankers need to be cognizant of such risks, and clearly explain the motivations for their actions in order to mitigate such risks.\n\nThe best way for central banks to maintain their independence is to use all their available monetary policy tools to best achieve their objectives.  Because the use of our unconventional monetary policy tools has been in pursuit of our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability, I do not see the use of these tools as creating significant new risks to our independence.\n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTo start, it is important to be clear on what we mean by unconventional monetary policies. In my remarks, I am going to focus only on the set of unconventional monetary policies that are relevant today in an environment in which central banks are constrained from lowering their policy rate any further due to the zero lower bound.  I will not discuss the type of extraordinary interventions that occurred at the height of the financial crisis. 1\n\nA starting point is that the independence of the central bank with respect to its budget supports its overall independence.  The Federal Reserve’s traditional monetary policy framework has helped to assure this budgetary independence. The liability side of our balance sheet consisted primarily of currency and reserve balances on which we did not pay any interest. The asset side consisted primarily of Treasury securities.  There was no meaningful credit risk and the interest rate risk was limited because assets were generally held to maturity. This, combined with the zero cost of the Fed’s liabilities, resulted in the Federal Reserve turning over a large amount of earnings to the Treasury each year after covering all of its operating costs and retaining a small portion of its earnings to maintain a level of surplus capital equal to the amount of capital paid-in by member banks.\n\nThus, one key question is how this budgetary independence might be threatened through the use of unconventional monetary policies.  After all, some of these policies do have implications for the Federal Reserve’s remittances to the Treasury and, thus,  could conceivably create a potential threat to the Federal Reserve’s budgetary independence.\n\nTo step back, the Federal Reserve’s set of unconventional monetary policies has consisted of three major components:\n\nWith respect to forward guidance, it is important to distinguish between two specific forms that this guidance may take.  In the first form the central bank provides its forecast for the future path of the policy rate and, possibly, some sense of the degree of uncertainty around this path.  In the second, the central bank pre-commits to a specific future path for its policy rate.\n\nProviding a forecast for the policy rate by itself does not create any budget or reputational risk for the Federal Reserve, so I generally do not see the first form of forward guidance as posing much risk to central bank independence. 2\n\nThe second form of forward guidance—pre-commitment to a policy rate path—could create more risk for the central bank.  In particular, consider a scenario in which the central bank decided to increase monetary accommodation by committing to maintain a low short-term interest rate for a long time even if this commitment resulted in inflation overshooting the central bank’s objective in the future. I could see how this could create a potential threat to the central bank’s independence.  That is because the commitment could force the central bank in the future to conduct monetary policy in a way that was inconsistent with the inflation portion of its mandate.\n\nAlthough this second form of forward guidance could create greater risk for the central bank with respect to its future independence, this is not a policy that has been adopted by the Federal Reserve.  There are implementation challenges with this approach.  In particular, it is difficult for a monetary policy committee today to institutionally bind future monetary policy committees to follow actions that could conflict with their objectives in the future.  Without such a credible forward commitment, such policies would likely be ineffective in affecting expectations in the manner needed to provide additional monetary policy accommodation.\n\nIn contrast, I think there are greater potential risks to central bank independence from the Fed’s large-scale asset purchase programs and the Treasury maturity extension program.  These programs do create some budget risk for the Federal Reserve. The issue here is not that the Fed is taking credit risk because the Fed’s purchases are restricted to Treasuries and agency MBS.  Instead, the budgetary risks stem from the fact that these asset purchase and maturity extension programs expose the Federal Reserve to increased interest rate risk that could affect the level of net interest earnings and therefore the amount of the Fed’s remittances back to the U.S. Treasury.  If the Federal Reserve needed to raise short-term rates to attain its objectives, it would do so by raising the interest paid on its reserves. As a result, net interest earnings would fall due to the increase in interest cost. If the rise in rates were sufficiently large, the Federal Reserve’s net interest margin could turn negative, resulting in losses for the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Fed’s earnings could also be adversely affected by asset sales.  For example, if the Fed determined that it needed to reduce the aggregate level of reserves through asset sales, the Fed might incur losses by selling these assets at prices below their amortized costs.\n\nAlthough this risk is real, I believe it is not a big threat to the Federal Reserve’s independence for two reasons.  First, the potential for this outcome is mitigated by the fact that the Federal Reserve has considerable non-interest bearing liabilities on its balance sheet—namely currency. These liabilities incur no interest expense regardless of the stance of monetary policy. This means that short-term interest rates have to rise appreciably before the Federal Reserve’s net interest margin turns negative.\n\nSecond, even if the Federal Reserve were to incur an operating loss either because of an increase in interest expense or because of realized losses on asset sales, the Federal Reserve can create a deferred asset on its balance sheet, obviating the need for funding from the Treasury to the Federal Reserve. In this sense, the Federal Reserve would retain its budgetary independence.\n\nIn the case where the Fed recognizes a deferred asset, its remittances to the Treasury would cease until that deferred asset was paid down. Is there a risk to budgetary independence that might emerge if the Federal Reserve did not remit any income to the Treasury for a considerable period of time?  My response here is that we should take a long-term perspective when we assess the potential fiscal costs associated with the Federal Reserve’s enlarged balance sheet.  The fact is that the Fed’s reimbursements to the U.S. Treasury have been around $80 billion per year in recent years, far higher than the $20 to 30 billion range that applied before the financial crisis.  Under most scenarios, the Federal Reserve’s total remittances to the Treasury will be larger than they would have otherwise been in the absence of the asset purchase and maturity extension programs.\n\nMore importantly, the Fed’s cumulative earnings understate the fiscal implications of the Federal Reserve’s actions.  To the extent that the asset purchases have resulted in easier financial conditions that have promoted stronger economic activity, this in turn has had a positive fiscal consequence for the U.S. government.  In addition, the Fed’s asset purchase programs have pushed longer-term interest rates below what they would otherwise have been, reducing the overall funding expenses of the U.S. Treasury.  Once we take into account the broader fiscal consequences of the unconventional monetary policies put in place by the Fed, they are quite likely to cumulatively have an overall positive impact on the government budget.  As a result, the use of unconventional monetary policy tools should pose no significant threat to the Fed’s independence.\n\nNow some worry that a large balance sheet may cause the Federal Reserve to deviate from the monetary policy that is consistent with its dual mandate goals with respect to unemployment and inflation.  The argument is made that concerns about the impact of policy changes on the level of remittances might constrain the conduct of monetary policy.  In particular, some argue that the Federal Reserve might pull its punches and not raise short-term interest rates in as timely or as aggressive a manner as needed to keep inflation in check.\n\nI think that the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet actually creates incentives that reinforce the pursuit of the Federal Reserve’s objective with respect to inflation.  Consider what would happen if the Federal Reserve failed to tighten in a timely way.  Inflation and long-term interest rates would rise, and this would necessitate a larger rise in short-term interest rates and even greater pressure on the Federal Reserve’s net interest margin and earnings in the future.  In contrast, by tightening in a timely way, the Fed would prevent inflation pressures from emerging and this would limit the need for a larger rise in short-term rates in the future.  The current size of the balance sheet would also discourage a premature interest rate hike.  In the absence of solid improvements in labor market activity, a sharp increase in short-term rates would unnecessarily reduce the Federal Reserve net interest income without any benefits in terms of achieving its dual mandate goals.  Thus, the current size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet actually create strong incentives to adjust policy in a timely way.\n\nA far more important threat to central bank independence than the use of unconventional monetary policy is whether the fiscal authorities act in a manner consistent with the central bank’s objectives.  As recent history has shown, central banks may not be able to achieve their objectives when an inconsistent fiscal regime is in place.  That is, monetary and fiscal authorities need to share the same objectives. When the objectives differ, fiscal dominance can become a major problem for the central bank.  For example, if the budget trajectory were clearly unsustainable, then monetary policy may no longer be able to credibly act in a way that keeps inflation expectations in check.  But I don’t think the issue of fiscal dominance is linked back to whether the central bank pursues unconventional monetary policies or not.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think that the best way to maintain independence is for central bankers to use all their available monetary policy tools, including unconventional monetary policy tools when needed, to best achieve their objectives.  The historical record is clear: Central bank independence tends to lead to better monetary policy outcomes.  But, the causality also runs in reverse: Good monetary policy outcomes help ensure monetary policy independence.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\n1 However, it is important to note that some of those interventions did indeed result in tighter limits on the central bank’s authority as a lender of last resort.  For example, the Fed’s scope to provide liquidity to troubled firms in unusual and exigent circumstances—under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act—was curtailed somewhat by the Dodd-Frank Act.  This underscores the fact that central bank actions can have consequences with respect to independence.\n\n2 While I have categorized providing a forecast for the future path of the policy rate as a form of unconventional monetary policy, this may be a misnomer in that some central banks use this form of forward guidance as part of their standard communication strategy, and the Federal Reserve may choose to continue to provide this form of forward guidance even after its policy rate is no longer constrained by the zero lower bound.",

    "text": "Good morning, I am pleased to be here in Buffalo to address the Buffalo-Niagara Partnership.  It is always a pleasure to speak with the business community because of the leadership role you play in the economy of the region.  I thank you all for inviting me here today. I try to get out of my office in New York City as much as I can to get a sense of regional economic conditions across the second Federal Reserve District.   I was last here in Buffalo in 2010 and, more recently, I traveled to West Point and the Capital region and Long Island. These visits are just as important as any trip I might take to Washington, D.C., to help formulate monetary policy, or to Switzerland, to help shape international bank regulation.  Each visit within the region helps me to deepen the relationships with the people I represent.  I believe that the understanding of issues and concerns that I gain today will help ensure that the Fed’s policy decisions reflect the public interest. Today, I want to talk a bit about the Fed—what we do and why we do it. Then I’ll provide some thoughts about the economic outlook nationally and locally.  After that, I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about what the Fed does and why, and about the economic outlook. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee, also known as the FOMC. What the New York Fed Does By way of introduction, I will briefly review what my colleagues and I do at the New York Fed on behalf of the Second District. I have the great fortune to serve as vice chair of the FOMC that meets eight times a year in Washington to set interest rates and make other decisions about monetary policy.  The members of this committee all strive to set policy to advance the mandate given to us by Congress to promote the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability.  Sometimes we have different views on the specific policy choice at hand, and you should view this as completely appropriate: these are hard questions—particularly during difficult economic circumstances such as we face today.   In fact, I think we make better decisions as a committee because we don't all think alike.  But we are united in our commitment to our dual mandate and in our belief that Fed independence is essential to the public interest.  That independence allows us to make tough decisions insulated from short-term political pressures. At FOMC meetings, each Committee member presents a current outlook for his or her region and the nation.  For these assessments, we consult our researchers and add critical information that we learn from listening to our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and community leaders, such as you and others I'll meet on this visit. For example, last month members of our small business advisory council told us that for the first time in several years, employees were leaving for other jobs and that they would need to replace those who left for better opportunities elsewhere.  The fact that some people with jobs felt confident enough to seek and take other job opportunities was another signal to us that the job market may be improving—although, to be sure, we read such signals cautiously. To help me gather more information about the region, yesterday, I had breakfast in Syracuse with business and community leaders at the Center for Economic Development.  Then I met with the staff of PathStone, a community development organization, met faculty and students at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University and had lunch with university officials who manage the tech transfer process.  In the afternoon, we drove to Skaneateles Falls to tour Welch Allyn, a manufacturer of medical diagnostic instruments.   Dr. Julie Shimer is the president and CEO.  Dr. Shimer was also recently appointed chair of the Empire State Development Corporation, and we talked about challenges and opportunities for economic development in New York State. After this morning’s gathering, I will speak with staff of the Empire Justice Center, meet with Lt. Governor Bob Duffy, convene a meeting of our Upstate Advisory Board, whose members are major leaders in the upstate economy, and visit the Roswell Park Cancer Institute to learn about their role in economic development in western New York and in the broader world arena. My colleagues and I at the New York Fed continually track conditions in our District, and we have created a number of tools for that purpose. For example, my staff produces monthly indexes of economic activity for New York City, the state of New York and New Jersey.  These indexes are essentially measures of local output—similar to gross domestic product, or GDP, at the national level.  These measures provide a more complete gauge of activity than the employment report, which is another important metric at the state level.  We have also constructed a consumer credit panel to track local household credit conditions at the county and even the zip code level, including the amount and type of personal debt and whether payments are being made in a timely way. In addition, we conduct a periodic poll about the credit needs of small businesses, which are an important source of new jobs.  We are just launching our latest poll that also includes questions about the skill needs of small businesses and whether the right kinds of skilled labor are available.  Almost 900 regional businesses responded to our last poll, some of which were from this region.  If you, as a representative of a small business, would like to participate in our current poll, please pass your card to my colleagues, who are in the audience, or see me after the speech and we will be glad to add you as a respondent. Results from prior polls stressed the problem of access to capital.  In response we held two workshops at the Bank last December.  In the first workshop, senior officers from the Export-Import Bank, the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce described the various loan programs available to small businesses from their agencies, as well as programs to help identify markets.  The second workshop reviewed the business plans of 40 small businesses and then matched them with potential lenders.  We plan to hold a similar workshop in Upstate New York this year. As you know, even states that are wealthier, such as New York, have large pockets of poverty. So, we target some of our work specifically to low- and moderate-income groups. We have worked hard to help neighborhoods that face high foreclosure rates, although much remains to be done.  We have provided housing advocates with the latest information on mortgage conditions, via mortgage briefs, roundtables, presentations and newsletters.  We have now developed an interactive online tool that shows monthly delinquency and foreclosure conditions, which we believe will aid the work of housing counselors and other parties seeking to help these communities.  It is available on our website along with other data and information useful to policymakers, business people and the general public. We use our website to share what we learn about our diverse District, and you will find detailed information about the region at the site.  I invite you to visit newyorkfed.org to explore our highly localized maps and information on small business, credit and housing conditions and even the latest job openings at the New York Fed. Finally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington, D.C., and at other agencies to help put the nation's financial system on a firmer footing.   Our supervisors are working hard to ensure that our District’s banks are operating safely and soundly.  Although much has been done, we are not finished and are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves. All in all, there is a lot to keep myself and my colleagues busy. National Economic Conditions Now I’d like to turn to the national and regional economy.  The incoming data on the U.S. economy generally has been a bit more upbeat over the past few months, suggesting that the recovery may be finally establishing a somewhat firmer footing.  Real GDP expanded at a 3.0 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2011, the fastest growth since the first half of 2010.  The average monthly job gain was 212 ,000 in the first quarter of 2012, up from 164,000 in the fourth quarter.  Sales of light-weight motor vehicles were about 14 ½ million at an annual rate in the first quarter, the best quarter for vehicle sales in four years.  Survey measures of business activity have rebounded from their dips in the middle of last year, and are now at levels that typically indicate solid overall growth.  Even housing starts have firmed somewhat in the last few months, although they remain at depressed levels. While these developments are certainly encouraging, it is still too soon to conclude that we are out of the woods.  To begin with, the economic data looked brighter at this point in 2010 and again in 2011, only to fade later in those years.\n\nMoreover, the United States experienced unusually mild weather over the first quarter, with the number of heating degree days more than 20 percent below the average of the preceding five years, which may have pulled forward some economic activity and hiring.\n\nIn this regard, the somewhat softer March labor market report that was released last Friday may reflect the earlier positive influence of the mild weather on job creation in January and February, although other less sanguine interpretations are also plausible.  We thus will need to see more data to determine the extent to which the March data represent a transitory weather-related setback.\n\nRegardless of the importance of the mild winter in distorting the economic data, real economic activity has yet to be strong enough on a sustained basis to make a big dent in the overall amount of slack in the U.S. economy.  While growth was stronger in the fourth quarter, most of it was due to inventory accumulation.  Growth of final sales remained quite weak.  Historically, quarters in which inventory investment makes significant growth contributions are typically followed by quarters in which that growth contribution is modest or even negative.  That appears to be what is shaping up for the first quarter of this year.\n\nBased on available data, our current expectations are that real GDP will expand at around a 2 ¼ percent annual rate during the first quarter of 2012.  Even with the robust increase of light vehicle sales, overall consumer spending in the first quarter appears to be rising at a similar moderate rate.  At the same time, real disposable income has been flat over the past three months, and the large increase of gasoline prices is likely further sapping consumers’ real purchasing power. And growth of business investment spending, which softened in the fourth quarter of 2011, may have been even a little softer in the first quarter of this year.\n\nTo put the recent pace of growth into perspective, we believe that the economy’s long-run sustainable growth rate—what economists call the potential growth rate—is around a 2 ¼ percent annual rate.  We need sustained growth above that rate to absorb the still substantial amount of unused productive capacity.  Thus, our recent growth rates are barely keeping up with our potential.\n\nEven though the unemployment rate has declined sharply from 9 percent last September to 8.2 percent in March, it is still unacceptably high.  In addition, many other measures of the labor market remain weak.  The labor force participation rate, the percentage of people employed, and the total number of hours worked in the economy all dropped sharply during the recession and remain well below their pre-recession levels, even taking into account the impact of demographic shifts.  Also, it appears that productivity growth has slumped recently.  Although that means that a given amount of growth translates into bigger employment gains, it certainly is not an unmitigated positive development.\n\nAlso, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the economy still faces significant headwinds and that there are some meaningful downside risks.  In the headwinds department, I would include the run-up in gasoline prices mentioned earlier because that will sap purchasing power, the continued impediments to a strong recovery from ongoing weakness in the housing sector, and fiscal drag at the federal and state and local levels.  In terms of downside risks, these include the risk that growth abroad disappoints and the risk of further disruptions to the supply of oil and higher oil prices.\n\nOn the inflation front, the overall rate of increase of consumer prices, as measured by the 12-month change of the price index for personal consumption expenditures, slowed to 2.3 percent in February from a recent peak of 2.9 percent last September.  Even though the recent rise of gasoline prices mentioned above could interrupt this pattern, we expect this moderation of overall inflation to resume later this year.\n\nWhile the underlying core inflation rate, that strips out volatile food and energy prices, has been somewhat higher than expected a few months back, it appears that the annual rate of core inflation 1 has peaked and we expect it to begin to decline later this year. 2 Finally, inflation expectations, which play an important role in the inflation process, remain well anchored.  By this I mean that people expect that the rate of inflation will continue to be relatively low for some time to come.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nSo how is the recovery proceeding in the state and the region?  As I mentioned, the New York Fed produces indexes that help us track economic activity in the region.  Based on these measures, the economic recovery that began in New York State in late 2009 has continued through early 2012, and even gained some momentum. Across Upstate New York, the cycle of recession and recovery has been much less pronounced than in the nation, which means that the region has been more stable in recent years than many other places around the country. This has been particularly true in Buffalo, which experienced an employment decline of about 3½ percent during the downturn—a significant loss, to be sure—but well below the over 6 percent decline that occurred nationally.\n\nOne reason why Upstate New York weathered the storm better than the nation as a whole is the resiliency of its housing markets. Like much of Upstate New York, Buffalo’s housing market has proven to be more stable than many other parts of the country.  In fact, since the peak of the national housing market in early 2006, home prices in the Buffalo area have increased by about 10 percent, compared with a decline of more than 30 percent nationally.  As a result, the drop-off in economic activity that is connected, directly and indirectly, to the performance of the housing sector has not been as severe here as in many other places around the country.\n\nThis stability is underscored by our latest quarterly consumer credit panel data, which shows that total household debt burdens have remained relatively low by national standards and that mortgage delinquency rates are lower in the Buffalo area than in other parts of the state and nation.\n\nThe recovery is proceeding in Buffalo, slowly but surely. So far, the region has gained back nearly 12,000 of the roughly 20,000 jobs it lost during the downturn.  This is somewhat faster progress than the nation has made, although, in part, that’s because the downturn was less severe here.\n\nOne particularly good bit of news is that for the first time in decades, manufacturing has been a source of job growth in the region, rather than decline, adding more than 3,000 jobs over the past few years. That’s nearly twice the pace of growth of the U.S. manufacturing sector.\n\nThat said, it is somewhat worrying that the pace of the recovery locally has actually slowed in recent months just as the national recovery has started to gain some momentum.  Despite this recent slowdown, I believe there are reasons to be optimistic about Buffalo’s longer-term outlook. In particular, the decades long economic restructuring that has occurred in the region has resulted in a more diversified economy. While the region still maintains a strong manufacturing presence, it is no longer the main source of jobs in the area.  In its place, the health and education sectors have emerged as important sources of job opportunity and economic development potential.  These sectors have provided stability to the region through the recession and recovery.\n\nThe recent announcement of Governor Cuomo’s $1 billion economic development pledge to the region is another positive development.  This commitment represents a tremendous opportunity for the region to accelerate the economic transformation already underway.  Therefore, it is important for the community to think strategically about how best to use these funds to leverage the region’s existing strengths.\n\nBuffalo’s colleges and universities deserve special attention within this strategy.  Not only do these institutions produce highly skilled labor, they also promote innovation by creating new knowledge and inventions through academic research and development.  It can be especially beneficial for local businesses to take advantage of both the knowledge created and the availability of research facilities at local colleges and universities.\n\nPartnerships between private industry and higher-education institutions are an important ingredient in this regard.  Going forward, I believe these partnerships will become more important than ever—particularly for places like Buffalo that continue to undergo economic restructuring. Fortunately, the region has a strong higher education sector in place. Conclusion To sum up, the incoming data on the U.S. economy has been a bit more upbeat of late, suggesting that the recovery may be getting better established.  But, while these developments are certainly encouraging, it is far too soon to conclude that we are out of the woods in terms of generating a strong, sustainable recovery.  On the inflation front, the year-over-year rate of consumer price inflation has slowed in recent months, and despite the recent rise of gasoline prices, we expect inflation to moderate further in 2012. Here in Buffalo, the economic restructuring has positioned the region’s health and education sector as a potentially solid base for longer-term growth. Thank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "Good morning and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  I am especially happy to welcome this group, with its focus on the finances of state and local governments.  We at the New York Fed are committed to playing a role in ensuring the stability of this important sector.  To this end, we supported the outstanding work of the Volcker-Ravitch state fiscal crisis taskforce.  In addition, we conduct ongoing outreach activities with local officials and produce research on the subject of local fiscal conditions.  We do these things because we recognize the critical role of state and local governments and their fiscal health to the overall well-being of the economy and its citizens.\n\nIn my remarks today I will touch on the importance of the state and local public sector for the economy, its fiscal health and the need for proactive efforts to address the emerging fiscal stresses in the sector.  As always, what I have to say represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe importance of state and local governments manifests itself in different ways, which are really different sides of the same coin.  First, the sector directly produces a very large amount of economic activity.  In 2014, state and local governments generated output valued at about $2 trillion.  This represents over 11 percent of total U.S. GDP and is more than 50 percent higher than the federal government's contribution.  And, even after years of retrenchment following the financial crisis, state and local governments employ almost 20 million individuals—nearly one in seven American workers.  Clearly, a successful and stable state and local government sector is a vital contributor to overall output and employment.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, we find the real effects of this activity: the provision of public safety, education, and health; as well as water, sewer and transportation services.  These are the core public services that our citizens need, and which are absolutely fundamental to support private sector economic activity.  So, as a central banker, I recognize the essential role that state and local governments play in the economy.  Without successful state and local governments, the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment with stable prices would be much more difficult to attain.\n\nA final important dimension of the state and local sector—and the one that is perhaps most obviously front and center for today’s discussion—is its debt.  The municipal bond market is very large, with outstanding issues totaling over $3.5 trillion.  Now this large dollar amount in and of itself is not a problem.  When governments invest in long-lived capital goods like water and sewer systems, as well as roads and bridges, it makes sense to finance these assets with debt.  Debt financing ensures that future residents, who benefit from the services these investments produce, are also required to help pay for them. This principle supports the efficient provision of these long-lived assets.\n\nUnfortunately, as the Volcker-Ravitch task force emphasized, issuing debt to finance infrastructure investments is not the only reason that states and localities borrow from the future.  Governments have also borrowed to cover operating deficits, and this kind of debt has a very different character than debt issued to finance infrastructure.  Let me take a moment to explain what I mean and why I think this distinction is important.\n\nWhen a jurisdiction borrows to invest in infrastructure, the cost of the debt to local residents—and those considering locating in the jurisdiction—is offset by the value of the services that the infrastructure provides.  This tradeoff is part of the “fiscal surplus” that a jurisdiction offers: the value of the services minus the tax price that residents have to pay.  A well-run capital budget will match these costs and benefits over the life of each project to ensure that the jurisdiction remains attractive to current and future residents.  That is, both current and future residents are willing to pay the tax cost of servicing this debt because of the benefits that they receive from the services supported by that debt.\n\nNow consider a different scenario—one in which the jurisdiction is borrowing to pay for a current year operating deficit.  This kind of borrowing is inconsistent with running a balanced budget, which is in principle required in all but one state.  But, as people in this room are well aware, states and localities can often find ways to “get around” balanced budget requirements if they are determined to do so.  One example of this was New York City in the 1960s and early 1970s, where annual operating deficits were repeatedly financed with short-term debt, until the fiscal crisis exploded in 1974-1975.\n\nThe key distinction between these two types of borrowing is that in the former case an asset is producing services that help to offset the cost of the debt, but this is not so in the latter case.  Indeed, using debt to finance current operating deficits is equivalent to asking future taxpayers to help finance today’s public services.  When this occurs, it means that the fiscal surplus offered by the jurisdiction in the future will be diminished by the value of these additional debts.  That is, in the future, the cost of servicing this debt will drive a wedge between the taxes paid by households and businesses, and the current services provided to them.  Of course, within the U.S., households and businesses can react to this wedge by choosing to locate elsewhere.  And because the tax base of any jurisdiction depends on the level of local economic activity, this out-migration can lead to ever-higher tax rates or ever-diminished services for those who still remain—typically those with fewer opportunities or resources to relocate.\n\nToday, there are several ways that states and localities can borrow to cover operating deficits; and the relatively slow economic growth since the financial crisis has increased pressure on their budgets, making such measures more appealing.  One mechanism for doing this is to treat borrowed funds as revenues that can be used to balance the budget.  Another form is asset sales.  Here the jurisdiction receives cash today in exchange for a reduction in its future assets—sometimes physical like an office building, sometimes financial like tobacco settlement funds—and an increase in its future costs.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, is the practice of pushing the cost of current employment services into the future.\n\nLet me elaborate on this last method.  Here I’m referring to the underfunding of public employee pensions and other post-retirement benefits for current employees.  Both of these practices add to the indebtedness of the state and local governments with the employees playing the role of creditors.  To be clear, while unfunded promises to cover retiree health insurance are very common, unfunded pension liabilities are probably much larger in aggregate magnitude.  Estimates of unfunded pension liabilities range up to several trillion dollars.  While widespread, underfunding of public pensions is not universal.  Many states have found ways to keep their public pensions reasonably well funded, demonstrating that pushing today’s costs into the future is not an inevitable outcome of a democratic government.\n\nNonetheless, we have seen evidence that high debt levels combined with diminished services provision can, in cases such as Detroit and Stockton, make the public sector finances unsustainable.  At a certain point, the debt service burden clashes with maintaining a sufficient ongoing provision of services to forestall people from voting with their feet.  This may occur well before the point that debt service capacity appears to be fully exhausted.  In other words, the prioritization of cash flows to debt service may not be sustainable beyond a certain point.  While these particular bankruptcy filings have captured a considerable amount of attention, and rightly so, they may foreshadow more widespread problems than what might be implied by current bond ratings.  We need to focus our attention today on addressing the underlying issues before any problems grow to the point where bankruptcy becomes the only viable option.  So, I am especially pleased to see that your agenda today focuses, in part, on helping cities and states avoid such levels of fiscal stress, where the risks of going past such a tipping point become significant.\n\nIn summary, state and local governments have enormous financial obligations, as well as critical service delivery responsibilities.  Managing their liabilities in such a way as to ensure that these vital services continue to be provided, and citizens view that they are getting appropriate value in exchange for their taxes is a daunting challenge.  I am happy to see such a distinguished group assembled here at the Bank to address this challenge.  Good luck in your work and I look forward to learning of the results of today’s discussions.\n\n1 Andrew Haughwout and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to be here today. I want to emphasize in my remarks today three points. First, a stable financial system is a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth. Second, the financial system that operated in the years leading up to the crisis failed in this regard, generating terrible outcomes in terms of economic growth and unemployment, returns available to savers and access to credit for borrowers. Third, although we have made progress in reforming how we oversee and regulate the financial system, our work toward achieving a more stable and dynamic system able to deliver its essential services to both savers and borrowers is far from complete. We must keep pushing this agenda forward and not be deterred by those that defend the status quo. As always, the remarks that follow reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me start with a few words about where we are now. It is clear that the build-up of debt during the years prior to the crisis, as well as the crisis itself, has contributed to an unusually anemic recovery. This has occurred despite the best efforts of policymakers to stimulate demand through aggressive monetary and fiscal easing. The extraordinarily poor economic outcomes we see today underscore the importance of building a financial system that is resilient in its ability to provide credit to households and business throughout the business cycle. It also underscores the importance of limiting the types of financial and real imbalances that develop during times of prosperity. When such balances unwind, they can cause significant damage to the financial system and the economy.\n\nA range of reforms are in train as the Dodd-Frank Act and other initiatives are implemented in the United States and abroad. Within the Federal Reserve System, we are building a more robust framework for financial stability. And, through the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), interagency coordination in identifying and mitigating risks to financial stability is being strengthened.\n\nAs we move to implement financial reform, we should not be dissuaded by those who argue that the costs of reform are too high or that the job is simply too difficult. I grant that not everyone is, or will be, happy with all the reform measures. Reasonable people can disagree about the best way to achieve certain public policy objectives or the appropriate speed of the transition. But I think that the fundamental point that the financial system needs to be changed in profound ways should be broadly accepted at this point.\n\nNow I accept the notion that some minimum degree of instability is unavoidable. That is the price society pays for maturity transformation and the other services provided by the financial sector—services that produce large public benefits. But I doubt that this should be the end of the story—we also have some control over the amplitude of booms and the severity of the busts. Although it is impossible to attribute the instability of financial markets to any one single driving force, recent experience suggests that in many cases innovation plays an important role. I explore this point further in the printed version of my remarks—but for the purposes of our discussion today let me summarize it by saying that innovations that initially create real value generate feedback mechanisms that often fuel the development of excessive expectations—a boom that eventually reverses when the basic belief system that sustained it is contradicted by events. Such innovations can occur in the real economy—consider the Internet—or in the financial sector—think of subprime lending and structured finance products. Although the role of innovation has differed across various booms and busts, some important common elements are evident in many of these episodes. Early on in the cycle, an innovation can lead to changes in fundamental valuations or the creation of new markets and financial products. Examples of this might include the technology boom that followed the creation of the Internet or the subprime lending and the associated structured finance innovations that supported the housing boom. As market participants respond to the innovation, this may cause a surge in business activity. Consider the investment in fiber optic cable and telecommunications equipment in the late 1990s or the surge in U.S. housing demand in the 2000s. This surge in activity drives up profits and prices, which in turn sustains the boom. As part of this process, feedback mechanisms work to reinforce beliefs in the importance and sustainability of the innovation. In the tech bubble, for example, some new firms do displace traditional providers and network effects support scale and profitability and deter new entrants. In the case of the subprime lending boom, the provision of credit led to increased demand, which pushed up prices, and rising prices, in turn, held down credit losses. These feedback mechanisms reinforce belief in the sustainability of the boom, often extending the boom far beyond activity levels or valuations justified by how the innovation has changed the “fundamentals.” The process often comes to an abrupt end, and generally does so when the basic belief system that underpinned the boom is contradicted by events. In the tech boom, prices fell when earnings didn’t materialize because only a few firms could achieve and sustain first-mover advantages. In the subprime mortgage episode, loss experience climbed sharply once the options of selling or refinancing at higher prices was no longer available. With the benefit of hindsight, the inherent contradictions supporting the boom are exposed. For example, the U.S. housing boom was unsustainable because it was not possible to indefinitely keep relaxing credit underwriting standards to qualify new buyers to stoke demand. It was also unsustainable because the rise in prices often led to a supply response that limited the prospect of further price increases. Another class of threats to financial stability emerge from sudden reversals of market sentiment regarding economic policy and institutional arrangements. This is a complex issue which I will not explore in detail today, other than to note that here too, early profits all too often feed pro-cyclical behavior, undermining market discipline. This in turn facilitates the accumulation of both private and public imbalances that are painfully difficult to unwind when financing suddenly stops. When sudden reversals occur, large costs are imposed on the real economy and the financial system, costs that are not fully internalized by the market participants that may have benefited from the boom. The often significant negative externalities associated with financial market instability  suggest that regulation and prudential standards should be aimed both at limiting the frequency and extent of booms and at building a more resilient financial system, so there is less damage when the busts inevitably occur. The goal here is not to use regulation to prevent or even limit innovation, whether real or financial. Many innovations have generated significant benefits for the macro-economy. For example, the Internet, which lay at the heart of the tech bubble, generated myriad benefits. Similarly, innovations in the financial realm have enabled businesses to limit risk and specialize in their core competencies, and households to smooth consumption. This in turn has enabled the economy to be more productive. Instead, a critical objective of prudential oversight and regulation should be to enhance the system so that financial transactions of all forms reflect an assessment of risk and return by both the borrower and the lender that is as accurate as possible, recognizing that we live in an inherently uncertain world. This means that our reform efforts should be aimed at strengthening the quality of information and the system of incentives governing risk-taking by both institutions and individuals. And on those occasions when regulators judge that a systematic understatement and mispricing of risk may be occurring, we need to find better and more effective ways to actively lean against those dynamics. This includes using the bully pulpit to point out why a particular boom is likely to prove unsustainable. It also means ensuring that markets are structured so that investors with differing perspectives on the value of an asset are able to actively participate. Booms tend to go further when the ability to “go short” is limited or emerges only late in the game. Second, regulation needs to be oriented to establishing standards that will be appropriate throughout the cycle—for both the boom period and the bust. For example, in terms of subprime mortgage underwriting, this would have included enforcing standards with respect to loan valuation, loan-to-value ratios, household income verification, and the quality of loan documentation. As I have argued before, monetary policy will often, though not always, be too blunt a tool for such tasks. Generally, it will be better to develop and use more surgical instruments designed to fit the particular circumstances. In addition, no matter how effectively we reform the financial system, it seems unlikely that we will ever be able to completely eliminate booms and busts. There will be problems in identifying the boom—distinguishing between what is sustainable and what is unsustainable. There also will be broader and even more subtle obstacles—booms, when they are underway, are typically enjoyable. As a result, regulatory interventions that temper booms normally are going to be unpopular. So in practice even activist regulators may struggle to act early enough and with sufficient force to arrest a boom before it becomes a bubble. This suggests that to make the financial system secure, we are going to have to do much more than just act to temper booms and busts. In this regard, making financial markets and institutions, in their practices and structure, less prone to amplifying and propagating shocks is a critical step. This means, in particular, that regulation should be designed to create incentives that operate over sufficiently long time horizons so that the entire cycle of boom and bust is included. For risk management systems, this includes using stress scenarios to place appropriate limits on concentration and risk exposures. The use of value at risk (VAR) models that emphasize recent experience is clearly inadequate. In the case of compensation practices, firms and regulators need to continue to look for ways to tie compensation to the profitability of the firm over the cycle and rather than over shorter time frames, such as the calendar year, and making sure that compensation is appropriately adjusted for the risks that were taken. There also needs to be a framework for ensuring that collateral haircuts are high enough to provide meaningful protection in bad states of the world even if this means keeping collateral margins higher during the good times. Making progress on this front would help limit the propensity for leverage to increase when loss experience is low and to provide greater protection when volatility climbs and market conditions become less buoyant. In general, we need to continue to look to implement changes in systems and practices that will help dampen the pro-cyclicality of the system, and temper the amplitude of both booms and busts. Attention to the incentives created by infrastructure design is also important. Poor infrastructure design can serve to mask and obscure participants’ understanding of the credit and liquidity risks that they are exposed to. A good example of this is the triparty repo market, which plays a central role in providing funding on a collateralized basis. This market for short-term credit evolved in the United States in a manner in which transactions between lenders and borrowers covered only part of each day—from late afternoon to early morning. During the middle of the day, the two large clearing banks supplied huge amounts of intraday credit to the major securities dealers. Borrowers’ assumed this credit would always be available to them, and did not appreciate the rollover risk to which they could be exposed if a clearing bank decided not to lend to them during the day. Similarly, triparty lenders underestimated their exposure to borrowers, believing that the clearing banks would always return their funds each morning. When triparty borrowers encountered funding pressures, these assumptions were starkly called into question. The private sector Triparty Repo Infrastructure Task Force, created in 2009, has made progress toward the objective of creating a more stable triparty market, but deeper change is needed to achieve real systemic risk reduction in this market. I will return to this subject later. As part of our financial stability effort, we also need to build in short-circuit mechanisms that help to dampen shocks and increase resilience. This is reflected in work underway in implementing the Basel III agreements relating to the capital conservation buffer and also on capital planning in our supervisory process. This includes requirements for financial intermediaries to cease paying dividends when economic circumstances deteriorate. It also includes developing a systematic framework so that banks can be required to raise capital to ensure that they have adequate resources to deal with adverse economic scenarios—even if those scenarios have a low probability of being realized. These innovations are designed to limit behaviors that we saw during the financial crisis that made the financial system less robust. Banks were reluctant to cut their dividend payments and compensation because of fears that this would signal weakness. These payouts depleted capital and made these institutions more vulnerable to deteriorating economic circumstances. Similarly, banks were reluctant to raise capital to protect themselves against particularly adverse states of the world. This was unfortunate because the collective behavior of banks to be less prepared for adverse states of the world, often made such adverse states of the world more likely. In an important sense, a poorly capitalized bank generates negative externalities, making the entire financial system less secure, with costs to other financial market participants, whereas the reverse is true of a well-capitalized bank. As noted earlier, another important step is to increase transparency throughout the financial system. There are at least two important elements to this. First, regulators need to have comprehensive access to information about the financial institutions and markets that they oversee—including ones that may not be directly regulated. Without such information, diagnosis of emerging problems is more difficult and less timely, and appropriate remedies are more difficult to develop. Second, financial institutions and other market participants need access to high quality information in terms of the financial condition of their counterparties. Balance sheet information including capital and liquidity positions and counterparty exposures would enable financial market participants to more accurately assess the condition of those with which they do business. Increased transparency would reduce the level of uncertainty, which contributes to risk aversion and financial crises. Greater transparency in terms of off balance-sheet activities such as OTC derivatives exposures might also be helpful for the same reasons. Greater transparency is often unpopular because it may reduce market power and reveal business strategies and, thereby, limit profits. But the private loss of profit opportunities must be balanced against the public good of greater financial stability. Such steps reinforce the work underway to make the major financial intermediaries and financial market infrastructures more resistant to shocks when they inevitably occur. This includes appropriate capital and liquidity requirements and appropriate risk management practices for banks and financial market infrastructures. Finally, when institutions do get into difficulty we need a credible way of enabling these institutions to recover or, if recovery is not possible, to be resolved in an orderly manner so that failure of any one institution doesn’t threaten to bring down the rest of the financial system. So how are we doing relative to the agenda that I have laid out?   In my opinion, we have made a good start, but there is a long ways to go. In many areas, we have identified the necessary tasks only in general terms. Progress in figuring out the details and the implementation path and how to coordinate the efforts on a cross-border basis is more limited. I would particularly highlight the cross-border coordination problem—regulatory oversight is national, but many financial firms and infrastructures operate on a global basis. Effective reform requires mutually consistent global standards—and while international cooperation to date has been good on many fronts, progress is uneven, and the devil is in the details of implementation. We need all national authorities to resist the temptation to favor domestic financial interests over the interest of achieving a true level playing field globally. And we should resist the urge to favor locally controlled infrastructures where global solutions would better advance the collective financial stability interest. Instead we should work to ensure fair access to global infrastructures. Also, it is important that national  regulators have access to data and a role in the regulatory oversight of such global infrastructures when that is relevant to their own national financial stability agendas. In the United States, I think we have made more progress in bolstering the resilience of our banking institutions than we have on the other tracks. There are two elements to this. The first element is the increase in capital that has already occurred. The major U.S. banking institutions are much better capitalized today than they were in the fall of 2008. The increase in capital reflects a number of factors—a long period of low capital payouts relative to income, significant equity raises, as well as sizable asset dispositions that have shrunk the balance sheet and bolstered capital. The fact that credit losses have abated and this has enabled banks to release reserves has also been important. The second element is the international agreement to implement new Basel III capital standards. Not only will Basel III significantly raise the Tier I capital standard when it is fully implemented in 2019, but also it raises the quality of capital by putting the emphasis on tangible common equity. In addition, we and our partners in the international community are in the process of implementing capital surcharges for large, systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), with the size of the surcharge dependent on size, complexity, and interconnectiveness. I appreciate that it is impossible to calibrate “SIFIness” precisely, but this is not a valid argument for no surcharge. The logic behind the SIFI surcharge is that the failure of a systemically important institution would generate a very large shock to the rest of the financial system. As a consequence, it makes sense to require higher capital for such firms to reduce their probability of failure. In addition, the Federal Reserve’s efforts to improve banks’ capital planning processes and evaluate their capital dispositions in the context of stress scenarios—the so-called Comprehensive Capital Assessment and Review (CCAR) process—is an important innovation. Most significantly, this process induces  banks to improve their capital planning processes in light of potential stress scenarios. It also creates an enforcement mechanism so that dividends and share repurchases can be suspended more quickly when economic circumstances deteriorate. On the liquidity side, there has also been progress. U.S. banks have bolstered their liquidity buffers and the Basel Committee has proposed a liquidity coverage ratio requirement that effectively would require large, systemically important banks to hold sufficient liquid assets so that they could reasonably conduct their operations for 30 days without having to raise any new funds. In addition, the industry is reengineering how the triparty repo system operates in order to significantly reduce the large intraday exposures of the two clearing banks in the system. This is important because, as we saw during the financial crisis, very large intraday exposures can prove destabilizing. However, I would argue that progress on the liquidity front has not progressed as far as desired. 1 First, many banks remain dependent on short-term funding to finance longer-term assets from counterparties that tend to flee at the first signs of distress. In particular, money market mutual funds remain vulnerable to runs. Such runs can occur even when the underlying risks remain negligible, making money market mutual funds a source of instability. Just a question from an investor about the fund manager’s exposures can cause the fund manager to withdraw funding from a counterparty. This may be market discipline, but it does not operate in a way that makes the financial system more stable. The SEC is leading an effort to reform the money market mutual fund industry. Second, the Basel liquidity coverage ratio is under review to ensure that it accomplishes its goals without creating adverse unintended consequences. It will be implemented but in a somewhat altered form, since the proposal is not locked down to the same degree as the Basel III capital standards. Ensuring that financial market utilities (FMUs) are robust is another important workstream with a number of important elements. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act has provisions that enable the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate particular FMUs as systemically important and, therefore subject to tougher prudential standards. Internationally, the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS), which I chair, and the International Organization of Security Commissions (IOSCO), have proposed a comprehensive set of operational standards for FMUs, which I expect will be finalized early next year. We expect that these principles will be endorsed and adopted by the G20 countries, establishing a minimum standard for important FMUs around the world. However, progress is slow and uneven. For example, it is unlikely that the G20 countries will meet the goal to clear all standardized over-the-counter derivative trades through central clearing counterparties by the end of 2012. Similarly, I have my doubts whether the next set of industry recommendations to reduce risk in the triparty repo market will be sufficient to eliminate all the major potential sources of instability—including inadequate risk management practices and lack of resiliency to a dealer default. Experience suggests that it is not easy for market participants to agree on measures that enhance financial stability when this goal conflicts with the commercial and business interests. If the private sector falls short in this instance, public authorities may need to intervene and impose more forceful regulatory solutions. I also think that the scorecard is mixed with respect to making financial institutions, in their practices and structure, less prone to amplifying and propagating shocks. On one hand, the capital rules and the CCAR process should cause banks to husband their capital better during times of stress than was the case during the financial crisis. Also, compensation practices are improving in that more pay is deferred and over longer time periods. Similarly, risk management practices have improved. Institutions are better able to aggregate and assess their risk exposures within short time periods and stress testing means that there is a better understanding of how these exposures might perform in adverse environments. But our task remains unfinished. While progress on reforming compensation practices is welcome, I recognize that there is still much to be done before we can truly say that incentives are lined up in a way that fully supports financial stability objectives. We have work to do on the information front too. Consider the issue of international regulatory access to data. Currently U.S. bank regulators do not have access to the consolidated global balance-sheet information of the foreign banks that operate in the United States (or vice versa for that matter). Our examiners see data associated with the foreign firms’ U.S. operations, but not how that fits in with their operations abroad. Without certain specific types of consolidated global information, it is difficult to place the U.S. operations of a foreign firm in their global context, and make informed judgments about the adequacy of such firms’ capital and liquidity buffers. For example, liquidity is often managed on a global basis, and key business lines are frequently managed globally, even if they reside in multiple legal entities located in different jurisdictions. Making progress in establishing protocols that would enable bank regulators to share more relevant confidential supervisory information on a cross-border basis would be a significant advancement. Such enhanced collaboration offers attractive alternatives to ringfencing or other actions that seek to impose local solutions to risks facing globally active firms. Similarly, information about counterparty exposures is not broadly available. Occasionally, information is revealed following specific stress tests, but disclosure is very incomplete and irregular. Nor is good pricing information on many financial market instruments such as OTC derivatives readily available. This may ultimately change as such OTC derivatives instruments become more standardized, are centrally cleared, and the data associated with such trades are reported to trade repositories—but, as noted earlier, this still lies off in the future. Similarly, implementing a global legal entity identifier standard that would enable regulators (and potentially others), to easily aggregate information on a consolidated legal entity basis is still a work in process. Similarly, there has been little progress made with respect to reengineering the financial system so that the transmission mechanisms act to dampen rather than amplify shocks. However, I wouldn’t be very critical here. This is particularly difficult work for several reasons. First, it is difficult because it relates to how all the parts of the financial system interact. It requires a holistic approach and an evaluation of how the financial system responds to shocks. Up to this point, regulatory reform efforts have been more focused on individual banks and infrastructures, rather than how the entire system functions. Second, it is difficult because the evaluation must extend to entities and activities that operate outside of the more tightly regulated core—including, of course, the so-called “shadow banking system.”    In the U.S., some of this responsibility undoubtedly falls to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was created by the Dodd-Frank Act. But this is a relatively new institutional arrangement and how well it will be able to perform its mission in practice remains to be determined. Similarly, on an international basis, the Financial Stability Board has undertaken an initiative to evaluate risks within the shadow banking system, but this effort is also still in a fledging stage. Finally, turning to the last issue about how to deal with institutions that run into difficulty, there has been progress. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) gave the FDIC the authority to resolve certain large systemically important financial  firms, on the recommendation of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, and after the Treasury Secretary makes certain determinations in consultation with the President. Among other things, DFA enables the FDIC to establish a bridge institution in which critical activities could be moved so that the failure of a major institution will not unduly disrupt the provision of key financial services. DFA also authorizes the Federal Reserve to require that such institutions develop recovery and resolution plans—plans that must be acceptable to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The need to produce such plans will likely create some incentive for rationalizing complex corporate structures and, presumably, make resolution easier to implement. But a major challenge remains in implementing resolution effectively on a cross-border basis. The legal rules and regulatory regimes differ across legal jurisdictions. So, when a multinational banking organization becomes insolvent, each subsidiary and affiliate must be resolved in multiple bankruptcy proceedings, with the prospect of inconsistent treatment and larger than necessary losses in aggregate. Although the Financial Stability Board has taken up this issue, the legal impediments to progress here are significant despite the best efforts and intentions of regulators. The difficulty in implementing an efficient  cross-border resolution is one of the reasons why the largest globally active firms are being asked to hold additional capital. In conclusion, let me emphasize the importance of the mission—to reform and better regulate the global financial system so it can perform its key financial intermediation function of funneling savings from investors to borrowers even under adverse circumstances. Clearly, the financial system we had in 2008 was woefully inadequate relative to this mission. Both the official sector and the private sector have responsibilities with respect to the work that remains ahead. It falls on us as regulators to seek to minimize the costs and adjust as the unforeseen consequences of reform become apparent, and to be mindful of the adjustment costs and challenges facing many firms and markets. In particular, we need to understand as best we can how all the threads of the reform effort interact within one integrated global financial system. We also need to ensure that, where the law gives us latitude, that compliance and other costs are calibrated to be commensurate with the financial stability benefits generated by particular reform measures. In this respect, we must be particularly sensitive to the burden that the regulatory environment places on smaller, less systemically important institutions. But the private sector has responsibilities too. Banking leaders and industry trade groups should propose smart solutions to achieve essential financial stability objectives and not simply lobby against change. The industry has an interest in a healthy financial system that can withstand shocks and adverse economic circumstances. More statesman-like engagement is both warranted and welcome. Thank you very much for your attention. I am happy to take a few questions. _______________________________________ 1 In general, I think progress on liquidity is inherently more difficult than on capital because tougher liquidity standards conflict with one of the basic function of banks-maturity transformation. Savers want to hold their funds in highly liquid, short-term assets. But borrowers want to lock up their funding over long time periods. Banks help bridge that gap. Pushing banks hard on the liquidity side runs up against this constraint.\n\nNow I accept the notion that some minimum degree of instability is unavoidable. That is the price society pays for maturity transformation and the other services provided by the financial sector—services that produce large public benefits. But I doubt that this should be the end of the story—we also have some control over the amplitude of booms and the severity of the busts.\n\nAlthough it is impossible to attribute the instability of financial markets to any one single driving force, recent experience suggests that in many cases innovation plays an important role. I explore this point further in the printed version of my remarks—but for the purposes of our discussion today let me summarize it by saying that innovations that initially create real value generate feedback mechanisms that often fuel the development of excessive expectations—a boom that eventually reverses when the basic belief system that sustained it is contradicted by events.\n\nSuch innovations can occur in the real economy—consider the Internet—or in the financial sector—think of subprime lending and structured finance products. Although the role of innovation has differed across various booms and busts, some important common elements are evident in many of these episodes.\n\nEarly on in the cycle, an innovation can lead to changes in fundamental valuations or the creation of new markets and financial products. Examples of this might include the technology boom that followed the creation of the Internet or the subprime lending and the associated structured finance innovations that supported the housing boom.\n\nAs market participants respond to the innovation, this may cause a surge in business activity. Consider the investment in fiber optic cable and telecommunications equipment in the late 1990s or the surge in U.S. housing demand in the 2000s. This surge in activity drives up profits and prices, which in turn sustains the boom. As part of this process, feedback mechanisms work to reinforce beliefs in the importance and sustainability of the innovation. In the tech bubble, for example, some new firms do displace traditional providers and network effects support scale and profitability and deter new entrants. In the case of the subprime lending boom, the provision of credit led to increased demand, which pushed up prices, and rising prices, in turn, held down credit losses. These feedback mechanisms reinforce belief in the sustainability of the boom, often extending the boom far beyond activity levels or valuations justified by how the innovation has changed the “fundamentals.”\n\nThe process often comes to an abrupt end, and generally does so when the basic belief system that underpinned the boom is contradicted by events. In the tech boom, prices fell when earnings didn’t materialize because only a few firms could achieve and sustain first-mover advantages. In the subprime mortgage episode, loss experience climbed sharply once the options of selling or refinancing at higher prices was no longer available. With the benefit of hindsight, the inherent contradictions supporting the boom are exposed. For example, the U.S. housing boom was unsustainable because it was not possible to indefinitely keep relaxing credit underwriting standards to qualify new buyers to stoke demand. It was also unsustainable because the rise in prices often led to a supply response that limited the prospect of further price increases.\n\nAnother class of threats to financial stability emerge from sudden reversals of market sentiment regarding economic policy and institutional arrangements. This is a complex issue which I will not explore in detail today, other than to note that here too, early profits all too often feed pro-cyclical behavior, undermining market discipline. This in turn facilitates the accumulation of both private and public imbalances that are painfully difficult to unwind when financing suddenly stops.\n\nWhen sudden reversals occur, large costs are imposed on the real economy and the financial system, costs that are not fully internalized by the market participants that may have benefited from the boom.

The private sector Triparty Repo Infrastructure Task Force, created in 2009, has made progress toward the objective of creating a more stable triparty market, but deeper change is needed to achieve real systemic risk reduction in this market. I will return to this subject later.\n\nAs part of our financial stability effort, we also need to build in short-circuit mechanisms that help to dampen shocks and increase resilience.

Not only will Basel III significantly raise the Tier I capital standard when it is fully implemented in 2019, but also it raises the quality of capital by putting the emphasis on tangible common equity.\n\nIn addition, we and our partners in the international community are in the process of implementing capital surcharges for large, systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), with the size of the surcharge dependent on size, complexity, and interconnectiveness. I appreciate that it is impossible to calibrate “SIFIness” precisely, but this is not a valid argument for no surcharge.\n\nThe logic behind the SIFI surcharge is that the failure of a systemically important institution would generate a very large shock to the rest of the financial system. As a consequence, it makes sense to require higher capital for such firms to reduce their probability of failure.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s efforts to improve banks’ capital planning processes and evaluate their capital dispositions in the context of stress scenarios—the so-called Comprehensive Capital Assessment and Review (CCAR) process—is an important innovation. Most significantly, this process induces  banks to improve their capital planning processes in light of potential stress scenarios. It also creates an enforcement mechanism so that dividends and share repurchases can be suspended more quickly when economic circumstances deteriorate.\n\nOn the liquidity side, there has also been progress. U.S. banks have bolstered their liquidity buffers and the Basel Committee has proposed a liquidity coverage ratio requirement that effectively would require large, systemically important banks to hold sufficient liquid assets so that they could reasonably conduct their operations for 30 days without having to raise any new funds. In addition, the industry is reengineering how the triparty repo system operates in order to significantly reduce the large intraday exposures of the two clearing banks in the system. This is important because, as we saw during the financial crisis, very large intraday exposures can prove destabilizing.\n\nHowever, I would argue that progress on the liquidity front has not progressed as far as desired. 1 First, many banks remain dependent on short-term funding to finance longer-term assets from counterparties that tend to flee at the first signs of distress. In particular, money market mutual funds remain vulnerable to runs. Such runs can occur even when the underlying risks remain negligible, making money market mutual funds a source of instability. Just a question from an investor about the fund manager’s exposures can cause the fund manager to withdraw funding from a counterparty. This may be market discipline, but it does not operate in a way that makes the financial system more stable. The SEC is leading an effort to reform the money market mutual fund industry.\n\nSecond, the Basel liquidity coverage ratio is under review to ensure that it accomplishes its goals without creating adverse unintended consequences. It will be implemented but in a somewhat altered form, since the proposal is not locked down to the same degree as the Basel III capital standards.\n\nEnsuring that financial market utilities (FMUs) are robust is another important workstream with a number of important elements. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act has provisions that enable the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate particular FMUs as systemically important and, therefore subject to tougher prudential standards. Internationally, the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS), which I chair, and the International Organization of Security Commissions (IOSCO), have proposed a comprehensive set of operational standards for FMUs, which I expect will be finalized early next year. We expect that these principles will be endorsed and adopted by the G20 countries, establishing a minimum standard for important FMUs around the world.\n\nHowever, progress is slow and uneven. For example, it is unlikely that the G20 countries will meet the goal to clear all standardized over-the-counter derivative trades through central clearing counterparties by the end of 2012. Similarly, I have my doubts whether the next set of industry recommendations to reduce risk in the triparty repo market will be sufficient to eliminate all the major potential sources of instability—including inadequate risk management practices and lack of resiliency to a dealer default. Experience suggests that it is not easy for market participants to agree on measures that enhance financial stability when this goal conflicts with the commercial and business interests. If the private sector falls short in this instance, public authorities may need to intervene and impose more forceful regulatory solutions.\n\nI also think that the scorecard is mixed with respect to making financial institutions, in their practices and structure, less prone to amplifying and propagating shocks. On one hand, the capital rules and the CCAR process should cause banks to husband their capital better during times of stress than was the case during the financial crisis. Also, compensation practices are improving in that more pay is deferred and over longer time periods. Similarly, risk management practices have improved. Institutions are better able to aggregate and assess their risk exposures within short time periods and stress testing means that there is a better understanding of how these exposures might perform in adverse environments.\n\nBut our task remains unfinished. While progress on reforming compensation practices is welcome, I recognize that there is still much to be done before we can truly say that incentives are lined up in a way that fully supports financial stability objectives.\n\nWe have work to do on the information front too. Consider the issue of international regulatory access to data. Currently U.S. bank regulators do not have access to the consolidated global balance-sheet information of the foreign banks that operate in the United States (or vice versa for that matter). Our examiners see data associated with the foreign firms’ U.S. operations, but not how that fits in with their operations abroad. Without certain specific types of consolidated global information, it is difficult to place the U.S. operations of a foreign firm in their global context, and make informed judgments about the adequacy of such firms’ capital and liquidity buffers. For example, liquidity is often managed on a global basis, and key business lines are frequently managed globally, even if they reside in multiple legal entities located in different jurisdictions. Making progress in establishing protocols that would enable bank regulators to share more relevant confidential supervisory information on a cross-border basis would be a significant advancement. Such enhanced collaboration offers attractive alternatives to ringfencing or other actions that seek to impose local solutions to risks facing globally active firms.\n\nSimilarly, information about counterparty exposures is not broadly available. Occasionally, information is revealed following specific stress tests, but disclosure is very incomplete and irregular. Nor is good pricing information on many financial market instruments such as OTC derivatives readily available. This may ultimately change as such OTC derivatives instruments become more standardized, are centrally cleared, and the data associated with such trades are reported to trade repositories—but, as noted earlier, this still lies off in the future. Similarly, implementing a global legal entity identifier standard that would enable regulators (and potentially others), to easily aggregate information on a consolidated legal entity basis is still a work in process.\n\nSimilarly, there has been little progress made with respect to reengineering the financial system so that the transmission mechanisms act to dampen rather than amplify shocks. However, I wouldn’t be very critical here. This is particularly difficult work for several reasons. First, it is difficult because it relates to how all the parts of the financial system interact. It requires a holistic approach and an evaluation of how the financial system responds to shocks. Up to this point, regulatory reform efforts have been more focused on individual banks and infrastructures, rather than how the entire system functions. Second, it is difficult because the evaluation must extend to entities and activities that operate outside of the more tightly regulated core—including, of course, the so-called “shadow banking system.”    In the U.S., some of this responsibility undoubtedly falls to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was created by the Dodd-Frank Act. But this is a relatively new institutional arrangement and how well it will be able to perform its mission in practice remains to be determined. Similarly, on an international basis, the Financial Stability Board has undertaken an initiative to evaluate risks within the shadow banking system, but this effort is also still in a fledging stage.\n\nFinally, turning to the last issue about how to deal with institutions that run into difficulty, there has been progress. In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA) gave the FDIC the authority to resolve certain large systemically important financial  firms, on the recommendation of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, and after the Treasury Secretary makes certain determinations in consultation with the President. Among other things, DFA enables the FDIC to establish a bridge institution in which critical activities could be moved so that the failure of a major institution will not unduly disrupt the provision of key financial services. DFA also authorizes the Federal Reserve to require that such institutions develop recovery and resolution plans—plans that must be acceptable to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The need to produce such plans will likely create some incentive for rationalizing complex corporate structures and, presumably, make resolution easier to implement.\n\nBut a major challenge remains in implementing resolution effectively on a cross-border basis. The legal rules and regulatory regimes differ across legal jurisdictions. So, when a multinational banking organization becomes insolvent, each subsidiary and affiliate must be resolved in multiple bankruptcy proceedings, with the prospect of inconsistent treatment and larger than necessary losses in aggregate. Although the Financial Stability Board has taken up this issue, the legal impediments to progress here are significant despite the best efforts and intentions of regulators. The difficulty in implementing an efficient  cross-border resolution is one of the reasons why the largest globally active firms are being asked to hold additional capital.\n\nIn conclusion, let me emphasize the importance of the mission—to reform and better regulate the global financial system so it can perform its key financial intermediation function of funneling savings from investors to borrowers even under adverse circumstances. Clearly, the financial system we had in 2008 was woefully inadequate relative to this mission.\n\nBoth the official sector and the private sector have responsibilities with respect to the work that remains ahead. It falls on us as regulators to seek to minimize the costs and adjust as the unforeseen consequences of reform become apparent, and to be mindful of the adjustment costs and challenges facing many firms and markets. In particular, we need to understand as best we can how all the threads of the reform effort interact within one integrated global financial system. We also need to ensure that, where the law gives us latitude, that compliance and other costs are calibrated to be commensurate with the financial stability benefits generated by particular reform measures. In this respect, we must be particularly sensitive to the burden that the regulatory environment places on smaller, less systemically important institutions.\n\nBut the private sector has responsibilities too. Banking leaders and industry trade groups should propose smart solutions to achieve essential financial stability objectives and not simply lobby against change. The industry has an interest in a healthy financial system that can withstand shocks and adverse economic circumstances. More statesman-like engagement is both warranted and welcome.\n\nThank you very much for your attention. I am happy to take a few questions.\n\n_______________________________________ 1 In general, I think progress on liquidity is inherently more difficult than on capital because tougher liquidity standards conflict with one of the basic function of banks-maturity transformation. Savers want to hold their funds in highly liquid, short-term assets. But borrowers want to lock up their funding over long time periods. Banks help bridge that gap. Pushing banks hard on the liquidity side runs up against this constraint.",

    "text": "It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today.  My remarks are going to focus on what is called the “too big to fail” problem.  As you are aware, this problem arises when the failure of a large, complex financial institution threatens to cause such significant disruption to the financial system and the economy that these potential costs are judged as too severe to bear, leading to government intervention to prevent the failure.  As a result, the firm, by being too big to fail, gains an implicit guarantee at the taxpayers’ expense that it does not have to pay for.  I think there is broad agreement that such a regime is unacceptable in several respects.  The first problem is that it creates an uneven playing field between large and small financial firms, with larger financial firms gaining a funding advantage from the perception that they may be too big to fail.  The second problem is that this funding advantage creates incentives for financial firms to become bigger and more complex.  The third problem is that there is a positive feedback loop.  As the banking system becomes more concentrated and complex, that just increases the financial stability risks, making the too big to fail problem even more acute.\n\nSo what should we do about it?  Today, I will evaluate three broad sets of choices: 1) Building a credible resolution regime and more resiliency in the financial system that together reduce the systemic costs of failure sufficiently so that large, complex firms can be allowed to fail; 2) taking steps, such as tougher prudential standards, that further reduce the probability of failure of such firms; and 3) breaking up the too big to fail firms so that no firm is so large that its failure would threaten financial stability in the first place.\n\nTo summarize, I conclude that building a credible resolution regime is necessary but not sufficient.  Even if the single-point of entry resolution framework proposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which I very much endorse, is fully perfected, the costs of resolution for the largest systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) will still be significant.  I will argue that at least as much effort should be made to lower the risk of failure of such large, complex firms.  Not only does this include higher capital and liquidity requirements, which we are implementing, but also building incentives into the system so that firm managements will act more forcefully and much earlier to put their firms on more solid ground before they encounter greater difficulties.\n\nFinally, I am not yet convinced that breaking up large, complex firms is the right approach.  In particular, these firms presumably exist, in large part, because there are scale or network effects that allow these firms to offer certain types of services that have value to their global clients.  These benefits might be lost or diminished if such firms were broken up.  In addition, the costs incurred in breaking up such firms need to be considered.  Finally, the breakup of such firms would not necessarily result in a significant reduction in overall systemic risk if the resulting component firms were still, collectively, systemic.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nDefining the Too Big to Fail Problem\n\nThe root cause of the too big to fail problem is the fact that the failure of a large, complex financial firm is likely to generate significant, undesirable externalities. These include disruption to the ability of the financial system to provide credit and other essential financial services to households and businesses. When this happens, not only is the financial sector adversely affected, but its troubles spill over and harm the real economy.\n\nAlthough there are negative externalities associated with the failure of any financial firm, these externalities are disproportionately more damaging in the case of large, complex and interconnected firms.  However, despite the label, too big to fail, the magnitude of these externalities does not depend simply on size. The extent of the externalities also depends on the particular mix of business activities and the degree of interconnectedness with the rest of the financial industry.  One significant element is the importance of the services the firm provides to the broader financial system and the economy, as well as the ease with which its customers can move their business to other providers. Another element is the extent to which the firm’s structure and activities create the potential for contagion—that is, the potential that a problem at one firm could spread more broadly through the financial system.  Contagion might occur along several different pathways, including the direct losses imposed by failure on the firm’s counterparties, the impact of the failure on the asset prices held by other leveraged financial institutions, or a loss of confidence spreading to other firms with similar business models.\n\nThe presence of large negative externalities creates a dilemma for policymakers when such firms are in danger of failing, particularly at a time when the wider financial system is also under stress.  At that point in time, the expected costs to society of failure are very large compared to the short-run costs from providing the extraordinary liquidity support, capital, or other emergency assistance necessary to prevent catastrophic failure.\n\nThe market's belief that a too big to fail firm is more likely to be rescued in the event of distress than other firms weakens the degree of market discipline exerted by capital providers and counterparties.  Since the government does not charge for this implicit guarantee, this reduces the firm's cost of funds and incents the firm to take more risk than would be the case if there were no prospect of rescue and funding costs were higher.  The fact that firms deemed by the market to be too big to fail enjoy an artificial subsidy in the form of lower funding costs distorts competition to the detriment of smaller, less complex firms.  This advantage, in turn, creates an unfortunate incentive for firms to get even larger and more complex.  As a result, the funding benefit of being seen to be too big to fail causes the financial system to become skewed toward larger and more complex firms in ways that are unrelated to true economies of scale and scope.\n\nThus, the too big to fail problem consists of two intertwined issues.  The first is that the negative consequences to the financial system and to the economy from failure for a given set of firms are unacceptably high.  This is the financial stability risk.  The second is that anticipated interventions to prevent catastrophic failure create an uneven playing field.  Not only is this outcome unacceptable from an equity or fairness perspective, but it is also undesirable because it can increase the incentives for firms to become even bigger and more complex.  Over time, this may lead to a greater number of systemically important firms and expose the financial system to greater systemic risk.\n\nThis suggests that we need to maintain our focus on two goals:  (1) Making the financial system more stable by reducing the degree of disruption when failures occur—that is, shrinking the size of the externalities—and by lowering the risk of failure in the first place, and (2) eliminating the artificial advantages that large, complex firms might have that create incentives for them to become bigger and more complex.\n\nOne more point deserves emphasis.  Only eliminating the competitive advantage of large, complex firms from the too big to fail subsidy will not necessarily make the financial system more stable.  For example, consider a regime in which interventions to prevent the failure of large, systemically important firms were impossible.  In that case, the funding advantage that comes from being perceived as too big to fail would be eliminated because such firms could fail putting the firm’s equity and debt holders at risk.  But, this would not be a good outcome from a financial stability perspective because the failure of such firms could still be catastrophic for the financial system and the economy.  Thus, we need to solve the “fairness/subsidy” issue, but do so in a way that ensures that the resulting regime is more stable, resilient and robust.\n\nThe Fairness/Subsidy Issue\n\nThere is considerable debate about the size of the funding advantage of large banks that is due to too big to fail and how much this funding advantage creates incentives to become larger and more complex.  One reason is that it is difficult to measure the size of these effects.  For example, consider funding costs.  We can document that larger banks’ unsecured debt funding costs tend to be lower than those for smaller banks.  But the funding costs for larger firms across a broad range of industries also tend to be lower than for smaller firms in the same industries.  This reflects, in part, the fact that the debt issues of larger firms tend to be more sizeable and more liquid.  In addition, larger firms may be more diversified on average and thus less prone to failure, everything else equal.\n\nThe measurement challenge, then, is to identify what portion of the lower funding costs at the largest financial firms, after accounting for these other factors, is due to a perception among investors that such firms are too big to fail.\n\nDespite these measurement difficulties, most of the evidence is consistent with a too big to fail funding advantage in banking.  First, during the financial crisis, we observed that the funding cost advantage of the larger banks grew substantially relative to the smaller banks as the crisis became more acute.  This is noteworthy because if the funding cost advantage is due to a too big to fail premium, then that premium should rise when the economic environment worsens and the potential risk of failure increases.  Of course, the Dodd-Frank Act has changed the landscape.\n\nSecond, ongoing research by Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff shows that the funding advantage of large versus small banks is higher than the funding advantage for large versus small non-bank financial firms and non-financial firms when other factors are held constant.\n\nThird, the major rating agencies add an uplift to their credit ratings for the largest banks due to the prospect of government support.  While it is possible that the rating agencies are wrong in their assessment, what matters is perception.  If investors share this view or simply follow the ratings, then this should create a too big to fail funding advantage.\n\nWith respect to the second consequence of the subsidy—the incentive for management to make their firms larger and more complex so as to be perceived as too big to fail and thus able to take advantage of any funding subsidy—this is harder to evaluate.  On one hand, this is not the only incentive management may have to get bigger.  For example, the fact that chief executive officer compensation and prestige are related to size may be just as important.  On the other, this still is a problem because it works to distort the structure of the financial system and makes—by encouraging the proliferation of large, complex firms—the too big to fail problem worse.\n\nI conclude that while the funding advantage issue is very relevant to the debate on too big to fail, it may not be the most important issue.  To me, the unacceptable risk posed to financial stability from the failure of large, systemic firms is at least as important.\n\nSolving Too Big to Fail\n\nAs I see it, there are two broad ways of solving the too big to fail problem.  The first is to create a more robust financial system so that the failure of a large, systemically important financial firm does not threaten to take down the rest of the financial system.  In this case, the authorities can let the troubled firm fail.  Because failure is now credible, this should also eliminate the funding advantage from being perceived as too big to fail.\n\nThe second is to take steps to prevent the failure of such large, complex firms in the first place.  This also reduces any funding advantage for firms perceived as being too big to fail, but without some of the negative financial stability consequences associated with failure.  I view these two strands as complements rather than substitutes, with more work necessary on both.\n\nTurning first to the issue of reducing the consequences of failure, there are numerous elements of this effort underway.  Some are focused on making the financial market infrastructure more robust so that when a failure occurs the shock is dampened, not amplified and propagated throughout the financial system.  For example, considerable effort has been made to create incentives for firms to standardize over-the-counter derivative trades and to clear those trades through central counterparties.  Similarly, extensive work has been undertaken by the Federal Reserve and the major clearing banks to make the tri-party repo system more stable.  Money market mutual fund reform is also part of this ongoing effort.\n\nOther initiatives are focused on reducing the financial stability consequences from the failure of a systemically important financial firm.  The major initiative here is the single point of entry framework for resolution proposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Under this framework, if a financial firm is to be resolved under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC will place the top tier bank holding company into receivership and its assets will be transferred to a bridge holding company.  The equity holders will be wiped out and sufficient long-term unsecured debt will be converted into equity in the new bridge company to cover any remaining losses and to ensure that the new entity is well capitalized and deemed creditworthy.  Subsidiaries would continue to operate, which should limit the incentives for customers to run.  By assigning losses to shareholders and unsecured creditors of the holding company and transferring sound operating subsidiaries to a new solvent entity, such a \"top-down\" resolution strategy should ensure continuity with respect to any critical services performed by the firm’s subsidiaries and this should help limit the magnitude of any negative externalities.\n\nI very much endorse the FDIC’s single point of entry framework for resolution.  I think it is the best plan for implementing Title II given the complexity and scope of large, global financial institutions, and I also think it is well suited to the U.S. bank holding company framework.  For this regime to work properly there needs to be a sufficient amount of debt outstanding at the parent company that can be converted by the FDIC into equity to ensure that the new bridge company will be demonstrably well-capitalized. We don’t yet have a long-term debt requirement—this is an area where we are still working out the details. My own view is that a holding company needs a substantial amount of long-term debt to ensure that the newly created bridge company will be considered fully viable by its counterparties.\n\nWhile the Title II single-point-of-entry strategy holds tremendous promise, there are important implementation issues that still need to be worked out.  Implementing the resolution regime on a cross-border basis remains one of the most significant challenges.  In this regard, I am worried about two current shortcomings:\n\nUnless market participants make the appropriate contractual changes that will ensure that the placement of the parent company into Title II will not trigger the close-out provisions of over-the-counter derivatives and other qualified financial contracts that are outside the reach of Title II’s U.S.  application, foreign counterparties to a SIFI will tend to exercise this right whenever it is in their individual economic interest to do so.  This would create significant difficulties.  Such actions could greatly complicate the operations of the firm during a time when it is already under considerable stress and could propagate stress more broadly in financial markets.\n\nThere are two main courses of action for addressing this concern, and they are not mutually exclusive.  First, existing derivative contracts need to be amended and future contracts need to provide that the parent’s entry into the Title II proceeding does not trigger the close out option.  Second, legal changes need to be implemented abroad so that the one-day stay that applies to qualified financial contracts governed by U.S. law is enforceable against those contracts governed by foreign law.  Only by making these changes can we avoid the potential for disruptive close outs.  I strongly encourage the ongoing efforts to address this critical issue.\n\nA second issue with respect to Title II resolution on a cross-border basis is that we cannot be certain how foreign authorities will react when the parent holding company is put into the Title II proceeding.  While the U.S. authorities have been in discussion with our colleagues abroad to enable the coordination needed for a smooth cross-border resolution process, uncertainties remain regarding the circumstances under which host authorities may either choose to take or be required to take actions such as unilateral \"ring-fencing\" that might disrupt the implementation of the single point of entry approach.  Thus, we need to continue to work with foreign regulators to iron out any issues ahead of time to remove these uncertainties so that the resolution regime will work well for global, systemically important firms.\n\nAnother issue with respect to the Title II resolution regime is the residual uncertainty about whether a particular firm in fact would go through a Title II resolution.  Recall that under the Dodd-Frank Act, Title II is not the default approach for dealing with the failure of a large complex firm.  For a firm to go through Title II, a determination must first be made that the failure of the firm and its resolution would have serious adverse effects on U.S. financial stability under the insolvency law that would otherwise apply.  This means that market participants will not know for certain which path U.S. authorities will ultimately take until this determination is made—allowing resolution under ordinary insolvency law, as contemplated under Title I, versus initiating a Title II resolution.  Faced with this uncertainty, investors in the short-term obligations that would likely be protected only under the Title II regime could decide to run.\n\nReducing the Likelihood of Failure\n\nEven with an appropriate resolution process in place that ends too big to fail, the consequences of failure will still be messy.  Also, market discipline is only effective to the extent that those investors with their funds at risk perform the appropriate due diligence on an ongoing basis.  This suggests that a resolution regime by itself is not sufficient.  Further efforts should also be made to reduce the probability of a default.\n\nA number of steps have already been taken along these lines that further reduce default risk.  The Basel III framework significantly raises both the quantity and quality of capital required of internationally active bank holding companies.  This risk-weighted capital standard is also being augmented by a higher leverage ratio requirement. The Basel framework will also require SIFIs to hold additional capital due to their complexity (more commonly referred to as the SIFI surcharge).  As a result, the capital buffer for the more systemic firms should be higher based on size, complexity, interconnectedness, global exposure and substitutability, so that their expected probability of failure will be lower than for less systemic firms. 1\n\nThe SIFI surcharge acts as a penalty for size and complexity, leaning against any remaining funding cost advantage that might remain for a large complex firm even after a viable resolution regime is in place.  This should further level the playing field for smaller firms and reduce the incentive to become systemically important in the first place.  However, I expect that it will take considerable time for the surcharge to have a meaningful impact on size and complexity.\n\nWe also need to create new mechanisms and incentives for bank management to act early, well before resolution becomes necessary.  Early intervention is likely to be much more successful in preventing failure as compared to last-ditch efforts. These actions can take many forms—cutting capital distributions earlier, raising new capital faster, restructuring businesses sooner, and reorganizing senior management and boards of directors more radically when the firm is not performing well.\n\nIn this regard, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) should bolster the incentives for early action.  The CCAR is a significant supervisory innovation intended to ensure that large, complex bank holding companies have robust internal capital planning processes and sufficient capital to withstand stressed economic conditions and to continue to be viable financial intermediaries.  Importantly, the CCAR takes a forward-looking perspective in assessing a bank’s capital adequacy, including ensuring that its internal stress testing processes address its unique vulnerabilities and exposures.  The CCAR should push banks to proactively manage their capital so as to be well prepared for the type of market stresses that could cause significant declines in income and capital.\n\nOther steps could be taken to complement the CCAR.  One approach would be to implement a long-term debt requirement in a way that further enhances market discipline and provides incentives for regulators to promptly intervene if necessary.  Another might be to structure compensation practices to strengthen senior bank managers’ incentives to proactively manage risk.  For example, imagine how incentives would change if a significant portion of senior bank management’s compensation each year were deferred to be available to cover future capital losses.  I suspect that over time this would meaningfully alter management’s risk tolerance.  Also, in addition to the quantity of the deferred compensation, the form it takes could also affect incentives.  If most of the deferred compensation were in the form of debt rather than equity, I suspect this would also affect management’s risk tolerance and the appetite to cut dividend payments, reduce share repurchases or raise more capital more promptly when the firm began to become stressed.  The terms and the form of deferred compensation are an important tool that could be further developed to generate a better set of incentives consistent with our financial stability objectives.\n\nWe must also ensure that firms can respond to financial or operational weakness of any type by having robust recovery plans that get triggered long before resolution becomes necessary.  They should develop and track metrics that not only identify when they are on the verge of insolvency or default, but that trigger appropriate remediation actions whenever the firm begins to become stressed.  These plans should identify actionable options that the firm can take in response to financial weakness that will restore the confidence of the firm’s counterparties without the need for extraordinary official sector support.  They must also have disciplined processes that analyze the root causes of their problems and identify longer-term strategies that will need to be employed as other recovery options to restore capital and liquidity are being executed.  And firms must support the viability of their contingency and recovery plans by implementing the internal governance necessary to develop, test, update and implement them credibly.\n\nSome argue that what I have proposed—higher capital requirements and better incentives that reduce the probability of failure combined with a resolution regime that makes the prospect of failure fully credible—are insufficient.  Perhaps, this is correct.  After all, collectively these enhancements to our current regime may not solve another important problem evident within some large financial institutions—the apparent lack of respect for law, regulation and the public trust.  There is evidence of deep-seated cultural and ethical failures at many large financial institutions.  Whether this is due to size and complexity, bad incentives or some other issues is difficult to judge, but it is another critical problem that needs to be addressed.  Tough enforcement and high penalties will certainly help focus management’s attention on this issue.  But I am also hopeful that ending too big to fail and shifting the emphasis to longer-term sustainability will encourage the needed cultural shift necessary to restore public trust in the industry.\n\nOne alternative strategy for dealing with too big to fail is to reduce the size of large banks by imposing size limits.  While I understand the motivation, it is important to recognize that imposing size limitations might not be a very efficient means of making the financial system more stable.  First, it could sacrifice some socially beneficial economies of scale and scope, especially to the global clients of large financial institutions, depending on how the size limits were implemented.  Second, the resulting benefits in terms of reducing systemic risk might be quite small.  As demonstrated by the thrift crisis, if many firms are all vulnerable to the same shock, ensuring that these firms are small and numerous won’t necessarily reduce the systemic risk they collectively pose to the financial system.  Third, the costs incurred in breaking up such firms also need to be considered.\n\nOthers have argued in favor of separating commercial and investment banking activities of the large banks.  In my opinion, there are shortcomings to re-imposing Glass-Steagall-type activity restrictions.  It is not obvious to me that the pairing of securities and banking businesses was an important causal element behind the financial crisis.  In fact, independent investment banks were much more vulnerable during 2008 than the universal banking firms which conducted both banking and securities activities.  More important is to address the well-known sources of instability in wholesale funding markets and to give careful consideration to whether there should be a more robust lender of last resort regime for securities activities.\n\nEvaluating the socially optimal size, scope and organizational structure of financial firms is a complicated exercise, and so is establishing a viable transition path to a system of much smaller banks.  It would be helpful in this regard if advocates of the break-up solutions would develop detailed proposals that address the essential questions of how such downsizing or functional separation would be accomplished, and what the expected benefits and costs could be from such a restructuring.\n\nThe recent financial crisis underscores the importance of financial stability as a necessary condition for a vibrant economy.  An important element in improving financial stability is to reduce the expected loss associated with the failure of any financial firm to the point where default does not imperil the financial system and the real economy.  A holistic approach is needed that both provides a credible resolution process for large, complex and interconnected banks, uses enhanced prudential standards and initiatives to further reduce the probability of default and the social losses associated with a default, and that incents management to intervene early to address incipient problems before they threaten the viability of the firm.  Relying solely on resolution is not sufficient.  Until the Title II resolution process is used, there will remain uncertainties regarding how well this approach will work in practice—especially in a time of market stress. For this reason it is also important to continue to pursue a number of alternative approaches.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to answer a few questions.\n\n1 New liquidity requirements such as the liquidity coverage ratio also work to reduce the risk of failure by giving firm management more time to address problems before a funding squeeze becomes acute.",

    "text": "I am pleased to be here today to speak about the issue of regulatory reform and\n  the global financial system.\n\nA stable and resilient financial system that allocates credit in an efficient\n  manner underpins and supports economic growth and rising standards of living\n  around the world.   As we saw recently, however, a financial system\n  that is prone to booms and crashes can not only lead to an inefficient allocation\n  of real resources during the booms but can also have devastating consequences\n  for global economic activity and employment during the crashes. In an integrated\n  global economy, severe negative consequences can be felt far away from the\n  center of the financial crisis–as they were in Asia in late 2008 and\n  early 2009.  This underscores our common interest in promoting financial\n  stability on a global basis.\n\nTruly effective reform would generate sizable and widespread benefits.   However,\n  there are significant challenges to achieving this. One challenge arises from\n  the fact that we have a global economy with many large, globally active financial\n  firms, but our regulatory regimes are implemented at the national level. Another\n  is that any attempt to improve regulatory standards will inevitably meet with\n  resistance from parties that have a vested interest in the status quo.\n\nToday I will comment on the actions underway in the United States and internationally\n  to make the financial system more resilient and robust.   I will\n  focus on the logic behind the reform efforts, progress to date, and areas where\n  there still is considerable work to do.  As always, what I have to say\n  reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market\n  Committee, the Federal Reserve System, or my international supervisory colleagues\n  with whom I work closely with on a regular basis.\n\nThe financial crisis exposed significant vulnerabilities in the financial\n  system.  Without revisiting all the causes and consequences of the credit\n  boom and bust that led to a boom and bust in the U.S. housing market, the bottom\n  line is that our regulatory system failed in two important dimensions.  First,\n  a significant number of large, internationally active financial firms reached\n  the brink of failure.  Second, the financial system was not very resilient\n  when these firms got into difficulty.  Instead, the threat of failure\n  propagated further shocks that reverberated throughout the global financial\n  system.\n\nThese two shortcomings reflect many factors including inadequate capital and\n  liquidity buffers, poor incentives to correctly measure, price and manage risks\n  ex ante, the opacity of firm balance sheet and counterparty exposures, and\n  the manner in which large financial firms were interconnected within the financial\n  system.   In the end, there was too much leverage in which large\n  amounts of highly illiquid, long-term assets were financed by short-term liabilities.  The\n  fact that a large amount of the wholesale funding used to finance these assets\n  was provided by leveraged financial intermediaries to other financial intermediaries\n  increased the system’s vulnerability to adverse shocks.  As it turned\n  out, the amount and quality of capital was grossly inadequate relative to the\n  quality of the assets and off-balance-sheet exposures of many of the major\n  global banking institutions.  Moreover, many institutions had inadequate\n  liquidity buffers.   The lack of liquidity forced the fire sale of assets,\n  which depressed prices and increased the pressure on capital.\n\nWhen troubled institutions did fail, this exacerbated the pressure on the\n  remaining institutions.    Aggravated by the lack of transparency\n  about their counterparty exposures and the contingent liabilities they faced,\n  the problems of a single institution quickly became the problems of many.  This\n  was fueled in part by concern that the counterparty claims on failed institutions\n  would be frozen and unable to be realized quickly.\n\nNot only did some core firms have inadequate capital and liquidity, they also\n  faced conflicting incentives as to how to manage their capital resources.  For\n  example, many firms that came under stress were slow to cut their dividends\n  or to raise new capital because of fears that such actions would signal their\n  underlying weakness.  Obviously, the failure to conserve capital made\n  these institutions weaker rather than stronger.\n\nThe crisis also underscored severe deficiencies in the international dimension\n  of the regulatory environment.  Financial institutions, flows and activities\n  are global, but the vast majority of regulation and information sharing is\n  contained within national boundaries. Where resolution regimes existed, they\n  generally existed only for banking entities and were not set up to handle the\n  orderly resolution of a large internationally active bank holding company or\n  non-bank financial firm.  This cross-border problem persists to this day.\n\nThe interconnectedness of the financial system also caused shocks to spread\n  quickly.  For example, the failure of Lehman Brothers led to losses at\n  the Reserve Fund, which precipitated a widespread money market mutual fund\n  panic. It also led to actions by U.K. bankruptcy authorities that had the effect\n  of freezing the assets owned by hedge fund and other clients of the firm and\n  this encouraged such investors to pull assets from other institutions perceived\n  to be weak. These and other propagation channels in turn, led to virtual stoppage\n  of lending and borrowing activity in the money markets and, ultimately, a credit\n  crunch that reverberated throughout the global financial system.   For\n  example, the crisis led to a sharp constraint on the availability of trade\n  credit in the fall of 2008 that had a devastating impact on economic activity\n  in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, as well as Japan.  This\n  region felt the full economic consequences of the crisis even though banks\n  in the region were generally healthy and far from the U.S. housing boom and\n  bust and the subprime mortgage debacle that could be viewed as the initial\n  spark that ignited the crisis.\n\nThe crisis also underscored another area for further cross-border work:  Our\n  international approach to liquidity provision and lender-of-last-resort services\n  to globally active institutions.  Cooperation among liquidity providers,\n  for example, through some central bank dollar swap arrangements, played an\n  important role in stabilizing global money markets.  However, the division\n  of lender-of-last-resort responsibilities between home and host countries remained\n  ambiguous through the crisis.  This needs further attention.\n\nSo what steps have been taken to address some of these sources of vulnerability?\n  There are literally dozens of initiatives underway nationally and globally,\n  not only in traditional bodies for such cooperation such as the Basel Committee\n  on Bank Supervision, but also among newer international groups such as the\n  Financial Stability Board. Most of these initiatives can be grouped into three\n  major categories:\n\nTurning to the first set of initiatives designed to reduce the probability\n  of failure of large, systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs),\n  the tougher capital and liquidity regimes that the Basel Committee has devised\n  are probably the most important elements.   On the capital side,\n  Basel III significantly increases requirements with respect to both the quantity\n  and quality of capital.   On the quantity side, there have been two\n  important changes.  First, the capital requirements have been raised so\n  that internationally active banks must have common equity ratios of at least\n  7 percent of risk-weighted assets when the standards are fully phased in by\n  2019.  This 7 percent standard consists of a 4.5 percent minimum plus\n  a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer.   Banks whose capital\n  ratios fall into the buffer range will face increasingly stringent restrictions\n  on capital distributions such as dividends and share repurchases and discretionary\n  bonus payments to staff.  This should act as a form of “automatic\n  stabilizer” to their capital resources and change the incentives banks\n  face during periods of stress.   Second, for many globally active banks,\n  the amount of capital required will also rise because the amount of risk-weighted\n  assets against which the capital ratios are calculated will increase.   Explicit\n  capital requirements for operational risk and counterparty credit risk, as\n  well as increased requirements for certain trading activity and transactions\n  between financial institutions should result in a significant rise in risk-weighted\n  assets.\n\nOn the quality side, capital requirements have been toughened by narrowing\n  the definition of what can be counted toward common equity capital for regulatory\n  capital purposes.  The emphasis has been put on common equity because\n  of the superior loss-absorbing capacity of this type of capital on a going\n  concern basis.   Tighter limits have been put on certain types of\n  assets—such as mortgage servicing rights and tax-deferred assets—in\n  which the values depend on a firm remaining viable, and that might not be easy\n  to realize in the midst of a financial crisis.\n\nOn the liquidity regime side, several major initiatives are underway.   The\n  Basel Committee has proposed a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement for\n  globally active banks.  In essence, this standard would require that large,\n  internationally active banks hold sufficient short-term, liquid assets so that\n  a bank could fund its operations for at least 30 days, without needing to borrow\n  funds from the central bank.  By creating a pool of liquid assets that\n  the bank could sell or allow to mature, the liquidity buffer would buy time\n  for the bank to explore options to restore market confidence.  Such steps\n  might include selling businesses and other asset dispositions, raising additional\n  capital, or by making changes in senior management.   The LCR requirement\n  is being carefully evaluated to ensure that there will be no deleterious, unintended\n  consequences when it becomes effective.\n\nAlso, apart from the Basel initiative, supervisors are placing greater emphasis\n  on liquidity.  For example, in the United States, supervisors have emphasized\n  the importance of adequate liquidity buffers and many banks have been pushed\n  to bolster their liquidity resources through the supervisory process.\n\nTogether, this emphasis on a greater quantity and higher quality of capital\n  and larger liquidity buffers should make banks individually, and the banking\n  system as a whole, more resilient to adverse shocks.  The goal is to enable\n  banks to retain market access to capital and funding even when large losses\n  occur or the banks are subject to other adverse shocks.  The ability to\n  retain access should enable banks to manage through their problems, avoiding\n  the types of liquidity runs that led to the forced unwinding of positions and\n  that pushed what might have been solvent institutions over the edge into insolvency.\n\nIn addition to the Basel III standards for capital and liquidity, an international\n  effort is underway to further reduce the probability of failure for systemically\n  important financial institutions or SIFIs.   The basic logic behind\n  this effort is that the failure of a larger, more complex firm can have disproportionately\n  large negative systemic consequences.  As a result, such firms should\n  be forced to hold additional capital in order to reduce their probability of\n  failure below that of smaller firms.  An additional capital requirement\n  on such SIFIs would also help to level the playing field between larger and\n  smaller firms by offsetting the funding advantage that accrues to the largest\n  firms that stems from the perception that they are “too big to fail.”  Although\n  there are potentially other options, I believe that a SIFI surcharge could\n  best be satisfied by requiring SIFIs to hold additional common equity above\n  and beyond the Basel 7 percent Tier I common standard.\n\nThe move toward a tougher capital and liquidity regime undoubtedly receives\n  the greatest attention in terms of the measures being implemented to make large\n  banks safer.  However, there also are a number of other important changes\n  being made to supervisory practices in the United States and elsewhere.  One\n  noteworthy example is the more widespread use of horizontal stress tests to\n  ensure that banks have adequate capital.  This is a very important development,\n  because it makes the evaluation of capital more forward-looking. The issue\n  is not just how much regulatory capital a bank has currently but how that bank’s\n  capital level is likely to evolve over time in adverse economic circumstances.\n\nIn the United States, another important change is that we are refocusing our\n  supervisory practices to identify structural weaknesses and to push firm managements\n  to remedy their shortcomings relative to “best practice” standards.    Horizontal\n  reviews across the large banks are being undertaken to identify firm-specific\n  deficiencies.  At the Federal Reserve, we are placing greater emphasis\n  on understanding banking organizations’ business models and strategies—in\n  other words, better understanding the specific markets and activities from\n  which the banking organizations make money over time and the nature of the\n  risks they take in this process.  Strong risk management practices within\n  organizations are particularly important, as risk managers must be empowered\n  to stand up to those in the front office and prevent activities and practices\n  that create risks or incentives that are incompatible with bank safety and\n  soundness.   Compensation practices are being reviewed to ensure\n  that the incentives created by the compensation regime are consistent with\n  a banking organization remaining in sound financial condition.\n\nAnother key supervisory innovation has been the more extensive supervisory\n  engagement on the processes that banking organizations use to assess and plan\n  for their capital needs. Recently, the Federal Reserve completed a Comprehensive\n  Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) program for the 19 largest U.S. bank holding\n  companies. The purpose of the CCAR process was to assess the way these institutions\n  allocate capital over time against the risks they run, including how robust\n  that allocation is to changes in the economic and financial environment.  As\n  part of this exercise, banking organizations had to show how their capital\n  would hold up under a stress environment specified by the Federal Reserve,\n  as well as how they expected their activities and capital positions to be affected\n  by changes such as Basel III. The CCAR built on lessons learned during the\n  crisis about the importance of taking a forward-looking and comprehensive approach\n  to assessing capital adequacy, including an assessment of the level and composition\n  of a bank holding company’s capital resources under stressed economic\n  and financial market conditions.\n\nThis exercise received considerable attention because an assessment of bank\n  holding companies’ plans for increasing dividend payments and implementing\n  stock buyback plans were an important part of the review. However, the CCAR’s\n  focus was much broader than simply assessing proposed capital distributions.  Instead,\n  the goal of the CCAR was to help ensure that large bank holding companies have\n  strong, firmwide risk measurement and management processes to support their\n  internal assessments of capital adequacy and that their capital resources are\n  sufficient given their business activities and the resulting risk exposures.\n\nThe second important strand of reform is to ensure that regulatory oversight\n  is sufficiently broad to include the activities of the so-called shadow banking\n  system.  This aspect of reform and oversight is still in its early days.   But\n  work is underway.   For example, the Financial Stability Board is\n  undertaking work to identify potential sources of vulnerability caused by the\n  activities in the shadow banking system and how such vulnerabilities could\n  be addressed.   Also, in the United States, the Financial Stability\n  Oversight Council (FSOC) views its mandate broadly with respect to identifying\n  systemic risks and proposing remedies.  For example, on an ongoing basis,\n  the FSOC will monitor and assess which non-bank financial intermediaries in\n  the United States are systemically important and, thus, require greater regulatory\n  oversight.\n\nBut the focus will not just be on large financial firms.  Activities\n  and practices that occur outside of the core institutions are also important.  For\n  example, the activities of money market mutual funds is one area receiving\n  close scrutiny.  As you know, a run on the money market funds developed\n  in the fall of 2008 when the Reserve Fund broke the buck when Lehman Brothers\n  failed.  This underscored a critical structural weakness of money market\n  mutual funds created by the convention that the net stable asset value could\n  be fixed at par.   When a money market mutual fund incurs losses\n  that cause it to “break the buck,” this encourages investors to\n  rush to withdraw their funds from other funds before they break the buck.  The\n  result can be a run on money market mutual fund assets.  In the United\n  States, the Securities Exchange Commission has already tightened the rules\n  with respect to liquidity, quality and the average maturity of so-called 2a-7\n  fund assets, but there is still more to be done to address the remaining vulnerabilities.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the final major strand of regulatory reform is to strengthen\n  the core of the financial system and make the system as a whole robust to the\n  failure of a large bank or non-bank financial institution.  In this realm,\n  there are several notable initiatives.\n\nFirst, an effort is underway to create robust resolution regimes that allow\n  large systemically important financial institutions to be wound down smoothly\n  in a way that minimizes contagion and the risk of a broader panic or that causes\n  damage to other parts of the financial system.  For example, the Dodd-Frank\n  Act gives enhanced resolution powers to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n  (FDIC) to use to wind down large, complex non-bank financial institutions.   If\n  such a firm becomes troubled, the regulators, with concurrence from the U.S.\n  Treasury, can avert a bankruptcy filing and instead put the non-bank financial\n  company into resolution.  As part of such a resolution process, regulators\n  are working to ensure that systemically important firms have viable recovery\n  plans and that such firms have “living wills” that can help guide\n  how such firms can be managed through a resolution situation.\n\nSecond, to reduce the likelihood of disruptive and highly costly failures,\n  regulators around the world are evaluating whether bail-in forms of capital\n  might be used to help recapitalize firms when they would otherwise lose their\n  viability, or, alternatively, to help facilitate the orderly wind-down of a\n  firm.  Bail-in capital might consist of a well-identified tranche of debt\n  that would convert to equity only if and when a particular set of trigger conditions\n  were met.   Such triggers might include breaching a certain level of regulatory\n  capital and/or a regulatory determination that without conversion the firm\n  would no longer be viable.  One considerable challenge is how to define\n  a set of triggers in a way that is sufficiently transparent and objective so\n  that the bail-in process does not act as a catalyst and precipitate a run on\n  other firms that might appear to have similar characteristics.  In principle,\n  however, by helping to recapitalize the firm, bail-in capital could help to\n  forestall the need for a forced, rapid liquidation of assets and this might\n  help to facilitate the orderly wind-down of a large, global firm that otherwise\n  could not otherwise be easily resolved.\n\nThird, efforts are underway to reduce counterparty risk exposures by requiring\n  that over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, and\n  equity and commodity derivative trades be standardized where feasible—and\n  that all standardized trades be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs).    Standardized\n  clearing through CCPs reduces the complex web of counterparty exposures that\n  exist in the bilateral world of OTC derivatives.  Everyone that centrally\n  clears becomes the counterparty to the CCP.  This enables a high level\n  of gross bilateral exposures to be netted down to a much more manageable set\n  of net exposures to the CCP.\n\nFourth, recognizing that mandated central clearing will only reduce risk if\n  the CCPs themselves are robust, efforts are underway to strengthen financial\n  market infrastructures.  In the United States, for example, the Dodd-Frank\n  Act instructs the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate certain\n  financial market utilities (FMUs) as systemically important.   Such\n  FMUs would be subject to a tougher regulatory oversight regime.  On a\n  parallel track, at the international level, the Committee for Payment and Settlement\n  Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions\n  (IOSCO) are revising and strengthening a set of regulatory oversight principles\n  and minimum business standards for financial market infrastructures (FMIs).  These\n  principles include numerous standards with respect to governance, access, risk\n  management practices, and capital and liquidity standards.   As Chair\n  of the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems and someone deeply involved\n  in the CPSS-IOSCO work, I believe that adoption of an agreed-upon global set\n  of minimum standards for FMIs is essential if we are to have a safe global\n  financial system.\n\nRecently, CPSS-IOSCO issued a revised set of such principles for consultation.  Responses\n  to the proposed principles are due back by late July.  The CPSS-IOSCO\n  plans to publish a final set of standards early next year.  I hope and\n  anticipate that countries will adopt these principles as the minimum regulatory\n  standards for the systemically important FMIs that operate in their jurisdictions.\n\nIn summary, considerable effort is underway to enhance financial stability. That said, I think it is important to recognize some of the important challenges\n    in designing and implementing effective reform.  Four broad challenges\n    immediately come to mind.  First, the resolution of large financial\n    firms that operate in multiple jurisdictions remains largely out of reach—at\n    least in the near- to medium-term.   This is due to the fact that legal\n    rules are not harmonized across the different regulatory regimes with respect\n    to bankruptcy and liquidation.  For example, although the Dodd-Frank\n    Act establishes a resolution regime for the U.S. operations of a large global\n    financial firm domiciled in the United States, this resolution framework\n    stops at the nation’s borders.  Supervisors from different nations\n    are working together in an effort to create more effective cross-border crisis\n    management tools and resolution regimes, but this work is still in its very\n    early stages and there are formidable obstacles to overcome.\n\nA second challenge is the uneven progress that has been made in reforming\n  bank regulation and supervision across the different jurisdictions.  For\n  example, in some cases, the supervisory authorities have been quite forceful\n  in making banks domiciled in their countries raise capital.   In\n  other cases, the response has been less aggressive.  The uneven progress\n  of reform makes comprehensive reform more difficult.  It shifts the tenor\n  of the discussion away from what is the proper macroprudential framework and\n  set of capital and liquidity requirements to one that focuses too much on issues\n  of relative competitiveness.   Too often the questions asked are:  What\n  is most beneficial to the banks of my particular country?  Do the regulations\n  bolster or harm my  “national champion”?  The focus shifts\n  away from the goal of bolstering global financial stability to finding ways\n  of tilting or adjusting the new standards to achieve a national competitive\n  advantage.\n\nThis is in not in anyone’s interest.  As discussed earlier, every\n  nation has an interest in promoting financial stability globally, since the\n  effects of systemic financial stress in one place can swiftly spread throughout\n  the global economy.  Moreover, although a relatively loose regulatory\n  regime may attract business from other financial centers, there is no free\n  lunch here.  A more lax regulatory regime is likely to expose that country’s\n  taxpayers to huge tail risks.\n\nA third challenge is the sequencing of reforms.  For example, many jurisdictions\n  are focusing on banking reforms, but have not yet applied the same intensity\n  to shadow banking activities.   If regulatory requirements for banks are\n  increased significantly, the risk of stimulating the growth of the non-regulated\n  shadow banking sector also increases.  This suggests that the regulatory\n  oversight effort has to be broadly applied so we just don’t trade one\n  problem—for example, undercapitalized large banks—for another—a\n  shrunken regulated banking sector and an enlarged, unregulated non-banking\n  sector.\n\nSo what needs to be done?   In short, plenty.   Although\n  we have made some progress in making the global financial system safer and\n  more secure, there is much more to do.  Several examples illustrate the\n  range of issues that are still outstanding.\n\nFirst, we do need to adopt an additional capital requirement on large global\n  systemically important financial institutions.   We need this to\n  reduce the risk of failure of such institutions to very low levels because\n  we do not yet have the tools in place to resolve these institutions on a cross-border\n  basis in a non-disruptive manner.   We also need to do this because\n  such institutions—by being perceived to be too big to fail—obtain\n  a funding advantage, which higher capital charges can help offset.  Without\n  such a requirement, large banks can gain a competitive advantage just through\n  their size.\n\nSecond, as discussed earlier, we have much more to do to ensure that we have\n  a relatively level playing field.  We need that to discourage regulatory\n  arbitrage and beggar-thy-neighbor policies that might benefit narrow national\n  constituencies at the expense of global financial stability.\n\nThird, we need closer cooperation among regulators.  While regulators\n  have successfully worked toward a much tougher regulatory regime for capital\n  and liquidity, there are still huge opportunities for further progress.  For\n  example, regulators need to adopt more far-reaching protocols that allow for\n  greater sharing of supervisory information on a cross-border basis to facilitate\n  more effective supervision.  But, this needs to be done carefully, so\n  that proprietary business information is protected.   Currently,\n  regulators generally do not have access to the necessary information to fully\n  assess the condition of foreign banks that operate within their borders.   They\n  have supervisory information about the activities and state of condition of\n  the foreign bank branches and subsidiaries within their borders, but do not\n  always have good access to information about the parent company or what the\n  banking entity looks like on a consolidated basis.  This has long been\n  a difficult issue, though efforts are underway to find ways to enhance information-sharing.\n\nSimilarly, protocols need to be developed to share regulatory information\n  about systemically important financial market infrastructures that operate\n  on a cross-border basis.  Access to the trade records of OTC derivatives\n  activity that will be recorded in trade repositories also needs to be made\n  available to be shared among regulators.\n\nFourth, we need greater clarity concerning the responsibilities of the home\n  versus the host country, especially when a bank encounters problems.\n\nFifth,\n  we need to work out how emergency liquidity should be provided on a cross-border\n  basis. If a major financial market utility in London, for example, needs dollar\n  liquidity to stay in operation, who will provide in it? Who will bear the risk\n  and on what terms and conditions?\n\nThe political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa underscores once\n  again the fact that we operate in a shared world economy in which events in\n  one country and region can have large impacts globally.  And to support\n  this globalized economy, global financial firms and a global payments and settlement\n  infrastructure are needed to support this activity.  Yet, we currently\n  operate with a financial system that is largely regulated on a country-by-country\n  basis.\n\nThis is not tenable.  What’s required is not some global authority\n  dictating what national authorities can do but instead greater cooperation\n  and trust in exchanging information and  agreement on harmonized standards\n  such as those laid out in the Basel III capital requirements and the CPSS-IOSCO\n  Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures.  There needs to be a\n  good faith commitment to try to achieve a level playing field.   The regulations\n  and supervisory practices that are put in place should be determined by what\n  is good for the public good writ large, rather than what benefits some narrow\n  set of private financial institutions or markets.\n\nFinally, we need to be persistent.  There is much work that still lies\n  ahead.  As the crisis recedes in memory, the natural reflex will be to\n  relax and grow complacent.  Already, some bankers are arguing that it\n  is time to get back to “business as usual.”   We have seen\n  that “business as usual” results in unacceptable outcomes.  So\n  we need to keep working on a continual basis to make the global financial system\n  more resilient and robust.   We will not be able to avert all future\n  failures or crises, but I know we can do much better in limiting the frequency,\n  severity and the breadth of their impact when they occur if we keep pushing\n  forward.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.   I would be happy to take a\n  few questions.",

    "text": "Thank  you, Mark, and thanks to the Bank of England for the opportunity to talk about  the important issue of reference rates.   I will focus my remarks today on reference rate reform in the United  States—where we have been, where we are, and where we are headed.  In short, I will argue that while much has  already been accomplished, we still have a lot more to do—and it must happen  within a compressed time frame.  This is  an important point that Andrew Bailey usefully underscored for us last  year.  Because of the great uncertainty  over LIBOR’s future and the risks to financial stability that would likely  accompany a disorderly transition to alternative reference rates, we need  aggressive action to move to a more durable and resilient benchmark  regime.  As always, what I have to say  reflects my own views and not those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nLIBOR Scandal Demonstrated the Imperative for Reform\n\nAlthough  the backdrop to current reference rate reform efforts is well known here, some  historical context is useful when considering the issues facing us today.  That history highlights why alternatives to  LIBOR are needed.  It also illustrates  the importance of continuing to focus on bank culture and proper incentives in  order to support financial stability over the longer term.\n\nAt its  core, the problem we face today is that the financial system has built a  tremendously large edifice on a structurally impaired foundation.  While many in the industry cannot recall a  time when LIBOR did not exist, in fact, it was only developed in the  1980s.  Since then, the use of LIBOR as a  reference rate has exploded—with the size of financial contracts referencing  U.S.-dollar LIBOR today estimated at close to $200 trillion. 2 The vast majority of these exposures are derivative obligations, such as  interest rate swaps.  But, that tally  also includes trillions of dollars of cash products, such as residential and  commercial mortgages, corporate bonds and loans, and securitized products.  And, with new contracts referencing LIBOR  still being written, this balance continues to grow significantly.\n\nBroadly  speaking, reference rates are vital to efficient market functioning.  They facilitate trading in standardized  contracts, which lowers transaction costs and increases market liquidity.  Robust reference rates can also reduce  information asymmetries and the risk of misconduct by providing transparent,  independent pricing.\n\nBut, in  the case of LIBOR, the foundation had serious flaws.  Most notably, LIBOR was (and is) based on  submissions from individual banks—which, in turn, were based on hypothetical  borrowing rates or expert judgments, and not actual transactions.  Moreover, deficiencies existed in regulatory  oversight and governance of the rate-setting mechanism.  These vulnerabilities enabled the  manipulation of the rate for the financial benefit of individuals and  institutions.  Amid profound breakdowns  in controls and compliance, individual traders conspired with rate submitters  at their own institutions or traders at other firms to manipulate the setting  of the rate to improve their trading results.   During the global financial crisis, panel banks also reportedly  submitted lower borrowing rates than they could actually obtain in the  marketplace.  They did so to disguise  their financial fragility at a time when uncertainty over bank liquidity and  solvency was high. 3\n\nThe  resulting scandal was particularly disturbing because of its scale and  flagrancy, including collusion by employees across firms.  It led to billions of dollars in fines, jail  terms for some individuals, and severe reputational damage to the financial  industry as a whole.  The global  financial crisis exposed excessive risk-taking and a long series of lapses in  judgment, and the LIBOR scandal further undermined trust in the ethical  standards of the banking industry.\n\nThe  scandal provides many cautionary lessons, including the ways in which poor  technical design can be exploited, the limitations of self-regulation, the  problems that arise when loyalty is to one’s trading co-conspirators rather  than to one’s institution, and the need for robust controls.  It also underscores the power of incentives  to drive individuals and firms to do things that are imprudent and/or  unethical. 4 And, the governance and control framework  that the banks and the LIBOR administrator had in place proved woefully  insufficient to prevent misconduct that stemmed from poor incentives.  In this context, one could say it was a  situation ripe for exploitation.\n\nThe  openness and brazenness of misconduct as captured in the recorded transcripts  also point to serious deficiencies in bank culture.  My New York Fed colleagues and I have  commented frequently on the need for sound culture and incentives as a  complement to effective regulation and supervision.  While there has been some progress on this  issue in recent years, the LIBOR and other rate-rigging scandals—not to mention  more recent breakdowns at individual banks—point to the need for further  strengthening of bank culture. 5 I look forward to the discussion with  Minouche and Andrew on improving culture in the fixed income, currency, and  commodity markets in the following panel.\n\nOne of  the key lessons from the financial crisis was that critical pieces of financial  system infrastructure must be both strong and resilient, and the LIBOR scandal  underscored this need. 6 The essential problem with LIBOR is the  inherent fragility of its “inverted pyramid,” where the pricing of hundreds of  trillions of dollars of financial instruments rests on the expert judgment of  relatively few individuals, informed by a very small base of unsecured  interbank transactions.  Moreover, that  base has contracted further in recent years, due to many factors, including  regulatory reform and the quantitative easing programs initiated by central  banks in many of the major advanced economies.   Relative to the vast sums of U.S.-dollar LIBOR contracts I mentioned  earlier, the median daily volume of unsecured three-month U.S.-dollar wholesale  borrowing is minuscule, at around $1 billion, and many days see less than $500  million in volume. 7 This lack of market liquidity means that  these rates cannot be sufficiently transaction-based to be truly  representative, and rates that are not transaction-based are more at risk to be  manipulated.\n\nSo,  despite efforts to improve LIBOR in recent years—and there undoubtedly have  been important changes that have strengthened its administration and  governance—the lack of underlying market liquidity for nearly all currencies  and maturities remains a problem, and there is no obvious solution. 8 The setting of LIBOR still depends heavily on  expert judgment.  Even for U.S.-dollar  LIBOR, actual transactions are the basis for only about one-third of the rate  submissions for tenors of one and three months.   This is noteworthy because these are the maturities that are referenced  by the bulk of financial contracts. 9\n\nIn light  of the history of LIBOR—and in the context of more than $320 billion in overall  misconduct fines since the crisis—banks are naturally reluctant to assume the  legal risks associated with submitting quotes based on very shallow markets. 10 Indeed, that is why some banks have left individual LIBOR  panels in recent years. 11 Andrew Bailey drove home this point in his  July 2017 speech.  He explained that the  Financial Conduct Authority had to press hard to persuade banks to remain on  the panels and voluntarily submit LIBOR quotes through the end of 2021. 12 LIBOR’s potential cessation after 2021 poses  a clear risk to financial stability, and prudent risk management means that all  of us must prepare for a world without LIBOR.\n\nThe Official  Sector Response\n\nIn recent years, international and domestic authorities  alike have actively worked with the private sector to address LIBOR’s  shortcomings and to find alternative rates.   One notable development has been the publication of an international set  of principles for financial benchmarks, developed by the International  Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) in 2013. 13 These principles—which include 19 specific  standards across governance, benchmark quality, methodology, and  accountability—have emerged as the international standard.  IOSCO has rightly focused on tying benchmarks  more closely to observable, arms-length transactions. This represents an  important step toward eliminating excessive reliance on expert judgment.\n\nThe Financial Stability Board (FSB) has been a  galvanizing force at the international level.   The FSB and its members have published proposals, plans, and timelines  for reference rate reform and have promoted the strengthening of the major  interest rate benchmarks.  The FSB has  been carrying out work on the development and introduction of alternative  benchmarks, developing a plan to accomplish a transition to new benchmarks,  encouraging work by the private sector on contract robustness, and reporting  regularly on the progress made. 14\n\nThe Federal Reserve has played a lead role in the  development of these recommendations as applied to U.S.-dollar LIBOR, working  closely with the other major financial regulatory agencies in the United  States.  This effort has also involved  coordinating with the official sector sponsors of similar efforts around the  world. 15 In late 2014, in response to FSB and  Financial Stability Oversight Council recommendations, the Federal Reserve  convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC)—a group of market  participants established to identify more robust alternative U.S.-dollar  reference rates that are risk-free or nearly risk-free, fit the needs of the  derivatives market, and are compliant with IOSCO principles. 16 This effort paralleled similar ones in other  jurisdictions to find reference rates that are well-suited to local conditions  and market needs—including the UK’s Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free  Reference Rates.  The ARRC was also  tasked with developing a transition plan to facilitate the adoption of these  rates in a voluntary and orderly manner, and with considering best practices in  contract design to prepare for the possibility that LIBOR ceases to be  published.\n\nPublication of Alternative Reference Rates by the Federal Reserve\n\nThe ARRC  has made important progress in achieving its mandate.  Notably, in June 2017, it selected the  Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as its preferred alternative to  U.S.-dollar LIBOR.  SOFR is a broad measure  of the cost of borrowing cash overnight using U.S. Treasury securities as  collateral, and is thus relevant to a wide range of market participants.  The rate is entirely transaction-based, and  the underlying market is robust, with current daily volume of more than $700  billion.  (By comparison, unsecured three-month  U.S.-dollar wholesale borrowing totals roughly $1 billion per day, as I  mentioned earlier.)  SOFR moves closely  with LIBOR and other money market rates over time, and because it covers  multiple segments of the repo market, it provides scope for future market  evolution. 17 Besides being more resistant to manipulation,  this nearly risk-free rate should also prove much more resilient during periods  of financial stress, because the U.S. Treasury repo market is likely to remain  deep and active during such episodes.\n\nThe New  York Fed administers and produces SOFR in cooperation with the Office of  Financial Research.  We began publishing  this rate on April 3 of this year, along with two other repo rates: the  Tri-Party General Collateral Rate and the Broad General Collateral Rate. 18 This work complements steps by the Federal  Reserve to promote greater transparency in rates in unsecured markets through  enhancements to the calculation of the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and  the launching of an entirely new rate, the overnight bank funding rate (OBFR). 19\n\nI have  long been a proponent of the idea that central banks are well suited to take on  this responsibility.  Reference rates  have strong public good properties, and the private sector faces notable coordination  challenges in this area.  Central banks  have a long history in producing such measures—recognizing that traditionally  this has been for purposes related to monetary policy—and are trusted  independent parties.  In my view, central  banks also ultimately “own” the financial stability risks that are present when  key reference rates are flawed.  Better  to recognize this responsibility and move proactively to mitigate such risks  than to step aside and hope that someone else will take up the mantle of reform.\n\nThe  Federal Reserve has designed these benchmarks to be compliant with IOSCO  principles, with regular review by oversight bodies and comprehensive ethics  and conflict-of-interest policies for staff. 20 Best practice also dictates that  administrators periodically review the rates they produce to assess whether  changes in the underlying markets require changes in how those rates are  administered.  We have dedicated  significant resources to these efforts, and are committed to the continued  production of rates so that market participants can have confidence about their  long-term viability.\n\nFor  these reasons, the Federal Reserve concurs with the ARRC that SOFR represents a  compelling alternative to U.S.-dollar LIBOR—particularly for most derivatives  transactions, where a near risk-free rate is more appropriate than a rate that  incorporates a bank credit risk premium.\n\nNevertheless,  market adoption of SOFR faces its own challenges, such as the development of  sufficient liquidity in derivatives that reference SOFR, and the establishment  of a term reference rate, which I will discuss in a moment.  These elements will have to be built over  time.  The ARRC’s Paced Transition Plan  lays out a timeline for the milestones that must reached over the coming  quarters and years for a successful transition. 21 I am confident that the ARRC will succeed,  but it will take considerable attention and effort.\n\nProgress  is already evident.  The Chicago  Mercantile Exchange began offering SOFR futures contracts earlier this month,  and trading activity has gotten off to a good start.  Development of SOFR derivatives, in turn,  will support the creation of a term reference rate.  Although the ARRC’s transition plan  anticipates that this will be completed by the end of 2021, it would be better  for this to occur more expeditiously.   The good news is that is broadly appreciated.  In this vein, the Committee’s second report  discussed some of the term rate alternatives, and development of proposals for  a term reference rate was recently added to its mandate.  In this regard, I would also encourage market  participants, academics, and other interested parties to contribute to the  effort to develop a term reference rate.\n\nAnother  key area of focus—further motivated by Andrew’s warning—is the development of  fallback contract language in the event that LIBOR ceases to be published.  The absence of such language creates the  potential for large-scale disorder in global financial markets should LIBOR go  away.  Put simply, this is an  unacceptable risk.  The International  Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) has been working on this issue for the  derivatives market and is expected to issue a consultative document soon that  should prove instrumental in making further progress.  The ARRC has also been coordinating a similar  effort across cash products of all types.   The goal is to achieve consensus on a consistent approach across markets  whenever feasible.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs I  have noted previously, LIBOR continues to have significant shortcomings despite  strengthened governance in recent years, and uncertainty about its future will  only grow over time.  This uncertainty  reflects the limited liquidity underlying LIBOR and the corresponding legal  risks I discussed earlier.  But, I am  also skeptical about whether LIBOR can ever be adequately  transaction-based.  As Andrew  highlighted, there is no guarantee that LIBOR will continue to exist beyond  December 2021.  In my view, LIBOR is  likely to go away—and it should, because it is not supported by a sufficiently  robust regime.  The LIBOR countdown clock  should provide an impetus for action, but it should also make market  participants and regulators increasingly nervous as we approach the  deadline—especially if longer-term solutions are not in train or in place.  Time is of the essence, and we must manage it  well.  The ARRC and others have laid out  valuable transition plans, and we need to ensure that they are executed  expeditiously and well.\n\nOf  course, I do not mean to minimize the costs involved.  This is a monumental and complicated  effort—one that the industry has never undertaken—and it will entail overcoming  many obstacles.  It requires collective  action by a wide variety of market participants, some of whom may not be fully  convinced of the need for change.  And,  there may be others with a direct interest in the preservation of LIBOR—such as  its administrator—who may not support moving away from the status quo.  There also undoubtedly will be those who seek  a free ride on the efforts of others.   And, of course, the effort will encounter inertia and wishful  thinking.  All of this is to be expected  in such a large undertaking with significant upfront costs.  Nevertheless, delay is not a viable  option.\n\nThis  task is borne out of necessity.   Financial crises typically result when we fail to identify  vulnerabilities, and then unexpected triggers turn those vulnerabilities into  points of weakness that can lead to catastrophic failure.  The discontinuation of LIBOR, however, is  different.  We can see it coming, and we  know the impact of a disorderly transition would be huge.  Therefore, a half-hearted effort or a failure  to act would be inexcusable, especially after all we have learned from the  experience of the financial crisis.   Moving this core piece of the global financial system to a firm and  durable foundation is essential and worth the cost.\n\nThis  task is admittedly hard, but I am optimistic given our past successes.  We have demonstrated that effective  collective action can provide solutions to longstanding structural  vulnerabilities in the financial system.   A key lesson from the crisis is that structural vulnerabilities must be  addressed continually.  If they are  ignored, larger problems eventually will result.  For example, through collective action over  the past decade, we have successfully addressed structural weaknesses in the  tri-party repo market, the over-the-counter derivatives market, and money  market mutual funds.\n\nEach of  these challenges required a tailored solution that relied on different  tools—including a diverse mix of market, regulatory and supervisory measures—to  get the job done.  Everything isn’t a  nail, and the best tool is not always a hammer.   You have to identify the problem that needs fixing and select the right  tool for the job.  This is likely to  require both official sector engagement and private sector initiative.\n\nIn the  case of LIBOR, the official sector has taken a multi-pronged approach:  strengthening the LIBOR regime, developing reference rate principles, using its  convening authority to marshal private sector participation, supplying robust  alternative reference rates, and using the bully pulpit to educate and spur  action.  International coordination has  featured strongly in these efforts, and should continue to do so.  This approach has achieved a great deal to  date, but, in light of the risks and potential implications, will it be  sufficient?\n\nThe  transition away from LIBOR represents a significant risk event for firms of all  sizes, and they should actively manage this transition through their existing  frameworks for identification, management, and mitigation of risk.  Supervisors should continue to support this  objective by ensuring that all firms are aware of the transition and that  LIBOR-related issues are being addressed in a way that is commensurate with a  firm’s exposures and risks.  More  broadly, the official sector will continue to push market participants to take  all necessary steps to mitigate the risks to financial stability from a  disorderly transition.\n\nIn  closing, the LIBOR scandal certainly was one low point among many during the  financial crisis and its aftermath.  It  highlighted the need for reform of a critical area of the global financial  system.  We have made considerable  progress since then, but reform still has a long way to go.  The remaining work, by necessity, will  involve purposeful collective action and engagement across the financial  industry to address market-wide issues.   It also will require firm-specific action to manage individual risks.  The challenge is that the window for action  is narrowing.  Therefore, we must  redouble our efforts to ensure a successful transition from LIBOR to a more  sound and durable regime.\n\nThank  you for your kind attention.  I would be  happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "Welcome to the New York Fed and to this timely conference on inflation-indexed\n  securities and inflation risk management.  Before discussing \"The\n  Case for TIPS,\" I would like to thank conference organizers, participants,\n  panelists and supporting Bank staff for planning and putting together today's\nevent.\n\nIn particular, I wanted to thank John Campbell for his contribution to making\n  today's conference a reality and I expect that his involvement will heighten\n  attention to this  subject and stimulate additional research from the\n  academic community on the topics we discuss here.\n\nOver the past year, Treasury has been evaluating the costs and benefits of\n  the TIPS program.  Some research studies on this topic have concluded\n  that the incremental financing costs associated with the TIPS program have\n  been substantial; leading some to conclude that the costs may outweigh the\n  benefits.  Today’s program, which includes a panel discussion on\n  the welfare benefits of inflation-protected securities, should help to broaden\nour knowledge on this topic.\n\nAs the title of my speech suggests, today I am\n  going to lay out the reasons why I, along with my colleagues Jennifer Roush\n  and Michelle Steinberg Ezer, believe that the benefits of the TIPS program\nexceed the costs of the program.\n\nBefore saying anything more, let me emphasize\n  that the views I express today are my own and those of my co-authors and, therefore,\n  may not represent the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n  Also, let me note that Jennifer and Michelle are the main authors of this paper.\n  I have ridden along on their coattails. My main contribution was to slow\n  down completion as I had to fit in my very modest contributions around the\n  unfolding financial crisis!    Finally, you may be wondering\n  why this is my first speech since I have become president—an odd subject\n  to choose, perhaps, given the ongoing financial crisis?   The answer\n  is a simple one, our paper and this conference have been in train for a long\n  time.  It is just a coincidence that the conference and my becoming president\nof the New York Fed have happened to arrive at about the same time.\n\nThe logic of issuing\n  inflation-protected securities is straightforward. Wouldn’t\n  some investors pay a premium—that is, accept a lower expected return—in\n  exchange for guaranteed, full compensation for inflation? Because the United\n  States and a number of other countries decided that the answer was likely to\n  be  “yes,” they developed an inflation-indexed government debt\nmarket.\n\nHas the program been a good development from the perspective of the\nU.S. Treasury? What about from the public’s perspective?\n\nA good starting\n  point for answering these questions is to account for the costs and benefits\n  of the program relative to an appropriate counterfactual. For example, we might\n  start by comparing the difference in funding costs to the Treasury of TIPS\n  versus a program of comparable duration nominal Treasuries.\n\nBut we should also\n  be careful not to ignore other potential benefits of the TIPS program. As we\n  see it, these potential benefits include:\n\nAlthough it is difficult to quantify these benefits, we argue that they are\n  meaningful and should not be ignored in evaluating the benefits of the TIPS\n  program.\n\nTurning first to the issue of measuring the impact of TIPS issuance\n  on the government’s funding costs, this could be done simply by comparing\n  the ex-post costs\n  of a program of TIPS issuance to the costs of a comparable program of nominal\n  Treasury issuance. Studies 1 of\n  this sort have typically shown that TIPS issuance has resulted in a higher\n  net cost to the Treasury. Unfortunately, although this methodology is attractive\n  in its simplicity, it has some flaws that undercut its usefulness in reaching\n  conclusions about the attractiveness of the TIPS program.\n\nThe problem with\n  an ex-post analysis is that it depends critically\n  upon the performance of inflation over the period in question. If inflation\n  turns out to have been meaningfully different than what was expected at the\n  time of TIPS issuance, then this difference—the so-called “inflation\n  surprise”—can be important in affecting the relative costs of TIPS\n  versus nominal Treasury issuance. If inflation turns out to be higher than\n  expected, then TIPS issuance will likely look to have been more expensive than\n  nominal Treasury issuance. If inflation turns out lower, an ex-post analysis\n  will likely show a savings from the TIPS program.\n\nOver the long run—and\n  I mean the very long run—there should\n  be roughly as many downward surprises in inflation performance as upward surprises.\n  But within any relatively short period, such as the last decade, this certainly\n  does not need to be the case. In other words, over such a short period, the\n  outcome of an ex-post analysis can be heavily influenced by which\n  of the two sides—the Treasury or investors—was the lucky recipient\n  of the net inflation surprise that occurred over the period in question. For\n  example, in countries such as the United Kingdom, where inflation declined\n  following the inception of an inflation-linked debt program, ex-post studies\n  generally suggest that these programs have reduced financing costs for these\n  countries.\n\nThe fact that the Treasury saved or lost money ex-post is\n  thus not a very reliable guide as to whether the strategic decision to implement\n  a TIPS program has been a good idea. The relevant question is whether the Treasury\n  obtained the financing it needed at a lower ex-ante cost. If the\n  experiment were to be run thousands of times drawing from the underlying distribution\n  of possible inflation outcomes, would Treasury’s costs have been lower,\n  on average, with TIPS or with nominal Treasuries? To conclude on the basis\n  of one coin flip or roll of the dice as ex-post analysis essentially\n  does surely is not the best way to evaluate the respective costs of TIPS issuance\n  versus nominal Treasuries.\n\nThus, we need to focus on the underlying factors\n  that determine the ex-ante difference in costs.\n\nThere are  two primary factors 2 underlying\n  the relative cost differences:\n\n1) the compensation investors require to hold\n  a security that is less liquid than its nominal counterpart, termed the illiquidity\n  premium, and 2) the insurance value they attach to obtaining protection against\n  inflation risk, known as the inflation risk premium.\n\nWith regard to the first factor, when investors\n  are worried about their ability to resell TIPS in a liquid secondary market,\n  they require compensation for holding the securities compared with more liquid\n  alternatives. This illiquidity premium tends to drive up TIPS yields and increase\n  the Treasury’s borrowing\n  costs.\n\nThe second factor works in the opposite direction.   To the extent that\n  investors are willing to pay for inflation protection, they would purchase\n  TIPS at a price above that implied by their expected payment stream.  As\n  such, inflation risk premiums result in lower expected borrowing costs for\n  the government and savings for the TIPS program compared with nominal issuance.\n\nTo\n  determine which factor has been historically dominant, we conduct an ex-ante cost\n  analysis: We compare the amount that the Treasury received for inflation compensation\n  at auction with an observable measure of the inflation expectations of TIPS\n  investors that is not contaminated by premiums for inflation risk or liquidity\n  differentials. Unfortunately, we don’t have a perfect measure of expected\n  inflation. Nevertheless, we may be able to get close. We do have estimates\n  of expected inflation from other sources—such as the Survey of Professional\n  Forecasters (SPF) conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. If\n  such measures do indeed reflect the inflation expectations of investors, then\n  we can conduct a reasonably accurate ex-ante analysis. TIPS analysts often talk about a concept they call the breakeven inflation\n  rate. Essentially, this is the realized inflation rate that would cause investors\n  to come out the same in terms of total compensation regardless of whether they\n  had bought TIPS or nominal Treasuries.\n\nThe difference between the auction breakeven\n  inflation rate and the SPF forecast yields a measure of the net savings or\n  loss incurred by the Treasury that is independent of forecast errors. It is\n  also equal to the net value of the illiquidity and inflation risk premiums\n  associated with each TIPS. Our analysis, which covers TIPS auctions through\n  April 2008, found that prior to 2004, the breakeven inflation rate was below\n  the SPF. This indicates that the illiquidity premiums exceeded the inflation\n  risk premium over this period. However, since 2004, we find that breakeven\n  inflation rates were approximately equal to expected inflation, indicating\n  that investors were roughly indifferent between the benefit of being protected\n  against inflation risk versus the cost in terms of the greater illiquidity\n  of TIPS relative to on-the-run nominal Treasuries. Thus, on an ex-ante basis,\n  it appeared that the cost of issuing TIPS was about equal to the cost of issuing\n  nominal Treasuries.\n\nTo determine the impact of the illiquidity premium and\n  inflation risk premium on these results, we decomposed our ex-ante analysis,\n  comparing the breakeven rate of inflation excluding the illiquidity premium\n  in TIPS yields 3 to\n  the SPF forecast.  This comparison yields an estimate of the premium investors\n  were willing to pay for inflation protection at previous TIPS auctions.  We\n  found an average risk premium estimate of 47 basis points over our sample period.\n  This suggests that the TIPS program does satisfy a real demand that is not\n  met by nominal Treasuries.\n\nIt also suggests that if the Treasury were to take steps to shrink the illiquidity\n  premium by, for example, improving secondary market trading in TIPS, this would\n  shift the cost-benefit analysis more firmly in TIPS direction.\n\nA change in\n  the TIPS illiquidity premium can have a notable impact on ex-ante cost\n  analysis.  For example, at the time this speech was written, the 10-year\n  TIPS breakeven rate was approximately 1.10 percent, compared to the SPF forecast\n  of 2.50 percent.  This is in contrast to the end of our sample period,\n  which showed them to be about equal.   This means that today TIPS issuance\n  is not very compelling. But it is important to emphasize that this shift has\n  occurred at a time when the preference for liquidity is especially strong,\n  benefitting nominal Treasuries versus TIPS.  When the market turmoil subsides\n  and this illiquidity premium shrinks, one might expect TIPS to again move ahead\n  on an ex-ante basis.\n\nSo, at this point, the TIPS versus nominal issuance\n  debate is inconclusive. But that’s before we have included some of the\n  other considerable—although\n  more difficult to quantify—benefits associated with TIPS issuance.\n\nLet\n  me now discuss some of these other benefits.\n\nInflation Hedge for Households First, TIPS offer a benefit to investors\n  because they have less risk than any other asset class. With virtually no credit\n  risk or inflation risk, TIPS are one of the safest of investments. 4 For\n  investors that want such safety, TIPS offer significant benefits.   Furthermore,\n  the ability for investors to choose the amount of inflation risk they hold\n  may result in a more optimal allocation of risk among investors with different\ntolerances. 5 How much is\n  this worth? Is the value of this completely captured in the relative interest\n  costs of TIPS? Probably not, because the relative interest costs between TIPS\n  and nominal Treasuries are set at the margin. We think there is some value\n  in having a high-quality hedge to inflation risk, especially one that is available\n  to less sophisticated investors.\n\nImproved Monetary Policy The second noteworthy benefit from the TIPS program is that it helps improve\n  the conduct of monetary policy.  Foremost, the program provides up-to-date\n  information about the evolution of inflation expectations and real interest\n  rates.   Because keeping inflation expectations well-anchored is so important\n  in keeping inflation itself in check, real-time measures of inflation expectations\n  may lead to better monetary policymaking. This, in turn, should improve macroeconomic\n  performance. Although this is very difficult to quantify in terms of value,\n  I think it is safe to say that in a $14 trillion economy, even a modest improvement\n  in performance generates large dollar benefits.\n\nU.S. policymakers focus on a variety of inflation expectation measures, including\n  private surveys of inflation expectations and market based measures, such as\n  TIPS breakeven inflation rates.  But in practice, the value of the survey-based\n  measures is limited by the lack of timeliness—new data become available\n  only monthly, quarterly or about every six weeks. Also, real money isn’t\n  riding on the accuracy of the survey responses. In contrast, the comparison\n  between nominal Treasury and TIPS yields represents the consensus of market\n  participants.\n\nFor these reasons, policymakers rely importantly on the long-term inflation\n  expectations proxied by the difference between nominal Treasury note and TIPS\n  yields.\n\nSo, how much is this tool worth? Of course, it is very difficult to\n  say. Perhaps, we would flatter ourselves and think that we could do just as\n  well without such a market-based, real-time measure of inflation expectations.\n  But I doubt it. After all, inflation expectations, when untethered, are very\n  difficult to re-anchor. TIPS help make it easier to keep inflation expectations\n  in check.\n\nImproved Fiscal Policy The third less quantifiable benefit of TIPS is that the program may create\n  incentives that can improve the conduct of fiscal policy.   TIPS provide\n  an explicit incentive for the fiscal authorities to conduct policy with an\n  eye toward the consequences for inflation.  The public’s recognition\n  of this incentive may help hold down inflation expectations and cause inflation\n  expectations to be more firmly anchored.\n\nIn addition, TIPS may give the Treasury\n  access to a broader investor base, which also may reduce the Treasury’s\n  overall borrowing costs. The comparison between the prevailing interest rates\n  on TIPS versus nominal Treasuries provides insight into the relative costs\n  associated with issuing a marginal dollar of debt. But just as important is\n  whether TIPS issuance, by displacing nominal Treasury issuance, reduces the\n  level of interest rates that the Treasury pays on its nominal issuances. This\n  would occur if TIPS were not perfect substitutes for nominal Treasury securities\n  and if the demand for nominal Treasuries were downward sloping— that\n  is, not completely elastic.\n\nThe first condition almost certainly holds given the different attributes\n  of TIPS versus nominal Treasuries. If they were perfect substitutes, then there\n  would not be a liquidity premium for nominal Treasuries relative to TIPS. The\n  second condition seems likely to hold since numerous studies have found that\n  an increase in the net amount of Treasury borrowing leads to higher expected\n  borrowing costs for the Treasury.\n\nHow big might this effect be? That’s\n  difficult to estimate. A few studies 6 have\n  found that an increase in supply in a particular segment of the Treasury yield\n  curve has contributed to a rise in yields. As a result, by issuing securities\n  in a segmented TIPS market, the Treasury may keep realized yields on bill and\n  nominal coupon securities lower than they otherwise would have been.\n\nThe last\n  noteworthy fiscal benefit from TIPS issuance is the fact that it reduces risk\n  to the U.S. government in terms of the variability of its net financial position.\n  The rate of inflation influences both the cost of TIPS and the government’s\n  tax receipts. Thus, some level of TIPS issuance may reduce the variability\n  of the government’s net financial position. This, in turn, should lead\n  to a more regular and predictable pattern of issuance, which should help minimize\n  interest costs.\n\nIn summary, our analysis of the ex-ante costs of the TIPS program\n  and the more difficult-to-measure benefits suggests that TIPS issuance provides\n  at least a modest net benefit to the Treasury. So, now I want to turn to a\n  related question: Are there ways to increase the benefits?\n\nI would be willing\n  to make two modest suggestions here. First, it may make sense to emphasize\n  longer-dated TIPS issuance rather than shorter-dated issuance. Analytically,\n  the logic goes as follows. Inflation uncertainty is likely to increase at longer\n  time horizons. Thus, investors are likely to pay a greater premium for inflation\n  protection at longer-time horizons. This implies that the cost savings associated\n  with TIPS are likely to be greater for longer maturities rather than shorter\n  maturities.\n\nThis prediction is supported by empirical studies that have examined\n  the premium that investors pay for inflation protection both in the United\n  States and elsewhere. For example, a study by Brian Sack of Macroeconomic Advisors\n  finds that forward breakeven inflation rates increase as maturity lengthens.\n  In contrast, the level of survey-based measures of inflation expectations is\n  quite constant beyond a time horizon of a few years. This means that the difference\n  between forward breakeven inflation and inflation expectations climbs as the\n  time horizon extends. This strongly suggests that the premium investors pay\n  for inflation protection increases as maturities lengthen.\n\nSecond, it may make\n  sense to structure the TIPS program in a way that would help reduce the illiquidity\n  premium associated with TIPS relative to on-the-run nominal Treasuries. Some\n  of the current illiquidity premium is likely to shrink as financial markets\n  stabilize. However, further improvements may require a change in either the\n  structure of the TIPS program or the secondary market trading environment.\n\nOn that note, I leave you with two outstanding questions: 1.What are the best\n  ways for the U.S. Treasury and the trading community to improve secondary market\n  liquidity in TIPS? 2. Given that TIPS appear attractive for the U.S. Treasury,\n  what is the optimal allocation of the Treasury’s liability portfolio\nbetween TIPS and nominal securities?\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\n__________________________________________ 1 See Sack and Elsasser\n  (2004), Roush (2008). 2 In addition to these primary\n      factors, TIPS yields also reflect the taxation difference between TIPS\n      and nominal issues, the convexity difference between real and nominal yields\n      and the price of the embedded deflation floor. 3 We used the illiquidity\n      premium in TIPS yields estimated in D’Amico, Kim and Wei (2008).\n      D’Amico,\n      Kim and Wei calculated the liquidity component for five- and ten-year TIPS\n      yields, which we used to adjust the auction prices for 5- and 10-year TIPS\n      issues.   For twenty- and thirty-year TIPS issues, we assumed that\n      the liquidity component is equal to the component for a ten-year security,\n      which in the event that these securities are less liquid than the ten-year\n      note, understates this effect and thus underestimates the risk premium\n      at this horizon.  For further information, see Dudley, Roush and\n      Steinberg Ezer (2008). 4 There is some inflation\n      basis risk in that TIPS are based on the non-seasonally-adjusted consumer\n      price index, and a household’s expenditure basket might differ from\n      the basket in the CPI.  Also, pension and endowment liabilities may\n      be more closely related to other inflation or wage measures than the CPI. 5 See Campbell and Shiller, 1996. 6 See Fleming (2002), Krishnamurthy\n(2002), Laubach (2003).",

    "text": "Good morning and  welcome once again to the New York Fed’s Quarterly Regional Economic Press  Briefing. I am pleased to have this opportunity to talk with the journalists  covering our region—and through you, to the people in our District. This  morning I will focus on regional economic conditions, with particular attention  to how the recession has affected public school spending in New York and New  Jersey—states that dominate the Second Federal Reserve District.  Following my remarks, my colleagues will  provide more details. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and  not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal  Reserve System.\n\nNational Economic Conditions I will begin with  a review of overall economic conditions.   Recent data suggest that the U.S. economy ended 2011 on a somewhat  stronger note—the best performance since the first half of 2010.  Nonetheless, the amount of slack in the  economy remains substantial.  Moreover, I  think it is unlikely that the pace of growth we saw in the fourth quarter will carry  through to the first half of 2012.\n\nGrowth of consumer  spending strengthened in the fourth quarter, adding a needed boost to the  economy.  Much of this stronger spending was  for durable goods, particularly motor vehicles.   In the fourth quarter of 2011, sales of light-weight motor vehicles reached  the highest quarterly rate since the first half of 2008.  This increase is encouraging because it  suggests that consumers are now more able to borrow money to finance their purchases  of cars and trucks.\n\nHowever, I must  note that this boost is likely due in part to temporary factors.  First, vehicle sales in the middle of 2011  were depressed due to supply chain disruptions stemming from the tragic  earthquake and tsunami in Japan.  In  addition, a stimulus-related tax provision that allowed businesses to immediately  expense some investments expired at the end of 2011.  So, some purchases were no doubt timed to  occur before that expiration.\n\nMoreover, for  goods and services other than durable goods, the rate of growth of consumer  spending has been rather tepid.   The  picture that emerges—up to now—is of a consumer who continues to be cautious.\n\nIn addition to  stronger growth of consumer spending, manufacturing output has firmed over the  past several months. For example, the widely followed Institute of Supply  Management manufacturing composite index rose from October to December 2011.  Improvements were particularly notable in new  orders and production activity.  Stronger  growth of consumer spending on durable goods is likely boosting the  manufacturing sector.  In addition,  growth of U.S. exports has been well maintained, while import growth has been subdued.\n\nAlongside the somewhat  stronger near-term growth we have also seen some improvement in the labor  market.  Workers are filing fewer initial  claims for unemployment insurance.  New claims  have fallen to levels not seen since mid-2008.   Private-sector employees are working more hours.  Aggregate hours worked rose at a 3 percent  annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2011, up from essentially no growth in the  third quarter.  Combined with average  hourly earnings rising at a 1.8 percent rate, the increase in hours worked  suggests an annual rate of increase in private wage and salary income of close  to 5 percent.  This is a respectable rate  that might support more spending—if sustained.\n\nA firmer labor  market has been accompanied by partial recovery in consumer confidence over the  past few months.  Confidence is rising up  from levels that were often—in the third quarter of 2011—lower than at the  depths of the Great Recession.\n\nIt should be noted  that while workers’ hours grew at a healthy pace in the fourth quarter, employers  added an average of just 140,000 payroll jobs per month, somewhat less than in  the third quarter.  Despite this rather  tepid increase in jobs, the unemployment rate fell a cumulative 0.5 percentage  points from September to December.  This  apparent discrepancy is due to two factors—faster job growth as measured by the  household survey and an outright decline of the labor force.  Workers aged 25 to 54 have been particularly  prone to dropping out, which suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate  may overstate the improvement in labor market conditions.\n\nDespite some  improvements, the economy continues to operate with significant excess slack.  Less than 59 percent of the U.S. working-age population  has a job.  This is unacceptably low—just  about the same share as in late 2009 and well below the levels in 2006 and  2007.\n\nOnce again, this  large amount of slack is putting downward pressure on trend inflation.  After a brief run-up during the second  quarter of 2011—reflecting the pass-through from higher commodity prices and  supply-chain disruptions—inflation has retreated and may be headed down  further.\n\nAs I noted  earlier, it is unlikely that the faster growth experienced in the fourth  quarter of 2011 will be matched in the first half of 2012.  In addition to the temporary nature of some  of the recent improvement, there are significant impediments to a robust  recovery that I’ll list briefly.\n\nFirst, global financial and  economic conditions may impede faster growth.   In particular, growth in the euro area is slowing and a recession may be  underway with adverse direct and indirect effects on the U.S. economy.\n\nSecond, fiscal  policy has become more contractionary.  Despite  the extension of the payroll tax cut, the stance of federal fiscal policy has tightened  and employment and spending by state and local governments continues to decline.\n\nThird, despite  record low mortgage interest rates, the depressed housing market remains a  significant impediment. 1 While house prices are no longer overvalued  by historical standards, restrictions on access to credit and the large number  of homes in the foreclosure pipeline means that home prices remain under downward  pressure.  The ongoing weakness in  housing makes achieving a vigorous economic recovery more difficult for several  reasons:\n\nIn a recent  speech I discussed some policy interventions that could help to stabilize the  housing market. I will not discuss this further as our focus today is on  education.\n\nIn sum, I  continue to expect moderate growth in the year ahead and see the risks to that outlook  as skewed to the downside, mainly due to uncertainty as to how events in Europe  will unfold.\n\nEarlier this week  we had a meeting of the FOMC.  The  committee reiterated its intention to maintain a highly accommodative stance  for monetary policy to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure  that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate. The  committee said it now anticipates that economic conditions are likely to  warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through  late 2014.\n\nThe committee  also released a statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy  within the context of the dual mandate, and published information on individual  participants’ expectations of the appropriate future interest rate path.  As Chairman Bernanke explained in his press  conference on Wednesday, the strategy statement “should not be interpreted as  indicating any change in how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy.  Rather, its purpose is to increase the  transparency and predictability of policy.”\n\nFurther details  on the discussion at the meeting will be available when the minutes are  published in three weeks.\n\nI will not comment  on monetary policy any further today beyond stating that monetary policy has  done and will continue to do its part in supporting the recovery—but it is not  all-powerful. Other complementary policy actions in housing, fiscal policy and structural  adjustment or rebalancing of the economy will be essential if we are to achieve  the best available recovery.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions Turning now to the  regional economy, growth slowed in late 2011 in New York City and New York  State, whereas New Jersey has seen a modest pickup.\n\nAs attendees at previous regional  press briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces economic activity indexes  to help monitor the performance of the regional economy. 2 Based on these measures, economic activity has  leveled off in both New York State and New York City since the summer,  following above-average growth in the first half of 2011.  In contrast, New Jersey’s economy, which was  sluggish throughout 2010 and into the first half of 2011, has picked up noticeably  in recent months.\n\nWe monitor Puerto Rico using an  index produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico. This index suggests  that the island’s recession, which started back in 2005, may finally be ending.  After bottoming out last August, activity has risen fairly sharply—reaching a  one-year high in November.  Still, Puerto  Rico’s recovery has had a number of “false starts” before and this measure is  noisy.  Thus, the recent improvements  will need to be sustained for longer before we can confidently declare that the  island’s recession is over.\n\nTurning to the employment situation, our region finished 2011  on a mixed note.  In New Jersey,  private-sector job growth was quite robust in the fourth quarter, despite a  small dip in December.  New York State,  in contrast, slowed more in December and has seen only minimal job gains since  we last met in August.\n\nJob growth in the region no longer appears  to be out-performing the nation, and regional unemployment rates remain  unacceptably high: at around 9 percent in both New York City and New Jersey,  and close to 8 percent across New York State.\n\nTurning to New York City, the  local job market, which had been quite resilient during and after the  recession, has lagged recently—partly reflecting weakness in the city’s  securities industry.  Still, the Big  Apple has recovered over half of the jobs lost during the recession, whereas  the nation has recouped only about a third of its job losses thus far.  Despite recent weakness in the securities  industry, other industries, such as tourism, and professional and business  services, have fared reasonably well in the City.  Weakness in financial activities industry—and  securities in particular—is worrisome because this sector has tended to drive  overall local growth and provide a major source of tax revenue for the city and  the state.\n\nThe New York Fed also conducts the Empire  State Manufacturing Survey to track conditions for regional manufacturers.  I am pleased to say that January’s report points  to some firming in manufacturing and a pickup in hiring—a big improvement from  late last year, when this survey consistently signaled little or no growth.\n\nNonetheless, ongoing weakness in the housing  market, coupled with a sluggish jobs recovery has increased financial pressures  on families.  Attendees at previous press  briefings may recall that at the New York Fed we have a special consumer credit  panel that allows us to track these trends closely. 3 Since the beginning of 2008, many regional  households have been reducing their per-person debt for mortgages, credit cards  and auto loans quite consistently.   However, the last three to four quarters show signs that households may  have reached the end of this deleveraging process.  Debt levels have been flat to slightly  increasing in both New York and New Jersey—as they have also been for the  United States as a whole.  Only in Puerto  Rico have debt levels continued to decline, suggesting that households on the  island may not be finished with their deleveraging.\n\nThe picture for debt delinquencies is  similar.  Although still quite high by  historical standards, as of the third quarter of 2011, delinquencies were  subsiding in New York and New Jersey, as they were for the nation as a  whole.  Unfortunately, Puerto Rican  households stand out as now having a higher delinquency rate than the mainland,  New York and New Jersey—and one that is continuing to rise.  Thus, although the financial strains on many  families in the region remain severe and are very troubling to me, they do show  some signs of abating slowly outside of Puerto Rico.\n\nImpact of the Great Recession on Public Schools in the  Region Now, I will turn  to our special topic.  In an important  sense, schools constitute the backbone of our national and regional economy.  Yet, this backbone can be vulnerable during  recessions.  Schools teach our citizens  skills, including how to read, write, do math, create art or music and work in  teams.  Economists call these skills “human  capital” because they are an important input that fuels a nation’s or region’s economic  growth and development.  In this way,  schools play a key role in shaping our future.  Therefore, it is essential to understand how the  Great Recession has affected our ability to educate the next generations of  students.\n\nThus, today, we  will examine how the recession has affected funding levels for schools in our  region.  As you know, there is an ongoing  vigorous debate about how to most effectively organize public education and  provide incentives to teachers, students and administrators.  Such inquiry is key to any effort to ensure  the best possible education for our citizens, but it is beyond the scope of  this briefing.\n\nThe housing bust and the onset of the recession  in 2007 strained state and local government finances.  Most local governments rely heavily on  property tax revenue to fund their schools and other activities.  This was particularly true during the first  half of the decade, when the housing boom strongly supported property tax  revenues.  Then came the bust; steep  declines in the housing market led to corresponding drops in local property tax  revenue.  State governments’ revenues  also fell, as rising unemployment cut income tax revenue and reduced consumption  shrank sales tax revenues.  Since most state  and local governments spend at least half of their budgets on education, these  developments have constrained funding for our primary and secondary schools.\n\nTo stave off drastic state and local government  spending cuts, the federal government allocated $100 billion to states,  including New York and New Jersey, for education through the American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  Research done here  at the New York Fed reveals that school finances in both New York and New  Jersey were impacted by the Great Recession, with New Jersey sustaining  particularly severe cuts. 4 ARRA funds helped school finances in both  states, yet did not completely compensate for lost state and local revenues.\n\nWith ARRA funding  drying up and our local and state economies still under stress, a question  looms before us. How might we expect school finances and student learning to  fare in the near future?  Given the key  role that human capital plays in our nation’s growth, this is an important  issue.  We at the New York Fed will  continue to monitor school finances and other education indicators in our  region closely as this will, over time, affect our regional economy.\n\nConclusion In summary, during the second half of 2011,  growth slowed in New York, falling well short of the national rate, although  New Jersey kept pace.  It’s also  important to note that the national labor market is showing more consistent  signs of improvement, and the regional labor market has continued to make  progress.  However, at the national  level, the pace of recovery remains sluggish by historical standards and is  likely to slow somewhat in early 2012.   Thus, unemployment, both nationally and locally, is likely to remain  unacceptably high for some time.   Also, inflation is likely to be below our objective for several years.  Clearly, much work  remains to achieve the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment in  the context of price stability.\n\nThe Great Recession has affected education  financing in both New York and New Jersey, but New Jersey was hit harder.  Through its impact on the education of the  next generation, this situation could have troubling implications for the  ability of the next generation to succeed in the demanding jobs of the future.\n\nI will now ask Jason Bram to provide  additional details on the regional economy.\n\n___________________________________________________ 1 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2012 White Paper, \" The U.S. Housing Market: Current Conditions  and Policy Considerations \" and “ Housing  and the Economic Recovery ” by William Dudley.\n\n2 For more information, see Indexes  of Coincident Economic Indicators on the New York Fed website.\n\n3 For a more information, see “ An  Introduction to the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel ,” New York Fed Staff  Report No. 479, November 2010.

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to the Economic Club of New York again. 1 Today, I will focus on the economic outlook and the role of monetary policy. I will argue that the fundamentals underpinning the U.S. economy are improving and monetary policy is gaining additional traction. But this may not immediately lead to stronger growth because of the recent increase in fiscal restraint. As a result, I expect that labor market conditions will improve only slowly and that inflation will remain muted. Consequently, it will be appropriate for monetary policy to remain very accommodative. As always, my views are my own and may not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Outlook: Tug of War Between Improving Fundamentals and Fiscal Restraint The U.S. economy remains on the slow growth track that has persisted since the recession ended in mid-2009. In fact, in 2012 real GDP grew just 1.6 percent, below the 2.2 percent rate of the preceding two years. This lackluster and disappointing performance masks the fact that the underlying conditions that support growth are gradually improving. However, in the near-term, this improvement in fundamentals is being offset by increased fiscal drag.\n\nLet's first examine the fundamentals, which have improved in at least six ways. First, household deleveraging is now well advanced. Household debt has declined significantly relative to income (Exhibit 1) . In the same vein, the household financial obligations ratio has fallen to levels last seen in the early 1980s (Exhibit 2) . 2\n\nSecond, the structural adjustment in housing has largely run its course. Activity and prices are firming, supported by low interest rates. Over the past four quarters, housing starts rose by 33 percent, existing home sales climbed by 12 percent (Exhibit 3) , and home prices, as measured by the CoreLogic national home price index, were up over 7 percent (Exhibit 4) . Although the pace of recovery varies regionally, the U.S. housing sector as a whole is now clearly rebounding.\n\nI see the recovery in home prices as particularly important. Houses are a significant component of household wealth. In addition, as home prices begin to rise we are likely to see more transactions and more building activity. Moreover, rising house prices are likely to encourage a further loosening of credit and appraisal standards that remain unduly tight.\n\nThird, the international economic outlook has improved somewhat. Global financial market strains relating to concerns about the euro-area have receded since last summer, though recent developments in Cyprus highlight the challenges that remain. Chinese growth appears to be climbing after a slowdown in 2012 and Japan is making renewed efforts to grow faster and exit from a long period of deflation.\n\nFourth, U.S. corporate profits relative to national income are at an all-time record (Exhibit 5) and cash balances are very high. As uncertainty recedes and the outlook improves, I expect business will increasingly shift towards real investment from mainly buying back shares and hoarding cash.\n\nFifth, the U.S. is in the middle of an energy revolution marked by a steady rise in oil and natural gas production (Exhibit 6) . Just as significant, the sharp fall in natural gas prices in the U.S. has created a huge impetus to investment in energy-intensive manufacturing, such as in petrochemicals. Because the lead times on such investment are long, this impulse will likely persist for many years.\n\nSixth, financial conditions have become increasingly accommodative, as monetary easing has passed through to a broad range of financial asset prices. Credit spreads have narrowed and the U.S. equity market has risen sharply (Exhibit 7) . The price and availability of some types of consumer loans, notably auto loans, has also improved.\n\nSo why isn't the U.S. economy growing more quickly? The fact that fiscal policy has turned significantly more restrictive is the most important reason. The impulse from state and local governments that subtracted from growth earlier in the recovery has gone from negative to close to neutral. But this has been overwhelmed by the sharp shift in federal fiscal policy from mild restraint in 2012 to much greater restraint in 2013 (Exhibit 8) . The increase in payroll tax rates, the rise in high income tax rates, the increase in taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act, and now the sequester—if sustained—will result in fiscal drag of about 1 3/4 percentage points of GDP in 2013. 3\n\nI view this as an unfortunate outcome. While the U.S. must put its public finances on a sustainable footing, this should be done in a manner that best achieves both our near-term and long-term objectives. In my opinion, a U.S. fiscal policy well-suited for the current set of circumstances would start with a very mild degree of restraint in the near-term that would credibly build to substantial consolidation over the next several decades. Of course, it is for Congress to judge what combination of tax increases and spending cuts should be undertaken to achieve this. Nevertheless, the aging of our population and simple math suggest that entitlement reform would need to be part of such a plan. Also, in an ideal world, fiscal policy would have broad-based bipartisan support. That would reduce uncertainty and reassure households and businesses that the U.S. was on a sustainable long-term path.\n\nInstead, we have nearly the opposite: significant retrenchment in the near-term, but no credible action over the long-term, with partisan divisions and significant uncertainty about what will happen next. Will the sequester, for example, be sustained or not?\n\nEconomic Outlook Looking at the outlook for 2013, I believe that growth in the first half will be sluggish as the fiscal contraction blunts the economy's forward advance. While first quarter GDP growth will likely rebound to a 2 to 3 percent annualized rate following the dip in the fourth quarter, this will be due in large part to temporary factors. 4\n\nI'd also emphasize that there remains considerable uncertainty about the outlook. In particular, we can't be confident about how much fiscal drag will blunt growth. Ultimately, though, the drag should abate. When that happens—presumably later this year, the economy should strengthen.\n\nInflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditure deflator, is currently below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective (Exhibit 9) . Substantial slack remains in labor and product markets, and underlying measures of inflation are subdued. With weak labor compensation growth, the trend growth of unit labor costs is less than 1 percent annualized, which is well below price inflation. Moreover, inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent longer-run objective. Thus, I conclude that the risk that inflation could significantly exceed our 2 percent objective is quite low over the next few years, even if the recovery were to strengthen considerably.\n\nU.S. Monetary Policy Initiatives Beginning in September, the FOMC made a number of important changes to monetary policy in order to promote a stronger recovery in the context of price stability. First, the FOMC began purchasing an additional $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) each month. 5 Second, the FOMC stated, for the first time, that it would continue buying assets and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until there was a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook 6 . Third, the FOMC stated its intention to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a considerable time after the recovery strengthens.\n\nTwo additional initiatives followed in December. First, consistent with the September statement, the FOMC began a new purchase program of $45 billion long-dated Treasuries per month. Second, the FOMC shifted to economic thresholds from calendar-based rate guidance.\n\nThe FOMC committed to keep the federal funds rate at its current level of zero to 25 basis points at least as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent, projected inflation on a one to two year horizon is below 2.5 percent and inflation expectations stay well anchored. Both elements of the policy stance were reaffirmed at last week's FOMC meeting.\n\nSo why did we make these changes? The additional asset purchases provide further monetary stimulus. This is appropriate given that we were falling short of our objectives. 7\n\nMoving to an outcome-based purchase program also has other advantages. In particular, expectations of the ultimate amount of purchases should change as the economic outlook evolves. This acts as an automatic stabilizing mechanism. In particular, the FOMC's statement that purchases will continue until the labor market outlook improves substantially provides additional support for the recovery by reducing downside tail risk.\n\nThe shift to rate guidance based on economic thresholds was not intended to provide additional accommodation at the time it was implemented. 8 But, the adoption of thresholds does support the recovery by changing the risk profile in a different way. The thresholds make it clear that short-term rates will not be raised at the first sign of economic improvement, before a sustainable recovery has been secured. As a result, households and businesses should be more confident in undertaking additional spending and investment today.\n\nThe shift to thresholds-based rate guidance has other benefits. Relative to calendar-based guidance, it provides more information about the economic conditions the Fed would need to see before raising rates. 9 Importantly, the shift to thresholds should also make the eventual normalization of monetary policy smoother, a subject I will return to later.\n\nBut this raises an obvious question. If quantitative thresholds are good for interest rate guidance, why not also have such thresholds for the asset purchase program? There are two reasons. There is somewhat more uncertainty about the efficacy and costs associated with asset purchases than rate guidance and we are likely to learn more about the efficacy and costs as the program unfolds.\n\nSo what is this likely to mean in practice? In my view, we should calibrate the total amount of purchases to that needed to deliver a substantial improvement in labor market conditions, by allowing the flow rate of purchases to respond to material changes in the labor market outlook. This makes sense because the benefits 10 of additional accommodation will gradually diminish as we get closer to our full employment and price stability objectives and become more confident that we will reach them in a timely manner. 11 At some point, I expect that I will see sufficient evidence of economic momentum to cause me to favor gradually dialing back the pace of asset purchases. 12\n\nOf course, any subsequent bad news could lead me to favor dialing them back up again. As the Chairman Bernanke said in his press conference last Wednesday \"when we see that the…situation has changed in a meaningful way, then we may well adjust the pace of purchases in order to keep the level of accommodation consistent with the outlook.\"\n\nThe Labor Market Outlook So how are we doing relative to our objective of a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook?\n\nSince we provided additional stimulus in September there has been some improvement in labor market conditions. The unemployment rate is modestly lower and private non-farm payroll growth a bit higher than earlier in 2012, which is certainly welcome. However, other important indicators including the employment-to-population ratio and job-finding rates are essentially unchanged (Exhibit 10) . This suggests that the labor market is far from healthy.\n\nMoreover, our policy is based on the outlook for the labor market, not the level of employment or unemployment today. In this context I note that the recent improvement in payroll employment growth, which gets much of the attention, is out-sized relative to the growth rate of economic activity that supports it. We have seen this movie before. When this happened in 2011 and 2012, employment growth subsequently slowed (see Exhibit 11) . Because growth this year will be constrained by fiscal consolidation, there is a risk that this could happen again. As a result, it is premature to conclude that we will soon see a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.\n\nEfficacy of The Asset Purchase Program Exceeds The Costs Our asset purchases are also conditional on our ongoing evaluation that the efficacy of the program exceeds the costs. That clearly has been the case to date—affirmed by our policy decisions. Since we put the outcome-based approach in place in September, my assessment is that efficacy has been as high or higher than I expected at the onset of the program, and costs the same or lower.\n\nEfficacy has two components: the effect of the purchases on financial conditions and the effect of financial conditions on the economy. Our latest purchase program has been associated with a substantial easing in financial conditions, higher equity prices, and narrower credit spreads. The resumption of additional agency MBS purchases in September pushed down MBS yields. With some lag, much of the drop in yields has been passed through to primary mortgage rates.\n\nMeanwhile, the impact of the improvement in financial conditions on the real economy has been somewhat stronger than I had expected. Since September we have seen considerable strength in the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, including housing, autos and durable goods, in spite of the uncertainty and drag from fiscal policy. Improvement in these sectors suggests that monetary policy may be gaining additional traction. This is important because it suggests that the benefit from a given amount of asset purchases has increased.\n\nOn the cost side, I conclude that costs specific to balance sheet expansion have turned out to be no greater than I had anticipated and, because we have less uncertainty about those costs, they are lower than I would have expected in a risk-adjusted sense. Let me start with three commonly cited potential costs—impairment of market functioning, the unanchoring of inflation expectations, and threats to financial stability.\n\nWe carefully monitor financial markets for signs that market functioning has been impaired, looking at metrics such as trading volumes, bid-offer spreads, failures to deliver securities and our own ability to execute transactions. On some of these metrics, market functioning has actually improved in recent months. Of course, we will need to continue to monitor this, particularly if a rise in interest rates leads to less MBS issuance. But so far, so good.\n\nIn terms of inflation expectations, a wide range of measures remain well anchored. For example, the 5-year, 5-year forward measure of inflation expectations calculated from Treasury TIPs versus nominal yields is well within the historical range of recent years (Exhibit 12) .\n\nIn contrast, assessing the potential costs in terms of financial stability is more difficult. Indeed, it is not clear to me which way the sign goes. Do asset purchases increase or reduce financial stability risks?\n\nOn the one hand, information received since September suggests there is slightly greater reason for concern about potential excesses in certain corners of the financial markets. In particular, some areas of fixed income—notably high-yield bonds and leveraged loans—do seem somewhat frothy. However, I view the expected cost to society from bad outcomes here as relatively low. The broad and rapid credit creation associated with the most dangerous types of asset bubbles has been absent (Exhibit 13) . The size of the asset classes in question is relatively modest and most of the investors in these assets are not highly leveraged. So if asset valuations were to adjust sharply and some investors experienced painful losses, I do not expect that such a shock would threaten financial stability.\n\nNevertheless, we will need to keep a close eye on financial asset prices. As I noted in my first speech to the Economic Club of New York 3 years ago: \"Despite the fact that it is hard to discern bubbles, especially in their early stages, I conclude that uncertainty is not grounds for inaction. Instead, the decision whether to act depends on whether appropriate tools can be deployed to limit the size of a bubble and whether the benefits of acting and deploying such tools are likely to exceed the costs.\" 13\n\nOn the other hand, there is a financial stability case for doing more purchases in the current context. To the extent that risky behaviors and incipient asset price bubbles are fueled by an expectation that interest rates will be \"low for long,\" asset purchases that strengthen the economic recovery and bring forward the date of liftoff should promote financial stability. Also, to the extent that asset purchases increase the likelihood of a sustainable recovery, this reduces the financial stability risks associated with a Japanese-style outcome of chronic deflation.\n\nAlthough the costs specific to the asset purchase program appear well-contained, it is also true that the costs increase as the program gets larger. In part, this is due to fact that as the balance sheet increases in size, the risk of a period of low or zero remittances to Treasury also increases. As we acquire more longer-dated assets funded with reserves, the Fed takes on more interest rate risk. This is how the policy works. A byproduct is that our net income and remittances will be unusually elevated for a while, then are likely to fall substantially for a period, before returning to more normal levels. This is because our interest expense will increase substantially when we begin normalizing rates. Also, if we were to sell assets in a rising rate environment, we could also experience some capital losses on these sales. In combination, depending on the future trajectory of short and long rates, remittances could even fall to zero for a period. 14\n\nThere are several important points to make here. First, the potential impact of the purchase program on future Fed remittances was known at the onset of the program—we have no new information here. The outcome depends on how the economy evolves, how we respond, and whether we decide to sell long-dated assets in the portfolio or not.\n\nSecond, it is important not to put excessive weight on the possibility of a period of zero remittances. Our mandate is economic not fiscal—our job is to return the economy to full employment and price stability. Moreover, in considering the fiscal consequences of our actions, what matters is not what happens to our remittances—that is far too narrow a perspective — but how our actions affect the federal debt-to-GDP ratio over time. This is the metric we should be focusing on in assessing the potential fiscal consequences of our actions.\n\nIn this respect, it is important to note that the narrow impact of Fed remittances on the federal debt-to-GDP ratio depends on the cumulative amount, not the timing of remittances. Cumulative remittances to date have been hundreds of billions of dollars higher, all else equal, compared to if the Federal Reserve had not expanded its balance sheet. And, according to Congressional Budget Office projections, even if remittances drop sharply in future years, cumulative remittances would still likely be higher compared to the counterfactual regime in which the Fed had not expanded its balance sheet (Exhibit 14) . In addition, because Fed purchases put downward pressure on long-term interest rates, this generates interest savings for the Treasury, and this benefit should be included in the fiscal cost calculations.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, to the extent that asset purchases are effective in pushing the trajectory of economic growth above what would otherwise have been the case, this will lead to higher federal government tax revenue and lower safety net spending outlays during the recovery period. This means that across a broad range of scenarios, our large-scale asset purchase program is likely to result in a lower federal debt-to-GDP ratio.\n\nTo sum up, the better choice is for the Fed to pursue the policy that best achieves its mandated objectives and puts the U.S. government in a better fiscal position. This dominates a policy of fewer purchases simply so we can avoid potentially having to explain why our remittances may have fallen to zero for a short period.\n\nIssues Associated with the Normalization of Monetary Policy Finally, I'd like to talk about some of the other issues associated with the normalization of monetary policy. In general, I think it is premature to spend much time focusing on exit when we have not yet secured a sustainable economic recovery. That's putting the cart before the horse in my opinion. That said, we nevertheless do need to understand the issues surrounding exit so that we can design the best monetary policy regime to achieve our objectives.\n\nOn this topic, let me ease three concerns I hear frequently expressed. The first is that the large amount of excess reserves in the banking system will be \"dry tinder\" and fuel a rise in inflation. As I have mentioned repeatedly, the ability of the Federal Reserve to pay interest on excess reserves ensures that we can control the credit creation process and prevent an upsurge in inflation.\n\nThe second is that when the Fed ultimately raises the rate it pays on excess reserves, it will be providing a subsidy to the banks. IOER is not a subsidy to the banks. 15 In attracting deposits or other liabilities, competition among banks 16 will ensure that higher interest payments to banks on their reserves will be passed through to bank liability holders.\n\nI look forward to the day when the economy is strong enough for us to raise the interest rate on excess reserves. When that happens, deposit rates will also rise. That will be important because ultra-low rates have been a burden for many seniors and others heavily reliant on this kind of income. When we raise the IOER, it will be my mother and my mother-in-law and others like them, not bankers, who will mainly benefit.\n\nThe third concern is the notion that the Federal Reserve will be slow to tighten monetary policy because this will reduce the amount of our remittances to the Treasury. This does not add up. The Fed is a central bank, not an asset management company—our commitment is to our dual mandate economic objectives—not maximizing net income or remittances. Moreover, even if we were to put any weight on this consideration, the incentives go the other way—our enlarged balance sheet creates an additional reason to tighten monetary policy in a timely way. If the Fed were to delay in raising short-term rates to protect its current earnings, inflation would rise and this would push long-term rates higher. This would just necessitate a bigger rise in short-term interest rates and a greater loss of earnings later.\n\nA much more important issue with respect to policy normalization is moderating the risk of a sharp snapback in longer-term yields. But this has less to do with the size of the balance sheet specifically than the challenge of normalizing the current stance of monetary policy in all its dimensions. There is always a risk that market participants will foreshorten the Fed's actions. Market participants could collapse an extended sequence of steps back to the date of the first move towards normalization resulting in an abrupt tightening of financial conditions.\n\nThe move to economic thresholds-based guidance for the fed funds rate should help in this regard. While the thresholds are certainly not triggers, they should help market participants adjust expectations about the likely timing of liftoff in a relatively continuous manner and guard against these expectations being pulled further forward in time than is warranted by changes in the economic outlook.\n\nNevertheless, we will need to communicate our broader intentions very clearly. Even when purchases cease, the enlarged balance sheet will provide substantial ongoing stimulus. It is important to recognize that the Fed could remain in this posture with policy \"on hold\" for a significant period. As the threshold framework should make clear, there is no fixed time-frame between completing purchases and raising short term rates.\n\nLong-term yields rose sharply in 1994 and 2004 when economic recoveries got underway in earnest after sustained periods of unusually low short-term rates. Compared to those episodes, the risk of a spike in long-dated yields this time around may be somewhat lower for two reasons. First, this risk is receiving much attention. Big market moves are typically associated with surprises. For the market to reprice suddenly, I presume there would need to be some new information that led investors to significantly revise their view of the outlook or the Fed's reaction function.\n\nSecond, the Fed's expansion of its own balance sheet may be a stabilizing influence. For example, the rise in interest rates during the prior episodes was amplified by convexity-related hedging generated by the lengthening of expected mortgage duration. This should be a less powerful force this time around because the Fed holds a substantial portion of the agency MBS market.\n\nHowever, we should keep up our guard. The regulatory community must continue to take steps to mitigate the vulnerability of the economy to a sharp rise in long-term rates. This includes monitoring banks' exposure to duration risk and the quality of their risk management and capital planning, while also looking outside of the banking system because some risks may reside elsewhere. In this regard, agency mortgage REITs and the risk of large outflows from bond mutual funds are issues that deserve ongoing attention.\n\nConclusion The FOMC is committed to the dual objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability. Currently we are falling well short of our employment objective and the restrictive stance of federal fiscal policy is a factor. On inflation, we are also falling short, but by a considerably smaller margin. As a consequence, we need to keep monetary policy very accommodative.\n\nI do not claim that there are no costs or risks associated with our unconventional monetary policy regime. But I see greater cost and risk in moving prematurely to a policy setting that might not prove sufficiently accommodative to ensure a sustainable, strengthening recovery. I remain confident that the benefits of a stronger and earlier economic recovery will trump the costs associated with our unconventional monetary policy measures.\n\nThanks for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n___________________________________________________ 1 Krishna Guha, Simon Potter, Jamie McAndrews, Lorie Logan, Kevin Stiroh, Paolo Pesenti, Richard Peach, Jonathan McCarthy and others on my staff helped with the preparation of these remarks.\n\n2 The household obligation ratio is the sum of payments on mortgage and nonmortgage debt, automobile lease payments, rental payments on tenant-occupied property, homeowners' insurance, and property tax payments divided by disposable after-tax income.\n\n3 Before taking into account fiscal multipliers.\n\n4 This includes a modest boost from inventory investment following the substantial drag of the prior quarter, a recovery in farm output following last year's drought, and less drag from defense outlays following the steep plunge of the fourth quarter. Rebuilding following the devastation from Superstorm Sandy may also provide some temporary lift this quarter.\n\n5 In addition to reinvestment of maturing MBS.\n\n6 At the time the FOMC was purchasing an additional $45 billion a month of longer-dated Treasury securities while selling an equivalent amount of shorter-dated securities under the Maturity Extension Program.\n\n7 While we specified a current monthly pace of purchases the degree of stimulus depends mainly on expectations for the ultimate size of purchases and how long we are expected to hold the assets that we have acquired.\n\n8 This was made clear in the FOMC statement that the Committee expected to reach the unemployment rate threshold at the same time as the earlier date guidance.\n\n9 It avoids the ambiguity of what a change in the forward rate guidance would signal. Is the date being moved out, for example, because the FOMC wants to provide additional accommodation or is the move just due to deterioration in the economic forecast?\n\n10 I draw a distinction here between efficacy and benefit. In my view, the benefit of additional accommodation would diminish as we get closer to our dual mandate objectives and become more confident in the forecast of a strengthening recovery, even if the assessment of the efficacy and cost of the tool were unchanged.\n\n11 Of course, this expectation assumes no new information on efficacy and costs emerges that fundamentally changes my assessment of the merits of the program.\n\n12 Assuming that the improvement in the outlook is not endogenous to the chosen policy setting to the extent that it would disappear if purchases were slowed.\n\n13 Asset Bubbles and the Implications for Central Bank Policy, Economic Club of New York, April 7, 2010.\n\n14 If the Fed's net income fell below zero in a year it would record a deferred asset that it would redeem with future net income. Paid in capital and surplus would remain positive in a very wide range of scenarios. See The Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet and Earnings: A primer and projections , Seth B. Carpenter, Jane E.

See also SOMA annual report (forthcoming).\n\n15 When the Fed creates reserve balances, banks are forced to either add deposits or other liabilities to match the increase in their assets, or reduce other assets, by selling off securities, for example. In either of these responses, banks experience a cost of managing their reserves.\n\n16 Among many other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act allowed banks to pay interest on corporate deposits, and those depositors, because they deposit large amounts, are likely more interest-sensitive, than individual depositors. Furthermore, the wholesale money market is intensely competitive, and, as evidence that reserves are distributed across banks in a way that reflects competitive considerations, note that currently, reserves are held in disproportionately large amounts by Foreign Banking Organizations. The reason I think this happens is that those FBOs do not have to pay the FDIC assessment fee on their liabilities (as they hold no U.S. deposits). That suggests that all banks face competition in attracting liabilities to match their reserve holdings, and that the FBOs, because they face a lower cost in doing so, have managed to attract those deposits at a faster clip than domestic banks. This is the sort of competition that I expect to see that will result in the interest on reserves being passed through by banks to their customers and to the broader economy.\n\nFor clarification, exhibits 8 and 14 have been revised to indicate that the charts show fiscal years.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure  to have this opportunity to speak to you.   In my remarks today, I will discuss financial regulation and the ways in  which proper incentives help ensure resiliency in the financial system. As  always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of  the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nWe have come a  long way since the global financial crisis in building a more resilient  financial system—one that can better support the provision of financial  services to American households and businesses such as those represented here, both  in good times and in bad.  But, there is  still unfinished business.\n\nOn the  regulatory side, for example, there is more work to be done to ensure that a  systemically important bank can be resolved effectively on a cross-border basis  in the event of failure.  Additionally, the  efficiency, transparency, and simplicity of the regulatory system could be  improved without weakening the core reforms to capital, liquidity, and  resolution that have made the financial system much stronger.\n\nMost  importantly, we need to recognize that an effective regulatory regime and comprehensive  supervision are not sufficient.  We also  need to focus on the incentives facing banks and their employees.  After all, misaligned incentives contributed  greatly to the financial crisis and continue to affect bank conduct and  behavior. 2\n\nToday, I will address  this issue of incentives, with emphasis on the complementary roles of  regulation, supervision, and bank culture.   Each of these is necessary to ensure that we have a robust and resilient  financial system not just today, but also in the future.\n\nProgress  Since the Financial Crisis\n\nThe financial  crisis was a watershed event that exposed severe deficiencies in the financial  system—including the inadequacy of bank capital and liquidity buffers, poor risk  management and internal controls, and bad bank cultures.  Many financial firms took on an excessive  amount of risk and did not always act in ways consistent with the interests of  their customers or the broader public.  The  crisis revealed woeful shortcomings in many of these elements, with terrible  consequences for the economy and millions of people.\n\nOver the past  decade, the official sector and the financial industry have made considerable  progress in addressing these problems.  The  banking system is much sounder and more resilient as a result, in a number of  ways.\n\nFirst,  systemically important banks are much safer. 3 They have much bigger liquidity and capital  buffers, and the quality of capital is much improved.  Moreover, the capital regime now has a  forward-looking element in which annual stress tests examine banks’ ability to  withstand losses under severely adverse economic conditions and constrain the  amount of capital that can be returned to shareholders via dividends and share  repurchases.  Strengthened liquidity  standards have given the market greater confidence that banks possess adequate  resources to weather temporary storms that arise.  At the global level, Basel III has helped to  level the competitive playing field in a number of ways—including, most  recently, by imposing constraints on banks’ use of internal models to meet  their capital requirements, and by introducing a leverage buffer for  systemically important firms, similar to what we already have in place in the United  States.\n\nNew regulatory  standards have been complemented by a supervisory framework for the largest  banks that explicitly acknowledges the impact that distress at such firms could  have on financial markets and the economy. 4 These efforts have led to considerable improvement  in risk management at banks, which should help better sustain the flow of  credit to the real economy throughout the business cycle.\n\nSecond,  considerable progress has been made in terms of resolution.  Systemically important banks now have living  wills that provide a roadmap for how these firms would be resolved in the event  of imminent failure.  Moreover, there is  now a well-defined mechanism under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act for  recapitalization of a failed systemically important firm.  The FDIC now has the authority to initiate a “single  point of entry” resolution, which places the parent holding company into FDIC  receivership and transfers its subsidiaries to a new parent company.  Total loss-absorbing capacity, or TLAC, of the  old parent company would be available to absorb losses and could be used to  recapitalize the new parent company.  But,  the task of operationalizing resolution for large, global banks—including  achieving full clarity on the roles of the home and host supervisors—is still  not complete.  It is key that work  continues on this front to ensure that a systemically important firm can fail  without threatening to topple the rest of the financial system—an important  step toward ending “too big to fail.”\n\nThird, some of  the obvious systemic vulnerabilities exposed by the financial crisis have been  remedied.  Important changes include  mandatory clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives through central  counterparties, or CCPs; more intensive supervision of systemically important CCPs;  and reforms of the tri-party repo system and the money market mutual fund  industry.  But, even as we reduce or  eliminate old vulnerabilities, we must not rest on our laurels, for new vulnerabilities  will inevitably take their place.\n\nThese accomplishments  notwithstanding, I have no doubt that the current regulatory framework could be  improved.  Indeed, the official sector should  assess the efficiency and effectiveness of regulations on an ongoing  basis.  I agree with Vice Chairman Quarles’  observation that there is more we can do to make the regulatory regime more  efficient, transparent, and simple—including relief for small banks, greater  tailoring based on a firm’s level of systemic importance, and simplifying the  Volcker Rule. 5 Some of these changes have already been  adopted or are in process.\n\nGreater  Focus on Incentives Is Needed\n\nBut, I also  think we must take a broader view of what characterizes a resilient and robust financial  system.  To that end, we need to carefully monitor the incentives that influence  the behavior of financial firms and their employees.\n\nIndeed, the  record from the crisis and more recent years shows just how powerful incentives  can be in driving firms and individuals to do things that are imprudent and/or  unethical.  Bad incentives can lead to conduct that not only generates large risk  exposures and market excess, but also erodes trust and confidence in the  financial system.  For example, the  pre-crisis housing boom would not have gone so far, for so long, without the  widespread breakdown in mortgage underwriting practices that was driven by poor  incentives. 6\n\nSome examples of bad incentives that contributed to the  financial boom and bust included:\n\nSince then, we  have seen a number of other costly breakdowns that were driven, in part, by  poor incentives.\n\nThese recent  cases were particularly disturbing in terms of their scale and flagrancy, and—in  the case of the rate-rigging scandals—the collusion by employees across  firms.  I am particularly struck by the  fact that manipulation of the foreign exchange market occurred even after the  LIBOR scandal was well known.  These episodes  underscore the tremendous power that incentives have to influence and distort  behavior, potentially leading to massive damage to bank cultures, reputations,  and finances.\n\nSome lessons on  incentives that stand out for me include:\n\nMany of these  issues and risks likely also apply to your companies.  But, I think they are particularly important for  financial institutions—especially those that are systemically important.  The scale of such firms magnifies the impact  of bad incentives on the financial system and economy.  At the same time, that scale also makes it more  difficult for senior management to properly control a firm’s activities and monitor  the conduct and behavior of its employees.  For these reasons, we need strong internal and  external checks on banks—an area to which I will now turn.\n\nThe  Complementary Roles of Regulation, Supervision, and Culture\n\nAs I said earlier,  a sound financial system is one that is safe and resilient, can support the  provision of financial services at a reasonable price to the real economy in  good times and in bad, and promotes confidence and trust among its customers  and counterparties.  Financial  institutions should be prudently managed and subject to strong internal checks—including  risk management policies and procedures, internal controls, compliance, and  audit.  Meanwhile, an effective financial  regulatory and supervisory regime should be as efficient, transparent, and  simple as possible.\n\nI think these  goals are broadly shared by supervisors and banks alike, which suggests to me  that the relationship between supervisors and banks does not always need to be  adversarial.  Indeed, a healthy dialogue  helps this supervisory process to work well.   For example, it is important that firms are proactive in revealing  problems to their supervisors.  And,  individual institutions can certainly benefit from the horizontal perspective  that supervisors bring to examinations.   This perspective can highlight where the firm stands vis-à-vis best  practices, or where there may be important vulnerabilities in its operations.\n\nOf course, there  is an irreducible amount of tension built into this relationship, given that each  party’s roles, interests, and responsibilities will not always coincide.  Banks are naturally more sensitive to  constraints on their profit opportunities or dividend policies and to the costs  of regulation.  They may also question  how much protection is necessary—for example, how stringent the capital  requirements or how severe stress testing assumptions should be.  These are areas where I would expect  perspectives to differ.\n\nSupervisors are  principally focused on compliance with laws and regulations as well as issues  of safety and soundness.  They also bring  to their work a perspective on financial stability that may not match the more  narrow interests of the firm.  For  example, supervisors seek to address the externalities created by the failure  of a systemically important firm by imposing higher capital and other  requirements than the firm would likely select if left to its own devices.\n\nThe financial  crisis is a vivid reminder that there can be many risks to financial stability,  and of the need for strong internal and external constraints on banks.  Here, the “three pillars” of regulation,  supervision, and bank culture must all play effective roles.  Regulation establishes what is legally  permissible for banks to do; supervision helps to reinforce those rules and  evaluate whether the bank’s controls and other processes are conducive to  safety and soundness; and bank culture sets the norms for what is appropriate  behavior. 9 But, at the same time, these pillars are  mutually reinforcing. Regulation and supervision, for example, attempt to  address various market failures in banking that can contribute to excessive  risk taking. 10 Bank culture, in turn, helps establish norms  in areas where regulation may be silent.\n\nIn this way,  regulation, supervision, and bank culture are complements, and deficiencies in  any of these pillars can be problematic.   For example, as we have seen in cases of unsafe or unethical behavior in  recent years, strong regulation and supervision cannot substitute for  deficiencies in bank culture—especially not on a timely basis.\n\nIt is the public sector’s job to establish and enforce  rules, but rules are inherently limited in their ability to constrain conduct  and behavior.  Much of our regulatory  regime has been developed in response to financial problems that have arisen over  time.  Because regulation is typically  reactive in this way, it may not always keep pace with the evolution of the  financial system or the broader economic environment.  Also, we must recognize that, at times,  actions will be taken that are  clearly inconsistent with the spirit of the rules that are place, or the rules will  simply be violated.\n\nConsider the use  by Lehman Brothers of so-called Repo 105 transactions to window-dress its  balance sheet.  Beginning in late 2007, Lehman  used Repo 105 transactions to temporarily remove securities from its balance  sheet for a few days in order to mislead investors and counterparties about its  financial condition.  These transactions  had the benefit of being recognized as “sales” even though they were nearly  identical to standard repo transactions that stayed on the balance sheet.\n\nIn another  example, following the introduction of Basel III, some banks tried to reduce  their capital requirements by transferring risk to other counterparties.  In certain cases, this occurred even when  those counterparties did not provide any additional resources to absorb potential  losses—either because they were very thinly capitalized, or were affiliated  with the banks in question.\n\nI would also note that the establishment of too many bright-line  rules may prove counterproductive to the goal of encouraging good bank cultures.   For one thing, detailed rules can be  construed as implying that the responsibility for good conduct rests with the public  authorities.  For another, rules may  create opportunities or incentives for legal or regulatory arbitrage.  When banks work to find creative ways around  rules, it can have an insidious effect on culture.\n\nAs I see it, an organization’s culture gets into trouble  when it equates “what is right” with what is legally permissible, and when  “what is wrong” becomes viewed as what is legally impermissible.  A proliferation of rules—followed by the gaming  of these rules—can be ultimately self-defeating. The end result may not only be  a loss of trust, but also over time a more burdensome regulatory regime than would  otherwise be the case.\n\nSo, while  regulation and supervision are necessary to ensure a resilient and robust  financial system, I very much doubt that they are sufficient.  They need to be supplemented by bank  management that pays close attention to incentives, conduct, and culture.  As I have previously said, incentives drive  conduct, which establishes the social norms that help define a firm’s culture. 11 The first step is for firms to evaluate the  incentives that they have in place with respect to personnel evaluation,  compensation, and promotion and to make sure they are consistent with the type  of behaviors they want to encourage.  For  example, how are compliance violations treated in compensation and promotion  decisions?  Are incentives in place to  encourage people to speak up early, when problems are smaller and more  manageable?  When employees do speak up,  how are they subsequently treated?\n\nMy colleagues and  I at the New York Fed have commented previously on the essential role of good  culture in a bank’s reputation, financial condition and performance, and in  customer confidence and trust. 12 As we have argued, “cultural capital”—through  its ability to limit misconduct risk—can be an important bulwark to a firm’s  financial capital. 13\n\nCulture is often viewed as a “soft” topic, but I would  disagree.  The financial penalties  associated with misconduct are anything but soft—with bank fines since the  crisis estimated at more than $320 billion as of year-end 2016. 14 The hit to a bank’s reputation from  misconduct can also be quantified through, for example, the associated impact  on its share price or funding costs.  Culture  should be about concrete incentives and behaviors that help achieve specific  goals, implying that it should not be viewed as a “soft” issue.\n\nI have argued on  several occasions that bank leaders could get a better view into their firms’  progress on conduct and culture by doing more collectively. 15 For example, major banks in the United States  could participate in an industry-wide survey of their employees conducted by an  independent third party, with the results anonymized to encourage respondents  to be candid in their assessments.  I suspect  that these results would create a more accurate picture of how banks are doing,  and would likely underscore how much work continues to be needed to improve  bank cultures.\n\nAnother idea  that I have discussed is the creation of a database of banker misconduct to  combat the problem of “rolling bad apples.”  In these cases, employees who are dismissed  due to suspicion or proof of misconduct are unwittingly hired by other firms in  the industry, where they have the opportunity to repeat their actions.  Understandably, firms are concerned about  legal risk if they share information about banker misconduct, but there may be  ways to address these concerns through legislation.  Once again, I invite the industry to take the  initiative on these issues, and to look to the public sector for support.\n\nFor their part, I  believe that supervisors have a special role to play in assessing incentives at  the firm level and their possible implications for bank behavior and misconduct.  Supervisors can mitigate misconduct risks by supporting the development of effective corporate governance  regimes, prudent risk management policies, and strong compliance and control  structures—all within a framework of effective oversight from the firm's board  of directors.\n\nUltimately, establishing and maintaining an effective  culture with appropriate risk governance and controls is the responsibility of  individual firms and the industry, but the official sector can help by highlighting  best practices and addressing collective action problems and other market  failures.\n\nAreas  Where Further Work on Incentives Is Warranted\n\nI would like to briefly  touch on some areas where further work on incentives may be warranted,  including regulatory changes that might address certain incentive and first-mover  problems.  At the outset, let me say that  I do not have all the answers and do not mean to suggest that these are the  only areas that need improvement. But, these issues are ones where more  investigation into possible solutions may be warranted.\n\nAs I discussed earlier,  we have made substantial progress in raising banks’ capital buffers.  But, I believe it would also be worthwhile to  evaluate other changes to our capital regime to encourage earlier action by  banks when the economic environment deteriorates.  Banks are naturally reluctant to raise  capital due to concerns about stigma and potential equity dilution.  This hesitancy was demonstrated clearly during  the financial crisis.  Bank management may  also delay such a move because they may be prone to over-optimism about the  outlook for their firm or the economy.  There  is also an externality problem, as a bank does not internalize the benefit that  accrues to the financial system when it takes steps to strengthen its own financial  condition.\n\nAlthough supervisors  have tools available in such circumstances, these require a safety-and-soundness  basis that may not always be available in a timely manner.  Changes in the 2018 Comprehensive Capital Analysis  and Review program enable banks to avoid a Federal Reserve Board objection  based on the quantitative assessment by raising new capital.  While this is a step in the right direction, the  current regime may not be sufficient to ensure that banks will raise capital  more proactively.\n\nCompensation is also  a powerful incentive.  As I mentioned earlier,  the emphasis in compensation practices on short-term performance over  longer-term sustainable returns was a key vulnerability revealed during the  crisis that helped motivate imprudent behavior.   Currently, senior bankers are paid mainly in cash and deferred stock  grants.  This structure creates  incentives to take actions to maximize a bank’s share price, rather than to  minimize the risk of the bank’s failure.   While compensation practices today feature a larger deferred component, greater  emphasis on deferral in the form of long-term debt—which can also be recognized  as TLAC—could better align senior managers’ interests with the long-term safety  and soundness of the firm. 16\n\nAs I see it,  this approach could have two benefits.  For  one, it would reduce the incentives for risk-taking. For another, if TLAC debt  holdings were at risk of conversion to equity in the event of failure, I  believe senior bankers would be incentivized to cut dividends or raise equity  capital earlier to reduce the risk of failure.  Having a regime in place that creates strong  incentives for management to steer aggressively away from bad outcomes would be  better than one in which management has incentives to temporize in the face of  rising risks.\n\nSome banks have  experimented with such compensation schemes, and I would encourage more to do  so.  But, this type of reform may also need  a push from the regulatory side.  Banks may  be reluctant to adopt such pay structures on their own for competitive reasons.   They may perceive that there is a first-mover  disadvantage in attracting and retaining talent.\n\nAnother possible  reform could involve putting a greater onus on senior management for the costs incurred  from regulatory fines or other legal liabilities, rather than on shareholders  alone.  Shareholders should not be  shielded from such costs and fines—as they may have also profited from  associated gains—but it doesn’t seem fair or prudent to shield the decision-makers  from responsibility for costly breakdowns as much as they are now.  Greater personal liability may also be a powerful  incentive to promote better behavior.  I  suspect changes in these areas would lead senior managers to encourage their  staff to speak up earlier about emerging risks, be more attentive when red  flags were raised, and respond sooner and more forcefully.\n\nI would also  note that the many regulatory reforms introduced over the past decade may  create incentives of their own, with important implications for bank behavior. Such  incentives may alter the nature and locus of risk-taking, and therefore need to  be closely monitored.  Risks could be  shifted outside the banking system, or the incentives could lead to different bank  strategies, business models, and product offerings that introduce new risks.\n\nThere is a long  history of such behavior.  For example,  off-balance-sheet instruments rose sharply in the 1980s in response to the  introduction of minimum primary and total capital requirements based on balance  sheet size.  More recently, in some  jurisdictions the use of leverage ratios based on period-end reporting of  assets—as compared to period averages in the United States—has encouraged window-dressing  behavior by some banks at quarter-end.  So,  while the reforms have mostly had the intended effect of encouraging safer  institutions, authorities and financial institutions should also be mindful of  potential unintended consequences.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, we  have made considerable progress toward a more resilient and robust financial  system.  While we should do more to make  the regulatory regime more efficient, transparent, and simple, there are outstanding  issues that still require additional work—such as the cross-border resolution  of large global banks.  We should also focus  more on incentives, which can help ensure that regulations are dynamic and work  well, and that banks are incentivized to take action early to steer away from  trouble.  Finally, regulation and  supervision are necessary but not sufficient—they must be supplemented by bank cultures  that encourage ethical behavior, the early identification of problems, and a  willingness to address those problems proactively.\n\nThank you for  your kind attention.  I would be happy to  take a few questions.",

    "text": "I. National economic conditions To provide some context, I'll begin with a few words about national economic conditions. U.S. economic activity has expanded for four consecutive quarters, but at rates that can only be described as modest when compared with early stages of past recoveries. The June payroll numbers tell the story of this sluggish recovery in employment. The economy gained only 83,000 private-sector jobs, following a downwardly revised gain of only 33,000 in May. Growth in the third quarter may turn out to be a bit less than we saw in the first half of the year, though we think there is only a slight risk of a double dip. The road to recovery is turning out to be a bit bumpy as relatively weak consumer spending and the ongoing problems in financial markets are keeping growth far less robust than we would like.\n\nTo date, the manufacturing sector has been a key source of growth during the recovery. After an unusually steep decline from late 2007 to mid-2009, manufacturing output has grown rapidly over the past year, although the level of manufacturing output remains well below the previous peak. A major force behind the growth of manufacturing output has been an unusually pronounced inventory cycle. Production has expanded as firms across a variety of industries have been rebuilding their stocks to bring them into a better balance with sales. Another driver of manufacturing output over the past several quarters has been a pronounced rebound of our exports of manufactured goods. Economic activity abroad has been recovering from its weak levels in 2009, and that global recovery has helped fuel demand for our products, particularly capital goods.\n\nThe importance of manufacturing in the recovery makes it a timely topic for our regional economic briefing, namely, trends in the manufacturing sector here in the Second District.\n\nII. Regional Economic Conditions (update since the April regional press briefing) Turning to our region, we can see a nascent recovery in most areas, with a holding pattern in other parts. This mixed pattern of growth is not surprising in the aftermath of a recession, and particularly a deep one with a financial crisis, as well. On the positive side, I can report that economic activity has picked up in many parts of the region.\n\nTo measure activity we use a set of indexes of economic activity—called Coincident Economic Indicators—that we produce here at the New York Fed for New York State, New York City and New Jersey, plus a similar index produced in Puerto Rico. These indexes provide a timely, monthly gauge of economic activity. They show that in New York State and New York City, activity has expanded at a relatively brisk pace since the beginning of the year. In Puerto Rico, where the recession began three years before the mainland downturn, the economy also appears to be picking up in recent months. In contrast, economic conditions in New Jersey remain essentially flat. Although activity there is no longer declining, New Jersey has yet to establish a sustained recovery.\n\nBut, what about jobs—which are the key for people to truly feel the recovery in their lives? I am pleased to note that private-sector job growth has turned up moderately across much of the region in the past few months, just as it has in the nation. Growth in private-sector jobs signals that some firms need to hire workers to meet their production needs. This is a good sign and necessary for a sustainable recovery. The number of private-sector jobs has increased in and around New York City, in Northern New Jersey and in some parts of upstate New York. The June job market report for New York and New Jersey showed the recovery is likely to be a bit bumpy. Private-sector employment fell in both in New York State and New York City, though despite June's dip, employment in New York City remains above its low point in December 2009. In contrast, New Jersey's private-sector jobs picture improved in June, though a weak public sector there continues to weigh down overall job growth.\n\nDespite the improvements we have seen, unemployment in the region remains painfully high. In June, New York City's and New Jersey's rates were very close to the national jobless rate of 9.5 percent. The rate for New York State, which has been improving since the first quarter, is noticeably lower at 8.2 percent. Puerto Rico, which has had much higher unemployment than the mainland for the past several decades, had a jobless rate of 16.3 percent in June, with little evidence of recovery so far.\n\nIII. Regional Manufacturing Sector Background The manufacturing sector is important to our region because it provides a substantial number of high-wage jobs and, in some parts of the region, is a key driver of business cycles and longer-term trends. To understand manufacturing in our region, it is important to note that different parts of the region specialize in different products. For example, New York City's largest manufacturing industry is apparel; motor-vehicle parts is a large industry in western New York, as are computers and electronics in Syracuse, Binghamton and the Hudson Valley. The pharmaceuticals industry is dominant in Northern New Jersey and Puerto Rico.\n\nOver the past several decades, manufacturing wages have risen, while the number of workers it employs has fallen, These long-term trends stem from fundamental structural changes in trade, technology and consumption patterns. Some manufacturing has moved to other parts of the United States or overseas. The advent of information technology and computerization has also profoundly altered many manufacturing processes. And, the mix of products demanded by consumers has evolved over time. All of these factors have combined to reduce the number of factory jobs across the nation, with the New York/New Jersey region hit particularly hard. What is less well known is that despite this employment decline, manufacturing output has actually continued to grow moderately in much of the New York/New Jersey region. This means that the sector has experienced substantial gains in productivity. These productivity gains—the result of innovation and adaptation—have been accompanied by rising average wages in manufacturing. Like the rest of the country, our job losses have been heavily concentrated in lower-skill positions, resulting in a leaner and more skilled manufacturing industry.\n\nThe manufacturing sector and its structural job-wage dynamics are particularly important in upstate New York. Upstate (especially in its rural areas) manufacturing workers tend to earn higher wages than the average in their region, and the sector employs a larger share of the workforce there than it does nationally.\n\nOutlook How will the current recovery in manufacturing employment play out? Nationally, the growth in manufacturing output over the past year has occurred in a variety of industries, including autos, machinery, and computers and other electronic equipment. This growth reflects a combination of the restocking of inventories, domestic demand growth (particularly in investment goods), and higher exports. The concentration of these industries in parts of our region meant that those areas were poised to take advantage of this growth. The region has seen some increase in factory jobs in recent months, which undoubtedly reflects the expansion of production that has occurred nationally in these industries.\n\nA number of indicators suggest that the inventory cycle may be largely complete—that is, the recent restocking has brought inventories into a better balance with sales. If so, we will lose restocking as an impetus for growth. Despite this, we expect manufacturing output to continue to expand because of improving domestic demand and foreign demand for U.S. manufactured exports. Yet, if this recovery follows the typical pattern for past recoveries, the prospect for growth in factory jobs will likely be weaker here than the rest of the nation.\n\nLonger term, the sector's prospects are likely to be governed by a continuation of the trends I mentioned before in international trade, technology and consumption patterns. This means that output and wages will likely continue to rise, both nationally and regionally. However, the sector is unlikely to be a major source of job growth. Beyond the national trends that work against an expansion of factory jobs, the New York–New Jersey region faces ongoing competitive pressures as a location for manufacturing production. That competition comes from other regions of the country, as well as from abroad. One key to meeting these competitive challenges will be for the region to ensure that it develops and attracts a highly skilled workforce that can meet the needs of innovative and rapidly changing firms.\n\nIV. The Empire State Manufacturing Survey In order to monitor conditions in the region, the New York Fed conducts a monthly survey of manufacturing firms in New York State, our Empire State Manufacturing Survey . Let me tell you a little about the survey and then review recent patterns.\n\nThe survey is sent to a pool of about 200 manufacturing executives in a wide variety of industries across the state. About 100 responses are usually received. For the survey's main index—which is called the General Business Conditions Index—respondents report the change from the previous month in of overall conditions in their firm. To explain their answers, we also ask them to assess components of activity such as orders, shipments, inventories and employment. Respondents are also asked for their views on the likely direction of these indicators over the next six months. In addition, each month we ask supplementary questions on a topic of current interest. To share the information as quickly and broadly as possible, we post results on our public website on the 15th of each month or the next business day. In doing this survey, we join the four other Federal Reserve Banks that use a survey to monitor conditions in their manufacturing sectors.\n\nThis morning I want to highlight the results of our July survey, which we released last Thursday. Our main index began to signal an upturn in the manufacturing sector in New York State last summer and, despite a brief dip last December, has given a consistently positive signal for a year now. Our July survey showed that conditions continue to improve, but at a slower pace than in previous months. In this month's supplementary questions, we asked respondents about the importance of trade with various parts of the world to manufacturing activity in New York State. In general, respondents indicated that exports account for a growing share of their revenues. Their firms are devoting more resources to marketing abroad—particularly in Asia—and expect their export sales to be higher in the next 12 months than in the past 12 months.\n\nIn sum, the region is showing signs of a moderate recovery, and the manufacturing sector is playing a key role in that recovery in parts of the region.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I will now ask Jaison Abel to provide more details on current regional economic conditions.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today.  This is my first time in New Zealand (not counting a brief stop at the Auckland airport).  I’m delighted to be here and am heading down to the South Island tomorrow.\n\nToday, I am going to talk about the challenges that face us in ensuring stability in the global financial system.  While we have made considerable progress in strengthening the financial system—for example, large global banks have considerably more capital and liquidity resources than prior to the financial crisis—there is still a significant amount of hard work ahead for all of us.  For example, we need to develop resolution mechanisms that will work on a global basis and we need to ensure that the clearing of standardized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives through central counterparties (CCPs) is done safely.  We also need to improve our ability to aggregate and share data.  We need to do this in order to develop a coherent view of the global financial system so that we can deal with emerging vulnerabilities in a timely and effective way.  As always, my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn the years prior to Lehman Brothers’ failure, critical vulnerabilities built up within the global financial system.  Banks evolved from being local in their geographic footprint, to national and then international in scope.  Supervision and regulation did not keep pace with these changes and capital and liquidity requirements were underdeveloped during this period.  Our view into the operations of global banks was too limited due both to shortcomings of banks in aggregating their internal information and to difficulties in sharing information globally across supervisors.\n\nAt the same time, the so-called “shadow banking” system was growing in both size and complexity.  Particularly noteworthy was the proliferation of money-like instruments created outside of the traditional banking sector that were used to finance long-term, illiquid assets.  In the U.S., protections against bank runs that were put into place during the Great Depression did not extend to this new shadow banking sector.\n\nPut simply, we did not have a good picture of the global financial system.  As a result, we were unable to observe its growing instabilities or respond preemptively to emerging vulnerabilities.\n\nWhile the official sector has made considerable progress in addressing these weaknesses, important challenges remain.  In particular, we must eliminate the regime of having “too-big-to-fail” financial institutions.  I believe that a multi-faceted approach is needed involving four major components.  First, we need to minimize the risk that a large, complex financial firm fails in the first place.  Second, we need to have credible resolution regimes in place should such a failure materialize despite our best efforts.  Third, we need to strengthen the resiliency of our financial system so that the stresses associated with the failure of a major financial firm are not amplified across the system. Fourth, we need to build up our data capabilities so we can better monitor the global financial system as a whole.  For the full benefit from this multifaceted approach to be realized, public authorities must continue to work together in a coordinated manner.\n\nGlobal, systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs) pose a significant challenge to financial stability on two fronts.  First, due to their size, complexity and central role in financial markets, a disorderly failure of a G-SIFI would directly cause major disruptions in markets, adversely affecting credit flows and real economic activity.  Second, such a disorderly failure would also indirectly place significant negative strains on other financial firms due not only to direct credit exposures to the failed institution, but also due to the fire sale dynamics that would ensue.  The lack of transparency in markets as to which firms would be most affected could result in a general pull-back by investors, which, in turn, could lead to additional deleveraging and further downward pressure on asset prices.  As we saw during the financial crisis, this amplification mechanism could quickly spread the strains throughout the global financial system.\n\nPrior to the financial crisis, the risk to financial stability posed by G-SIFIs created a dilemma for policymakers when one or more of these firms found itself in danger of failing.  On the one hand, standing back and not intervening would enhance market discipline.  This market discipline would provide incentives for better decision-making by the management of financial firms and more vigorous monitoring by their creditors.  On the other hand, the risks to financial stability from a failure would have been extraordinarily high, creating pressure for the official sector to intervene in an effort to prevent a disorderly failure.\n\nHistorically, in most cases when the relevant firms were very large and complex, this dilemma has led to official sector interventions.  A consequence is that market discipline was undermined for those firms perceived to be “too big to fail.”  To the extent that such actions cause creditors to anticipate future interventions that would shield them from losses, this reduces creditors’ incentive to monitor the management of these firms or respond forcefully in the case of early signs of deterioration.  In addition, because the expectation of official sector intervention lowers expected credit losses, this results in cheaper funding costs and provides G-SIFIs with a competitive advantage.  It also creates an incentive for such firms to take actions to maintain their too-big-to fail status to preserve this funding advantage.  As a consequence, the structure of the financial system has evolved towards larger and more complex firms than can be justified by economies of scale and scope.\n\nThis is an unacceptable regime and this policy dilemma needs to be resolved.  Ideally, we want a regime in which we retain the benefits from the services provided by G-SIFIs to the economy, but not at the price of having to “bail-out” such institutions in order to preserve financial stability should they come to the brink of failure.\n\nI believe that a credible solution involves two complementary goals.  First, coordinated steps must be taken to significantly reduce the likelihood that a G-SIFI ever reaches the point where it is at risk of failure.  This risk should be pushed well below the level for smaller and less complex financial institutions.  Second, home jurisdictions for these G-SIFIs need credible resolution mechanisms that can be implemented on a global basis so these firms can fail without large systemic consequences.  A resolution mechanism will be credible only if it reduces the negative externalities from such a failure to an acceptable level.\n\nWhile progress has been made toward these two goals, additional work and coordination is still required.  Turning first to efforts to reduce the likelihood that a G-SIFI will be at risk of failing, the Basel international standards raised both the quantity and quality of capital for internationally active banks.  Banks also are required to capture more complex risks in their measures of risk-weighted assets.  To complement the stronger risk-weighted capital standards, an international leverage ratio requirement also has been adopted.\n\nIn addition, the Basel framework will require a capital buffer that increases with a firm’s size, complexity, interconnectedness and global footprint.  In addition to providing additional loss absorbing capacity, this capital buffer requirement will act to offset any funding advantages for G-SIFIs, helping to level the playing field with smaller, less complex financial institutions.  Together, when fully implemented, these changes should reduce the failure risk for G-SIFIs.\n\nTo complement the Basel framework, I believe that jurisdictions need to create processes and incentives for management of G-SIFIs to act earlier and more decisively in response to emerging risks facing their firms.  Proactive interventions by the senior management of banks will have a greater efficacy and a lower cost than reactive steps taken only in response to growing market pressure.  These proactive management interventions can take many forms including raising additional capital, cutting capital distributions, restructuring business lines and making difficult personnel changes.  Avoiding a hazard is easier if one’s focal point is kept well down the road.\n\nOfficial sector stress tests are an important tool that can facilitate this forward-looking management focus.  One example is the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process in the United States.  The goal of CCAR is to ensure that banks have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes, as well as sufficient capital to withstand severely stressed economic conditions while, maintaining their ability to perform their critical roles of credit intermediation.  In CCAR, each of the participating banks is required to project the impact of particular forward-looking stress scenarios on their operations over a two-year horizon.  Both the banks and the supervisors conduct independent assessments of the impact of the stress scenarios on the various business lines of the bank.  This approach provides a cross-validation of each bank’s analysis, while at the same time generating results that can be compared across the participating banks.\n\nAnother important feature of CCAR is that the scenarios and the key aspects of the banks results are made public rather than treated as confidential supervisory information.  This transparency is important for supporting market confidence in the banking system.  Finally, a critical aspect of the stress testing process is the supervisory review of the capital planning process for each participating bank.  This planning process is what reinforces and promotes a proactive stance by management to emerging risks.\n\nThe structure of bank management compensation also could be designed to provide incentives that reinforce a proactive, forward-looking risk management approach.  As I will discuss in a moment, sufficient long-term debt that can be converted to equity is an important element of an effective resolution mechanism for G-SIFIs.  While the magnitude of this long-term debt needs to be sufficient to ensure that public funds are not at risk in the event that a resolution of a firm is necessary, making this long-term debt a component of management compensation might also be used to help reduce the likelihood of a default.  Long-term debt provided by outside creditors exposed to risk of default can create useful market discipline.  However, outside creditors do not have the same information or decision rights as inside management.  Structuring a long-term debt requirement so that a meaningful component consists of deferred compensation held by senior management would presumably strengthen the incentives for proactive risk management.  In my opinion, more research is needed into how the structure of management compensation for financial firms could incentivize good risk management and limit the appetite for excessive risk. 1 Even if every jurisdiction were to successfully implement these types of initiatives and consequently reduce the default risks associated with their G-SIFIs, the risk of failure would not be fully eliminated.  This means there would always be some residual risk of major disruptions to financial markets due to a disorderly default of a large financial firm.  Consequently, the development and implementation of credible resolution mechanisms for G-SIFIs is the second key component of a global strategy to improve financial stability.  By credible, I mean that if the situation of an impending G-SIFI default arises, the home authorities will proceed with the resolution plan, rather than give in to pressure to intervene to prevent the failure.  This requires that the resolution mechanisms be capable of significantly mitigating the negative externalities associated with winding down a failing G-SIFI.  Although the specifics of the resolution mechanisms will necessarily vary to some extent across jurisdictions, reflecting differences in institutional structures, legal frameworks, and regulatory regimes, the goal is common—to be able to resolve any G-SIFI regardless of its home jurisdiction, even in periods of stressful financial market conditions, without taxpayer funds, in a way that minimizes knock-on effect to financial markets and other financial institutions. As I have indicated in earlier speeches, I endorse the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) single point of entry (SPE) resolution framework for the United States.  For the SPE approach to be successful, firms subject to this resolution regime will need to have a sufficient amount of long-term debt at the parent company that the FDIC can convert into equity to guarantee that the new bridge company is adequately capitalized.  Counterparties at the subsidiary level need to be assured that they have no reason to pull back from the new bridge company. In the international arena this type of requirement is referred to as GLAC, or “gone concern loss absorption capacity.”  The Financial Stability Board is working on a proposal for an international GLAC standard, with a target date for consideration this November. Finalizing this standard is an important to-do item.  As I discussed earlier, both the amount and the composition of additional resources are important.  The adequacy of the GLAC buffer mitigates the negative externalities from a default, while the possible use of management-held long-term debt as an element of GLAC could bolster incentives to reduce the risk of a default in the first place. There are implementation details of the FDIC’s SPE resolution framework that still need to be worked out.  These arise from the challenge involved in operationalizing the framework with financial firms that conduct business across several jurisdictions and geographic borders.  In this international arena, one specific issue needs to be promptly addressed.  Due to parent guarantees or other cross-default provisions, the placement by the FDIC of the parent company into receivership may be treated by some counterparties as an event of default.  This could trigger the close-out of qualified financial contracts (QFCs) such as interest rate swap contracts at international subsidiaries, which could potentially be destabilizing.  To deal with this issue, the Dodd-Frank Act’s Title II one-day stay on the close-out of qualified financial contracts needs to be extended to cover contracts governed by non-U.S. law and involving non-U.S. counterparties.  Resolving this issue is important to ensuring a smooth transition to the new bridge company. Addressing the contract close-out issue can be accomplished in two ways that are not mutually exclusive.  First, existing derivative contracts could be amended and future contracts written to stipulate that the parent’s placement into a Title II resolution does not trigger the close-out option.  Second, legal provisions in other countries could be modified so that the one-day stay that applies to qualified financial contracts governed by U.S. law is also enforceable for those contracts governed by foreign law.  Either or both of these actions would help ensure that the FDIC’s SPE mechanism could be successfully executed without unduly disrupting financial markets and counterparty risk positions. Given the cross-border activities of the G-SIFIs, the effectiveness of resolution mechanisms also will depend on the degree of coordination across national authorities.  For example, we do not know for certain how foreign authorities would react if the parent of a U.S.-based G-SIFI were placed into a Title II resolution proceeding.  Uncertainties exist regarding whether foreign authorities either might choose, or be required, to take defensive actions such as ring-fencing that could disrupt the smooth implementation of the resolution process.  An important task going forward is for authorities to work cooperatively and expeditiously to resolve these uncertainties. A well-crafted and well-executed resolution process for G-SIFIs can still be expected to create some strains in financial markets, especially considering the likely unsettled state of these markets at the time a resolution is being implemented.  This suggests that it is also important to work on improving the resiliency in financial markets so that any shocks associated with a G-SIFI resolution are dampened rather than amplified.  Two areas of work that show promise along these lines are new funding requirements and the move to central clearing for many OTC derivatives. An important function of financial firms is to provide liquidity to the market.  However, this exposes financial firms to run risk.  Liquidity runs can be an accelerant to asset fire sales that can lead to downward price spirals where firms must sell assets to raise funds, with these sales putting more downward pressure on asset prices, leading to a renewed round of asset sales.  For solvent financial firms, protection against liquidity runs requires liquidity buffers and/or access to appropriately collateralized central bank liquidity support.  Financial firms on their own would likely choose to hold liquidity buffers that are smaller than socially optimal since these firms do not internalize the positive market externality that these liquidity buffers provide.  As a consequence, liquidity regulation is necessary to achieve the desired level of firms’ liquidity buffers. Liquidity buffer requirements are also needed to reduce the dependence of these firms on central bank lender-of-last-resort (LOLR) support.  There are several reasons this is desirable.  First, access to central bank liquidity can lead to moral hazard with respect to the behavior of financial firms.  This can be mitigated by requiring that firms with access to LOLR support hold sufficient liquidity buffers that must be used ahead of any central bank liquidity—the equivalent of liquidity “skin-in-the game.” Second, the line between illiquidity and insolvency often can become blurred, especially when markets are under stress.  Central banks are meant to provide liquidity support only to solvent firms so that the central banks avoid taking on credit risk.  An overreliance by firms on access to central bank liquidity can expose the central bank to the risk of loss.  Finally, in some cases, central bank liquidity provision can become stigmatized.  In this case, financial firms are prone to underutilize this source of liquidity—a decision that can have adverse consequences for markets and the availability of credit.  Liquidity buffers reduce the likelihood that this stigma constraint will become binding. The on-going Basel discussions have focused on a short-term liquidity requirement—the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR); and a longer-term liquidity requirement, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).  The intention of the LCR is for banks to hold sufficient high-quality, liquid assets that can be easily and quickly converted to cash to cover expected liquidity outflows in a stress scenario over a 30-day period.  Unlike illiquid assets, the conversion of these high quality liquid assets into cash should not create any fire sale dynamics.  However, it is important that banks actually use this liquidity buffer when there are liquidity outflows, rather than attempting to maintain their LCR at 100 percent by selling other assets. The OTC derivatives markets remain another important source of potential instability.  Recognizing this vulnerability, the Group of Twenty (G20) in its 2009 Pittsburgh Summit statement stipulated that all standardized derivative contracts would be moved to central clearing, and that the remaining non-standard derivatives would be subject to higher capital requirements. 2 While there will inevitably be a residual share of derivatives that do not lend themselves to standardization, authorities need to continue to work collaboratively to keep this residual share to a minimum. Why is standardization so important?  Standardization has advantages in terms of increasing transparency, price discovery and liquidity.  Standardization is also important because it allows the derivatives to be centrally cleared in a CCP.  Without central clearing, participants have bilateral credit exposures to each of their counterparties.  Moreover, they cannot fully assess their credit risk exposures in this framework since there is no information on the other derivative contracts that their counterparties have with other market participants.  Central clearing replaces this complex web with a single set of relationships between the firm and the CCP as its counterparty.  This allows for netting, so that a firm’s risk is limited to its net exposure to the central counterparty.  This both reduces risk and increases transparency.  Consequently, members of the CCP have less of an incentive to pull back in periods of stress and this makes the market more resilient. In addition, international standards on margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives have been adopted. 3 By definition, bespoke derivatives cannot be centrally cleared and so do not benefit from the risk reduction and enhanced transparency associated with central clearing.  To offset this, these derivatives will be required by regulation to have higher initial margin requirements, as well as variation margin. Despite these efforts, we still may not get the balance right in terms of the requirements applied to non-standard versus standardized, cleared contracts.  One worry is that CCPs that are shareholder-owned and operated for profit may compete for market share by offering lower margin requirements on standardized products.  This could strike the wrong balance between the private profit motive versus the public benefit of clearing.  For this reason, I believe that all CCPs need to have strong governance and regulatory oversight.  This must be harmonized on an international basis in order to prevent a potential race to the bottom. It is important to recognize that increased use of CCPs for central clearing also creates potential financial stability issues that must be addressed.  While CCPs reduce aggregate risk, they also concentrate the remaining risk.  That is, CCPs create potential single points of failure in global derivatives markets.  CCPs need adequate capacity to absorb potential losses from the default of one or more of its members, and they need to have access to liquidity so that they can always fully settle their obligations. To address this concern, in 2012, international standard setters issued a set of minimum risk management standards for financial market infrastructures including CCPs. 4 These principles, known as the “Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures” (PFMIs), require that a CCP maintain sufficient liquid resources.  This includes the requirement that a CCP have a pre-funded default arrangement and that the CCP collects initial and variation margin.  In particular, the PFMIs stipulate that a CCP must be able to withstand, in a stress environment, the failure of the member having the largest exposure to the CCP.  In some cases, this requirement is strengthened to require the ability to cover the failure of the two largest members.  The PFMIs also require the CCPs to develop effective methodologies to estimate their funding exposures, so that they can better manage their liquidity risks. Another important risk management task for CCPs is the on-boarding of new members and the monitoring of the condition of existing members.  The strength of the CCP is ultimately derived from the collective strength of its members.  The mutualization of the CCP’s net credit risk across its members creates an incentive for its members to only want well-capitalized and well-managed members as part of the CCP.  The CCP also must ensure that members are meeting their margin requirements and remain in good standing. It is also worth noting that these safeguards for CCPs will need to be put into place along with other reforms such as the use of multilateral trading platforms and trade repositories.  Seamless integration with these new trading processes is essential for CCPs to contribute to financial stability. The financial crisis also highlighted the significant gaps that existed between the data collected and the data necessary to adequately monitor developments in the global financial system.  In addition, the crisis underscored an important limitation of the current data structure: the inability to combine data effectively across jurisdictions in order to develop a comprehensive view. As a consequence, policymakers often did not have timely access to key information that would have informed both the diagnosis of emerging problems as well as the likely efficacy of proposed interventions.  As we all know, it is difficult to safely steer a fast-moving car if outward vision is impaired by a windshield that is largely obscured. In response, the G20 in April 2009 instructed the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to detail these information gaps and to develop proposals for resolving them.  The Data Gaps Initiative (DGI) was the response to carry out this important work.  The DGI set out four broad objectives: (1) Better capture the build-up of risk in the financial sector, (2) improve data on international financial network connections, (3) monitor the vulnerability of domestic economies to shocks, and (4) improve the communication of official statistics.  Across these four objectives twenty specific recommendations were developed. 5 In particular, the DGI effort included developing a centralized data center to pool relevant data for all globally systemically important banks (GSIBs). 6 Implementing the DGI agenda involves more than simply defining common data templates and retooling bank information systems to populate these templates.  Rather, what is required is a deeper cultural change in how supervisors operate and interact with each other.  This transformation takes time and involves a process of building mutual trust.  To date, a new data center has been established at the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) that is receiving data on G-SIB institution-to-institution counterparty credit exposures.  Work is underway to expand this data collection to include institution-to-institution funding dependencies, with additional work to follow on institution-to-aggregate credit and funding.  Home supervisors contributing data to the BIS data center are receiving reports based on an analysis of the pooled data.  Supporting this collaborative initiative is a multilateral framework signed by all of the participating supervisors that details confidentiality requirements, data sharing, and governance arrangements.  As this effort moves forward, the data will be available to support both enhanced micro-prudential supervision and macro-prudential supervision. More work, though, needs to be done to facilitate a comprehensive data view of the important financial markets.  As an example, an increasing number of trade repositories are collecting valuable transaction data.  However, the full benefit of these data can only be realized if we can aggregate this information across the trade repositories, and if regulators have access to the data needed to support their respective mandates. 7 The Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have produced an analysis of some of the foundational steps that need to be taken. 8 Again, implementing these steps will take time and will need our continued attention. The goal of financial stability will remain elusive so long as we have financial firms that are judged as “too big to fail.”  Some might argue that this is reason enough to break up these firms.  I do not believe that this is the best course of action.  As I have outlined here today, I prefer a multi-faceted approach that strives to: (1) minimize the risk that a large complex financial firm faces default, (2) have in place a credible resolution regime if a default becomes imminent, (3) improve the resiliency of our financial system so that any shocks resulting from a resolution are not amplified across the system, and (4) build out a global data model for effectively monitoring global financial markets.  If we can execute on these four elements, then I believe that we can retain the economic benefits from having large financial firms that support the global economy while minimizing the risks that the activities of such firms might pose to the global financial system. Thank you for your kind attention. 1 Structuring this in a way to get the incentives right is critical.  For example, one would want to be certain that in no circumstance would management see a benefit from putting the firm into resolution in order to convert its debt holdings into equity. 2 See Group of Twenty (2009) The G20 Pittsburgh Summit Leaders’ Statement . 3 See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Board of International Organization of Securities Commissions (2013) Margin Requirements for Non-Centrally Cleared Derivatives . 4 See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (2012) Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure . 5 See FSB and IMF (2009) The Financial Crisis and Information Gaps . Report to the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors. 6 FSB and IMF (2009), recommendation no. 9: “The FSB, in close consultation with the IMF, to convene relevant central banks, national supervisors, and other international financial institutions, to develop by end 2010 a common draft template for systemically important global financial institutions for the purpose of better understanding the exposures of these institutions to different financial sectors and national markets. This work should be undertaken in concert with related work on the systemic importance of financial institutions. Widespread consultation would be needed, and due account taken of confidentiality rules, before any reporting framework can be implemented .” 7 See Communique Meeting of Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Washington, DC, April 18-19, 2013 “We also call for a feasibility study on how information from trade repositories can be aggregated and shared among authorities, so as to enable comprehensive monitoring of risks to financial stability.” 8 See CPSS / IOSCO. Report on OTC Derivatives Data Repository and Aggregation Requirements . January 2012.\n\nEven if every jurisdiction were to successfully implement these types of initiatives and consequently reduce the default risks associated with their G-SIFIs, the risk of failure would not be fully eliminated.  This means there would always be some residual risk of major disruptions to financial markets due to a disorderly default of a large financial firm.  Consequently, the development and implementation of credible resolution mechanisms for G-SIFIs is the second key component of a global strategy to improve financial stability.  By credible, I mean that if the situation of an impending G-SIFI default arises, the home authorities will proceed with the resolution plan, rather than give in to pressure to intervene to prevent the failure.  This requires that the resolution mechanisms be capable of significantly mitigating the negative externalities associated with winding down a failing G-SIFI.  Although the specifics of the resolution mechanisms will necessarily vary to some extent across jurisdictions, reflecting differences in institutional structures, legal frameworks, and regulatory regimes, the goal is common—to be able to resolve any G-SIFI regardless of its home jurisdiction, even in periods of stressful financial market conditions, without taxpayer funds, in a way that minimizes knock-on effect to financial markets and other financial institutions.\n\nAs I have indicated in earlier speeches, I endorse the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) single point of entry (SPE) resolution framework for the United States.  For the SPE approach to be successful, firms subject to this resolution regime will need to have a sufficient amount of long-term debt at the parent company that the FDIC can convert into equity to guarantee that the new bridge company is adequately capitalized.  Counterparties at the subsidiary level need to be assured that they have no reason to pull back from the new bridge company.\n\nIn the international arena this type of requirement is referred to as GLAC, or “gone concern loss absorption capacity.”  The Financial Stability Board is working on a proposal for an international GLAC standard, with a target date for consideration this November. Finalizing this standard is an important to-do item.  As I discussed earlier, both the amount and the composition of additional resources are important.  The adequacy of the GLAC buffer mitigates the negative externalities from a default, while the possible use of management-held long-term debt as an element of GLAC could bolster incentives to reduce the risk of a default in the first place.\n\nThere are implementation details of the FDIC’s SPE resolution framework that still need to be worked out.  These arise from the challenge involved in operationalizing the framework with financial firms that conduct business across several jurisdictions and geographic borders.  In this international arena, one specific issue needs to be promptly addressed.  Due to parent guarantees or other cross-default provisions, the placement by the FDIC of the parent company into receivership may be treated by some counterparties as an event of default.  This could trigger the close-out of qualified financial contracts (QFCs) such as interest rate swap contracts at international subsidiaries, which could potentially be destabilizing.  To deal with this issue, the Dodd-Frank Act’s Title II one-day stay on the close-out of qualified financial contracts needs to be extended to cover contracts governed by non-U.S. law and involving non-U.S. counterparties.  Resolving this issue is important to ensuring a smooth transition to the new bridge company.\n\nAddressing the contract close-out issue can be accomplished in two ways that are not mutually exclusive.  First, existing

in other countries could be modified so that the one-day stay that applies to qualified financial contracts governed by U.S. law is also enforceable for those contracts governed by foreign law.  Either or both of these actions would help ensure that the FDIC’s SPE mechanism could be successfully executed without unduly disrupting financial markets and counterparty risk positions.\n\nGiven the cross-border activities of the G-SIFIs, the effectiveness of resolution mechanisms also will depend on the degree of coordination across national authorities.  For example, we do not know for certain how foreign authorities would react if the parent of a U.S.-based G-SIFI were placed into a Title II resolution proceeding.  Uncertainties exist regarding whether foreign authorities either might

    "text": "National Economic Conditions To provide context, let me start with a few comments about national economic conditions. As I discussed in a recent speech, the long and deep recession that ended in June 2009 has been followed by a very tepid recovery. Since June 2009, economic activity has grown—but only slowly from levels far below the productive capacity of the economy.\n\nIn recent months, the momentum of the recovery has slowed. For example, after rising at a 3.25 percent annual rate during the second half of 2009, there has been a progressive slowing—to a 2.75 percent annual rate during the first half of 2010 and, most likely, to an even slower rate when the third-quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) figures are released at the end of this month.\n\nWith demand growth barely keeping pace with firms' ability to increase productivity, job creation has been too weak to significantly reduce unemployment, which stands today at 9.6 percent. And, as is typical in such circumstances of considerable slack, the rate of inflation has declined.\n\nViewed through the lens of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate—the pursuit of the highest level of employment consistent with price stability, the current situation is wholly unsatisfactory. Given the outlook that the upturn appears likely to strengthen only gradually, it will likely be several years before employment and inflation return to levels consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.\n\nWhy are we experiencing this soft patch now? There are several reasons:\n\nInstead, we have ongoing sluggishness in two key sectors that have led past recoveries: consumer spending and housing.\n\nThe slow recovery of consumer spending and housing in the face of very substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus reflects the painful unwinding of the dynamics at work during the expansion that preceded it. Beginning around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in home prices. The rise in home prices helped to support additional demand for credit as households used the collateral represented by their homes to borrow large sums of money via home equity lines of credit and second mortgages. This also fueled a strong boom in home construction. But house price increases could not be sustained without limit. When home prices peaked and started to turn down, the dynamic linking house prices, credit and consumption went into reverse, forcing substantial adjustments on the part of the household sector and in the housing market itself.\n\nI've discussed in recent speeches the role monetary and regulatory policy can play in helping to support economic activity and in improving economic outcomes relative to what would otherwise be experienced in the absence of this support. These steps include critical reforms that make the financial system safer and accommodative monetary policy that make mortgages more affordable and make the investments that create jobs are more attractive. Today I will focus on the economic trends themselves.\n\nLet's consider first the consequences of this dynamic for consumer spending—that is, households' purchases of goods and services. Families' expenditures rose at a slow 2 percent annual rate over the first half of 2010 and (so far) this sluggishness appears to have continued in the third quarter of 2010. Families have not yet boosted their spending above the levels preceding the severe cuts they made during the recession. This frugality stands in stark contrast to the first year of recovery from previous deep recessions. Several factors are inhibiting families from spending. Many people have lost their jobs and are still unemployed, or have had their hours or pay reduced. Confidence in the economy remains quite low. And households' net worth, which fell substantially as real estate and stock prices dipped, remains well below its previous peak compared with disposable income. So, households have been saving more. The personal saving rate, which rose to 5.5 percent by the end of 2009 from a recent low of 1.2 percent in the third quarter of 2005, seems headed even higher in the third quarter. Households are \"deleveraging\"; they are paying down their debts. Of course, lenders have also reinforced this tendency as they have tightened underwriting standards for consumer credit, relative to their pre-recession standards.\n\nHave households completed their deleveraging, so they will soon spend more? Although we believe that substantial progress has been made, it is hard to tell how much further this process has to run. For example, the share of household after-tax income that families owe for servicing debts and paying for housing (including property taxes, homeowners insurance and rents) has declined sharply over the past two years and is now back to levels last seen in the late 1990s. Households have cut the total amount of debt they owe. They are also refinancing outstanding debt to take advantage of the lowest mortgage interest rates since the mid 1950s. We expect the increased rate of mortgage refinancing now in place to continue over the near term. This represents another means by which households can free up income for other uses.\n\nNow, let's consider the slow housing recovery. Housing market activity—both new construction and sales—remains depressed. On the construction side, total housing starts are running at just 600,000 units per year (seasonally-adjusted) in recent months. This is up from 530,000 units at the trough in the first quarter of 2009 but it is still extremely low by the standards of the last 50 years. In fact, the rate of new construction is so low that there is barely any net growth in the U.S. housing stock these days.\n\nOne reason why so little housing is being built is that many existing homes stand vacant. We estimate that there are roughly 3 million vacant housing units more than usual. And more vacancies are added daily as the foreclosure process moves homes from families to mortgage lenders. This stock of vacant homes will shrink when fewer are foreclosed upon and more of these homes are sold or rented out.\n\nOn the sales side, even though low mortgage interest rates and falling home prices have together boosted housing affordability to its highest level in 40 years, the current pace of sales is quite sluggish. Impediments to home sales include tight lending standards, a weak job market and continued uncertainty regarding the future path of home prices. The large decline in home prices that occurred between 2006 and 2008 is also important. This decline reduced the amount of equity that owners have in their homes, making it difficult for people to come up with the funds needed to \"trade-up\" and move into better homes.\n\nIn addition, the steep decline in home prices put many families at risk of mortgage delinquency and, ultimately, losing their homes to foreclosure. With lower home prices, many families now owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth. This means that they cannot refinance or sell their homes easily if they experience a financial crisis, such as a job loss or a serious illness. Recent developments on foreclosures have been mixed. While RealtyTrac reports that foreclosure completions in the United States exceeded 100,000 for the first time in September, it is important to remember that foreclosure is a lengthy process in most states. Our data indicate that, in recent quarters, borrowers are becoming less likely to fall behind on their mortgages, so fewer households are now entering the foreclosure process. At the same time, though, major lenders have acknowledged serious problems in the processes they have used to repossess homes and announced moratoria on new foreclosures. Taken together, these developments suggest that the situation in housing remains uncertain for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Federal Reserve actively encourages efforts to find viable alternatives to foreclosure, like loan modifications, or deeds in lieu. We also support due process and access to legal counsel for homeowners facing foreclosure, for instance through legal aid programs. At the same time, it is important that foreclosures that properly comply with state and federal law can ultimately take place, as this is a necessary part of the adjustment that will eventually return us to more normal conditions in the housing market.\n\nAt present, the extent of the documentation problem and its wider ramifications are still uncertain. In conjunction with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve is therefore seeking to establish the facts through a review of the foreclosure practices, governance and documentation at the major bank mortgage servicers. We want to ensure that the housing finance business is supported by robust back-office operations—for processing of new mortgages as well as foreclosures— so that buyers of homes and investors in mortgage securities have full confidence in the process. We are monitoring developments closely in order to evaluate any potential impact on the housing market, financial institutions and the overall economy.\n\nThe key role that housing has played during this recession and recovery makes it a timely topic for our regional economic briefing.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions (update since the July regional press briefing) Now, let me turn to regional economic conditions. Overall, the recession seems to have been less severe in much of our region than in many other parts of the country, though unemployment remains unacceptably high.\n\nAs attendees at previous Regional Press Briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces Coincident Economic Indicators to help track the performance of the regional economy. Since July, these indicators point to recovery in New York State, and particularly in New York City.\n\nAlthough New York City and New York State are recovering, elsewhere in the region, the story is different. In New Jersey, although activity is no longer declining, there has yet to be a sustained recovery. New Jersey's economy remains essentially flat. An index produced in Puerto Rico by the Government Development Bank shows that the pickup in economic activity there in late spring and early summer has retreated and activity in the past few months has again turned down.\n\nNow, let's look at jobs, which are the key for people to truly feel the recovery in their lives. I am pleased to note that private-sector jobs have continued to grow moderately across much of the region in the past few months, just as they have in the nation. Growth in private-sector jobs—which is not affected directly by hires and layoffs from the decennial census—signals that, on balance, firms are expanding their workforces to meet their business needs. While state and local government job cuts have also reduced total employment, the fact that the private sector is creating jobs is a good sign and necessary for a sustainable recovery.\n\nThe number of private-sector jobs has increased in and around New York City, in northern New Jersey and in some parts of Upstate New York. The latest job market report for New York shows a continuation of the generally rising trend of employment in the state at a pace that roughly matches the nationwide growth rate. In New York City, employment has expanded at rates substantially above the nation. Since we last met, employment in New Jersey has expanded, and while that growth has been quite modest, it is an encouraging sign. In Puerto Rico, employment reports continue to give mixed signals, showing a see-saw pattern that has yet to add up to a strong rebound.\n\nDespite these employment gains, unemployment in the region remains painfully high. In August, New York City's and New Jersey's rates were very close to the national jobless rate of 9.6 percent. The rate for New York State, which has been improving since the first quarter, is noticeably lower at 8.3 percent. Puerto Rico, which has had much higher unemployment than the mainland for the past several decades, saw a modest decline in its jobless rate, but at 15.6 percent is still showing little evidence of a recovery.\n\nRegional Housing Trends in New York and New Jersey We focus on housing at today's briefing because it represents the most important asset that many households own, provides a substantial number of high-wage jobs and is often a key driver of regional as well as national business cycles. I'll start with a key observation: During this recession, the housing sector contributed less volatility to the regional economy than it did in much of the nation. We have, of course, seen painful losses of homes, construction jobs and housing equity in New York and northern New Jersey. This pattern can be seen quite directly in the construction sector, where many jobs were created during the housing boom, but then were lost as the housing market deteriorated. However, our housing markets tend to be less influential in our economy because we are a relatively mature region. That is, we are not adding population as rapidly as some other parts of the country, so housing construction—which tends to be very cyclical—and associated purchases account for a smaller share of aggregate activity here than it does in faster growing regions. In addition, much of our region was spared the worst effects of the non-prime mortgage boom and bust. There was generally lower penetration of nonprime loans into our housing markets, and in general, our region shows better performance, with fewer delinquencies and foreclosures. This pattern was particularly true across Upstate New York. However, as can be seen on the New York Fed's U.S. Credit Conditions maps, there are significant pockets of housing distress around the greater New York City metro area, especially in communities in the Bronx, Dutchess County and Long Island. Indeed, we recently documented the severity of problems on Long Island in our Facts and Trends publication. Moreover, New Jersey had non-prime mortgage activity closer to the national average and now has more delinquencies and foreclosures than is the case for much of the region. As the uneven pattern of nonprime lending suggests, the region is hardly uniform. The housing section fared better in Upstate New York than it did in much of the region during the recession. In fact, the housing boom and bust largely bypassed Upstate New York, where construction activity is a relatively small part of the overall economy. Relative to Upstate New York, most areas in downstate New York and northern New Jersey more closely tracked the national cycle. Sales activity and home prices ramped up during the housing boom, but then dropped sharply. More recently—over the past year—home sales and prices in the region have followed different paths. Home prices have generally stabilized across upstate New York, with some parts, such as Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, even experiencing price increases over this period. However, home prices have continued to decline in the greater New York and New Jersey area. By contrast, the number of home sales have generally increased throughout the region over the past year. But the pattern has been erratic because of various policy changes. In particular, the introduction, initial expiration and subsequent extension of the home buyer tax credit introduced volatility as it boosted, slowed and then boosted sales again. With the final expiration of this tax credit, the recent rise in home sales across New York and northern New Jersey may well be short-lived. Regional Housing Trends: Focus on New York City I'll end with a few remarks about New York City's housing market—a very large market that stands out as unique in many respects. Let me remind you of some of these key differences: Compared with the rest of the region, and with the rest of the country, New York City has an exceptionally large share of rental housing: 67 percent of homes citywide versus 33 percent for the United States. The market is dominated by multi-family structures, especially in Manhattan and the Bronx. When these units are owner-occupied, they are more likely to be co-ops than condominiums, and, thus, to have comparatively low leverage rates. New York City has very high housing prices and long construction lags. Since the number of homes cannot adjust quickly, rising demand during a boom typically leads to rapid rises in prices and unregulated rents. Eventually, of course, the amount of housing supplied responds to changes in demand. So, how did the economic expansion and contraction affect New York City's housing market? For a mature city, the city saw an unusually strong boom in housing sales, construction and prices. This expansion actually began in 1996 and continued even in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack. Since 2007, however, New York City's market has turned down. This decline started later than the nation's and prices have fallen less sharply. Now, prices appear to have stabilized. This pattern can also be seen in Manhattan's rental market. After a long period of rising rents, the market weakened substantially from 2007 to 2009, and rents have rebounded moderately in 2010. New York City has not been spared from the high rates of mortgage delinquencies characteristic of this recession. Manhattan's delinquency rates are elevated although they remain markedly below the national average. By contrast, pockets of distress are much more prevalent in the outer boroughs, all of which have delinquency rates, per owner-occupied unit, above the national average. The relatively mild recession and the recovery in the City are lending support to both home prices and sales. Also positive, compared with the rest of the country, are the City's low mortgage leverage rates and a low share of homes with underwater mortgages. Nevertheless, several risks to home prices in the City remain. These risks include the ongoing completion of a considerable number of new apartment buildings—ones that were started at the end of the boom. Another risk comes from the slow pace of job growth in high-pay sectors (including the securities industry) in New York City. Finally, during the boom, prices rose substantially faster than rents. Going forward, this disparity could exert downward pressure on home prices as renting has become a more affordable alternative. Conclusion In sum, after a recession that was milder than in many parts of the country, the region is showing signs of a modest recovery in New York, but little growth elsewhere. The housing sector played a pivotal role in the recent national downturn. In the region, the fact that housing activity has a smaller weight in the regional economy helped to limit the recession's impact on many communities. Going forward, given housing's significance to the well-being of people in our region and beyond, the New York Fed will continue to focus on the sector as we monitor regional and national economic conditions. Thank you for your kind attention. I will now ask James Orr to provide more details on current regional economic conditions.\n\nRegional Housing Trends in New York and New Jersey We focus on housing at today's briefing because it represents the most important asset that many households own, provides a substantial number of high-wage jobs and is often a key driver of regional as well as national business cycles.\n\nI'll start with a key observation: During this recession, the housing sector contributed less volatility to the regional economy than it did in much of the nation.

    "text": "Thank you for having me here to speak today.  As you all know from daily experience, the financial system plays an essential role in modern economies.  Because financial intermediation is critical to economic activity, disruption to it can cause severe damage to the economy.  The experience of recent years revealed serious flaws in the system.  Risk was mispriced and there was a build-up of excesses before the crisis.  Structural weaknesses in the financial system then amplified the effect of the bursting of the bubble in U.S. house prices, and the result was a widespread financial crisis.\n\nOne critical factor was the extensive use of short-term wholesale funding in the years leading up to the crisis.  Not only did this aspect of our financial system create the potential for a firm to fail in an extraordinarily rapid manner when faced with a loss of market confidence, but it also served as a channel through which the effects of those failures were widely propagated throughout the broader financial system.\n\nAlthough much has been done over the past few years to mitigate the structural flaws that make wholesale funding a point of weakness in the global financial system, some important issues and vulnerabilities remain.  I will focus my remarks today on some of those vulnerabilities—including the areas of tri-party repo and money market mutual funds markets—and discuss what could be done to make wholesale funding markets more stable. 1\n\nI will also consider the larger issue of the appropriate role of wholesale funding in the financial system.  How comfortable should we be with a system in which critical financial activities continue to be financed with short-term wholesale funding without the safeguards necessary to reduce the risk of runs and the fire sales of assets that can threaten the stability of the entire financial system?\n\nAs always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWholesale funding as a structural vulnerability As this audience knows, in the two decades before the financial crisis, the global financial system underwent rapid transformation.  During this period, there was a shift from bank-based financial intermediation to capital markets-based financial intermediation, 2 and an increase in the scale and complexity of securitization activities.\n\nIn the pre-crisis period the growth of securitization was accompanied by a growing reliance on short-term funds raised in wholesale markets to finance securities and activities essential to securitization.  This ranged from the use of repo 3 funding to finance inventories of securities held for market-making 4 purposes to the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper by conduits 5 created to acquire and hold securities.\n\nThe increased use of short-term wholesale finance was driven both by demand and supply factors.  On the demand side, it was more profitable to use shorter-term funds to finance longer-term assets.  On the supply side, such funding was plentiful because it was viewed as safe and because of the growing institutionalization of savings with corporations and institutional investors in need of deposit-like products in which to place their cash balances.   After all, the funds were only exposed for a short period of time, and in the case of repo, secured by collateral.\n\nThe growing reliance on short-term wholesale funding to finance longer-term assets increased liquidity and maturity mismatch risk.  This was particularly dangerous because many of the assets being financed were structured-credit products, some of which were opaque, difficult to value and illiquid.\n\nShort-term funding of longer-term assets is inherently unstable particularly in the presence of information and coordination problems.  It can be rational for a provider of funds to supply funds on a short-term basis, reasoning that it can exit if there is any uncertainty over the firm’s continued ability to roll over its funding from other sources. But if the use of short-term funding becomes sufficiently widespread, the firm’s roll-over risk increases.  In this situation, there is a strong incentive for each lender to “run” if there is any uncertainty that could undermine the borrower’s ability to continue to roll over its funding from other sources.  This is the case even if the provider of funds believes that the borrower would remain solvent as long as it retained access to funding on normal terms.\n\nOf course, this insight is not a new one.  Prior to the establishment of a lender of last resort and retail deposit insurance for banks—which came with the quid pro quo of prudential regulation—bank runs were a regular and disruptive feature of our financial system.  These innovations solved the coordination problem and stabilized this source of funding.\n\nWhat was new prior to the crisis was the extent to which maturity transformation and financial intermediation began to take place outside of commercial banks.  This activity occurred largely without the types of safeguards—robust prudential regulation, deposit insurance, lender of last resort—that have safeguarded the commercial banking system from the types of widespread panics and runs that are capable of destabilizing the entire financial system.  The risk created by this gap in coverage was not well recognized by regulators or the private sector.  Market participants had little incentive to internalize the negative externality of run-risk created by their collective choice of finance and made erroneous assumptions about the liquidity of asset markets and the capacity and willingness of banks to distribute central bank liquidity to the wider financial system during periods of stress.\n\nBecause the boom years resulted in strong earnings, low price volatility and few credit losses, firms were able to operate at extreme levels of leverage.  When the housing bubble started to deflate, the vulnerabilities of this type of business model soon became apparent.\n\nHeavy reliance on short-term wholesale funding exposed the system to a series of intertwined downward spirals in asset and funding markets.  This spread in waves, beginning in the market for asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) issued by off-balance-sheet conduits, and spreading via auction-rate securities, to the repo, money market and financial commercial paper markets that formed the core financing for market-based financial intermediation.\n\nInitial declines in asset prices forced leveraged holders with maturity mismatches to sell assets.  This increased price volatility and reduced the value of the assets that collateralized other firms’ borrowings.  Higher volatility led banks and secured lenders to raise margins, while concern about counterparty risk and their own funding needs made banks reluctant to on-lend liquidity.\n\nHigher margins on repo and increased collateral calls due to credit ratings downgrades reduced the quantity of assets that could be financed in repo markets and elsewhere, prompting further asset sales. 6 As wholesale investors started to exit, this set in motion a bad dynamic—a fire sale of assets that cut into earnings and capital.  This just increased the incentives of investors to run and for banks to hoard liquidity against the risk that they could themselves face a run.  This downward spiral of fire sales and funding runs was a key feature of the financial crisis.\n\nSpecific institutional weaknesses The fragility of short-term wholesale funding was greatly aggravated by certain critical institutional shortcomings in these markets, particularly in the structure of the tri-party repo system and the U.S. money market mutual fund business.\n\nThrough the tri-party repo market, the two large clearing banks were providing a large amount of intraday credit to securities firms each day to facilitate the daily “unwind” of the prior day’s transactions. 7 In the run-up to the crisis, the daily “unwind” practice helped make tri-party repo look like a very liquid investment while still being an apparently highly durable source of funding.  This masked the underlying risks and contributed to weak risk management practices.\n\nAs the concerns about the U.S. housing market escalated in 2007, participants in the tri-party repo market became increasingly concerned about the liquidity and credit risks that they faced.  The clearing banks became uncomfortable with their large intraday exposures to their tri-party securities firm customers.  After all, if a securities firm were to fail suddenly, the clearing banks could be stuck with huge loans to these counterparties, secured by securities that were not necessarily high quality and liquid.   Thus, as the condition of the most troubled securities firms deteriorated, there was a risk that one morning a clearing bank might decide not to unwind a firm’s tri-party transactions in order to avoid a large intraday exposure.\n\nThis risk faced by the clearing banks, in turn, unnerved the tri-party repo investors.  After all, if the unwind did not occur, they would be stuck with the collateral securing their loans from the night before.  Most of these investors were not prepared to take possession of and liquidate such collateral, and had no interest in doing so.  The incentives for these investors were to run at the first sign of trouble to avoid getting stuck with the dealer’s collateral.\n\nThis incentive to run was reinforced by the fact that if the investors were stuck with the collateral, they would have strong incentives to sell it quickly in order to generate the liquidity needed to meet redemption calls or to keep their portfolios in line with regulatory guidelines.  Such “fire sales” of assets could result in losses and could be extremely destabilizing to markets.\n\nThe crisis also made it clear that the monies provided to the money market mutual funds by their own investors were also inherently unstable.  This made such funds, in turn, an unreliable source of finance in repo, commercial paper and other markets.  Investors in a fixed net asset value (NAV) money market fund could take their money out on a daily basis at par value, with no redemption penalty.   This could occur even if the money market fund did not have sufficient cash or liquid assets that it could easily sell to meet all potential redemptions.  This created an incentive for investors to be the first to get out whenever there was any uncertainty over the underlying value of the assets in the fund.  By being first in line, they could exit while the fund could still repay at par, leaving others to bear any losses.  The longer the investor waited, the greater the risk that the fund would be forced into the fire sale of assets to meet redemptions and end up “breaking the buck.”\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury and others took a series of actions to contain the spiral of funding runs and asset fire sales.  First, the traditional lender of last resort function was strengthened through the introduction of the Term Auction Facility (TAF) and foreign exchange swaps with foreign central banks.\n\nThen, as the crisis intensified, lender of last resort liquidity provision was extended to directly backstop key wholesale funding markets and opened to certain nonbank firms.  The Federal Reserve created a direct backstop to the tri-party repo system through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF).  When the Reserve Fund broke the buck after the failure of Lehman Brothers, precipitating a run on money market mutual funds, the Treasury guaranteed money market fund assets and the Fed introduced the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidation Facility (AMLF).  The Fed also backstopped the commercial paper market (formerly funded in large part by money market mutual funds) by introducing the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF).  When wholesale funding for non-residential mortgage securitizations evaporated, the Fed rolled out the Term Asset-Backed Lending Facility (TALF).\n\nThese actions ultimately stabilized funding markets and crowded back in private funds.  But, they were an emergency response, not a sustainable, long-term solution.  After all, because most of the special Fed liquidity facilities were authorized under Section 13.3 of the Federal Reserve Act  they were required to be temporary in nature and end when times were no longer “unusual and exigent.”\n\nStatus of reforms Since the crisis, a number of steps have been taken that reduce the vulnerability of the system to funding runs in short-term wholesale markets.  Capital and liquidity requirements for large complex financial institutions have been raised sharply, the largest broker-dealers have become part of bank holding companies subject to additional regulation, and risk-weights on assets have been adjusted to better capture risks and to reduce the scope for regulatory capital arbitrage by banks.\n\nHigher capital levels for bank holding companies reduce the incentive for providers of funds to run from these firms at the first sign of trouble.  Higher liquidity buffers 8 also help so that banks do not have to sell illiquid assets at the first signs of funding difficulties.  This reduces the fire sale risk: that the sale of illiquid assets will depress asset values, potentially turning a solvent firm into an insolvent one.\n\nMeanwhile, the New York Fed has led a Federal Reserve effort to make the tri-party repo system more resilient to stress.  In particular, the Fed has pressed the two large clearing banks to make changes to their settlement processes that will diminish their own intraday exposure and enable the market to operate with much less reliance on intraday credit. 9 These efforts are starting to bear fruit: the share of trading activity that requires intraday credit extensions by clearing banks has declined from 100 percent before November 2012 to approximately 80 percent currently, and is expected to fall to 10 percent by the end of next year. 10\n\nReducing the market’s dependency on intraday credit will make the market more resilient to future stress events, by forcing all participants to consider the credit and liquidity risks they are exposed to.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2010, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) tightened the liquidity requirements and concentration limit rules for 2a-7 money market mutual funds and increased the fund manager disclosure requirements.  These changes, which were intended as a first step, make money funds somewhat less risky.  But, they do little to reduce investors’ incentives to run at the first sign of trouble.\n\nWorthwhile as the steps taken thus far are, we have not come close to fixing all the institutional flaws in our wholesale funding markets.  The tri-party repo system and the money fund industry that plays a crucial role financing collateral through it are both still exposed to runs.  In fact, in each of these areas, one could argue that the risks have increased compared to prior to the crisis.  That is because the Dodd-Frank Act raised the hurdle for the Federal Reserve to exercise its Section 13.3 emergency lending authority and because Congress has explicitly precluded the U.S. Treasury from guaranteeing money market mutual fund assets in the future.   With extraordinary interventions ruled out or made much more difficult, this may cause investors to be even more skittish in the future.  This is why it is essential to make the system more stable.\n\nTurning first to the issue of tri-party repo reform, there is still considerable work to do.  In particular, the risk that investors will run at the first sign of trouble persists.  That is because the costs of running are very low relative to the potential costs of staying put.  The potential costs of staying are elevated in part because investors often don’t have the capacity to take possession of the collateral or liquidate the collateral in an orderly way should a large dealer fail.  Both aspects result in run risk, fire sale risk and potential financial instability. Let me be clear.  We must deal with the fire sale issue in tri-party repo and the heightened run risk it creates.  I believe there are three potential ways forward, all of which are superior to the status quo.   First, tri-party repo transactions could be restricted to open market operations (OMO) eligible collateral. 11 Such collateral would likely remain quite liquid during a time of crisis. 12 In addition, such collateral could, in a crisis, potentially be passed directly by a broker-dealer to the discount window under Section 13.13 authority, or, because of beneficial treatment under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, be financed by a banking affiliate that would then itself borrow at the discount window.  Thus, one could construct an effective lender of last resort backstop for an OMO-eligible- only tri-party repo system.\n\nHowever, there are also some significant disadvantages to such an approach.  The less liquid collateral could just migrate to be financed elsewhere, with associated run and fire sale risks.  Also, given that housing finance reform could cause the agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be replaced by something different that was not OMO eligible under the Federal Reserve Act, the share of assets that are OMO eligible could diminish over time.  Finally, this approach would do little to mitigate the risk of fire sales of a defaulted dealer’s collateral by its investors once a dealer is bankrupt.\n\nThe second option is to have a mechanism or process to facilitate the orderly liquidation of a defaulted dealer’s collateral.  One could imagine a mechanism that was funded by tri-party repo market participants and potentially backstopped by the central bank.  This would have the advantage of dealing with the entire tri-party repo market and not artificially favoring one type of collateral over another.  It would also push against the underpricing of liquidity and credit risk during good times by forcing market participants to pay for the costs of a liquidation facility up front.\n\nBecause no single market participant has a strong incentive to develop such a mechanism, however, sustained regulatory pressure may be required to reach such a solution.  From the perspective of the tri-party repo borrowers and investors, the status quo undoubtedly is viewed as superior because neither group is forced to fully bear the externalities associated with their actions.  Instead they anticipate that emergency liquidity would be made available in the event of a future systemic crisis. Third, if borrowers and investors did not embrace an orderly collateral liquidation mechanism, supervisory oversight could be brought to bear to limit the use of tri-party repo funding on the grounds that it is still an unstable source of funds.  For example, the use of tri-party repo could be restricted unless borrowers demonstrated that there was an adequate means of orderly collateral liquidation upon the failure of a major dealer.\n\nTurning next to the issue of money market mutual funds, further reform to directly address the incentive for investors to run is essential for financial stability. In November, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) put out for comment three alternative paths forward: 13\n\n1. Moving to a floating net asset value (NAV). 2. Retaining a stable NAV, but adding a new NAV buffer and a minimum balance requirement.  The minimum balance would be at risk for 30 days following withdrawals.  If the fund subsequently “broke the buck” during this period by suffering losses greater than the size of its NAV buffer, the minimum balance would be first in line to absorb these losses. 3. A larger NAV buffer than in the second alternative, but without a minimum balance at risk buffer.\n\nI have stated my views on money fund reform before. 14 Although any of these proposals—depending on the fine print of course—would likely be an improvement over the status quo, the first and third proposals don’t fully eliminate the incentives to run.  In the case of a floating rate NAV, fund managers faced with large redemption requests typically sell their most liquid assets first, leaving the remaining investors with a riskier, less-liquid portfolio and a greater risk of loss. Similarly, with a stable NAV and a capital buffer, unless the capital buffer were very large, there would still be an incentive to run because the buffer might not prove large enough to shield the investor from loss. Because the second option is the only one that actually creates a disincentive to run, as I stated before the FSOC proposal, I view it as the best one for financial stability purposes.  The requirement that investors who withdraw funds must maintain a small balance for a short period to absorb near-term losses would deter investors from pulling out at the first glimpse of trouble and make the system safer.  The modest withdrawal restrictions, which create a “minimum balance at risk,” might be set at 5 cents on the dollar, based on the high-water mark of recent holdings, with more favorable treatment for small retail investors. 15\n\nA minimum balance at risk of loss would also increase market discipline. Corporations and other sophisticated investors would have an incentive to monitor risk-taking more carefully, rather than rely on their ability to get out ahead of small retail investors when trouble materializes.\n\nThe larger question Reforming the tri-party repo system and the money market mutual fund industry is essential and would make the financial system significantly more stable. But even after such reforms, we would still have a system in which a very significant share of financial intermediation activity vital to the economy takes place in markets and through institutions that have no direct access to an effective lender of last resort backstop. 16\n\nThe financial crisis clearly demonstrated that we can no longer assume that in periods of stress banks will be willing to access lender of last resort loans and on-lend to the nonbank financial sector at sufficient scale to stabilize the system of market-based financial intermediation, as happened in earlier periods such as the commercial paper crisis in the mid-1970s.\n\nThe financing needs outside the commercial banks may be too large relative to the capacity of the banking system, banks may be reluctant to lend to competitors, be concerned about their own liquidity and funding needs, or simply be deterred by elevated counterparty risk. We need to consider whether our current architecture is satisfactory.   If we were to decide that the existing state of affairs is not acceptable in financial stability terms, there are two broad paths we could follow.\n\nThe first option would be to take steps to curtail the extent of short-term wholesale finance in the system.  In principle, regulators across a broader set of institutions and markets could take steps to directly limit the use of short-term wholesale funding to finance longer-term assets, and take actions that reduced the amount of maturity transformation associated with securitization markets.  In other words, regulators could require that a greater proportion of market-based finance be funded by longer-term debt.  Alternatively, additional legislation or regulatory changes could be implemented to reduce the volume of wholesale-funded, capital markets activities.\n\nIt is also true that some of the measures under debate in the area of limiting the scope of activity or the scale of certain financial institutions, three of which were explored by  my colleague Federal Reserve Governor Dan Tarullo in a recent speech, would likely have the effect of reducing the use of short-term wholesale funding relative to the current status quo. 17 For example, if regulators were to cap the size of a bank’s overall liabilities relative to gross domestic product (GDP) not only would this have the effect  of capping the size of individual firms, but it also would likely limit the use of short-term wholesale funding by the largest institutions.\n\nThe other path would be to expand the range of financial intermediation activity that is directly backstopped by the central bank’s lender of last resort function. This expanded range could be defined either in terms of access by the types of firms that are systemically important in market-based finance, or by types of activity or assets.\n\nIt is worth pausing here to review in a little more detail the two key functions performed by a lender of last resort.  The first function is to provide a precautionary backstop:  to reduce the risk of a financial panic beginning in the first place by ensuring that collateral can always be financed. 18 The first function is important because it makes it less likely that investors will back away from firms because they think others perceive an elevated risk of insolvency, even if they themselves do not share this view. Thus, a lender of last resort facility can reduce the risk of financial instability due to coordination problems even if the lender of last resort is not utilized. 19 In contrast, an emergency facility is unlikely to be as effective.  There will be uncertainty around whether it will be deployed, whether it will arrive in time, and how broad it will be.\n\nThe second function of a lender of last resort is to prevent the fire sale of assets by firms facing a sudden loss of funding from spreading contagion across the system and disrupting the provision of credit to the economy.  This is particularly important during a financial panic, when the demand for liquidity increases sharply.  Only the central bank has the ability to meet this increased demand under any potential circumstances.\n\nWe have banking activity—maturity transformation—taking place today outside commercial banks.   If we believe these activities provide essential credit intermediation services to the real economy that could not be easily replaced by other forms of intermediation, then the same logic that leads us to backstop commercial banking with a lender of last resort might lead us to backstop the banking activity taking place in the markets in a similar way.\n\nHowever, any expansion of access to a lender of last resort would require legislation and it would be essential to have the right quid pro quo—the commensurate expansion in the scope of prudential oversight.  Substantial prudential regulation of entities—such as broker-dealers 20 —that might gain access to an expanded lender of last resort would be required to mitigate moral hazard problems.  For example, firms might take less care in managing liquidity and capital if they know they have a lender of last resort backstop and be subject to less counterparty and creditor discipline.  In addition, the fact that an institution has access to a lender of last resort facility has value to the institution, even if that institution never taps the facility.  Thus, without a corresponding imposition of offsetting obligations and costs, the granting of access would create a significant competitive advantage.\n\nExtension of discount window-type access to a set of nonbank institutions would therefore have to go hand-in-hand with prudential regulation of these institutions.   Many thorny issues would have to be resolved.   For example, who would have access and on what terms and conditions? How would foreign-owned broker-dealers be treated?  Would an insurance-type payment be appropriate for firms that enjoyed lender of last resort access but did not have insured deposits?  How would the Fed’s role, as the lender of last resort, be coordinated with the oversight responsibilities of the primary regulators?\n\nConclusion Which path to go down—limit wholesale funding or backstop it more broadly—would depend in large part on the social value of the capital markets-based activities presently being financed in unstable short-term wholesale markets and the utility of short-term wholesale funding for lenders.\n\nOf course, the choice might not be as black and white as this.  Some activities undertaken by securities firms or other nonbank entities presumably are much more socially useful than others.  In this case, legislators might deem that certain classes of securities firms should be granted access to a lender of last resort facility, but restricted in the scope of their permitted activities to those that do clearly create social value.\n\nThe sheer size of banking functions undertaken outside commercial banking entities—even now, after the crisis—suggests that this issue must not be ignored.  I don’t think we should be comfortable with a situation in which extensive maturity transformation continues to take place without the appropriate safeguards against runs and fire sales.  Pretending the problem does not exist, or dealing with it only ex post through emergency facilities cannot be consistent with our financial stability objectives.\n\nThe issue of the social value created by market-based financial intermediation and appropriate scope and terms associated with a lender of last resort function are complex ones that require further study and analysis.  However, regardless of where we come out on these questions, we must make the basic structure of the wholesale funding market as sound as possible.  Thus, we must push ahead with tri-party and money fund reform.\n\nThank you for your attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 I note that the set of issues relating to wholesale funding are closely related to the challenge of ending ”too big to fail” I discussed in a November 15, 2012, speech (see www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2012/dud121115.html). The more stable the sources of funding, the more resilient each firm would be, and the less the failure of any one firm would disrupt the provision of credit to the economy.\n\n2 Banking groups retained a prominent role in credit supply via nonbank affiliates outside the commercial bank.\n\n3 A repo is a sale of securities coupled with an agreement to repurchase the securities at a specified price on a later date.\n\n4 Market makers are institutions such as securities brokers and dealers that buy and sell securities on behalf of customers. Market making accommodates the asynchronous arrival of sellers and buyers, thus providing liquidity to financial markets.\n\n5 Conduits are bankruptcy-remote, special purpose vehicles that fund pools of securities in short-term funding markets. The securities might consist of loans, mortgages, receivables and securitized products such as asset-backed securities (ABS). The securities in asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits serve as collateral for the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper, while repo conduits fund in the repo market. Most conduits are so-called single-seller conduits that only serve individual banks or finance companies. Multi-seller conduits provide funding for asset pools of multiple institutions. Conduits are backed by credit lines from commercial banks, which allow the conduits to have a credit rating. Asset-backed commercial paper conduits are also defined in \"Shadow Banking: A Review of the Literature.\" Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, no. 580, (October) 2011. www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr580.pdf.\n\n6 The problem was particularly acute for those firms with large securities trading and over-the-counter derivative businesses operated outside of depository institutions. In the United States, even those securities firms that were part of bank holding companies were vulnerable because Section 23A restrictions in the Federal Reserve Act that govern transactions between the bank and the nonbank affiliates as part of a bank holding company complex sharply limited what assets the securities firm could pass through to the bank and on to the Fed’s discount window facility.\n\n7 In the unwind, cash was transmitted back from securities firms to wholesale investors each morning, to hopefully be reinvested and returned back to the securities firms by the end of the day to finance their inventories of securities.\n\n8 The new global liquidity standards adopted by the Basel Committee provide a global minimum standard.\n\n9 At the end of 2011, the New York Fed disbanded a private-sector taskforce that had generated some good ideas but was running into trouble on implementation, and adopted a supervisory approach to pushing forward further reform.\n\n10 These estimates are based on data from the clearing banks with analysis by New York Fed staff.\n\n11 OMO eligible is collateral that the Fed can purchase or repo in its open market operations.\n\n12 In addition, because the Federal Reserve is authorized to intervene in the Treasury, agency debt, and agency MBS markets, it could act to stabilize these markets during times of stress. This would make it easier to liquidate such collateral without unduly depressing prices.\n\n13 Financial Stability Oversight Council. 2012. \"Proposed Recommendations Regarding Money Market Mutual Fund Reform.\" (November). http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Proposed%20Recommendations%20Regarding% 20Money%20Market%20Mutual%20Fund%20Reform%20-%20November%2013,%202012.pdf\n\n14 See William C. Dudley. 2012. \"For Stability’s Sake, Reform Money Funds.\" www.bloomberg.com, August 14. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-14/for-stability-s-sake-reform-money-funds.html.\n\n15 For a more detailed discussion, see “The Minimum Balance at Risk: A Proposal to Mitigate the Systemic Risks Posed by Money Market”. www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr564.pdf\n\n16 Although the largest stand-alone securities firms adopted bank holding company status during the crisis, their non-depository institution arms do not have access to the discount window backstop because Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act restricts the ability of the holding company to transfer assets from the non-depository institution to the commercial bank affiliate that has access to the discount window.\n\n17 See Daniel K. Tarullo. 2012. \"Industry Structure and Systemic Risk Regulation.\" December 4. http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20121204a.htm. In this speech, he explores three policy proposals: (1) breaking up large financial institutions by reinstating Glass-Steagall restrictions or by imposing other prohibitions on affiliations of commercial banks with certain business lines; (2) placing a cap on the nondeposit liabilities of financial institutions; and (3) requiring financial institutions above a specified size to hold minimum amounts of long-term debt available for conversion to equity to avoid or facilitate an orderly resolution of a troubled firm\n\n18 A lender of last resort finances with an appropriate haircut.\n\n19 This was demonstrated recently by the European Central Bank’s Outright Monetary Transactions program\n\n20 Several of the largest broker-dealers adopted bank holding company status in recent years, but Section 23A rules restrict the capacity of their banking subsidiaries to channel liquidity to their broker-dealer operations.",

    "text": "Welcome to the New York Fed and to a discussion of how culture and conduct might be improved within the financial services industry.  I am pleased to see all of you here today—there is tremendous breadth of experience and responsibility within this room.  We need to take full advantage of this opportunity. I encourage all participants to be candid and on-point, because the task of reforming culture is formidable. 1\n\nUntrustworthy behavior on the scale that we have witnessed in financial services does not arise in a vacuum.  Social science research makes it clear that context largely drives conduct. 2 This is not a new insight.  Adam Smith observed centuries ago that, independent of personal sentiment, we often behave according to what we “[see are] the established rules of behavior.” 3 We observe the activity around us, assess the norms of conduct and generally adapt to those norms in our own behaviors.\n\nBanking is not exempt from this universal propensity.  Gerry Corrigan noted three decades ago that the “implicit codes of conduct” that govern banker behavior exist apart from “explicit regulations.”  He posited that these implicit codes must align with the public good—an obligation that banks owe in exchange for the benefits “uniquely available to [that]particular class of institutions.” 4 This, in Corrigan’s view, was what made banks “special”—the reciprocal benefits and responsibilities that support and constrain an industry essential to public well-being.\n\nCorrigan’s premise is not an antique concept from a bygone era of banking.  Then, as now, there are public purposes of banking—including financial intermediation, corporate valuation, facilitating investment opportunities, providing credit and creating market liquidity.  These activities underpin the economy and financial stability.  Reciprocity—in other words, the expectation of a quid pro quo in the relationship between society and the financial services industry—is the basis of public trust in financial institutions.  There is, however, a widespread sense that this principle has been compromised.\n\nIndustry Responsibility\n\nTwo years ago, I noted that recent scandals in banking evidenced “deep-seated cultural and ethical failures.” 5 Many of the industry’s leaders now agree.  According to the Federal Advisory Council of the Federal Reserve System, a group composed of senior representatives from the industry, “as often as not [...] the challenges faced in recent years have been behavioral and cultural; post-crisis episodes such as LIBOR and foreign exchange manipulation provide hard evidence that there remains work to be done.” 6\n\nLast year I argued that “the solution [to cultural problems] needs to originate from within the firms, from their leaders.” 7 I view today’s workshop as a progress report on the industry’s efforts.  This is an opportunity for us to discuss collectively what is working, what is not, and the next steps that are needed.\n\nWe should take care, though, not to confuse cause and effect.  The banking scandals that followed the financial crisis are evidence that something fundamental is wrong.  I would encourage each of you to consider not just specific examples of misconduct, but the patterns within them that point to underlying causes.  I suspect we will see a strong overlap with those factors that contributed to the financial crisis.  I think your focus should be less on the search for bad apples and more on how to improve the apple barrels.\n\nRole of the Official Sector\n\nDodd-Frank strengthened bank balance sheets, and banks have become more resilient to systemic shocks.  This is a positive development.  At the same time, it is also important to mitigate the sources of systemic shocks. Dodd-Frank apparently did little to curb misconduct—a possible source of systemic risk.  If the people managing capital cushions and liquidity buffers view these tools as sufficient mitigants for the costs of misconduct, or if powerful incentives encourage workarounds of the new regulations, then the connection between post-crisis reforms and greater financial stability becomes threatened.\n\nIn the last year, we have seen emerging approaches to supervision that aim to address culture, conduct and governance.  These methods are being developed in a number of jurisdictions. 8 I am pleased to welcome representatives of 15 foreign supervisors and other official sector agencies who are joining the many representatives of U.S. supervisory and regulatory agencies here today.  The topic of culture and conduct has truly become a global dialogue.  We have a lot to learn from each other.\n\nOne question on the minds of many in the official sector is, “what is the most effective way to promote reform?”  Sharing ideas on leading practices, challenges and the opportunities for industry collaboration is a start—but it is not the end.  Financial firms need to act on this information, and the official sector should hold institutions accountable for demonstrating sustained, observable progress.\n\nOverview of Agenda\n\nLet me now give a brief overview of today’s agenda.  The first panel will present the Group of Thirty’s recent report on banking conduct and culture, which calls for fundamental and sustained change.  As you all know, the Group of Thirty is a forum consisting of senior public officials and private sector bankers.  Its purpose is to facilitate non-partisan discussion of issues that threaten global economic stability and economic progress.  It speaks volumes that the Group has focused its work in recent years on effective governance, the role of supervision, and on conduct and culture.\n\nEach of the four remaining panels will address one aspect of the multidimensional nature of cultural change.\n\nOur keynote speaker today is Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund.  Christine Lagarde has been outspoken in her view that “financial leaders [must] take values as seriously as valuation, culture as seriously as capital.” 9 This makes abundant sense to me—culture and capital each promote financial stability.  Thank you for joining us.  I am also grateful to Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman of the Board of Governors, who will speak with Christine Lagarde following her remarks.\n\nPlease join me in welcoming Christine Lagarde.\n\n1 What I have to say today represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.

    "text": "National Economic Conditions The statement issued by the FOMC earlier this week presents a sober assessment of the state of the U.S. economy. Economic growth so far in 2011 has been quite a bit slower than we expected earlier in the year. While jobs growth picked up early in the year, in the last few months conditions in the labor market have deteriorated again and the unemployment rate edged up. Household spending has flattened out, and the housing sector is depressed. Business investment in equipment and software is expanding, but investment in corporate office and other commercial buildings is weak.\n\nSome of the weakness in economic activity in the first half of the year was due to temporary factors such as the hit to household income from higher food and energy prices, and supply chain disruptions following the tragic earthquake in Japan. These restraining forces have abated and thus, we should see stronger growth in the second half. But it is clear that not all of the weakness was due to these one-time factors—and in light of this, I have revised down my expectations for the pace of recovery going forward.\n\nOn the inflation front, the committee noted that inflation has moderated recently as energy and commodity prices have declined from their peaks—having picked up earlier in the year, mainly reflecting higher prices for commodities and imported goods, as well as the supply disruptions from Japan. Longer-term inflation expectations remain stable, and the committee now expects inflation to settle over the coming quarters at levels at or below those consistent with our mandate to promote full employment and price stability.\n\nIn light of the current outlook, the FOMC in its statement noted that we now anticipate that we are likely to keep short-term interest rates exceptionally low at least through mid-2013. We also discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. Further details on the discussion at the meeting will be available when the minutes are published in three weeks time. I will not comment on monetary policy any further today.\n\nFollowing the release of the FOMC's statement, market interest rates generally moved lower, which should help provide some additional support for economic activity and jobs. I would note, however, that conditions remain unsettled and the equity market in particular remains very volatile.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions Turning to our region, the economic recovery continues to be slow, although much of the region is performing reasonably well compared with the nation as a whole.\n\nTo frame our current situation, let me put this recession and recovery in the context of previous cycles. While this recession lasted longest, caused the deepest job losses, and has shown the slowest employment recovery of any post-war recession for the United States, it has not been the worst on record for the region.\n\nNew York State sustained fewer severe job losses than the nation during the recent recession—a reversal of historical patterns. Upstate New York, which has struggled with sluggish economic growth in recent decades, has proven particularly stable. In fact, while job losses were quite severe during previous recessions, that was not the case this time around. Similarly, New York City's job losses were more moderate than in previous recessions. New Jersey, on the other hand, saw steeper jobs losses than New York and a more tepid recovery. Puerto Rico endured a serious downturn lasting for over five years and is now just beginning to show signs of stabilization.\n\nWhy was the downturn in our region less severe than in many other parts of the country? Part of the reason is that the effects of the housing boom and bust on the region's economy were less consequential. Of course, we have seen declines in construction employment, losses of housing equity and people losing their homes. However, as in most mature regions, the housing market tends to be less influential here than it is in parts of the country where population growth has been more rapid. This is particularly true across much of Upstate New York, which experienced little in the way of a construction boom, home price growth or subprime mortgage penetration. While many areas in downstate New York and northern New Jersey did experience a more significant boom and bust, the changes there were not on the same scale as in hard-hit states, such as Nevada, Arizona or Florida.\n\nAlso, while the financial crisis was a key driving force behind the recession, employment in New York City was not affected nearly as much as some had predicted. Instead, it turned out that the finance sector held up better than expected.\n\nThe pace of recovery in our region, though somewhat stronger than at the national level, has nonetheless been disappointing. Growth has been weak and the unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high. This slow pace of recovery continued into the second quarter of 2011.\n\nAs attendees at previous regional press briefings may recall, the New York Fed produces economic activity indexes (CEIs) to help monitor the performance of the regional economy.\n\nBased on these measures, activity continued to expand in both New York State and New York City through June, with growth decelerating only modestly in the second quarter. By contrast, the recovery in New Jersey's economy has been more sluggish, though the index for New Jersey did pick up in 2011, which is an encouraging development.\n\nWe monitor Puerto Rico using an index produced by the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico. This index shows that the recession there, which started back in 2005—well before the mainland's—continues to be a challenge. The sharp decline in activity that persisted well into 2010 appears to have subsided. However, for some time now the island's economy has experienced a series of fits and starts. As such, the recent improvements will need to be sustained for a period of time before we'll know that they are breaking out of the pattern of mixed signals.\n\nThe performance of regional housing markets continues to influence the pace of recovery for local economies. Many of the places hit hardest by the housing bust have had a particularly weak recovery. Although housing markets remain fragile, an encouraging development here is that home prices appear to be firming across much of our region.\n\nTurning to jobs, data for the second quarter of 2011 indicate that businesses in the region, on balance, expanded employment at a more rapid pace than the nation. Still, the number of jobs being created each month is not enough to sustain a robust recovery.\n\nGiven the slow recovery of employment across much of the region, unemployment rates have edged up in most places. June's unemployment rate of 8.0 percent in New York State and 9.5 percent in New Jersey remain unacceptably high. While Puerto Rico's unemployment rate has fallen sharply in recent months, it is still particularly elevated at 14.9 percent.\n\nOne factor that remains a drag on overall employment growth in much of the region is the weakness of the public sector. As we have discussed at previous press briefings, our state and local governments continue to cut jobs more sharply than governments elsewhere. The recent exception to this trend is Puerto Rico. While the island sustained deep cuts in government jobs in 2009 and 2010, a recent increase in this sector was a key reason for Puerto Rico's relatively strong job growth in June. Overall, the weakness of the public sector continues to pose a risk to employment growth throughout our region going forward.\n\nAnother potentially troubling development for the region is the recent weakness in the financial sector. The finance industry, which had begun to recover late in the cycle, appeared to be showing signs of expansion when we last met. Since then, the industry has lost jobs in New York City and in New Jersey. This recent job loss has been particularly significant in the city's securities industry, which has shed nearly 4,000 jobs since April. More difficulties may lie ahead, as there have been many recent announcements of consolidations and layoffs in the region's banking sector.\n\nDespite weak labor market conditions overall, some sectors are enjoying robust growth in the region. In particular, the professional and business services and education and health sectors have continued to add jobs. These are high-value-added services that the region can export to other parts of the country and overseas, and provide jobs that tend to be performed by highly skilled people. As such, these sectors help support the broader economy and are likely to provide a source of growth for the region going forward.\n\nIt is difficult to say when the pace of job growth will pick up. As such, we will continue to monitor our region's economy and job situation closely.\n\nJob Creation in the Region The fact that the recovery has been so sluggish might lead you to believe that no jobs are being created. However, this is not true. Beneath the high unemployment rate and overall slow job growth lies a considerable amount of job churning. Ongoing losses in some sectors are being offset by gains in other sectors. Today we look inside this churning for clues about how these changes are playing out in our region.\n\nHow do these changes in the labor market occur in the midst of a recession and recovery? First, many jobs are destroyed rapidly and few created as the economy weakens. This pattern is a defining characteristic of recessions. Afterward, during the recovery, employment rises as layoffs subside and firms begin to hire more. As this process plays out, some hiring will be in different industries from the layoffs. For example, some auto manufacturing jobs may never come back, while health care providers continue to add jobs.\n\nThus, employers are adding two sorts of jobs: new and old. Some jobs are in industries that continued to expand jobs throughout the recession and weak recovery, such as health care and education. We think of these as \"new jobs.\" These shifts in jobs are transformational. They are part of how our region adjusts to the evolution of technology, trade patterns and consumer preferences. In addition, now that we are in recovery, a broad set of industries are beginning to add jobs to replace earlier layoffs, such as administrative support and wholesale and retail trade. We think of these as \"old jobs\" because they restore their industries' share of jobs as economic activity picks up.\n\nThe two recessions before the current one saw an unusually high share of \"new job\" creation—in expanding industries, rather than rebounds of \"old jobs\"—compared with recessions in the 1970s and 1980s. Research done here at the New York Fed documents this for the nation and New York. 1 The preponderance of transformational \"new job\" creation may have reflected the fact that the recessions of 1990-91 and 2001 were relatively shallow.\n\nIn addition, employers may be more likely to use recessions as an opportunity to make their operations more efficient. For example, employers are less likely to use temporary layoffs when they reduce staff during downturns and more likely to use temporary service agencies or outsource part of their operations when they need to expand.\n\nSo far, the current recession does not follow the pattern of the last two downturns. In New York and New Jersey as well as the nation, job creation during the recovery has been fairly evenly balanced between new jobs and old jobs—instead of heavily weighted toward new jobs as in the past two recessions. If this pattern holds, the recovery process could have a higher share of unemployed workers returning to jobs similar to those they left during the downturn. That could be promising for the adjustment process when the recovery gathers strength. There is some variation within the region, though, and the areas with a higher preponderance of new jobs are undergoing more rapid transformations that could position them well for growth going forward. As a result, these areas could face a particularly strong need to retrain and educate their workers.\n\nIn order to prepare our region to be as competitive as possible, policy makers, firms and workers need to accurately gauge which industries and jobs will grow fastest.\n\nGiven the trend over the past few decades, it is no surprise that the new jobs being created across the region and nation are most likely to be in industries with a high share of workers with a college education. Thus, education and worker training is likely to continue to be very important in maintaining the economic vitality of our region going forward.\n\nConclusion In summary, the recovery in our region continued at a slow pace during the second quarter of 2011. While overall job growth has been sluggish through the recovery, we find that there has been a great deal of job churning below the surface throughout our region. So far, this job churning is about evenly balanced between old and new job creation. The evidence to date is pretty clear that these new jobs, on balance, are in industries that employ workers with higher levels of skills and education.\n\nI will now ask Jaison Abel to provide additional details on the regional economy.\n\n_______________________________________ 1 Groshen, Erica L. and Simon Potter. 2003. \" Has Structural Change Contributed to a Jobless Recovery? \" Federal Reserve Bank of New York Current Issues in Economics and Finance 9, no. 8.

    "text": "It is a pleasure to welcome you to the New York Fed today to discuss the important issue of wholesale funding. 1\n\nAs you all know, the financial system plays an essential role in modern economies, and liquidity is in turn critical to the functioning of the financial system. Because financial intermediation is critical to economic activity and intermediation is dependent on funding and liquidity, disruption to funding and liquidity can cause severe damage to the economy. The experience of recent years revealed serious flaws in the system. Risk was mispriced and there was a build-up of excesses before the crisis. Structural weaknesses in the financial system then amplified the effect of the sharp decline in U.S. house prices, and the result was a widespread financial crisis and a deep recession both here and abroad.\n\nThe extensive use by financial firms of short-term wholesale funding was one critical factor in the crisis. Not only did this reliance on short-term funding create the potential for a firm to fail in an extraordinarily rapid manner when faced with a loss of market confidence, but it also served as a channel through which the effects of those failures were widely propagated throughout the broader financial system.\n\nI will focus my brief remarks on describing the structural vulnerabilities associated with short-term wholesale funding, laying the groundwork for our discussions at today's workshop.\n\nAs always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs this audience knows, in the two decades leading up to the financial crisis, the global financial system underwent a rapid transformation. During this period, there was a shift from bank-based financial intermediation to capital markets-based financial intermediation, and an increase in the scale and complexity of securitization activities.\n\nIn the pre-crisis period, the growth of securitization was accompanied by an increasing reliance on short-term funds raised in wholesale markets to finance securities and activities essential to securitization. This ranged from the use of repo funding to finance inventories of securities held for market-making purposes to the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper by conduits created to acquire and hold securities.\n\nBoth demand and supply factors drove the increased use of short-term wholesale finance. On the supply side, the growth of savings from corporations and institutional investors in need of deposit-like products in which to place their cash balances created a plentiful source of funds.  These products were viewed as \"safe\" since, after all, the funds were only exposed for a short period of time, and in the case of repo, they were secured by collateral. On the demand side, setting aside any possible instabilities in this funding source, it was more profitable to use shorter-term funds to finance longer-term assets.\n\nIn fact, the growing reliance on short-term wholesale funding to finance longer-term assets increased liquidity and maturity mismatch risk in the financial system. This was particularly dangerous because many of the assets being financed were structured-credit products, some of which were opaque, difficult to value and illiquid. In periods of market stress, these features increase the run risk by funding providers.\n\nShort-term funding of longer-term assets is inherently unstable, especially in the presence of information and coordination problems.  It can be rational for a funding provider to supply funds on a short-term basis, reasoning that it can exit if there is any uncertainty over the firm's continued ability to roll over its funding from other sources. But, if the use of short-term funding becomes sufficiently widespread, the firm's roll-over risk increases. In this situation, there is a strong incentive for each lender to \"run\" early if there is any uncertainty that could undermine the borrower's ability to continue to roll over its funding from other sources. This is the case even if the provider of funds believes that the borrower would remain solvent as long as it retained access to funding on normal terms. The cost of running when it turns out to be unnecessary is small relative to the cost of not running when it turns out to be prudent.\n\nOf course, this insight is not a new one. Prior to the establishment of a lender of last resort and retail deposit insurance for banks—which came with the quid pro quo of prudential regulation—bank runs were a regular and disruptive feature of our financial system. These innovations solved the coordination problem and stabilized this source of funding.\n\nWhat was new prior to the crisis was the extent to which maturity transformation and financial intermediation had migrated outside of commercial banks. The growth of what we call the shadow banking system occurred largely without the types of safeguards—robust prudential regulation, deposit insurance, lender of last resort—that have safeguarded the commercial banking system from the types of widespread panics and runs that are capable of destabilizing the financial system. The systemic risk created by this gap in coverage was not well recognized by regulators or the private sector prior to the global financial crisis. Market participants had little incentive to internalize the negative externality of the run-risk created by their collective choice of finance, and they made erroneous assumptions about the liquidity of asset markets and the capacity and willingness of banks to distribute central bank liquidity to the wider financial system during periods of stress.\n\nBecause the boom years resulted in strong earnings, low price volatility and few credit losses, firms were able to operate at extreme levels of leverage. When housing prices started to decline, the vulnerabilities of this type of business model soon became apparent.\n\nHeavy reliance on short-term wholesale funding exposed the system to a series of intertwined downward spirals in asset and funding markets. This spread in waves. It began in the market for asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) issued by off-balance-sheet conduits, and spread via auction-rate securities to the repo, money market and financial commercial paper markets that formed the core financing for market-based financial intermediation.\n\nInitial declines in asset prices especially for mortgage related assets forced leveraged holders with maturity mismatches to sell assets. This increased price volatility and further reduced the value of the assets that collateralized other firms' borrowings. Higher volatility led banks and secured lenders to raise margins, while concern about counterparty risk and their own funding needs made banks reluctant to on-lend liquidity.\n\nThe resulting higher margins on repo and increased collateral calls due to credit ratings downgrades reduced the quantity of assets that could be financed in repo markets and elsewhere, prompting further asset sales. As wholesale investors started to exit, this set in motion a bad dynamic—a fire sale of assets that cut into earnings and capital. This increased the incentives of investors to run and for banks to hoard liquidity against the risk that they could themselves face a run. This downward spiral of fire sales and funding runs was a key feature of the financial crisis.\n\nThe inherent fragility of short-term wholesale funding was greatly aggravated by certain institutional shortcomings in these markets, particularly in the structure of the tri-party repo system and the U.S. money market mutual fund business.\n\nThrough the tri-party repo market, each day the two large clearing banks were providing a large amount of intraday credit to securities firms to facilitate the daily \"unwind\" of the prior day's transactions. In the run-up to the crisis, the daily \"unwind\" helped make tri-party repo look like a very liquid investment while still being an apparently highly durable source of funding. This masked the underlying risks and contributed to weak risk management practices.\n\nAs the concerns about the U.S. housing market escalated in 2007, participants in the tri-party repo market became increasingly concerned about the liquidity and credit risks that they faced. The clearing banks became uncomfortable with their large intraday exposures to their clients—broker-dealers, thrifts and others. If the risk that a client might fail became too high, a clearing bank could decide not to unwind that client's trades in the morning, leaving its investors with the collateral. Most of these investors lacked the operational or financial capacity to take possession of collateral and liquidate it in a gradual manner to recoup their investment; they had a strong incentive to run at the first sign of trouble to avoid getting stuck with the dealer's collateral. Alternatively, if a client were to fail suddenly after the mornings unwind, then the clearing bank would be stuck with huge loans to these counterparties that could have put their own viability at risk, backed by securities that were not necessarily high quality and liquid.\n\nThe \"breaking the buck\" by the Reserve Fund following the Lehman bankruptcy also made it clear that the monies provided to the money market mutual funds by their own investors were also inherently unstable. This made such funds, in turn, an unreliable source of finance in repo, commercial paper and other markets. Investors in a fixed net asset value (NAV) money market fund could take their money out on a daily basis at par value, with no redemption penalty. This could occur even if the money market fund did not have sufficient cash or liquid assets that it could easily sell to meet all potential redemptions. As with bank deposits prior to deposit insurance, this created an incentive for investors to be the first to get out whenever there was any uncertainty over the underlying value of the assets in the fund. By being first in line, they could exit while the fund could still repay at par, leaving others to bear any losses. The longer the investor waited, the greater the risk that the fund would be forced into the fire sale of assets to meet redemptions and end up breaking the buck.\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, the Federal Reserve, the U.S.  Treasury and others took a series of actions to contain the spiral of funding runs and asset fire sales. First, the traditional lender of last resort function was strengthened through the introduction of the Term Auction Facility (TAF) and foreign exchange swaps with foreign central banks.\n\nThen, as the crisis intensified, the lender of last resort liquidity provision was extended to directly backstop key wholesale funding markets and made available to certain nonbank firms. The Federal Reserve created a direct backstop to the tri-party repo system through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF). When the Reserve Fund broke the buck after the failure of Lehman Brothers, precipitating a run on money market mutual funds, the Treasury guaranteed money market fund assets and the Fed introduced the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidation Facility (AMLF).  The Fed also backstopped the commercial paper market (formerly funded in large part by money market mutual funds) by introducing the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). When wholesale funding for non-residential mortgage securitizations evaporated, the Fed rolled out the Term Asset-Backed Lending Facility (TALF).\n\nThese actions ultimately stabilized funding markets and crowded back in private funds. But, they were an emergency response, not a sustainable long-term solution. After all, because most of the special Fed liquidity facilities were authorized under Section 13.3 of the Federal Reserve Act, they were required to be temporary in nature and to end when times were no longer \"unusual and exigent.\"\n\nMuch has been done over the past few years to mitigate the structural flaws that make wholesale funding a point of weakness in the global financial system. The New York Fed, for example, has led a Federal Reserve effort to make the tri-party repo system more resilient to stress, while the SEC has taken steps to address risks associated with money market mutual funds.  Nonetheless, some important issues and vulnerabilities remain. Moreover, because the Dodd-Frank Act raised the hurdle for the Federal Reserve to exercise its Section 13.3 emergency lending authority, extraordinary interventions will be more difficult to undertake, perhaps causing investors to be even more skittish in the future. This is why it is essential to make the system more stable. To that end, I look forward to hearing the insights and suggestions that come out of today's workshop.\n\nThank you for your attention.",

    "text": "Good  evening.  It is a pleasure to have the  opportunity to speak at this Money Marketeers event.  In my remarks, I will focus on two  topics:  1) The economic outlook and the  implications for monetary policy, and 2) the Fed’s balance sheet normalization  process, which is likely to begin relatively soon.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own  views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or  the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nOverall, the  economy remains on a trajectory of slightly above-trend growth, which is  gradually tightening the U.S. labor market.   Over time, this should support a rise in wage growth.  When combined with a firmer import price  trend—partly reflecting recent depreciation of the dollar—and the fading of  effects from a number of temporary, idiosyncratic factors, that causes me to  expect inflation will rise and stabilize around the FOMC’s 2 percent objective  over the medium term.  In response, the  Fed will likely continue to remove monetary policy accommodation  gradually.  But, the upward trajectory of  the policy rate path should continue to be shallow, in part because the level  of short-term interest rates consistent with keeping the economy on a  sustainable long-run growth path is likely to be considerably lower than it was  in prior business cycles.\n\nThe process of  balance sheet normalization—in which an increasing proportion of maturing  Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) repayments are allowed  to run off the Fed’s balance sheet—should also exert some monetary policy  restraint over time.  But, I believe this  impact will be quite modest.  Not only is  this shift in policy now widely anticipated, but we have also seen that the  impact on the level of long-term interest rates has been small as expectations  have adjusted.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nSo, why do I  anticipate that the economy will likely continue to grow at a slightly  above-trend pace?   The fundamentals  supporting continued expansion are generally quite favorable.  Low unemployment, sturdy job gains, and  rising wages—even at a pace below previous expansions—are lifting personal  income.  Household wealth has been boosted  by rising home and equity prices, and household debt has been growing relatively  slowly, contributing to a healthy household balance sheet.  Thus, consumer spending should continue to  advance in coming quarters.\n\nBusiness fixed  investment outlays are also likely to continue to rise.  With the supply of labor tightening, there are  greater incentives for businesses to invest in labor-saving technologies.  Investment spending should also benefit from  a better international outlook and the improvement in U.S. trade  competitiveness caused by the dollar’s recent weakness.  The softer dollar and solid growth abroad  also suggest that the trade sector will no longer be a significant drag on  economic growth.\n\nTurning to the  outlook for inflation, I have been surprised by the persistence of the  shortfall from the FOMC’s 2 percent long-run objective.  While some of this year’s shortfall can be  explained by one-off factors, such as the sharp fall in prices for cellular  phone service, its persistence suggests that more fundamental structural  changes may also be playing a role.   These include the increased ability of prospective buyers to compare  prices across different sellers quickly and easily, the shift in retail sales  to online channels of distribution from traditional brick-and-mortar stores,  and the consequences of these changes on brand loyalty and business pricing  power.\n\nOver the coming  months, I hope that we will be better able to differentiate between these  competing explanations.\n\nIf it turns out  that structural changes have played a significant role, I would generally view  this as a positive, rather than negative, development.  It would imply that the U.S. economy could  operate at a higher level of labor resource utilization without generating a  troublesome large rise in inflation.   More people could be put to work on a sustainable basis, enabling them  to gain opportunities not just to earn greater income, but also to develop  their skills and grow their human capital.\n\nBefore I go  further, let me say a few words about the impact of Hurricane Harvey.  The massive flooding in Texas has been a  tragedy for countless people.  My heart  goes out to all who have suffered and face a long and difficult recovery.\n\nWhile the human  toll of such a storm is immense, past disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and  Superstorm Sandy have shown that the impact on the national economy tends to be  modest and transitory.  At first,  activity dips as normal commerce is disrupted.   But later, when rebuilding gets underway in earnest, economic activity  receives a modest boost.\n\nAlthough I  expect that the Texas floods will make it more difficult to assess the economic  data in the months ahead, I do not expect it to fundamentally alter the  underlying trajectory of the national economy.   Of course, for parts of Texas, sadly, the consequences will be  immeasurably greater.\n\nMonetary  Policy Outlook\n\nAs I noted  earlier, I still anticipate that above-trend growth will lead to higher  utilization of the economy’s resources, and that, over time, this will help  push inflation higher.  Thus, even though  inflation is currently somewhat below our longer-run objective, I judge that it  is still appropriate to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation  gradually.\n\nThis judgment is  supported by the fact that financial conditions have eased, rather than  tightened, even as the Fed has raised its short-term interest rate target range  by 75 basis points since last December.   For example, equity prices have risen, credit spreads have narrowed  modestly, longer-term interest rates have declined, and the dollar has  weakened.  On balance, these movements  have been large relative to the upward drift in short-term interest rates.  The easing in financial conditions is  important because monetary policy does not directly influence the trajectory of  economic growth and inflation.  Instead,  as I have noted in previous remarks, short-term interest rate changes are an  important factor that affects broad financial market conditions. 2 Financial conditions, in turn, influence the  demand for goods and services by households and businesses.  But, if financial conditions ease even as we  are removing monetary policy accommodation, this may have implications for  further policy adjustments.  All else  equal, an easing of financial conditions may warrant a somewhat steeper policy  rate path.  Conversely, if financial  conditions were to tighten unduly, then this might necessitate a shallower rate  path to temper that tightening.\n\nTo be clear,  this does not mean that the Fed should mechanically target a particular set of  financial conditions.  That is because  the set of financial conditions appropriate to achieving the Fed’s statutory  objectives of maximum employment and price stability will evolve over time as  the economic outlook changes.  Financial  conditions are just a means to an end—the achievement of the Fed’s employment  and inflation objectives.\n\nWith that  background, I would like to comment on some of the criticism of Fed policy  decisions.\n\nSome of the  commentary surrounding the FOMC’s June decision to raise the federal funds rate  target by 25 basis points illustrates the current tension between “too low”  inflation and “too buoyant” financial conditions.  On one hand, some observers question the  decision to reduce policy accommodation given that inflation has fallen  somewhat further below our objective.  I  would respond to these concerns by noting that monetary policy is still  accommodative and that financial conditions have eased.  In addition, the long and variable lags  between monetary policy adjustments and their impact on the economy imply that  the FOMC may need to remove accommodation even when inflation is below its  goal.  In particular, if the unemployment  rate were already below its longer-run natural rate, as may be the case  currently, the impact on wage growth and price inflation would still likely  take some time to become evident.  This  would be particularly true if inflation expectations were well-anchored at or  slightly below our 2 percent objective, as is the case currently.\n\nOn the other  hand, some Fed watchers have argued that we are helping to create financial  asset bubbles by not removing accommodation more quickly.  My view is that asset valuations are not  particularly troublesome given the economic environment in which we’ve  been—that is, a long period of moderate growth, low inflation, low interest  rates, and low recession risks.  I would  be much more concerned about asset valuations if financial market performance  were disconnected from the economy’s performance—for example, if market  volatility were very low and asset valuations elevated at a time when the  economy was performing poorly and the outlook was highly uncertain.  Stretched valuations would also be of greater  concern if credit growth were unusually strong and financial institutions were  becoming more leveraged and dependent on wholesale funding.  The good news is that the substantially  higher capital and liquidity requirements enacted in response to the financial  crisis have helped to reduce the risks to financial stability.\n\nRelatedly, some  critics have argued that our asset purchases have unduly distorted financial  asset prices.  My response to this  critique is that monetary policy—including large-scale asset purchase  programs—works through its influence on financial conditions.  We turned to asset purchases to provide  additional monetary policy stimulus when the federal funds rate was constrained  by the effective zero lower bound.  In  buying longer-maturity Treasuries and agency MBS, we sought to reduce risk  premia to provide additional support to economic growth at a time when the  economy was operating far from full employment.   The argument that monetary policy should avoid affecting asset  prices—that it be somehow “neutral”—is not one that I find compelling.  Such an argument essentially implies that  monetary policy should not be utilized to achieve the Fed’s dual mandate  objectives.\n\nAnother recent  critique is that the Fed has contributed to the low volatility of financial  markets by making monetary policy too predictable.  Some argue that we should surprise market  participants in order to manufacture greater uncertainty and generate more  market volatility.  The notion is that if  the Fed were more unpredictable, market participants would be less  complacent.  And, if markets were  perceived as riskier, this might hinder the development of financial asset bubbles.\n\nI am not  supportive of such a strategy for several reasons.  First, I don’t think it is necessary to be  unpredictable to keep financial market participants “on their toes.”  There are plenty of potential surprises from  the economic environment without the Fed seeking to deliberately generate its  own.  Changes in the economic outlook  affect financial asset prices and market participants’ expectations for future  monetary policy actions.  I don’t see a  significant benefit to artificially adding “noise” to this process.  Developments in early 2016 provide a good  example.  As the economic environment  changed and financial conditions tightened, we responded by raising short-term  interest rates much more slowly than had been anticipated.\n\nSecond, deliberately  degrading the signal of how we are likely to react to changes in economic  circumstances would likely lead to higher risk premia.  This would represent a real cost that would  have to be borne by households and businesses.   Third, a less reliable Fed would also presumably loosen the linkage  between the stance of monetary policy and financial conditions.  Because the monetary policy impulse works  through its impact on financial market conditions, I don’t see why the Fed  would want to act in a way that deliberately made this linkage less  predictable.  In actuality, I have been  pushing in the opposite direction.  By  explaining the importance of financial conditions as part of our monetary  policy decisions, I am trying to tighten the linkage.\n\nBalance  Sheet Normalization\n\nI’d like to wrap  up my comments tonight by discussing the likely next step in the monetary  policy normalization process: beginning to allow maturing Treasuries and agency  MBS paydowns to run off the Fed’s balance sheet, in contrast to our current  practice of reinvesting all of the proceeds.   As you are aware, following the June FOMC meeting we issued an addendum  to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. 3 In that addendum, the FOMC outlined how it  planned to gradually reduce the Fed’s securities holdings over time.  Namely, when that program is implemented, the  FOMC will decrease its reinvestments in an orderly way, with repayments  reinvested only to the extent they exceed gradually rising caps.  For maturing Treasury securities, the FOMC  anticipates that the monthly cap will be $6 billion initially and will increase  in steps of $6 billion at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches  $30 billion.  For repayments of agency  MBS, the monthly cap will be $4 billion initially and will increase in steps of  $4 billion at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $20  billion.\n\nFor Treasury  securities, when the caps are fully phased in, they will generally only be  binding during the middle month of each quarter, when there is typically a  spike in maturing Treasuries in the Fed’s portfolio.  For agency MBS, as long as long-term interest  rates are steady or rising, we expect that the fully-phased-in caps will not be  binding.  However, if long-term interest  rates were to fall sharply—provoking a surge in refinancing and mortgage  repayments—the caps would likely bind, limiting the amount of agency MBS that  would have to be absorbed by the private market.\n\nAs currently  anticipated, once we start the balance sheet normalization program, we expect  it to continue in the background until the FOMC judges that the Fed’s  securities holdings are no larger than necessary to implement monetary policy  efficiently and effectively.  Adjustments  to the target range of the federal funds rate will remain the primary tool of  monetary policy.  However, if economic  circumstances were to change during the normalization process in a way that  would warrant a sizable reduction in the target range for the federal funds  rate, the FOMC would be prepared to resume reinvestment.\n\nThe program has  been designed to be implemented gradually and predictably so that market  participants and the U.S. Treasury can anticipate when and at what pace the  portfolio is likely to run off over the course of normalization.  This should keep expectations more stable and  reduce the risk that a sharp shift in expectations could generate undesirably  large movements in interest rates and asset prices.\n\nAs I see it, a  few questions about this program remain and are worth addressing.  The first question is why do this at  all.  After all, the Fed has had a large  balance sheet for many years now.  In my  view, the balance sheet expansion was undertaken in response to an  extraordinary set of circumstances—a deep recession, short-term interest rates  at the zero lower bound, and the economy far away from our dual mandate  objectives.  Now that these circumstances  no longer hold, it seems appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Fed’s  balance sheet.\n\nIn thinking  about the decision to reduce the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, I see two  important, opposing factors.  One is that  a large balance sheet could conceivably make further asset purchases less  attractive.  This factor suggests that we  should use the opportunity to shrink the balance sheet during good economic  times so that this tool will be fully available to us in the future if  necessary.  However, on the other side,  reducing the size of the balance sheet is another form of monetary tightening,  one with which we have little experience.   This suggests we should proceed with caution.  The FOMC has judged that a gradual,  predictable approach to normalization is the best way to appropriately balance  these two factors.\n\nAnother question  is how long the normalization process will take.  Assuming that this process begins later this  year and continues uninterrupted, the balance sheet size would likely normalize  in the early part of the next decade. 4 There is uncertainty about the exact timing  for several reasons.  We don’t know how fast  our agency MBS holdings will pre-pay, how quickly currency outstanding will  grow, how many bank reserves will be required for the efficient execution of  monetary policy, or the evolution of other liability items on the Fed’s balance  sheet that affect the amount of bank reserves.\n\nAgainst that  backdrop, one major issue that remains outstanding is whether the Fed will  continue to operate with a “floor” system, in which the Fed maintains a  relatively abundant supply of reserves and the effective federal funds rate is  managed by periodic adjustments to the interest rate the Fed pays on bank  reserves.  Or, whether the Fed will move  back to a “corridor” system, in which reserves are relatively scarce and the  effective federal funds rate is managed by frequently adjusting the supply of  reserves to meet demand at the desired federal funds rate level.  In this type of regime, it is the quantity of  reserves, rather than the interest rate the Fed pays on reserves, that is the  primary driver of the federal funds rate. 5\n\nHaving  managed the System Open Market Account during the financial crisis—a period  during which the demand for reserves was very volatile—I very much favor a  floor-type system.  It is much easier to  manage on a day-to-day basis.  It also  eliminates the need for a lot of interbank trading activity to move reserves to  banks that would otherwise find themselves short of reserves on a particular  day.  In my view, this type of  intermediation activity does not have much social value.\n\nWhile  the FOMC has discussed these issues, it has made no decision about its choice  of long-term monetary policy operating framework.  This seems appropriate to me because over the  next few years we will gain considerable further experience about operating  with a floor-type system.  Nevertheless,  my expectation is that the FOMC will ultimately favor maintaining a floor-type  system similar to what is in place today.   As support, I would point to the minutes of the November 2016 FOMC  meeting, in which participants observed that the current framework had been  working well.\n\nThis  leads us to the next question:  Assuming  that a floor system is retained, what amount of reserves will be needed in the  banking system so that day-to-day open market operations are not necessary to  keep the federal funds rate within its target range?   In other words, how small can the amount of  excess reserves be before banks begin to compete and bid for such reserves,  introducing unwanted volatility to the federal funds rate?  First, there will need to be sufficient  excess reserves to accommodate day-to-day fluctuations in the “autonomous  factors” that influence the amount of reserves in the banking system.  These include shifts in the Treasury’s cash  balance, the foreign repo pool, and overnight reverse repo facility usage.  Second, there will have to be an additional  buffer to meet banks’ underlying demand for reserves.  We expect that the demand for reserves will  be considerably higher than it was prior to the financial crisis because  reserves can be used to satisfy the more stringent liquidity requirements that  are in place today, and because the opportunity cost of holding reserves is  much lower now since the Fed pays interest on reserves.\n\nTogether,  as a rough starting point, we have suggested that the necessary amount of  excess reserves could be in a range of $400 billion to $1 trillion. 6 Coupled with uncertainty about the likely  growth in other factors, such as currency outstanding, this implies a  normalized balance sheet size of, perhaps, $2.4 trillion to $3.5 trillion in  the early 2020s.\n\nAfter  reaching that level, one should anticipate that the Fed would resume purchases  of Treasury securities.  These purchases  would allow the balance sheet to expand to accommodate the growth in currency  outstanding and in banks’ demand for reserves as the economy grows.  They also would make up for ongoing paydowns  of the agency MBS that remain in our portfolio.\n\nAlthough  there is considerable uncertainty about the long-run size of the Fed’s balance  sheet, I would stress that the balance sheet is likely to shrink by much less  than it grew between 2007 and 2014.   Based on New York Fed staff projections, I would expect the Fed’s  balance sheet, which currently stands at $4.5 trillion, to shrink by roughly $1  trillion to $2 trillion.  This compares  to an increase of about $3.7 trillion in the wake of the financial crisis.  This is another reason why I anticipate that  the impact of balance sheet normalization on financial markets is likely to be  quite mild.  This view is supported by  empirical research carried out within the Fed 7 and is consistent with the results of surveys of private sector economists,  including the Survey of Primary Dealers and the Survey of Market Participants  conducted by the New York Fed’s Markets Group. 8\n\nConclusion\n\nTo  sum up, I expect that the U.S. economy will continue to perform quite well,  with slightly above-trend growth leading to further gradual tightening of the  U.S. labor market.  As this occurs, I  would anticipate that wage growth will firm and that price inflation will  gradually rise.  In response, I expect  that we will continue to gradually remove monetary policy accommodation.  Balance sheet normalization will likely be  part of this process.  But, we expect  this to have only a mild impact and to run passively in the background.  Short-term interest rates will remain the  primary tool of monetary policy.\n\nThank  you for your kind attention.  I would be  happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "I. Introduction Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Quigley, other members of the Subcommittee, it  is  an honor to testify before you today to discuss the economic and fiscal challenges facing  Europe and the potential implications for the United States. My name is Bill Dudley, and  I am president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nLet me preface these remarks by stating that the views expressed in my written and oral testimony are solely my own and do not represent official views of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or any other part of the Federal Reserve System.  Additionally, because I am precluded by law from discussing confidential supervisory information, I will not be able to speak to the financial condition or regulatory treatment or  rating of any individual financial institution.\n\nThe Federal Reserve seeks to promote financial stability in order to enable U.S. businesses and households to maintain their access to credit and to ensure sustained economic growth. Although the U.S. economy is currently expanding at a moderate pace, we face significant downside risks, mostly relating to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Because  developments in Europe will have an important bearing on the prospects for growth and jobs here in the U.S., the Federal Reserve is monitoring the situation there closely. This is also why we have taken special steps, in cooperation with other central banks, to support the flow of credit  to  households and businesses. I welcome the opportunity to testify on these matters today.\n\nII. Europe Within the European Union, seventeen countries share a common currency, the euro.  The situation in the euro area is very unsettled, with pressure on sovereign debt markets and local banking systems. The euro area has the capacity, including the fiscal capacity, to overcome its challenges. However, the politics are very difficult, both because the problem has many dimensions, and because many different countries and institutions in the euro area have to  coordinate their actions in order to achieve a coherent and effective policy response.\n\nEurope's leadership has  affirmed its commitment to the European Union and its single  currency monetary union on numerous occasions. And the leadership is working to achieve  greater policy coordination in areas such as fiscal policy. Putting all the countries using the euro  on a  clearly sustainable fiscal path would help restore market confidence. Assuming that Europe  ultimately succeeds in managing this situation, a stronger union will emerge that will be viewed  as more robust and  resilient. This would be a welcome development for the U.S.\n\nIf, in contrast, Europe were not to be fully successful in charting an effective course, this  could have a number of negative implications for the U.S. In particular, there are three  possibilities that I would like to highlight for the Subcommittee today.\n\nFirst, if the European situation were to deteriorate, then the euro area would face even more serious fiscal and economic challenges. As a result, growth within the euro zone would  weaken and this would lead to less demand for U.S. goods and services that are exported to Europe from companies and workers here. This would hurt growth here in the United States and  would have a negative impact on U.S. jobs. It  is  important to recognize that the euro area is the world's second largest economy after the U.S. and  an  important trading partner for us. Also, Europe is a significant investor in the U.S. economy, and vice versa. Thus, what happens in Europe has significant implications for our economy.\n\nSecond, if the European situation were to deteriorate, this could put pressure on the U.S.  banking system. The good news is that U.S. banks are much more robust  and resilient than they  were a few years ago. U.S. banks have bolstered their capital significantly, built up their loan loss reserves and have significantly larger liquidity buffers. Also, the direct exposures of U.S.  banks to the countries in Europe that are facing the most intense fiscal challenges are actually quite modest.\n\nThe bad news is that the exposures of the U.S. banks climb quite sharply when one also considers the exposures to the core European countries and to the overall European banking  system. This means that if the crisis were to broaden further and intensify, this could put greater  pressure on U.S. banks' capital and liquidity buffers.\n\nThird, if the European situation were to deteriorate further, financial markets would likely  become more stressed. This could tighten the availability of credit to U.S. households and  businesses. It could also cause equity prices to fall  and  this would have a negative impact on  Americans' pension and  401(k) holdings. This tightening of financial conditions would damage  the  U.S. recovery and result in slower output growth and less job creation. At a time that U.S. unemployment is very high, this is a particularly unacceptable outcome. In the extreme, U.S. financial markets could become so impaired that this would dry up the flow of credit to households  and  businesses.\n\nIII. U.S. Dollar Swaps In terms of what actions the official sector in the United States has taken or  could take with regard to Europe, I wish to emphasize that any and  all such actions pursued by the Federal  Reserve are motivated by the mandates Congress has given to the Federal Reserve to promote price stability and maximum sustainable employment here in the United States.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve System was created by Congress in 1913, it was given the  responsibility of providing liquidity to the financial system in times of stress in order to shield the economy, to the extent possible, from the severe effects of financial instability on economic activity and jobs. While the economy and the markets have evolved substantially in the century  since then, this basic principle continues to guide our efforts today. Central banks around  the world have an important lender of last resort role. This role is important in order to protect the  economy against financial instability.\n\nIn today's globally integrated economy, banks headquartered outside of the U.S. play an  important role in providing credit and other financial services in the U.S.—providing a total of  about $900 billion in overall financing within the U.S. For these banks to provide U.S. dollar  loans, they have to maintain access to U.S. dollar funding. At a time when it  is  already hard enough for American families and firms to get the credit they need, we have a strong interest in  making sure that these banks can continue to be active in the U.S. dollar markets.\n\nBanks headquartered outside the U.S., like banks that are headquartered here, make  extensive use of dollars in their financing activities. In part, this is due to the fact that the U.S.  dollar is the world's number one currency—a status that brings with it many benefits for our country. It  is  in the U.S. national interest to make sure that non-U.S. banks that are judged to be  sound by their central bank are able to access the U.S. dollar funding they need in order to be able  to continue to finance their U.S. dollar assets. If the access to dollar funding were severely impaired, this could necessitate the abrupt, forced sales of dollar assets by these banks, which  could seriously disrupt U.S. markets and adversely affect U.S. businesses, consumers and jobs.\n\nOne way we can help to support the availability of dollar funding is by engaging in currency swaps with other central banks. This has been used as a policy tool dating back to 1962. Recently, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to re-launch this tool, cooperating  with  five other central banks. Our intention is to create a credible backstop to—but not supplant—private markets. Banks with surplus dollars are more likely to lend to banks in need of dollars  if  they know that the borrowing bank will be able to obtain the dollars it needs to repay the loan, if necessary, from its central bank.\n\nThis action is designed to support financial stability, avoid an unnecessary tightening in  financial conditions and support economic activity and jobs in the United States. In particular, by  reducing the cost of dollar funding via the swap lines last month, we reduced the pressure on banks in Europe to abruptly liquidate their U.S. dollar assets. Thus, this step will help to insulate  U.S.  markets from the pressures in Europe and support the availability of  credit to U.S. households and businesses. European banks are particularly active in areas such as trade finance, project finance, energy lending and municipal finance—a sharp contraction of the financing they  provide would be harmful for the U.S. economy as a whole including for U.S. exporters, firms working on infrastructure projects, the energy industry and hard-pressed state and local  governments across the country.\n\nU.S. financial institutions currently do not face difficulty obtaining liquidity in short-term  funding markets. However, were conditions to deteriorate, the Federal Reserve has a range of tools available to provide an effective liquidity backstop for such institutions and is prepared to use these tools as needed to support financial stability and to promote the extension of credit to  U.S.  households and businesses.\n\nIn sum, I am hopeful that Europe can effectively address its current fiscal challenges. The Federal Reserve is actively and carefully assessing this situation and the potential impact on the U.S. economy.   At this time, although I do not anticipate further efforts by the Federal Reserve to address the potential spillover effects of Europe on the United States, we will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\nThank you for your invitation to testify today, and I look forward to your questions.",

    "text": "Today I want to discuss some of these initiatives, with a special focus on the recent agreement in Basel on capital and liquidity for large, internationally active banks. I will give my perspective on how these efforts have been informed by the lessons of the financial crisis and discuss what some of the likely consequences may be as these measures are put in place. Given the breadth of the changes, my remarks will be by no means complete. As always, my remarks reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe biggest lesson of the financial crisis is that severe financial disruptions can inflict very large and persistent costs on real economic activity and employment. Thus, lawmakers and regulators must make widespread changes to create a more resilient and robust global financial system. But, at the same time, this must be done in way that ensures the financial system retains sufficient dynamism so that it can allocate capital efficiently to support innovation and economic growth.\n\nThe crisis revealed a number of significant weaknesses in the global financial system. First, many leading financial institutions at the core of the system did not have enough high-quality capital to be able to retain access to private funding markets in the face of the large credit and mark-to-market losses. In particular, they often held grossly inadequate capital against their trading book exposures and the counterparty credit risk generated by activities such as their over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives business.\n\nSecond, individual firms and the system as a whole had inadequate liquidity buffers to withstand marketwide disruptions. Indeed, there was widespread overreliance on short-term funding to finance long-term illiquid assets. This was especially evident among the major securities dealers, which depended on tri-party repo funding to finance much of their securities inventories, and in the so-called shadow banking system, in which entities such as structured investment vehicles and conduits were dependent on short-term funding to finance their long-term assets. Banks that had provided liquidity guarantees to these shadow banks were in turn exposed to runs on those entities.\n\nThird, a lack of transparency exacerbated uncertainty about the creditworthiness of many institutions. Some of this was due to the complexity of the assets—collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), in particular, were very hard to value even in normal times. But, some of this was also due to the lack of transparency about certain markets—the OTC derivatives market for credit default swaps is one notable example.\n\nFourth, an inappropriate structure of incentives encouraged excessive risk-taking. This was evident within firms in the form of “the trader’s option,” in which compensation was based mainly on fiscal year results with no clawback when mark-to-market profits on illiquid securities and other assets turned into losses. It was also evident in the ability of the largest firms to benefit in terms of their funding costs via a perception that they would be “too big to fail.”\n\nFifth, regulators and market participants did not appreciate how the financial system was interconnected so that shocks were transmitted broadly through the financial system, often intensifying rather than dampening as they spread.\n\nThe severe economic costs generated by the crisis indicate that the primary goal must be to reduce the likelihood and the severity of future financial crises. To accomplish this, we need a financial system that is better suited to withstand shocks of all kinds, regardless of their source. We need a financial system in which market participants face the appropriate set of economic incentives so that they do not take excessive risks, but instead behave in ways that generate outcomes that are supportive to economic growth and ongoing financial stability. This requires financial institutions to internalize the costs of their risk-taking activities up front and to hold capital and liquidity buffers sufficient to handle a plausible range of adverse outcomes. Finally, on occasions when these buffers prove inadequate and a financial firm does reach the brink of failure, the official sector needs the capacity to smoothly wind down such firms so that future taxpayer-funded rescues prove unnecessary.\n\nRegulatory and supervisory efforts to accomplish these goals are proceeding down several distinct but related paths:\n\nTurning first to the Basel III capital and liquidity standards agreed upon by the Governors and Heads of Supervision Committee (GHOS) in Basel last month, I believe these standards address some of the major shortcomings revealed by the crisis. In particular, the new standards will require banking organizations to significantly increase the amount of high-quality, loss-absorbing capital that they hold; significantly improve risk capture in trading, counterparty credit, securitization and other activities that the prior regulatory capital requirements did not adequately capture; make it more expensive for banks to provide liquidity guarantees to shadow banks; constrain the leverage that banking companies can take by introducing a credible, non-risk-based backstop; and increase the capacity of banks to absorb shocks that might temporarily impede their ability to access short-term funding markets. While these changes apply directly only to large internationally active banks, they will have wider ramifications for the financial system as a whole, including nonbanks and the capital markets.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that the agreement achieves an appropriate balance between significantly increasing the minimum capital and liquidity requirements for the major banks, while doing so in a way that recognizes the current state of the global economy and that seeks to minimize adjustment costs. The international regulatory community consciously has been willing to trade off a relatively slow phase-in period for the new standards in order to reach a much higher level of standards.\n\nThe new capital rules are intended to provide strong incentives for banks to change their business models in ways that make the system more stable and reduce the negative impact their actions have on others—for instance, by providing incentives to standardize OTC derivatives contracts and clear such standardized trades through central counterparties. To understand what these new requirements mean for the amount of capital banks will ultimately have to hold, it is important to note that one of the intended consequences of these changes is for banks to adjust their business models in ways that reduce the risks their activities generate. This adjustment will likely reduce the amount of extra capital that banks would need relative to a world in which they kept their business models unchanged even as the new rules were phased in. In other words, the impact on banks must be evaluated dynamically, not by taking a snapshot of the banks’ activities and balance sheets today.\n\nThat said, the new capital standards are much tougher than the existing regime. The requirements have been strengthened in several different dimensions. First, the standards emphasize common equity by creating an explicit quantitative capital standard for this highest form of capital, as compared with an implicit qualitative standard under the previous rules. This is important because the crisis demonstrated that bank investors and debt holders have a strong presumption that only common equity is truly loss absorbing outside bankruptcy. In the crisis, as losses climbed, Tier 1 capital ratios were eroded from the bottom, with tangible common equity ratios sometimes shrinking to levels that raised questions about a bank’s viability and its ability to access the equity and debt markets. Although common equity is typically a higher-cost form of capital for banks, it absorbs losses on a going-concern basis and so preserves an institution's viability in the eyes of the market much better than other forms of Tier I capital, such as perpetual preferred stock or trust preferred securities (TRUPS).\n\nSecond, the standards create a new definition of what constitutes common equity. The emphasis is on the ability of common equity to be loss absorbing. For that reason, there are limits on the amount of the assets that are not readily saleable or loss absorbing that can be counted toward a bank’s tangible common equity. These include assets such as mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets. Also, there is strict treatment of equity tied up in the form of minority interests. That is because this invested equity is not immediately available to the parent company to absorb losses in that company’s operations.\n\nThird, the minimum required ratio of total tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets will be increased significantly. Once the new standards are fully phased in, it will have to equal 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.\n\nFourth, the measure of risk-weighted assets—the denominator of the capital adequacy ratio—is constructed to better capture the risks that banks are taking in their activities. For example, the risks weights on trading account assets and for counterparty exposures have been increased substantially to reflect the lessons of the crisis. Note that due to better capture of the underlying risks, at least initially, aggregate risk-weighted assets in the system are likely to increase. This is not because the inherent riskiness of bank balance sheets has increased, but rather because that riskiness will be better captured.\n\nIn addition to the 4.5 percent minimum common equity standard, there is also a new capital conservation buffer requirement equal to 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets. If a bank were to incur losses and fall deeper and deeper into this buffer, increasingly tough limitations would come into play in terms of the bank’s ability to make capital distributions by paying dividends or buying back shares. This capital conservation buffer is designed to forestall the type of behavior that we saw during the crisis—banks continuing to dissipate capital by paying out dividends in order to demonstrate that they were strong. Instead, banks will have an incentive to raise additional equity to exit the buffer and its restrictions on distributions.\n\nIn order to maintain operational flexibility in terms of their business operations and an ongoing ability to distribute capital to their shareholders, we expect that banks will want to maintain their level of tangible common equity at or above 7 percent, the sum of the minimum requirement and the conservation buffer. However, we do anticipate that the buffer may be penetrated from time to time during adverse economic environments.\n\nFinally, the risk-based ratios will be back-stopped by a new leverage ratio standard, which will constrain the amount of overall leverage that a banking organization can take relative to the sum of its non-risk-weighted assets and off-balance-sheet exposures.\n\nTogether, these changes represent a very significant upgrade of the standards: A much higher proportion of this ratio is now met by common equity; that common equity is much better quality than before; the amount of risk-weighted assets against which capital must be held has increased and better reflects underlying risk; a new capital conservation buffer is added, and there is a new backstop against excessive leverage.\n\nSo what were the considerations that went into constructing this new standard? The basic goal was to enable the big, internationally active banks covered by the Basel Accord to absorb the type of losses associated with a major marketwide financial shock and still retain sufficient market confidence so that they could continue to be able to fund themselves and, if necessary, to raise additional equity without the need for unusual government support.\n\nI believe that the requirements were the outgrowth of at least four major considerations:\n\n1. What type of losses could banks expect to occur in a crisis? In other words, how thick a buffer was needed to absorb shocks? This is represented by the 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer. Although this is not thick enough to protect every bank in every crisis, it does create a loss-absorbing cushion so that banks will retain their ability to access the capital markets even after incurring significant losses.\n\n2. How much common equity must a bank hold to be viewed as viable by financial market participants? This is important because beyond a certain point banks lose their access to the capital markets, and this makes failure much more likely. The 4.5 percent minimum common equity requirement is set at a high enough level so that a bank operating above this level would very likely still be able to access the capital markets to replenish its capital base after large losses.\n\n3. What was achievable internationally? It is important to have international convergence in terms of standards. This is necessary to minimize competitive inequity and to avoid creating incentives for a race to the bottom. If standards differed markedly around the world, then the conversation would inevitably shift to “what will help my banks competitively” from “what levels of capital do we need to have a sound financial system.”\n\n4. What is the appropriate tradeoff between benefits and costs? There are diminishing returns in terms of the benefits of ever higher capital requirements. Setting the bar at too high a level would increase intermediation costs too much and drive activities offshore or into areas that are not as closely regulated. At some point, higher requirements would not make the financial system safer, just the regulated sector much smaller.\n\nOn this last point, some argue that the new standards are too severe. They argue that, in the short run, the higher standards could lead to a significant constraint in credit that could hurt the nascent economic expansion. And, they argue, in the long run, that the higher capital standards will inevitably drive up lending costs and that this will hurt economic performance. Although I believe the new standards do impose some real costs on the financial system in order to achieve real benefits, I believe that concerns over the costs are exaggerated.\n\nTurning first to the issue of the transition to the new regime, we cannot precisely predict the size of the adjustment costs as they will depend importantly on the strategies bank managers employ to meet the new requirements, and how bank investors respond to these actions. Nonetheless, I believe the transition is likely to be quite manageable for three reasons.\n\nFirst, many of the large U.S. banks already have large amounts of tangible common equity. In part, this represents the regulatory response during the crisis. The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in 2009 required the large banks to have a capital buffer consistent with achieving a Tier I common ratio of 4 percent under a stress environment considerably worse than what was anticipated (or did, in fact, occur). Banks that fell short of this were forced to raise additional capital. On top of this, Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) repayment terms provided strong incentives for banks to issue common equity to repay the TARP preferred stock. In addition, several banks converted preferred stock into common equity. Roughly speaking, the 19 banks subject to the SCAP generated more than $100 billion of common equity via share issuance and $80 billion via conversion of preferred stock into common equity in 2009.\n\nSecond, as noted above, the standards are being phased in slowly. For example, in 2013, the tangible common equity standard will be only 3.5 percent. In 2013, there will be no conservation buffer requirement and banks will still get credit for items that will ultimately be deducted from common equity, such as deferred tax assets. The Federal Reserve, as the consolidated supervisor of the largest and most complex banking companies, does not expect these banks to meet the fully phased in standards today. Instead, the Federal Reserve will require firms to develop an adequate capital plan to meet the Basel III requirements as they become effective and will track progress toward meeting those plans over time.\n\nThird, banks have many ways they can adjust their business models to meet the new standards as they are phased in. Many of these changes can occur without any risk of disruption to the flow of credit to households and business. For instance, banks can sell non-strategic assets to investors and can modify their minority investments in non-consolidated interests. Low-quality legacy assets, such as subprime mortgage loans and second mortgages, will mature and run off. Risk-weighted assets will tend to fall as the economy recovers. Moreover, as banks book profits, deferred tax assets will shrink, reducing the magnitude of these future deductions from common equity.\n\nFinally, it is important to note the significant potential earnings power of large U.S. banks, which have historically tended to have higher rates of return on their average assets relative to many of their foreign counterparts. Banks that currently are short of the 2019 standard could retain these future earnings to build up their capital ratios. Equity analysts project that the 20 largest U.S. banks will earn more than $80 billion in 2010, and consensus estimates expect that figure will increase to around $110 billion in 2011. Of course, because these estimates are dependent on an economy that continues to recover, we need to be cautious about relying entirely on as-yet-unrealized earnings as the primary means to meet the higher capital standards.\n\nSo what about the long-run consequences? It would be prudent to assume that requiring banks to hold more capital and higher cost capital is likely to result in somewhat higher lending spreads. Bank managements will need to generate sufficient income to support the rate of return on equity at a sufficient high level so banks can continue to attract capital from investors.\n\nOf critical importance is whether the increase in lending spreads is likely to be large or not. Those who argue that the new capital standards will necessitate a large increase in lending spreads generally start with a rigid set of assumptions. These include: 1) Return on bank equity is unchanged; 2) the increase in bank equity does not affect funding costs; and 3) there is no change in the banks’ book of business or on banks’ ability and willingness to adjust other expenses, such as compensation.\n\nSuch rigid assumptions are unrealistic. This is particularly important because each assumption is likely to be wrong in the direction that reduces the impact on lending margins. First, the necessary return on equity that banks will have to generate to be able to attract capital will likely fall. Because banks with more capital should be safer and have less volatile earnings, investors should demand a lower return on equity than before.\n\nSecond, by increasing the soundness of banks, an increase in bank equity, everything else equal, should also reduce funding costs. Third, higher bank lending spreads almost certainly will push some activity into the capital markets, constraining the magnitude of the rise in total lending costs. Finally, banks may be forced via competitive pressures to lower their compensation levels. By cutting compensation costs, banks could have smaller lending margins and still earn sufficient profits to generate a level of returns necessary to attract capital. Given all the potential margins for adjustment, there are good reasons to expect that the increase in lending margins will actually turn out to be quite modest.\n\nAlthough any increase will be a real cost, this appears to be a necessary and appropriate price to pay for a much more resilient financial system. The cost represented by higher lending spreads has to be weighed against the benefits of a more robust and resilient banking system. Recent years have surely taught us that easy access to credit that is underpriced because it is not backed by sufficient capital is not a sustainable route to prosperity. Indeed, to the extent that tougher standards reduce the misallocation of resources in the real economy that often accompanies periods of financial excess, ensure more consistent access to finance over time and encourage investment by holding out the prospect of greater economic stability, the new standards could be consistent with a more rapid sustainable growth rate over the long run.\n\nTurning next to the new Basel liquidity requirement, the new standard will likely necessitate a significant adjustment in behavior for those banks that historically relied on short-term wholesale funding and those that had negligible buffers but instead had relied on the Federal Reserve and the Federal Home Loan Bank System to be their liquidity backstops. However, the transition costs are likely to be quite manageable because, as was the case for the capital standards, there are many margins available for adjustment.\n\nBefore I assess the transition costs of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) standard, a few words about what the LCR is intended to do and how it operates. The notion behind the LCR standard is that large, internationally active financial institutions should have a liquidity buffer that enables them to operate for 30 days in a stress environment without having to rely on government support, including central bank liquidity backstops. Banks would have to have sufficient liquid assets that they could sell to be able to meet outflows stemming from deposit withdrawals; bank debt that matures and is unable to be rolled over; and drawdowns from committed credit and liquidity facilities provided to financial firms and other entities. The size of the required liquidity buffer depends, in part, on the maturity of the bank’s assets and liabilities, the stickiness of its deposit liabilities, the amount of irrevocable liquidity backstops and composition of its assets.\n\nThe adjustment costs associated with the LCR standard should be low because, like capital, there are different, relatively low-cost ways to adjust to the standards. For example, because the liquidity buffer only needs to last for 30 days, a bank that extends the maturity of its short-term wholesale borrowing or its deposit liabilities by a month or two will find that this goes a long way in helping to meet this standard. Banks could also cut the level of their backstop liquidity lines and other commitments to financial firms. The standard assumes that such lines of credit can be fully drawn upon and thus, count as potential draws against the buffer.\n\nBecause the common international liquidity standards are relatively untested, regulators are implementing LCR with an “observation period.” What this means is that unanticipated and unintended consequences generated by the new liquidity standard will be closely scrutinized and, if necessary, adjustments will be made to the rules if undesirable effects become evident over time. For example, the tough requirements on backstop liquidity lines could potentially be modified if such rules generated unintended negative consequences for short-term corporate funding markets, such as the nonfinancial corporate commercial paper market.\n\nMoving on from the changes to capital and liquidity standards, I now want to discuss how firms, markets and the official sector deal with distress in the event that it does occur. Of paramount importance in making the financial system more robust is the need for a viable resolution mechanism for large, complex financial firms. The Dodd-Frank Act does this for the nonbank operations of systemically important U.S. financial firms by authorizing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), under certain conditions, to establish a “bridge” bank to liquidate the troubled firm’s operations in an orderly manner. Any net outlays incurred by the FDIC in this process must be recovered by assessing levies on the financial industry.\n\nThis resolution process is beneficial because an orderly resolution prevents the type of catastrophic collapse that leads to widespread market disruption. And it does so in a way that taxpayer funds are not at risk. However, much work needs to be done so that market participants can understand how such resolutions would work in practice. In particular, there will be some uncertainty about the precise conditions that will trigger a resolution under Title II of DFA. Even after DFA, the alternative of a normal Bankruptcy Code filing remains. In fact, DFA requires an evaluation as to why a filing under the Bankruptcy Code is not appropriate. In addition, the Dodd-Frank resolution process is complex, requiring multiple steps.\n\nMoreover, the resolution regime in Title II of Dodd Frank could be very difficult to implement for complex, globally active firms. These banks operate in diverse legal regimes worldwide and it is very doubtful that DFA will apply to these banks’ operations outside the United States.\n\nOne approach to this problem would be to harmonize the diverse insolvency laws in the various jurisdictions in which globally active firms have significant operations. But achieving this objective will be hard and take many years at a minimum.\n\nThis is one reason to require additional loss-absorbing capacity for systemically important firms, most (if not all) of which tend to be complex global organizations. Such a surcharge would be a mechanism to reduce the probability of failure for such firms below that of smaller firms.\n\nA surcharge for systemically important financial institutions has two motivations. First, it compensates for the distortion created by the fact that a large financial firm may still be resolved differently than smaller firms and that this could conceivably, by being an orderly resolution process, reduce the costs imposed upon creditors. To the extent creditors see this as a benefit, this might enable large banks to retain some funding advantage over smaller firms not likely to be resolved in the same fashion. Second, it recognizes the large costs imposed on the broader financial system by the failure of systemically important banks.\n\nSuch an approach is being pursued both internationally and in the United States. The recent Governors and Heads of Supervision meeting in Basel, for example, endorsed additional loss-absorbing capacity for systemically important firms. Similarly, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the Federal Reserve shall establish prudential standards for systemically important financial companies, including capital and liquidity standards that are “more stringent” than for other institutions that do not present systemic risk.\n\nStrengthening financial market infrastructures is another important initiative underway to make the financial system more resilient and robust. In this regard, there are two important strands of work underway. First, there is strong momentum both in the United States and abroad to require that standardized OTC derivative products be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs) and that the information associated with all OTC derivatives trades be reported to trade repositories, with this information then being available to regulators around the world.\n\nSecond, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) are undertaking a review of international standards for financial market infrastructures. This review will lead to a comprehensive set of recommendations as to what constitutes best practice with respect to the operations of financial market infrastructures. These recommendations will apply to a broad array of financial market infrastructures, including CCPs and trade repositories. The final report will be completed during the first half of 2011. The goal will be to have these standards endorsed by the Financial Stability Board and the G-20 leaders. With those endorsements, it should be possible to harden the recommendations into more substantial standards.\n\nIn all of the reforms that we are implementing it is important that we pay close attention to the shadow banking system. By shadow banks, I mean the largely unregulated financial entities that take credit risk and/or engage in maturity transformation without access to explicit governmental backstops such as the Federal Reserve’s discount window and or deposit insurance. As we saw in the crisis, without such support, these institutions are vulnerable to runs. When this occurred, the shadow banking sector imploded in a way that imposed significant costs on the regulated sector.\n\nThe risk is that tighter capital and liquidity requirements for the large financial institutions could push much of the business of credit intermediation and maturity transformation from the regulated sector to the unregulated sector. However, this risk is mitigated by the fact that shadow banks heavily rely on credit support and liquidity lines from the regulated sector. The costs of such facilities will be affected by the new capital and liquidity standards for banks. Thus, the economics of the shadow-banking sector are likely to change in a way that makes such activities less attractive. In addition, by increasing transparency and requiring some risk retention by issuers, Dodd-Frank should make the securitization markets in which shadow banks operate less likely to support poorly underwritten credit. Taken together, these changes mean it is less likely that there will be widespread movement of credit and maturity transformation from the regulated sector to the unregulated sector. Nonetheless, as my colleague Governor Tarullo noted in a recent speech, 1 more will need to be done to increase the stability of the unregulated sector, and developments in this area will need to be scrutinized carefully in the years ahead.\n\nBefore closing, let me reiterate the importance to achieve harmonized global standards. As noted earlier, this is important for competitive equity reasons. But more importantly, it is necessary to ensure that banks and other financial firms cannot move their activities to evade regulation. If that were to occur, we would just have a race to the bottom and a less transparent and even more complex financial system.\n\nIn this respect, it is important that we regulate the U.S. operations of foreign banks in a way that is consistent with how U.S. banks are treated. It is also important that we work for the same type of national treatment abroad, and when there are differences in regulatory regimes, that we find ways of reducing or eliminating the substantive differences over time.\n\nFinally, it is important that we clarify the responsibilities of the home and host countries and work to better share information across the regulatory community. This can help ensure that regulatory decisions are made and applied in a consistent and fair manner. It is also my hope that by establishing a robust global regime, we can mitigate the incentives for national regulators and supervisors to impose local rules that make it hard for globally active institutions to manage their operations on a global basis, thereby undermining the global integration of markets that has supported economic globalization.\n\nOver the next 12 to 18 months, regulators will be particularly busy in implementing these reform efforts. Broad legal statutes now have to be turned into specific rules and regulations governing business practices, conduct and operations. Doing this well—in particular, in a way that is sufficiently informed, deep and broad—will be very important. Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act are important markers on this road, but it will always be a journey to a never-reached destination of perfection.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________ 1 Governor Daniel K.

    "text": "Welcome to our Economic Press Briefing.  Today we are going to introduce you to a data  product that we have been making available to the public, U.S. Economy in a Snapshot .  My  role is to put this product in the broader context of the Federal Open Market  Committee’s (FOMC) communication strategy about the economy and policy.  My colleague Robert Rich will then walk you  through the structure of the product and discuss excerpts from the May release.   As always, what I have to say reflects  my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or  the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nConventional U.S. monetary  policy is conducted by targeting the level of the federal funds rate—an  overnight interest rate on bank reserves.  Few participants in our economy have any  direct interaction with this interest rate.  How, then, is controlling this interest rate  such an important part of setting monetary policy and steering an 18 trillion  dollar economy toward the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives of maximum  sustainable employment and price stability?\n\nThis is the remarkable aspect of  monetary policy.  Just as a pebble  dropped into a lake disturbs the water not just at the point of impact but  ripples outward far from the origin, changes in the federal funds rate  influence the prices of financial assets more broadly and this, in turn,  affects the broader economy.  An  important insight of modern monetary theory is that this transmission of  monetary policy to the broader economy through its many channels works best  when the central bank is transparent about its goals, policy strategy and  approach to implementing its strategy.  In this case, market participants and  households both understand and can anticipate actions by the central bank.  By doing so, the transmission channels of  monetary policy are enhanced.  This  places considerable importance on effective central bank communication.\n\nRecognizing this, the FOMC has  undertaken many initiatives over the years to improve its communications with  the public.  These include providing  clarification in terms of the goals of monetary policy, discussions of the  FOMC’s broad policy strategy, as well as FOMC participants’ ongoing  explanations of their views on monetary policy.  As part of this effort, I provide a  comprehensive update on my outlook for the economy and monetary policy several  times during the year.  Once a year we  publish our staff’s judgmental economic forecast.  We have also provided in the Liberty Street Economics blog discussions  of an internal staff model-based economic forecast.  In addition, we now regularly release our  real-time forecast of “current quarter” real GDP growth.  All of these help the public to understand our  assessment of economic conditions through the lenses of these different types  of forecasts.\n\nWhen asked about the trajectory  for the monetary policy stance, I always point out that it is data dependent.  The FOMC calibrates the stance of monetary  policy to best achieve our twin objectives of price stability and maximum  sustainable employment, taking into account our forecast for how the economy is  evolving.  This forecast reflects the  ongoing flow of the data.  Data releases  that are close to our expectations have little additional impact on the  forecast, while data releases that deviate significantly from our expectations  can lead to more significant revisions of the forecast.  It is, therefore, important for market  participants and households to be able to follow the data along with the FOMC  and to understand how we are likely to interpret and react to incoming data.\n\nWhile market analysts readily have  access to economic and financial data, this access is not widely available to  everyone.  To help fill this information  gap, for the past year we have been making available on our website a monthly  publication called U.S. Economy in a  Snapshot .  This publication contains  a set of key data charts as well as commentary by our staff economists.  The purpose is to provide interested readers  easy access to clear and concise presentations of important economic  information.  The associated commentary  provides some pertinent observations one might draw from the data.\n\nOur goal is to provide  information that helps households and businesses follow the data along with the  Fed.  If people know more about how the  economy is performing and how that is likely to influence our actions, this  should make it easier for us to achieve our twin objectives.\n\nI will now turn it over to Rob  to discuss the Snapshot in greater  detail.\n\n1 Jonathan McCarthy, Paolo Pesenti, Robert Rich and Joseph Tracy assisted in  preparing these remarks.",

    "text": "Good morning, and welcome to the  New York Fed’s Economic Press Briefing .   I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak with you today about our Survey of Consumer Expectations .  This is  an important source of information that we use in our analysis of current and  future economic conditions to help inform our monetary policy decisions.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own  views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the  Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nIn pursuing its monetary policy  objectives, the Federal Reserve relies on a large number of data sources that  provide information about recent developments and the current state of the  economy.  Most of these data sources are  backward looking.  That is, they provide  data about past decisions and outcomes.   In contrast, we know relatively little about the forward-looking  subjective expectations and intentions of economic agents, which are a key  determinant of current and future outcomes.   This information, though, is essential for formulating policy and  evaluating its effectiveness.  The  macroeconomic outcomes we observe reflect preferences and constraints, as well  as beliefs of individual consumers and firms.   Therefore, a fuller understanding of such outcomes requires reliable  data on the beliefs and intentions held by economic agents and how they evolve  over time.  In particular, consumer  expectations influence a variety of considerations, including spending and  saving behavior, wage dynamics, job search, housing demand and the demand for  credit.  Given their importance in  determining U.S. economic activity, consumer expectations are of particular  value in assessing the economic outlook and the related risks.\n\nOver the last decade, we have  devoted significant resources to improving the measurement of the economic  expectations of households.  This work  culminated in the creation of the Survey of Consumer Expectations, or SCE, in  2013.  The expectations data collected in  our survey give us direct insight into households’ decision-making and  consumers’ financial and economic outlooks.  While we monitor expectations on a number of  topics, of particular importance are households’ medium-term inflation  expectations.  Having reliable measures  of inflation expectations is crucial to assess the effectiveness of monetary  policy and central bank communications.   Such an assessment focuses on analyzing the extent to which longer-run  inflation expectations remain well-anchored, and on learning more about how  agents update and revise their expectations in response to new information. The  SCE allows us to carry out this sort of analysis.\n\nBesides their obvious policy  relevance, the SCE data are also highly valuable for research.  Our economists have shown that the SCE’s  expectations data are informative and predictive of respondents’ current and  future behavior.  They have also  documented the substantial heterogeneity in the formation and updating of  expectations across demographic groups.   To facilitate further research, we make the survey data available in the  Center for Microeconomic Data section of our website.  Each month we also illustrate the trends in  our expectations series through easy-to-use, interactive charts.  Further, a number of our Liberty Street  Economics blog posts describe the data and the analysis we have conducted.  We do this because we want researchers,  policymakers, commentators and the general public to understand the data and to  follow our updates.\n\nLet me now describe our Survey of  Consumer Expectations in more detail.\n\nThe Survey of  Consumer Expectations\n\nFollowing extensive design and  testing, we launched the Survey of Consumer Expectations in June 2013.  The survey has a number of innovative and  unique features, three of which I would like to highlight today.  First and foremost, as I mentioned earlier,  it collects households’ subjective expectations and intentions on a wide range  of economic outcomes and behaviors.  In  addition to short- and medium-term inflation expectations, it collects data on  households’ expectations regarding the housing, labor and credit markets, as  well as households’ financial situations and a host of other macroeconomic  variables of interest.  For example, the  survey elicits beliefs about future wage growth, house price appreciation, job  search and labor market transitions, households’ spending and income growth,  and credit applications.  By collecting  data on a broad range of expectations, it is possible to analyze how they interact  with each other and jointly influence households’ decisions.  We also study how expectations vary with  demographics and other household characteristics.\n\nThe broad scope of the SCE allows  us to study many questions relevant to economic policy—such as understanding  housing market decisions, disentangling credit demand from supply, analyzing  job search behavior and measuring wage growth as people transition between  jobs.  In addition, the survey has been  used to help answer other policy-relevant questions as they have come up in our  discussions.  Two examples are  households’ spending response to the decrease in gas prices in early 2014, and  households’ early experiences and perceptions of the Affordable Care Act  following its enactment.  Some of this  analysis relies on the ability of our survey to shed light on whether consumers  expect a specific change in economic conditions to be temporary or permanent.\n\nA second important feature of the  survey is that—in addition to simple point forecasts—for some variables, such  as inflation, we get respondents’ entire forecast distributions by asking them  to assign probabilities to various ranges of future outcomes.  These so-called density forecasts in turn  allow us to measure households’ uncertainty about future events by looking at  the spread in their subjective distributions.   Density forecasts also allow us to monitor the perceived likelihood that  respondents assign to specific events, such as deflation or a large increase in  earnings.\n\nA third important characteristic of  the SCE is that it is a rotating panel.   Each month about 1,300 household heads participate in our survey.  This is a nationally representative sample.  Respondents remain on the panel for up to 12 months, with a constant fraction  entering and rotating out each month.   This allows us to monitor the expectations of the same respondents over  time, which provides important benefits.   First, it gives us greater confidence that month-to-month changes in our  headline numbers reflect true changes in beliefs, and not just changes in the  sample composition.  Second, observing  repeated responses by the same individuals allows us to examine how  expectations are formed and revised over time.   Third, by following the same people over time, we are able to study how  expectations are related to contemporaneous and future economic decisions and  outcomes for these respondents.\n\nToday the SCE team will provide  further background about the survey, discuss newly released findings for  October and recent trends in some of its main indicators.  The team will then present findings from two  special components of the SCE: one that covers households’ credit experiences  and expectations, and one that deals with labor market behavior and  expectations.  Before I pass this on to  my colleagues, I would like to comment briefly on these two special surveys.\n\nNew findings on  Credit Access\n\nThe SCE Credit Access Survey supplements the information collected in the Federal Reserve Board’s Senior  Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, also known as  SLOOS.  The SLOOS is a primary source of  information on credit standards and credit demand as perceived and reported by banks .   In contrast, the SCE Credit Access Survey, which has been conducted at a  four-month frequency since October 2013, measures experiences in credit markets as perceived by households .  The combination of the two data sources  provides a more complete picture of household credit access and demand.  Today, we are releasing the October 2016  findings as well as introducing new data from the survey.\n\nA unique feature of the SCE is its  measure of latent credit demand—that is, demand that does not lead to an  application for credit.  We measure this  latent credit demand as the proportion of households who report that, while  needing credit, they did not apply because they expected their application to  be rejected.  In addition to current  credit experiences, we also elicit households’ expectations of their future  credit applications and the likelihood of these applications being  approved.  As we will show later, the  survey provides useful insights into the extent and variation in met and unmet  credit needs across households.   Moreover, our analysis indicates that reported expectations are indeed  predictive of credit outcomes reported four months later.\n\nNew Findings on  Job Search\n\nWhile the SCE Credit Access Survey  allows us to track credit market experiences and expectations, the SCE Labor  Market Survey gathers information on the job search behavior and expectations  of employed and unemployed respondents.   Aggregate labor market statistics on earnings, employment and labor  market transitions are readily available, yet relatively little is known about  the expectations and search behaviors of labor market participants and how  these change over time.  Our SCE Labor  Market Survey collects rich information on respondents’ actual and expected  wage offers, as well as their reservation wage, which is the lowest wage or  salary they say they would accept for a new job.  We also elicit expectations about future  labor market transitions, such as the likelihood of staying with the same  employer, switching employers, finding a job or being laid off.\n\nOver time,  changes in responses to these questions can shed light on how workers’  expectations evolve, and how these changes relate to observed trends in  aggregate earnings and employment dynamics. Our preliminary analyses of the  data suggest that these expectations measures are predictive of respondents’  subsequent labor market outcomes. In coming years, as we generate a longer time  series for the survey, we will be able to explore whether the expectations we  collect can be used to construct leading indicators of the job market.\n\nNow, I'd like to turn things over to our economists,  beginning with Olivier Armantier, who will provide further background and  specifics about our survey.\n\n1 Olivier  Armantier, Giorgio  Topa, Joseph Tracy, Wilbert van der Klaauw and Basit Zafar assisted in  preparing these remarks.",

    "text": "In my talk, I'll argue that the economic outlook has improved considerably. Despite this, we are still very far away from achieving our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. Faster progress toward these objectives would be very welcome and need not require an early change in the stance of monetary policy.\n\nHowever, I'll also focus on some issues with respect to inflation that will merit careful monitoring. In particular, we need to keep a close watch on how households and businesses respond to commodity price pressures. The key issue here is whether the rise in commodity prices will unduly push up inflation expectations.\n\nInflation expectations are well-anchored today and we intend to keep it that way. A sustained rise in medium-term inflation expectations would represent a threat to our price stability mandate and would not be tolerated.\n\nTurning first to the economic outlook, the situation looks considerably brighter than six months ago. On the activity side, a wide range of indicators show a broadening and strengthening of demand and production. For example, on the demand side, real personal consumption expenditures rose at a 4.1 percent annual rate during the fourth quarter. This compares with only a 2.2 percent annual rate during the first three quarters of 2010 ( Chart 1 ). Orders and production are following suit. For example, the Institute of Supply Management index of new orders for manufacturers climbed to 67.8 in January, the highest level since January of 2004 ( Chart 2 ).\n\nThe revival in activity, in turn, has been accompanied by improving consumer and business confidence. For example, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 77.5 in February, up from 68.9 six months earlier ( Chart 3 ).\n\nIndeed, the 2.8 percent annualized growth rate of real gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter may understate the economy's forward momentum. That is because real GDP growth in the quarter was held back by a sharp slowing in the pace of inventory accumulation. The revival in demand, production and confidence strongly suggests that we may be much closer to establishing a virtuous circle in which rising demand generates more rapid income and employment growth, which in turn bolsters confidence and leads to further increases in spending. The only major missing piece of the puzzle is the absence of strong payroll employment growth. We will need to see sustained strong employment growth in order to be certain that this virtuous circle has become firmly established.\n\nWith respect to the labor market, there are conflicting signals. On one hand, the unemployment rate has fallen sharply over the past two months, dropping to 9.0 percent from 9.8 percent two months earlier ( Chart 4 ). This is the biggest two-month drop in the unemployment rate since November of 1958. On the other hand, payroll employment gains have remained very modest—rising by only 83,000 per month over the last three months ( Chart 5 ). Such modest payroll growth is not consistent with a sustained drop in the unemployment rate.\n\nThe true story doubtless lies somewhere in between—but probably more on the side of the household survey that tracks unemployment. That is because measured payroll employment growth in January was probably temporarily depressed by unusually bad winter weather. Although some of the recent decline in unemployment is due to a drop in the number of people actively seeking work, the household survey does show a pick-up in hiring. Other labor market indicators, such as initial claims and the employment components of the ISM surveys for manufacturing and nonmanufacturing, have also shown improvement recently ( Chart 6 and Chart 7 ), which suggests that the weakness in payroll growth is the outlier.\n\nAlthough there is uncertainty over the timing and speed of the labor market recovery, I do expect that payroll employment growth will increase considerably more rapidly in the coming months. We should welcome this. A substantial pickup is needed. Even if we were to generate growth of 300,000 jobs per month, we would still likely have considerable slack in the labor market at the end of 2012.\n\nIn monitoring employment trends, we also need to recognize that the data are likely to be quite noisy on a month-to-month basis. This is particularly the case during the winter months, when weather can play an important role. Recall, for example, the aftermath of the blizzard of 1996 in the Northeast when the February payroll employment count was originally reported as rising by 705,000 workers. It will be important not to overreact to monthly data but to focus on the underlying trend.\n\nSo why is the economy finally showing more signs of life? In my view, the improvement reflects three developments. First, household and financial institution balance sheets continue to improve. On the household side, the saving rate, which moved up sharply in 2008 and 2009, appears to have stabilized in the 5 percent to 6 percent range. Meanwhile, debt service burdens have fallen sharply to levels that prevailed during the mid-1990s. Debt service has been pushed lower by a combination of debt repayment, refinancing at lower interest rates and debt write-offs ( Chart 8 ). Financial institutions have strengthened their balance sheets by retaining earnings and by issuing equity. For many larger institutions, a release of loan loss reserves has been important in supporting earnings. Credit availability has improved somewhat as very tight standards start to loosen ( Chart 9 ). As a result, some measures of bank credit are beginning to expand again ( Chart 10 ).\n\nSecond, monetary policy and fiscal policy have provided support to the recovery. On the monetary policy side, the unusually low level of short-term interest rates and the Federal Reserve's large-scale asset purchase programs (LSAPs) have fostered a sharp improvement in financial market conditions. Since August 2010, for example, when market participants began to anticipate that the Federal Reserve would initiate another LSAP, U.S. equity prices have risen sharply and credit spreads have narrowed ( Chart 11 and Chart 12 ). Long-term interest rates have moved higher after initially declining, but this does not appear troublesome as it primarily reflects the brightening economic outlook.\n\nOn the fiscal side, the economy has been supported by the shift in policy toward near-term accommodation. In particular, the temporary reduction in payroll taxes is providing substantial support to real disposable income and consumption. This could have a particularly strong impact on growth during the first part of the year.\n\nThird, growth abroad—especially among emerging market economies—has been strong and this has led to an increase in the demand for U.S.-made goods and services. Over the four quarters of 2010 real exports rose 9.2 percent ( Chart 13 ). After a disappointing performance earlier in the year, U.S. net exports surged in the fourth quarter ( Chart 14 ).\n\nThe firming in economic activity, in short, is due both to natural healing and past and present policy support.\n\nIn this regard, it important to emphasize that we did expect growth to strengthen. We provided additional monetary policy stimulus via the asset purchase program in order to help ensure the recovery did regain momentum. A stronger recovery with more rapid progress toward our dual mandate objectives is what we have been seeking. This is welcome and not a reason to reverse course.\n\nWe also have to be careful not to be overly optimistic about the growth outlook. The coast is not completely clear—the healing process in the aftermath of the crisis takes time and there are still several areas of vulnerability and weakness. In particular, housing activity remains unusually weak and home prices have begun to soften again in many parts of the country ( Chart 15 and Chart 16 ). State and local government finances remain under stress, and this is likely to lead to further fiscal consolidation and job losses in this sector that will offset at least a part of the federal fiscal stimulus ( Chart 17 ). And we cannot rule out the possibility of further shocks from abroad, whether in the form of stress in sovereign debt markets or geopolitical events. Higher oil prices act as a tax on disposable income, and the situation in the Middle East remains uncertain and dynamic. Also, we cannot ignore the risks stemming from the longer-term fiscal challenges that we face in the United States.\n\nBut in the near-term, the most immediate domestic problems may recede rather than become more prevalent. On the housing side, stronger employment growth should lead to increased household formation, which should provide more support to housing demand. And anxieties about the large overhang of unsold homes represented by the foreclosure pipeline may overstate the magnitude of the excess supply of housing. Families that have lost their homes through foreclosures are likely to seek new homes as their income permits, even though many may re-enter the housing market as renters rather than buyers. On the state and local side, a rising economy should boost sales and income tax revenue and help narrow near-term fiscal shortfalls. 1\n\nMoreover, although we do need to remain ever-watchful for signs that low interest rates could foster a buildup of financial excesses or bubbles that might pose a medium-term risk to both full employment and price stability, risk premia on U.S. financial assets do not appear unduly compressed at this juncture.\n\nOn the inflation side of the ledger, there are some signs that core inflation is now stabilizing. However, both headline and core inflation remain below levels consistent with our dual mandate objectives—which most members of the FOMC consider to be 2 percent or a bit less on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) measure.\n\nRecent evidence shows that the large amount of slack in the economy has contributed to disinflation over the past couple of years. This can be seen in the steady decline in core inflation between mid-2008 and the end of 2010. As shown in Chart 18 , core PCE inflation in December had risen at just 0.7 percent on a year-over-year basis, down from 2.5 percent in mid-2008. Slack in our economy is still very large, and this will continue to be a factor that acts to dampen price pressures.\n\nNevertheless, there are several reasons why we need to be careful about inflation even in an environment of ample spare capacity. First, commodity prices have been rising rapidly ( Chart 19 ). This has already increased headline inflation relative to core inflation, and the commodity price changes that have already taken place will almost certainly continue to push the headline rate on year-over-year basis higher over the next few months. Second, some of this pressure could feed into core inflation. Third, medium-term inflation expectations have recently risen back to levels consistent with our dual mandate objectives ( Chart 20 ). If medium-term inflation expectations were to move significantly higher from here on a sustained basis, that would pose a risk to inflation and, thus, would have important implications for monetary policy.\n\nWith respect to the inflation outlook, I think there are four important questions that deserve attention.\n\nWith respect to the first question, the economy retains a very large amount of slack by virtually all measures. For example, last month the industrial capacity utilization rate was 76.1 percent. This compares with a long-term average of 80.9 percent ( Chart 21 ). Similarly, the current unemployment rate of 9 percent is well above most estimates of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU)—the lowest rate of unemployment consistent with sustained price stability.\n\nIn the pre-crisis period, the NAIRU was likely in the region of 4.5 percent to 5 percent. There are several reasons why the NAIRU may now be higher. First, extended unemployment compensation benefits create incentives for prospective workers to keep looking for better jobs rather than accept less attractive positions. Empirical work on this subject suggests that the NAIRU might currently be roughly 1 percentage point higher because of this factor. However, this effect will only persist for as long as the extended benefits are in place.\n\nSecond, the rise in unemployment has been associated with an increase in the degree of mismatch between unemployed workers' job skills and available job vacancies. Some cite the upward shift in the Beveridge curve, which illustrates the relationship between unemployment and job vacancies ( Chart 22 ), as evidence of this effect.\n\nThird, the longer that people are unemployed, the more their skills tend to atrophy, which makes it harder for them to become employed in the future. For unemployed workers, the median duration of unemployment has climbed and a growing proportion of the unemployed has been jobless for long periods ( Chart 23 ).\n\nIn my view, these last two factors have probably pushed up the NAIRU by 0.5 to 1 percentage point on top of the about 1 percentage point effect of extended unemployment benefits, which is likely to be a temporary effect. Taken together, this suggests that the current NAIRU might be between 6 percent and 7 percent.\n\nAlthough undesirable, this rise should not create concern about the medium-term inflation outlook. First, even the higher estimate of NAIRU is still far below the current unemployment rate of 9 percent. Second, as discussed above, much of this rise is likely to be temporary rather than permanent. As the labor market improves, the extension of unemployment claims benefits will almost certainly be allowed to lapse. When this occurs, the NAIRU is likely to drop back to somewhere in the region of 5 percent to 6 percent.\n\nThird, some of the evidence that the NAIRU has increased is not particularly compelling. For example, the loop in the Beveridge curve that is evident now has been seen in past business cycles—cycles in which there was no persistent rise in the NAIRU. This strongly suggests that the rise in job mismatch has a cyclical component. Fourth, the 9 percent unemployment rate may understate the amount of labor market slack. That is because the labor participation rate has fallen sharply.\n\nIn my view, the large gap between the current unemployment rate and the long-run NAIRU suggests there is little payoff from investing much energy to more precisely estimate the NAIRU. As the economy expands and the unemployment rate falls, we will have plenty of time to be able to refine our estimates of NAIRU in light of what happens to labor cost trends such as the employment cost index, and to unit labor costs. Currently, all these measures are quiescent and consistent with a large amount of labor market slack ( Chart 24 ).\n\nThe second question is whether the economy could grow so fast that inflation pressures could rise even with an unemployment rate still well above the NAIRU. The notion is that at very fast growth rates wages and prices might have to rise in order to funnel labor and capital to those areas where demand and output were rising particularly rapidly.\n\nAlthough this possibility shouldn't be ruled out, we should not be too worried about this, particularly if growth is broadly based. In particular, the economy is not growing quickly right now relative to past recoveries. For example, in the rebound from the comparably deep early 1980s recession, the annualized growth rate exceeded 7 percent for five consecutive quarters. Moreover, empirically there is little historical evidence that discontinuous “speed limit” effects play a significant role in influencing inflation in the United States.\n\nThe third issue is whether the rise in commodity prices will turn out to be persistent and, if so, how this might impact the inflation outlook. Recently, commodity prices have risen sharply. For example, the spot GSCI—a broad measure of commodity prices—has risen more than 35 percent over the past year. This was in train before the upheavals in the Middle East raised market concerns about potential disruption to oil supplies, pushing energy prices—though not other commodity prices—still higher. Commodity price pressures are pushing measures of headline inflation above measures of core inflation, which exclude food and energy prices. How worried should policymakers be about this development?\n\nAlthough there have been commodity price cycles in the past, commodity prices have not consistently increased relative to other prices, and indeed have declined in relative terms over the very long term. Historically, if commodity prices rose sharply in a given year, it has been reasonable to expect that these prices would stabilize or fall within a year or two. This property has been important because it has meant that measures of current “core” inflation, rather than current headline inflation, have been more reliable in predicting future headline inflation rates.\n\nIn contrast, over the past decade, commodity prices generally have been on an upward trend. For example, as shown in Chart 25 , fuel prices have generally been in a rising trend since 1999 and non-fuel prices since 2001—both trends interrupted temporarily by the financial crisis.\n\nSetting to one side the near-term effects of geopolitical developments, the rapid urbanization and industrialization of nations such as China and India could be generating an ongoing secular rise in commodity prices that might not be fully captured in today's spot and futures market prices. If so, this would undercut the role of core inflation as a good predictor of future headline inflation.\n\nNevertheless, there are important mitigating factors that suggest that it would be unwise for the Federal Reserve to over-react to recent commodity price pressures. First, despite the general uptrend, some of the recent commodity price pressures are likely to be temporary. In particular, much of the most recent rise in food prices is due to a sharp drop in production caused by poor weather rather than a surge in consumption ( Chart 26 ). More typical weather and higher prices should generate a rise in production that should push prices somewhat lower. This is certainly what is anticipated by market participants, as shown in Chart 27 .\n\nSecond, even if commodity price pressures were to prove persistent, the U.S. situation differs markedly from that of many other countries. Relative to most other major economies, the U.S. inflation rate is lower and the amount of slack much greater.\n\nMoreover, for the United States, commodities represent a relatively small share of the consumption basket ( Chart 28 ). This small share helps to explain why the pass-through of commodity prices into core measures of inflation has been very low in the United States for several decades.\n\nThird, the Federal Reserve's success in anchoring inflation expectations has also been important in limiting pass-through. Since 1984, for example, when the Federal Reserve began to achieve success in driving down and then subsequently anchoring long-term inflation expectations, there has been very little evidence of commodity price pass-through into core inflation. In contrast, prior to 1984, when inflation expectations were much less well-anchored, pass-through did occur and, at times, played an important role in pushing underlying inflation higher.\n\nThis leads to our final issue—the importance of inflation expectations in shaping the inflation outlook.\n\nRising inflation expectations tends to push up inflation in a number of ways—by reducing the expected cost of borrowing at a given level of interest rates, by pulling forward buying decisions to beat future expected price increases, and by encouraging more aggressive price and wage setting behavior. In a world of unanchored inflation expectations, commodity price pressures would more easily be passed through into core inflation.\n\nFortunately, inflation expectations remain well-anchored. This can be seen in all three major measures of inflation expectations. First, market-based measures of inflation expectations are generally well-behaved. For example, the five-year forward measure of breakeven inflation generated from differences in the nominal Treasury yield curve and the TIPS yield curve has shown a modest rise since mid-2010 back into the range that has generally been in place for the past decade ( Chart 29 ). Second, the long-term inflation expectations of professional forecasters have been very stable. As shown in Chart 30 , the median long-term inflation forecast in the Professional Forecasters' survey remains around 2.1 percent for the PCE deflator. In terms of household expectations, there has been an increase in short-term expectations. This typically occurs when commodities such as gasoline go up sharply in price. However, even here longer-term expectations remain well-anchored. As shown in Chart 31 , the University of Michigan median five-year inflation expectations measure remains around 2.9 percent—comfortably within its normal range and historically consistent with slightly lower realized inflation.\n\nTo summarize the main points, we have a considerable amount of slack, little evidence of discontinuous speed limit effects, and little inflation pass-through from commodities into core inflation when inflation expectations are well-anchored, which is currently the case. This suggests that the biggest risk in terms of higher underlying inflation over the next year or two is that inflation expectations could become unanchored. This might occur, for example, if there were a loss of confidence in the ability and/or willingness of the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy in a timely way in order to keep inflation in check.\n\nIn this regard, the proof of the pudding will be in our actions—talk is cheap. What is key—that the appropriate policy steps are taken in a timely manner.\n\nHowever, let me make two points. First, I am very confident that the enlarged Federal Reserve balance sheet will not compromise our ability to tighten monetary policy when needed consistent with our dual mandate goals. Second, I am equally confident that no one on the FOMC is willing to countenance a sustained rise in either inflation expectations or inflation.\n\nLet me explain why our enlarged balance sheet does not compromise our ability to tighten monetary policy. Although our enlarged balance sheet has led to a sharp rise in excess reserves in the banking system, this has the potential to spur inflation only if banks lend out these reserves in a manner that generates a rapid expansion of credit and an associated sharp rise in economic activity. The ability of the Federal Reserve to pay interest on excess reserves (IOER) provides a means to prevent such excessive credit growth.\n\nBecause the Federal Reserve is the safest of counterparties, the IOER rate is effectively the risk-free rate. By raising that rate, the Federal Reserve can raise the cost of credit more generally. That is because banks will not lend at rates below the IOER rate when they can instead hold their excess reserves on deposit with the Fed and earn that risk-free rate. In this way, the Federal Reserve can drive up the rate at which banks are willing to lend to more risky borrowers, restraining the demand for credit and preventing credit from growing sufficiently rapidly to fuel an inflationary spiral.\n\nFor this dynamic to work correctly, the Federal Reserve needs to set an IOER rate consistent with the amount of required reserves, money supply and credit outstanding needed to achieve its dual mandate of full employment and price stability. If the demand for credit were to exceed what was appropriate, the Federal Reserve would raise the IOER rate—pushing up the federal funds rate and other short term rates—to tighten broader financial conditions and reduce demand. 2 If the demand for credit were insufficient to push the economy to full employment, then the Federal Reserve would reduce the IOER rate—pushing down the fed funds rate and other short term rates—to ease financial conditions and support demand, recognizing that the IOER rate cannot fall below zero. While the mechanism is different, the basic approach is very similar to the way the Federal Reserve has behaved historically.\n\nAlthough our ability to pay interest on excess reserves is sufficient to retain control of monetary policy, it is not bad policy to have both a “belt and suspenders” in place. As a result, we have developed means of draining reserves to provide reassurance that we will not—under any circumstance—lose control of monetary policy. These include reverse repo transactions with dealers and other counterparties, auctions of term deposits for banks, or securities sales from the Fed's portfolio.\n\nA related concern is whether the Federal Reserve will be able to act sufficiently fast once it determines that it is time to raise the IOER. This concern reflects the view that the excess reserves sitting on banks' balance sheets are essentially “dry tinder” that could quickly fuel excessive credit creation and put the Fed behind the curve in tightening monetary policy.\n\nIn terms of imagery, this concern seems compelling—the banks sitting on piles of money that could be used to extend credit on a moment's notice. However, this reasoning ignores a very important point. Banks have always had the ability to expand credit whenever they like. They didn't need a pile of “dry tinder” in the form of excess reserves to do so. That is because the Federal Reserve's standard operating procedure for several decades has been a commitment to supply sufficient reserves to keep the fed funds rate at its target. If banks wanted to expand credit that would drive up the demand for reserves, the Fed would automatically meet that demand by supplying additional reserves as needed to maintain the fed funds rate at its target rate. In terms of the ability to expand credit rapidly, it makes no difference whether the banks have lots of excess reserves on their own balance sheets or can source whatever reserves they need from the fed funds market at the fed funds rate. 3\n\nSo we have the means to tighten monetary policy when the time comes, but do we have the will? I think there should be no doubt about this. It is well understood among all the members of the FOMC that allowing inflation to gain a foothold is a losing game with large costs and few, if any, benefits.\n\nIn this regard, some have argued that Fed officials might be reluctant to raise short-term rates because such increases would squeeze the net interest margin on the Fed's System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio. Although it is true that a rise in short-term interest rates would reduce the Fed's net income from the extraordinary high levels seen in 2009 and 2010, 4 this will not play a significant role in the Fed's monetary policy deliberations.\n\nFed policy is driven by the objectives set out in the dual mandate, and the net income earned by the Fed is the consequence of the policy choices that advance those objectives. The Federal Reserve's net income statement does not drive or constrain our policy actions. In short, we act as a central bank, not an investment manager.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out in passing that a failure to raise short-term interest rates at the appropriate moment based on our dual mandate objectives would also be a losing strategy with respect to net income. Inflation would climb, bond yields would rise and the Fed would ultimately be forced to raise short-term rates more aggressively, or to sell more assets at lower prices to regain control of inflation. This would almost certainly result in larger reductions in net income than a timelier exit from the current stance of monetary policy. So what does this all imply for monetary policy? First, barring a sustained period of economic growth so strong that the economy's substantial excess slack is quickly exhausted or a noteworthy rise in inflation expectations, the outlook implies that short-term interest rates are likely to remain unusually low for “an extended period.” The economy can be allowed to grow rapidly for quite some time before there is a real risk that shrinking slack will result in a rise in underlying inflation. We will learn more as we go, and, as always, should be prepared to adjust course in a timely manner if incoming information suggests a different strategy would better promote our objectives.\n\nSecond, the Federal Reserve needs to continue to communicate effectively about its objectives, the efficacy of the tools it has at its disposal to achieve those objectives, and the willingness to use these tools as necessary. This is important in order to keep inflation expectations well-anchored. If inflation expectations were to become unanchored because Federal Reserve policymakers failed to communicate clearly, this would be a self-inflicted wound that would make our pursuit of the dual mandate of full employment and price stability more difficult. If we consistently and effectively communicate our objectives and our strategies, we can avoid this outcome.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________ 1 However, growth alone will not resolve the longer-term problem of the disparity between promises made to state and local workers in terms of their public employee pension and health benefits and the resources set aside to pay for those benefits. 2 The IOER rate and the federal funds rate are likely to track each other closely in most circumstances. Banks do not have any incentive to lend reserves in the fed funds market at rates below the IOER rate, and can arbitrage away any significant price gap that emerges from the activity of non-depository institutions that can buy and sell federal funds, but cannot hold reserves at the Fed. Thus, through the IOER rate, the Federal Reserve can effectively control the fed funds rate. 3 Indeed, even the opportunity cost of making the loan is similar in both instances. A bank that has excess reserves and decides to extend credit forgoes the chance to earn the IOER on the money lent out. A bank that borrows reserves in the fed funds market in order to extend credit pays the fed funds rate in order to do so. The IOER and fed funds rate are likely to be similar. 4 As a byproduct of actions taken to combat the crisis, the Fed generated record net income in 2009 and 2010, and remitted $125 billion to Treasury. In the early phase a significant part of this income came from liquidity programs. More recently, the main contributor has been net interest on the expanded SOMA portfolio. At this juncture, SOMA continues to generate abnormally high net income. As policy eventually normalizes and the cost of financing assets via interest on excess reserves goes up, the net interest margin on the SOMA assets will return to more normal levels. However, the net interest margin is unlikely to turn negative because roughly $950 billion of assets are—and have been for many years—funded by notes and coins in circulation, on which the Fed does not pay interest.",

    "text": "It  is a great pleasure to be here and have the opportunity to talk about the U.S. economic  outlook.  I want to thank the Association  for a Better New York (ABNY) for sponsoring today’s event.  This is an excellent venue to speak about  what we can do to improve our country’s economic performance.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own  views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or  the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe  U.S. economy—supported by solid gains in household spending—has expanded at a  moderate rate in 2016.  Job gains have  been sturdy, and we have seen some firming in wage growth as the labor market  has continued to tighten.  Moreover, as  the effects of earlier declines in energy prices have dissipated, the overall  inflation rate has begun to move up closer to our 2 percent objective.  As a consequence, economic conditions are not  far from the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment  and price stability.  And, I expect that we  will make further progress toward these goals in 2017.  So, from a cyclical perspective, the economy  is in reasonably good shape.\n\nOver  the longer term, however, the U.S. economy faces significant challenges.  On the positive side, economic expansions  don’t die of old age, and there appear to be few imbalances in the economy that  could lead to the current expansion ending.   But, in order for this to remain the case, it is important that fiscal  policy and monetary policy are well aligned going forward.\n\nIt  is also important that the United States retains sufficient fiscal capacity so  that fiscal policy can support the economy when the next cyclical downturn does  occur.  If fiscal policy can play a  greater role in promoting macroeconomic stability, it would likely reduce the  need for monetary authorities to take extraordinary actions to support economic  activity.\n\nThere  are other structural issues worth noting.   In particular, productivity growth has been anemic over the past few  years, while income inequality has increased and income mobility remains low.  As a consequence, the gains in living  standards generated by the current business expansion have been modest compared  to previous expansions, and these gains have not been widely shared.  Much more could be done both locally and  nationally to increase the economy’s potential to perform better for a broader array  of our citizens.\n\nThe Outlook for Growth and Inflation\n\nThe  U.S. economy has been expanding at a moderate rate.  Growth has averaged about 1.8 percent this  year and seems likely to continue at or slightly above this pace in 2017.  The main driver of growth in 2016 has been the  consumer, as real personal consumption expenditures have increased at a 2.9  percent annual rate during the first three quarters.  This solid consumption growth has been  supported by sturdy job gains and rising nominal wages.  Payroll gains have averaged about 180,000 per  month this year.  While this is down somewhat  from 2015’s monthly pace of nearly 230,000, it is still considerably higher  than the 75,000-110,000 monthly pace consistent with the likely long-term  growth in the labor force.  And wage  gains, while still relatively muted, have begun to rise more rapidly as the  labor market has continued to tighten.\n\nAnother  positive factor for the economy is that household finances generally are in  good shape.  The household saving rate is  5.9 percent, which is a bit higher than one would expect based on historical  relationships between household net worth and disposable income.  And, after a long period of deleveraging, household  debt has been growing, but very slowly.  Over  the last four quarters, household debt has risen by 2.4 percent.  This slow pace, combined with low borrowing  rates and an improving labor market, has pushed down the ratio of household  debt service to income close to its lowest level since at least 1980.  This suggests that households have the  financial capacity to sustain their spending.\n\nIn  contrast to consumer spending, many other areas of the economy have been  considerably softer.  Residential  investment, after experiencing strong gains in 2015 and in the first quarter of  2016, fell during the past two quarters.   However, increases in single-family housing starts and permits in  October suggest that we are likely to see a reversal of this trend in the  fourth quarter and into next year.\n\nBusiness  fixed investment has also been weak for some time.  Part of this weakness reflects the collapse  in oil and gas drilling activity following the plunge in crude oil prices  during the second half of 2014.  This  adjustment now appears to be over, as oil and gas prices have recovered  somewhat.  But, even outside of this  area, business fixed investment has been disappointing.  Several factors may be at play here—including  earlier uncertainty surrounding the presidential election outcome and the fact  that capacity utilization rates remain unusually low at this point in the  economic business cycle.  While the  election uncertainty has been resolved, I would expect business fixed  investment to only rise slowly in the year ahead.\n\nIn  contrast, the trade sector has performed surprisingly well in 2016.  This sector had to contend with headwinds  created by weak growth in final demand by our major foreign trading partners,  as well as the impact of earlier dollar strength on the nation’s export  competitiveness.  However, I’m not sure  that I would take much signal from this performance.  The improvement in trade seems to have been  driven mainly by weakness in imports, particularly for capital goods, and by  some one-off factors, such as the surge in soybean exports last quarter—both of  which are unlikely to continue.\n\nWith  respect to inflation, we are making progress in pushing toward our 2 percent objective.  In particular, headline inflation has risen this  year as the earlier declines in energy prices have dropped out of the  year-over-year figures.  And, core  inflation has remained broadly steady, running at 1.7 percent over the past  year—as measured by the personal consumption expenditures deflator that excludes  food and energy.  This stability is noteworthy,  because one might have anticipated that lower energy prices and a firmer dollar  would have pushed core inflation a bit lower.   Also, household inflation expectations—which at times in 2015 appeared  to be at risk of becoming unanchored to the downside—have been broadly  stable.  The University of Michigan  long-term inflation expectations measure has generally remained in the 2.5-2.8  percent range of recent years.  In  addition, the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations measure of 3-year  median inflation expectations has stabilized in 2016 in a range of 2.5-2.8  percent, after declining modestly over the course of 2014 and 2015.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nIf  the economy grows at a pace slightly above its sustainable long-term rate, as I  expect, the labor market should gradually tighten further, and the resulting pressure  on resources should help push inflation toward our 2 percent objective over the  next year or two.  Assuming the economy stays  on this trajectory, I would favor making monetary policy somewhat less  accommodative over time by gradually pushing up the level of short-term  interest rates.\n\nFollowing  this year’s election, we have seen relatively large movements in financial  asset prices.  In particular, the stock  market has firmed, bond yields have risen and the dollar has appreciated.  On balance, it appears that financial market conditions  have tightened modestly.  My personal interpretation  of these developments is that market participants now anticipate that fiscal  policy will turn more expansionary and that the FOMC will likely respond by  tightening monetary policy a bit more quickly than previously anticipated.  Assuming this expectation is realized, the recent  modest tightening in financial market conditions seems broadly appropriate.\n\nLet  me emphasize here that I do not view the recent shift in financial market  conditions as one that should prompt great concern.  It is important to distinguish between a  tightening of financial conditions that is driven by an increase in risk  aversion from one that is driven by a greater likelihood of stronger near-term aggregate  demand and less downside risk to the growth outlook. We experienced the former  at the beginning of 2016, while the latter reflects current expectations of  greater fiscal policy stimulus.\n\nObviously,  there is still considerable uncertainty about how fiscal policy will evolve over  the next few years.  At this juncture, it  is premature to reach firm conclusions about what will likely occur.  As we get greater clarity over the coming year,  I will update my assessment of the economic outlook and, with that, my views  about the appropriate stance of monetary policy.\n\nMonetary and Fiscal Policy in a Low-Rate  Environment\n\nI  also would like to highlight the limitations of monetary policy.  One important factor contributing to such  limits is that the real short-term interest rate consistent over the longer run  with a neutral monetary policy stance appears to be very low, and is expected  to remain so for some time.  This has  been helping to keep real inflation-adjusted interest rates lower than they  have been historically.  In part, this  reflects anemic productivity growth as well as the slowing of labor force  growth due to the aging of the population.   An implication of this environment is that there will likely be less  scope than there has been historically for the Federal Reserve to cut interest  rates when needed in the face of an economic downturn.  All else equal, this means a greater risk for  short-term interest rates to be pinned at their effective lower bound and for inflation  expectations to become unanchored to the downside.  Although forward guidance and large scale  asset purchase programs have expanded the ways in which the Federal Reserve can  provide additional accommodation, these unconventional monetary policy tools also  have their own limits.  These limits suggest  that fiscal policy may need to play a greater role in stabilizing the economy  than has been the case in past decades.\n\nWhat  I have in mind here is putting in place stronger, more robust automatic fiscal  stabilizers that would provide income support during economic downturns.  By reducing fluctuations in disposable  incomes, these types of fiscal actions would stabilize aggregate demand,  thereby limiting the risk of monetary policy getting pinned at the zero lower  bound for an extended period and the need for extraordinary monetary policy measures.\n\nI  favor automatic, rather than discretionary, fiscal actions because they would typically  go into effect more quickly and would be better anticipated.  Expectations matter greatly in affecting economic  behavior.  For example, if the economy  were to weaken, the anticipation that strong fiscal stabilizers would kick in to  support incomes should lead workers to be less fearful about losing their jobs,  and businesses to be less concerned that demand for their products might fall  precipitously.  This, in turn, would make  workers more confident that they could sustain their spending, and would make businesses  more confident that they could keep workers on their payrolls.\n\nWhat  type of fiscal stabilizers would be most effective?  I would turn first to those that Congress has  implemented on a discretionary basis during past economic downturns, such as  extensions of unemployment compensation and cuts in payroll taxes.  For example, when the unemployment rate climbs,  extensions of the duration of eligibility for unemployment compensation could be  triggered automatically, helping to stabilize household income.  Similarly, when the unemployment rate breaches  certain thresholds, payroll tax cuts could be triggered, helping to support the  disposable income of workers facing reductions in hours.  Payroll tax cuts also have the advantage of skewing  more toward low- and moderate-income workers, who typically have a higher  propensity to consume out of current income.\n\nObviously,  it is up to the incoming Administration and Congress to decide on the  appropriate fiscal measures.  But, the  point that I want to highlight is that robust automatic fiscal stabilizers  would complement monetary policy, and take some pressure off of the Federal  Reserve to undertake extraordinary measures in situations where there is little  scope for cutting short-term interest rates.  This approach might also be superior to other  proposals—such as raising the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective—that are  designed to reduce the risk of monetary policy being trapped at the zero lower  bound.\n\nFor  such fiscal actions to be sustainable over time, it is important that the United  States retain sufficient fiscal capacity.  This would also ensure that automatic fiscal  stabilizers are viewed as fully credible.   On this score, while significant progress has been made in recent years  in stabilizing the country’s fiscal situation, circumstances are likely to grow  more challenging in the years ahead.   There are three areas that I would highlight.  First, the earnings that Federal Reserve  returns to the U.S. Treasury Department each year are likely to fall in the future,  as rising short-term interest rates narrow the gap between what the Federal  Reserve pays on its liabilities—primarily currency and bank reserves—and what it  earns on its portfolio of Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed  securities.  In recent years, the Federal  Reserve’s remittances to the Treasury have averaged about $90 billion per year,  far above the $20-30 billion average prior to the Great Recession.  Although the precise trajectory of future  reimbursements is highly uncertain, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)  projects that Federal Reserve payments to the Treasury will drop from around  0.6 percent of GDP in fiscal 2016 to 0.3 percent of GDP by 2026.\n\nSecond,  the Treasury’s debt-service costs will likely grow as interest rates rise and  the amount of outstanding debt held by the public continues to increase.  While net outstanding Treasury debt held by  the public has risen to $14.2 trillion from $4.8 trillion over the past decade,  annual debt-service costs have only increased very modestly.  Looking ahead, the CBO’s baseline projection  is that debt-service costs will rise from 1.4 percent of GDP in fiscal 2016 to 2.6  percent of GDP in 2026.\n\nThird,  the retirement of the baby boom generation will put significant upward pressure  on Social Security and Medicare expenditures.   Although the trend in Medicare expenditures has flattened out in recent  years as healthcare inflation has moderated and utilization growth has slowed,  the CBO nevertheless projects that such expenditures will rise from 3.2 percent  of GDP in 2016 to about 4.0 percent of GDP in 2026.  Consequently, significant pressures on the  federal budget are still very much in train.   It will be important that fiscal policy be managed so it retains the  capacity to be used for macroeconomic stabilization.\n\nStructural Challenges\n\nWhile  we have made steady progress over the past year toward our twin goals of  maximum sustainable employment and price stability, significant challenges  remain for the economy that lay largely beyond the scope of monetary policy.  The three I would highlight are the sharp  slowdown in labor productivity growth, the increase in income inequality and  the low rate of income mobility.\n\nI  draw attention to the slowdown in productivity growth for two reasons.  First, productivity ultimately drives living standards  and how people assess their economic well-being.  Second, beyond ensuring a stable  macroeconomic and financial environment, monetary policy can do little to  improve productivity growth.\n\nAnnual  productivity growth has averaged only 0.7 percent during the past five years, near  the lowest 5-year pace since the early 1980s.   There are a number of competing explanations for the slowdown.  These include weak capital investment, a  flattening out of educational attainment by new labor market entrants, less new  business formation, understatement of quality improvements and, hence, output, and  fewer ground-breaking innovations.  I  suspect that all of these factors play a role.\n\nWhat  public policy can do to address this issue is to ensure that the economy  operates closer to the frontier of what is achievable.  For example, more efforts to improve job  skills would prove beneficial—through retraining and apprentice programs, and  better alignment of education and training with business needs.  Also, encouraging small business start-ups would  help—by removing barriers for entrepreneurs to establish new businesses, and by  creating more start-up incubator programs.   I also suspect that well-targeted infrastructure spending would be  advantageous if it addresses logistical bottlenecks and enables people to commute  to areas with good job opportunities.   For example, in the New York City metropolitan region, mass transit is  old, slow and crowded.  As a New Jersey  resident, I’m still waiting for that second set of rail tunnels into New York  City that should have been built years ago.\n\nWhile  higher productivity growth could support better living standards, the benefits for  low- and middle-income households depend, in part, on how those gains are  distributed between business and labor, and on how labor income is distributed  across the workforce.  Moreover, income  distribution shouldn’t be viewed as a static concept.  It is important that people are able to move  upward in income through their careers, regardless of their starting point.\n\nOver  the past several decades, three developments have been discouraging.  First, the share of labor income relative to  business income has fallen.  Since 1970,  the labor share of GDP in the United States has declined about 5 percentage  points.  Similar declines are evident in  most developed and emerging market economies.  Second, the distribution of labor income has  become more skewed.  Since 1970, the top  1 percent of households in the income distribution has more than doubled its  share of the nation’s income.  Third, despite  the notion of the American dream, income mobility in the United States remains relatively  low compared to many other countries.  Also,  the potential for income mobility is not evenly distributed. Research has shown  that where you are born and raised in the United States still has significant  implications for your future prospects.\n\nAs  a country, we need to address these issues.   With respect to the labor share of income, maintaining the U.S. economy at  full employment should help.  As the  unemployment rate has fallen over the past two years, the labor share of income  has moved up almost 1.5 percentage points.   Supporting maximum sustainable employment is part of the Fed’s dual  mandate, so we can play an important role here.\n\nWith  respect to the rising concentration of income and the low level of income  mobility, I think considerable improvements are also achievable.  Income distribution can be influenced by tax  policy and by educational opportunities.   Income mobility can be influenced by local policies on education and housing.  As Raj Chetty’s pathbreaking work makes clear,  income mobility depends on where one is born and lives.  This suggests quite strongly that improved  access to good education, childcare and affordable housing would help.\n\nAs  I noted in a recent speech, an important aspect of a city’s vitality is the  ability of its residents to develop the skills necessary to be successful and  achieve their dreams. 2 A big asset for New York City is its access to  affordable education.  Each year, tens of  thousands of low-to-moderate-income New Yorkers send their children to one of  the city’s specialized high schools.  When  it comes time for college, many of these same students have access to the City University of New York (CUNY) and State University of New York (SUNY) systems.  A recent highly  regarded study assessed how much of an opportunity children born to less  advantaged families in different parts of the United States have of moving up  in the world.  New York City ranked 10th  out of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas. 3 This is a better than average performance,  but I think New York City should aspire to do even better.\n\nTo  conclude, while the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy is reasonably good,  there is considerable work to do over the longer term to improve our nation’s productive  capacity and foster an environment in which the gains are spread more evenly.  Monetary policy is limited in what it can do  to address these broader structural issues.  However, monetary policy will do its part to  ensure the macroeconomic and financial stability that can help in achieving  progress in these areas.  Moreover, even  with respect to macroeconomic stability, monetary policy could use an assist from  fiscal policy.  It is important that  monetary policy and fiscal policy work together and not at cross purposes to be  able to bolster the economy when it needs support.\n\nThank  you for your kind attention.  I would be  happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity today to speak  again at the Economic Club of New York.  As  we mark the tenth anniversary of the onset of the financial crisis, I would  like to focus on some of the lessons we should draw from that harrowing  experience, and the implications of those lessons for regulatory policy going  forward.  As always, what I have to say  reflects my own views and opinions and not necessarily those of the Federal  Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe first lesson is that financial crises can have grave  consequences—for the economy and the nation—that can linger for many  years.  The toll from the financial  crisis was severe, with nine million jobs lost and eight million housing  foreclosures amid the deepest economic downturn since the Great  Depression.  Moreover, the road back has  been long and slow.  Despite economic  policies oriented toward supporting recovery, it has taken eight years to push  the unemployment rate down to a level consistent with the Federal Reserve’s employment  objective.  Other residual impacts  include the large size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet; significantly higher  public debt; and substantial damage to public trust in the nation’s government and  financial institutions.\n\nThe second lesson follows from the first.  We need to ensure that we have a resilient  financial system.  To that end, we must ensure  that the safeguards put in place in response to the crisis are fully  appreciated and respected.  But, it also  means that we need to finish the job—for example, by building out a fully  workable regime for resolving a complex, global firm if one were to become  insolvent.  We need to ensure that our  financial system can continue to provide critical services not just during good  times, but also during periods of stress.\n\nThese objectives are particularly relevant today, when  reopening the Dodd-Frank Act and modifying our regulatory framework are under  consideration.  While it is appropriate  to evaluate adjustments that might improve our regulatory regime, it is critical  that we do not forget the hard-learned lessons of the crisis and—in the haste  to reverse course—undermine the robustness and resiliency of the financial  system.\n\nThe U.S. Housing Market  Boom and Bust\n\nAt the heart of the crisis was the U.S. housing boom and  bust.  Between 1997 and 2006, U.S. home  prices nearly doubled in real terms on a national basis.  Then, when the boom turned to bust, real home  prices reversed course, declining by about 40 percent on a national basis, with  larger price declines in several states. 2 The magnitude of the national price declines  was unprecedented during the postwar period.\n\nThe evolution of the financial crisis illustrates a  number of key issues, including the potential hazards of financial innovation,  the procyclicality of the financial system, and the importance of confidence in  sustaining effective financial intermediation.\n\nThe housing boom resulted from several factors.  Innovations in subprime mortgage lending enabled  moderate-income households to purchase homes with negligible down payments.  This led to an increase in the demand for  housing, which helped push up home prices.   Home price appreciation masked the potential riskiness of such lending  and, in turn, sustained the wisdom of the easier underwriting standards.  As long as home values were rising, subprime  borrowers could either refinance their loans or sell their homes when the initial  teaser rates expired.  Thus, losses on  subprime and other mortgage lending were low, reinforcing the belief that such  loans were “safe.”\n\nEasier mortgage underwriting practices were also supported  by the ability of mortgage originators to pool their mortgages into collateralized  debt obligations (CDOs), transforming low-quality assets into triple-A-rated securities.  Investors, including banks, relied too heavily  on credit ratings and didn’t do sufficient due diligence on the underlying  quality of the assets and the assumptions that underpinned the triple-A ratings.  Implicit in these ratings was the assumption  that a large, national decline in home prices was extraordinarily unlikely.\n\nThe rise in home prices led to a surge in construction  activity, which helped to sustain the housing boom for a time.  This effect was particularly powerful in states  such as Arizona, California, Florida, and Nevada.  Rising home prices also bolstered the economy  by supporting consumption, as households monetized these gains by cash-out  refinancings and home equity lines of credit.\n\nThe housing boom was also supported by an accompanying financial  boom.  The financing activity associated  with the surge in mortgage originations and securitizations pushed up the  earnings of the major banking and securities firms.  These strong earnings created incentives to  ease underwriting standards further.\n\nBut, as housing supply responded to the increase in home  prices—housing starts rose from a 1.5 million annual rate in mid-2000 to a 2.3  million annual rate in early 2006—the positive feedback loop began to run in  reverse.  Home prices began to soften, subprime  borrowers found it more difficult to refinance, and mortgage loan defaults and  delinquencies rose.  As the bust got  underway in earnest, residential investment declined and consumer spending was  undercut as home equity levels fell.\n\nThe housing boom and bust underscores several important  lessons.  First, the financial sector is  not only a very complex system, but also one that can be inherently  unstable—subject to excess, then sharp reversal.  This is especially the case when an important  innovation occurs and market participants don’t fully appreciate the powerful feedback  loops that first sustain a boom and then contribute to a bust when the process  runs in reverse.  This means that we as regulators  must continually evaluate the financial system and monitor the landscape for new  developments and innovations that, if taken too far, could lead to excess and put  the system at risk.\n\nSecond, when there are potential excesses that could  threaten financial stability, we should look to temper them.  For example, in the run-up to the financial  crisis, macroprudential tools—such as requiring larger down payments or more  closely evaluating the incomes of borrowers—could have been implemented to  limit the demand for housing.  If such an  approach were successful, home prices would not have risen so dramatically, and  the subsequent bust would have been less severe.  Another approach would have required  financial intermediaries to build stronger capital and liquidity buffers as  protection against a housing bust and an economic downturn.\n\nPrior to the financial crisis, the conventional wisdom  was that asset bubbles could not be identified in real time—rather, they could  only be cleaned up after they burst.  While  there are significant challenges to identifying asset bubbles, it is clear that  cleaning up only after they burst does not always work out well in  practice.\n\nThird, we need to carefully monitor the incentives that  govern the behavior of borrowers, savers, and financial intermediaries.\n\nDuring the crisis, some examples of bad incentives that  sustained the boom included:\n\nCulmination of the Crisis\n\nOnce the housing bust got underway, stress on the  financial system increased sharply as asset prices fell and bank earnings plunged.  In the spring of 2008, such pressures led to a  forced sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase.   Later in the year, the government placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into  conservatorship.  In September, Lehman  Brothers failed.  And, a day later, AIG was  rescued in order to protect the rest of the financial system against further  losses and even broader contagion.  With  confidence in financial markets and financial intermediaries badly frayed, the  Federal Reserve and the U.S. government intervened and provided a range of liquidity  backstops, debt guarantees, and capital infusions to forestall a complete  collapse of the financial system and the economy.\n\nThe bust exposed many structural flaws in the financial  system that exacerbated its instability.   Without being exhaustive, these included the instability of the tri-party  repo system, which supported the nation’s short-term funding markets; the risks  of runs in the money market mutual fund industry; and the risk of contagion caused  by the huge volume of outstanding bilateral (non-centrally cleared) over-the-counter  (OTC) derivative obligations between the major financial intermediaries.\n\nThe tri-party repo system was centered on two of the major  U.S. banks.  The system matched investors  and borrowers each day—with the investors lending cash, secured by Treasuries  and other collateral, to the major securities firms.  But, the system was unstable.  In times of stress, clearing banks could be  faced with very large single-firm exposures—of potentially hundreds of billions  of dollars.  Not surprisingly, when such  counterparties became troubled, the clearing banks were less willing to take on  these large intraday exposures.  As a  result, repo investors, who were primarily worried about getting repaid each  morning, were motivated to simply withdraw from the market.  As short-term investors withdrew funding, the  liquidity buffer of the troubled securities firm was quickly exhausted,  particularly as other counterparties to that firm demanded additional collateral  to secure their own exposures.\n\nStructural weaknesses in the money market mutual fund  industry—which was a major source of short-term wholesale funding to the  securities industry and various non-bank financial corporations—also  exacerbated the crisis.  When Lehman  Brothers failed, the value of its outstanding short-term obligations  collapsed.  The Reserve Primary Fund “broke  the buck,” and investors rushed to withdraw their funds from prime  institutional money market mutual funds in a modern version of a classic “bank  run.”  The funds generally did not have  sufficient cash available to meet these runs because they offered overnight  liquidity at par value against a portfolio of assets with weighted average  maturities that were considerably longer.\n\nAnother important source of instability was the large  volume of bilateral OTC derivatives positions outstanding among the major firms  and the right of a firm to immediately close out such positions if their  counterparty became insolvent.  For  example, when Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008, counterparties to  Lehman terminated OTC derivatives in which the contract was in the money (i.e.,  Lehman owed money to the counterparty) and liquidated the collateral held  against those obligations, but kept open obligations in which the exposure went  the other way, from them to Lehman.  Not  only did this create an imbalance in the risk exposures of the failed firm, but  it also generated significant market churn and risk as firms scrambled to  rebalance their own risk exposures.  The  contagion generated by the complex web of outstanding bilateral OTC derivative  exposures significantly worsened the crisis and was responsible for much of the  losses Lehman incurred in its bankruptcy. 3\n\nThe near-collapse of the U.S. financial system underscores  three critical lessons.\n\nFirst, financial institutions must be robust to  stress.  In particular, they need to have  enough capital to be considered solvent even after sustaining significant  losses, so that they can maintain the market access needed to recapitalize.  They also need sufficient liquidity buffers  so that they can respond to shocks without having to sell illiquid assets.  The forced sale of illiquid assets can push  asset valuations far below their fundamental value, which can increase insolvency  risk.  And, it is important that they not  be overly reliant on short-term wholesale funding, which can evaporate during  times of stress.\n\nSecond, when we identify potential sources of instability  that could amplify shocks, we need to make structural changes to the financial  system to reduce or eliminate them.  For  example, the financial crisis made it clear that changes were needed in how tri-party  repo transactions were unwound each day, net asset values were calculated for  prime money market mutual funds, and OTC derivative obligations were cleared, settled,  and risk-managed.\n\nThird, there should be a viable and predictable resolution  regime.  We need to be able to resolve a  large, systemically important bank or securities firm in a way that limits  contagion and stress on the rest of the financial system, while at the same  time protecting the taxpayer against loss.\n\nMeanwhile, central counterparties (CCPs)—through which  most standardized OTC derivatives must now be cleared—need to be open for  business for the financial system to operate effectively.  Here, the emphasis should be on ensuring that  these financial market utilities can open for business the day after the  failure of one or more of their participants.   Credible resolution regimes for large banks and securities firms—and  credible recovery regimes for CCPs and other critical financial market utilities—should  help support confidence during times of stress.\n\nThese measures would make the financial system less prone  to booms and busts.  Financial  intermediaries would be more robust to stress when busts inevitably occur, and  contagion to the broader system would be reduced when a systemically important  firm fails.  Such changes should reduce  the likelihood of the failure of a large, systemically important firm and the  negative consequences of such a failure on the broader financial system.  These steps should help to ensure that credit  flows can be sustained throughout the business cycle.\n\nConsiderable  Progress\n\nSo, where are we relative to what is needed?  As I see it, there has been considerable  progress.  The nation’s largest banks are  much safer as a result of substantially higher capital and liquidity  requirements, as well as robust stress tests.   This enhanced resiliency has been achieved without a significant  negative impact on the broad availability of credit—recognizing that it is now more  difficult for households with low credit scores to obtain a mortgage.  Most importantly, improving the capacity of  such firms to continue to lend during times of stress should make the overall  economy more stable.\n\nWe have also made significant progress in addressing many  of the structural weaknesses uncovered by the financial crisis.  Money market reform has made the prime money  market mutual fund industry smaller and safer.   The elimination of the net asset value convention for institutional prime  money market mutual funds has made these funds smaller and less prone to runs  during times of crisis. 4 The tri-party repo system has been made more  stable as intraday exposures of the large clearing banks have been dramatically  reduced. 5 This means that they have less reason to back  away from a firm if it were to become troubled.   And, firms are much less reliant on short-term wholesale funding.\n\nWe have also reduced the amount of risk in the system by  requiring that most standardized OTC derivatives be cleared through CCPs, where  multilateral netting occurs. 6 In a centrally cleared regime, major  intermediaries have net exposures to individual CCPs that replace much larger  bilateral exposures to other financial intermediaries.  Of course, this means putting more eggs in  the CCP basket.  So, it is particularly  important now to closely watch that basket. 7 Greater oversight of CCPs is necessary to  ensure that they have good governance, sound risk management, robust  technological infrastructures, and adequate liquidity support.  In addition, we have made considerable  progress in developing a viable resolution regime for large, systemically  important banks and securities firms.\n\nMore Work Is Still  Needed\n\nYet, we should not be complacent, as there are important  areas where our work is not complete. 8 Relative to other countries, the United  States has limited ability to implement effective macroprudential tools.  That is because oversight is shared by several  different entities, and the power to implement macroprudential tools is constrained.   Another challenge is the diverse  structure of the U.S. financial system, in which non-banks and capital markets  play a substantial role in credit intermediation.  Although the Financial Stability Oversight  Council (FSOC) could conceivably play a greater role here, whether it will be  able to do so effectively remains uncertain.\n\nAnother issue that needs attention is the ability to  resolve large, complex financial firms that operate on a global basis.  The framework of requiring such firms to hold  a large buffer of debt that could be converted into equity at the time of non-viability  is an important step forward.  But, the  task of operationalizing this on a global basis in a way that is fully credible  to these firms’ customers and counterparties has not been completed.  Achieving clarity about the roles and  responsibilities of home and host country authorities is still a work in  progress.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s lack of authority to lend to a  major securities dealer that gets into difficulty is another outstanding issue.  The Dodd-Frank Act narrowed the Federal  Reserve’s authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act.  No longer can the Federal Reserve lend to an  individual securities firm or non-bank financial intermediary.  Such authority may not be as necessary now  that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has the power to lend  under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act and firms are required to have sufficient  resources to support their resolution plans.   But, I would prefer having such a tool available in extremis given the potential need to buy time for coordination  and critical decision-making.  I think it  is important to ensure that one can “get to the weekend.”  Finally, the work needed to ensure that CCPs  can always recover has not yet been completed.   This is an issue of increased importance given that their role in the  financial system has become more prominent.\n\nWhere the Pendulum  May Have Swung Too Far\n\nAt the same time, there are some areas where the pendulum  may have swung too far, where the costs of regulation—including compliance  costs and the potential impact on the provision of services—are likely to  exceed the benefits.  In this vein, I  favor regulatory relief for smaller banking organizations.  First, such firms individually are not  systemically important, and therefore do not pose a significant risk to the  viability of the U.S. financial system.   Second, the regulatory burdens on smaller firms can be heavy because  they don’t have the scale over which compliance and other regulatory costs can  be spread.  Regulatory requirements  should be appropriately calibrated to avoid inadvertently creating a  competitive advantage for larger financial firms.\n\nI also think that the Volcker rule could be modified so  that its implementation would be less burdensome.  As I see it, regulators could review the criteria  for permissible market-making.  Trading  activity should be viewed as market-making when it is customer-facing and  inventories are not excessively large or stale.  Market-making  serves an important function, and it is  important that trading desks can intervene and buy during flash crashes  or sell during flash surges.  Permitting this  could provide greater liquidity and stability to financial markets.  I would also exempt smaller banking  institutions from the Volcker rule since they rarely, if ever, engage in  proprietary trading.\n\nDo No Harm\n\nMany speculate that Congress will make changes to the  Dodd-Frank Act.  If the scope is confined  mainly to small bank relief and adjusting how the Volcker rule is applied, I  have no objection.  But, because the  Dodd-Frank Act addresses many of the key lessons of the crisis, I think it  appropriate that changes be made carefully—with a paring knife, rather than with  a meat cleaver.  Here, I would underscore  the importance of preserving higher capital and liquidity requirements for  systemically important banks; Title VII, which mandates the central clearing of  standardized OTC derivatives; and Title VIII, which gives the Federal Reserve  an oversight role for financial market utilities that are systemically  important, and which helps promote more uniform risk management standards.\n\nWhile Title II gives the FDIC the authority to resolve a  large, complex financial firm by converting its debt into equity and  establishing a new holding company, I do not think this is necessarily the only  way to have a viable resolution regime.   However, if Title II were to be eliminated, then the Bankruptcy Code would  need to be bolstered.  There are two  essential requirements: the ability to initiate an effective resolution strategy  over the weekend, and a government entity—be it the Federal Reserve or the  FDIC—that can provide a credible liquidity backstop to the recapitalized entity  when it opens for business on Monday morning.   If resolution cannot be accomplished in this timeframe, confidence would  suffer and there would be contagion.   Without a credible liquidity backstop, clients and counterparties would  run, making it much more difficult for the recapitalized firm to conduct its  business.\n\nI would also preserve the authority of the FSOC to  designate non-banking firms as systemically important and subject to  supervision by the Federal Reserve.  As I  see it, the designations of GE Capital and AIG were successful in two important  respects.  First, Federal Reserve  supervision resulted in improved corporate governance and risk management.  Second, it created incentives for the firms to alter their operations to become  less systemically important in order to be de-designated.  We should also retain this designation tool  because we cannot predict which firms and activities may emerge and become  systemically important in the future.  After  all, I do not think many were focused on or worried about the activities of  AIG’s Financial Products Group several years before the financial crisis, though  in retrospect those activities proved to be systemically important.  That part of the firm should have been better  supervised and regulated.\n\nSumming Up\n\nIn conclusion, as we reflect on potential changes to the  U.S. regulatory regime, we should not lose sight of the horrific damage caused by  the financial crisis, including the worst recession of our lifetimes and millions  of people losing their jobs and homes.  We  had a woefully inadequate regulatory regime in place, and while it is much  better now, there is still work to do.  We  should finish the job as quickly as possible, and we should do no harm as we  adjust our regulatory regime to make it more efficient.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak with you here today.  In my remarks, I will assess the outlook for the U.S. economy and the progress that the Federal Reserve has made toward its dual mandate objectives of maximum employment in the context of price stability.\n\nOver the past few years, the U.S. economy has made considerable progress toward achieving these goals.  Yet we still have further to go—the unemployment rate is still too high and the inflation rate too low.  Because the economic outlook is uncertain, I can’t tell you when normalization will occur.  The timing is data dependent.  We will have to see what unfolds. Whenever such a shift in policy occurs, we need to be mindful that it most likely will be accompanied by some degree of market stress and turbulence.  Moreover, the normalization of U.S. monetary policy could create significant challenges for those emerging market economies (EMEs) that have been the recipients of large capital inflows in recent years.  This leads to an important question: What can the Federal Reserve do to address these risks?\n\nWhile tightening cycles by the Fed can pose challenges for EMEs, these need not be disruptive.  The combination of stronger U.S. growth, improved EME fundamentals and effective Fed communications can limit the stresses caused by the onset of tightening.  The experience will vary across EMEs, but EMEs as a group are better equipped today to handle the challenge than they were in the past.\n\nAs always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\n\nSince the end of the Great Recession more than five years ago, the U.S. economy has grown at a disappointing 2.3 percent annualized rate.  Several times over that period, it appeared that growth was strengthening, but each time such hopes were subsequently unfulfilled.  We appear again to be at a similar junction.  Real GDP growth accelerated over the last two years, rising at a 2.7 percent annual rate.  However, the first quarter of 2015 is expected to be quite weak with growth only at around a 1½ percent annualized rate.  What does this portend for growth going forward?\n\nDespite the weak performance of the first quarter, I believe that the growth prospects for the U.S. economy over the remainder of 2015 will improve.  I expect that the first quarter weakness will prove to be largely temporary.  The winter weather was quite severe in the eastern two-thirds of the United States and bottlenecks at the West Coast ports disrupted both sales and production.\n\nMore important in assessing the growth potential of the U.S. are the improved underlying fundamentals.  The firming of growth in 2013 and 2014 reflected several important developments that, in my view, are likely to continue to support growth over the remainder of this year and into 2016.  Those developments include the fact that the household deleveraging process has largely run its course and the imbalances in the housing market have been largely worked off.  In addition, federal fiscal consolidation appears to be over for now, and employment and spending are again increasing at the state and local government level.\n\nMy outlook for 2015 as a whole is that economic growth will be close to the pace of the past two years, supported by continued solid fundamentals and accommodative financial conditions.  If I am correct, then this would lead to a further reduction of labor market slack, with the unemployment rate approaching 5 percent by the end of the year.\n\nAn important underpinning of this outlook is that, after a lull in the first quarter, household spending will move back toward the kind of growth path it was on over the second half of 2014, when real PCE grew at about a 3¾ percent annual rate.  I expect stronger consumer spending to be supported by three factors: healthier household balance sheets, improved household income prospects and the benefit to purchasing power caused by the earlier declines in energy prices.  The fact that the personal saving rate is somewhat above what its longer-term relationship with household net worth also suggests that consumer spending could grow a bit quicker than income growth in the year ahead.\n\nLet me elaborate on each of these three factors supporting household spending.\n\nWe have documented the steady improvement in household balance sheets in our Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit . Aggregate household credit declined from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2013.  Since then it has increased by 6 percent.  The strongest and most broad based growth of consumer credit has been for purchases of motor vehicles.  In contrast, growth of mortgage debt remains relatively sluggish and is confined to those borrowers with relatively high credit scores.  However, as typically occurs as an economic expansion progresses, there are signs that credit standards are easing a bit, which should promote stronger growth of household borrowing going forward.\n\nAnother plus for consumer spending has been strong gains in nominal income.  Over the second half of 2014, hours worked in the nonfarm business sector rose at a 3.6 percent annual rate.  While wage growth has not yet picked up appreciably, this gain in hours worked resulted in a 4.7 percent annualized growth rate of labor compensation.\n\nThe pace of improvement in the labor market slowed somewhat in the first quarter of 2015 from that of the second half of last year.  Nonfarm payroll employment increased in the first quarter by about 200,000 per month, but a gain of only 126,000 in March.  This was well below the pace of the fourth quarter.  Growth in hours worked also slowed, but because wage gains picked up somewhat, the growth rate of compensation in the first quarter looks to have been about as strong as it was during the second half of last year.\n\nMoreover, the level of slack in the labor market has diminished sufficiently so that one might expect firmer wage gains going forward.  The unemployment rate in March of 5.5 percent, for example, is at a level where, historically, we have seen a pickup in the pace of real wage gains.  If this happens again and unemployment continues to decline as I expect, then these wage gains will help support continued solid income growth even if the pace of employment growth remains slower than last year.  However, it will be important to determine whether the softness in the March labor market report was temporary, or if it foreshadows a more substantial slowing in the labor market than I currently anticipate.\n\nThe final factor supporting household spending is the decline in energy prices.  Recently, the benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price has been fluctuating in the neighborhood of $50 per barrel, about half the price in June of last year.  Since the U.S. is still a net importer of petroleum, this development has provided substantial benefits, with our oil import bill down by about a ½ percentage point of GDP.  That represents a significant boost to real disposable income for households.  The degree to which this energy dividend supports household spending will depend, though, on how much is spent versus saved.\n\nWhile I am relatively optimistic about the growth outlook for 2015, I also must acknowledge that there are some significant downside risks.  In particular, the roughly 15 percent appreciation of the exchange value of the dollar since mid-2014 is making U.S. exports more expensive and imports more competitive.  My staff’s analysis concludes that an appreciation of this magnitude would, all else equal, reduce growth of real GDP by about 0.6 percentage point over this year. Some of the recent softness in indicators of manufacturing activity is likely a reflection of this development.\n\nAdditionally, the decline in energy prices, while helping to support household spending, will adversely impact business investment.  The support to growth from rapidly rising U.S. oil production almost certainly will fade due to the oil price decline.  Now, with prices sharply lower, U.S. oil exploration and drilling activity is falling off very sharply, and this will undoubtedly exert a meaningful drag on economic activity.\n\nTurning to the inflation outlook, the data continue to come in below the FOMC’s objective of a 2 percent annualized rate for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator.  The twelve-month change of the total PCE deflator was just 0.3 percent in February, with the core PCE deflator at just 1.4 percent.  Despite these low readings, my expectation is that inflation will begin to firm later this year.  Importantly, most of the impact from the decline in energy prices that has weighed down overall inflation is likely over.  Although the appreciation of the dollar may cause some further softness in import prices, the continued decline in resource slack as the economy expands should push in the opposite direction.  We are already seeing some firming in rent inflation as rental vacancy rates have returned to more normal levels and employment and income growth have strengthened.  Longer-term household inflation expectations have been well maintained through this period of very low inflation as shown in our Survey of Consumer Expectations .  This should reinforce the effect of a higher level of overall resource utilization in slowly pushing inflation back towards the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nAs the FOMC has consistently communicated, decisions on monetary policy, such as the timing of lift-off will, depend on how the economic outlook evolves—in particular with respect to the labor market and inflation.  As I have discussed, the labor market has improved substantially over the past few years and I expect to see inflation begin to firm later this year.  If this labor market improvement continues and the FOMC is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term, then it would be appropriate to begin to normalize interest rates.  At their March meeting, the FOMC removed language from the statement that indicated that we would be patient in beginning the process of normalizing monetary policy.  But, as Chair Yellen remarked in her most recent press conference, removal of the word “patient” from the statement does not indicate that we will now be “impatient” to begin to normalize monetary policy.  Rather, the timing of normalization remains uncertain because how the economy evolves is also uncertain.\n\nWhen, hopefully, the data support a decision to lift off later this year, it does not mean that U.S. monetary policy will be tight.  Rather, we will simply be moving from an extremely accommodative monetary policy to one that is only slightly less so.  I would view this as a positive signal about the progress we have made in restoring the U.S. economy to health.  It is important to remember that near zero short-term interest rates and the large expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet were designed to be a temporary extraordinary treatment to help the economy regain its vitality, and not a permanent palliative.\n\nI remain confident that when the FOMC decides to begin to remove policy accommodation that we have the requisite tools to support this decision.  We have tested numerous tools including overnight reverse repurchase operations, term reverse repurchase operations and term deposit facilities to ensure that, when the time comes, lift-off can be managed smoothly.  As the FOMC has communicated, the primary tool will be interest on excess reserves (IOER), with overnight reverse repurchases as a supplemental tool to be used as needed to help ensure a firm floor under short-term interest rates.\n\nOnce normalization has begun, two important questions will be:  How fast will it proceed? And how high will short-term rates ultimately need to go?\n\nHow fast the normalization process will proceed depends mainly on two factors:  how the economy evolves and how financial market conditions respond to movements in the federal funds rate target.  If financial market conditions do not tighten much in response to higher short-term interest rates, we might have to move more quickly to achieve the appropriate restraint on financial market conditions.  In contrast, if financial conditions tighten unduly, then this will likely prompt us to go much more slowly or even to pause for a while.  Our intention will be to move short-term interest rates in a manner to generate the set of financial market conditions that we deem to be most consistent with achieving our employment and inflation objectives.\n\nThe question of how high short-term rates will ultimately need to go before we approach a neutral monetary stance is a difficult question, which is hard to pre-judge for a couple of reasons.  First, it depends on how financial market conditions evolve in response to our monetary policy adjustments.  Second, it depends on other factors, such as real potential GDP growth, which, in turn, depends on the growth rates of the labor force and of productivity.  My current thinking is that the long-run nominal federal funds rate consistent with 2 percent inflation is somewhat lower than in the past.  My point estimate is 3½ percent, but I place considerable uncertainty on this estimate.\n\nGlobal Implications of U.S. Monetary Policy Normalization\n\nLet me now turn to the implication of U.S. policy normalization for foreign economies.  While our monetary policy mandate has a domestic focus, our monetary policy actions have global implications that feed back into the U.S. economy and financial markets.  In some cases, these feedback effects can be disruptive.  An example is the market volatility that we saw in the spring and summer of 2013 during the so-called “taper tantrum.”  EME financial markets were hit the hardest, with declines in equity prices, a widening in sovereign debt spreads and a sharp increase in foreign exchange rate volatility.  In the U.S., we saw a spike in Treasury yields, with the 10-year rate rising by more than 100 basis points from early May before peaking in early September.\n\nDespite the domestic focus of our policy mandate, we at the Fed take the potential international implications of our policies seriously.  In part, this is out of simple self-interest, since the international effects of Fed policies can spill back onto the U.S. economy and financial markets.  In part, too, it reflects a sense of special responsibility we have given the dollar’s role as the international reserve currency.  We are and will remain attentive to the risk that the onset of Fed policy normalization could bring a new round of market pressures on EMEs.  Yet I think there are good reasons to think that this adjustment will prove manageable and not be very disruptive.\n\nFirst, many EMEs appear to be better equipped today to handle the Fed's prospective exit from its exceptional policy accommodation than they were during past tightening cycles.  This reflects the fundamental reforms that EMEs have put in place over the past 15 years, as well as the hard lessons learned from past periods of market stress.  Among the positives are:\n\nTo be sure, progress has not been uniform across EMEs, and more work remains in some countries to further strengthen institutional structures.  Vulnerabilities remain in several important EMEs, and some have been hit by a sharp adverse turn in their terms of trade due to the recent fall in global commodity prices.  Still, the fundamental improvements I’ve cited leave many EMEs better positioned than in the past to weather those times in the cycle when the external environment turns more challenging.\n\nSecond, during previous Fed tightening cycles EME economic performance has generally been good.  During the last three U.S. tightening cycles, EME industrial production growth has been between 7½ and 10 percent over the 12-months from the start of Fed tightening, while EME export volumes have risen 10 to 15 percent.  The likely explanation for this favorable record is that Fed tightening generally occurs during periods of strong U.S. economic performance.  Recent research from the IMF bears out this hypothesis, finding that higher U.S. interest rates associated with stronger U.S. growth represent a net positive for EMEs. 2\n\nFinancial performance of EMEs has been more diverse across Fed policy cycles.  The strongest contrast is between the tightening cycle that began in 2004, and the one beginning a decade earlier, in 1994.  EME asset prices strengthened considerably during the 2004 cycle, but weakened considerably during the earlier cycle.  Notably, the 1994 cycle was associated with a large increase in U.S. long-term bond yields, and appears to represent a case in which there was a considerable gap between what the Fed did in terms of monetary policy tightening relative to initial market expectations.\n\nA similar gap was apparent during the taper tantrum in the spring of 2013, when our attempts to provide guidance about the potential tapering of asset purchases ended up confusing market participants, causing many to anticipate an earlier start and more rapid rollout of actual policy rate hikes.  These episodes are reminders of the importance of transparency and clear messaging in how the Fed is evaluating the evolving economic landscape, a point I’ll return to shortly.\n\nThird, the stance of Fed policy will be far from the only factor affecting external financial conditions for EMEs.  Even as the FOMC considers the appropriate timing and pace of moving to a less accommodative policy stance, the ECB and the Bank of Japan are implementing additional easing measures.  As a result, external conditions will remain more supportive than would be indicated by a narrow focus on Fed policy alone.\n\nFinally, EME fundamentals are likely to be the most important determinant of how their financial conditions respond to Fed policy normalization.  This was one of the key lessons of the taper tantrum.  At first, market pressure was somewhat indiscriminant across countries.  Relatively quickly, however, market pressures turned more focused, tightening more severely for countries with clear fundamental vulnerabilities:  large current account deficits, a heavy reliance on portfolio inflows and high inflation rates.  Markets then responded favorably as EME authorities shifted toward clearer, more consistent policies focused on inflation objectives and external sustainability, and away from policies with conflicting and sometimes competing objectives.  A smooth adjustment to Fed normalization this cycle will be more likely if market participants retain this discriminating perspective.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that the road ahead will necessarily be an easy one.  Market participants may focus on vulnerabilities that they might have ignored prior to the taper tantrum in 2013, placing an added premium on strong fundamentals, policy coherence and predictability.  There will likely be no one right answer for EMEs in managing the trade-offs that come with the changed environment, and the adjustment could sometimes be difficult.\n\nWith respect to these risks, central banks in general, and the Fed in particular, play an important role.  We seek to be good global stewards.  As you know, we’ve taken a number of steps to increase transparency and to improve the clarity of our communications.  This includes regular press conferences by the Fed chair following FOMC meetings; the publishing of growth, inflation and short-term rate forecasts of FOMC participants; and a concerted attempt to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at to assess progress toward our mandate.  We are, though, still learning how to more effectively communicate, especially given our new and expanded set of policy instruments.\n\nA second area in which we can and must collectively do better is safeguarding global financial stability. Simply put, we failed to act both early enough and decisively enough to stem the credit excesses that spawned the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  While the U.S. was not alone in this shortcoming, given our position in the global financial system we especially should have done a better job.  We've taken important steps through new legislative mandates and a broader effort to rethink our regulatory and supervisory framework.  In particular, systemically important banking organizations must now hold higher amounts of capital and liquidity that are better aligned with their risk profiles and the official sector is making progress in ensuring no financial firm will be too-big-to-fail.\n\nAlthough this remains very much a work in progress, these efforts should help us to avoid repeating the mistakes of the recent past, and enable us to be more proactive in mitigating potential future vulnerabilities.  Of course, we at the Fed are not alone here.  Since the recent financial crisis, central banks worldwide have been engaged in a broad rethinking of how to better fulfill their mandates.\n\nLet me close with a final thought. The largest problems that countries create for others often emanate from getting policy wrong domestically.  Economic recession or financial instability at home is often quickly exported abroad.  Equally important, growth and stability abroad makes all our jobs at home easier.  This illustrates the externalities in the work we do, with more effective fulfillment of our domestic mandates helping to bring us collectively to a better place.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n1 Matthew Higgins, Richard Peach, Paolo Pesenti and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 See “Spillovers from Unwinding Monetary Support in Advanced Economies,” 2014 Spillover Report, Chapter 2.

    "text": "Welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and to our  third conference focused on culture within the financial services  industry.  It is encouraging to see all  of you in attendance today—in particular, the many non-executive directors,  representatives from the investor community, and foreign supervisors who have  joined us to help broaden and deepen the dialogue.  Thank you for your participation.  As always, what I have to say today reflects  my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the  Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe evidence is pervasive that  deep-seated cultural and ethical problems have plagued the financial services  industry in recent years.  Bad conduct  has occurred in both investment banking and securities market activities as  well as in retail banking. 2 This has eroded the industry's  trustworthiness.\n\nThis erosion impedes the ability of  the financial services industry to do its job.   That job is financial intermediation—to facilitate the efficient  transfer of resources from savers to borrowers, and to help customers manage  the financial risks they face.   Verification—whether through regulation or internal controls—is an  expensive substitute for trustworthiness.   Fines for bad behavior drain resources that could be better used to  expand access and improve services, but billions of dollars in avoidable  penalties are just the start.  The time  spent handling a legal crisis is time not spent on more productive  pursuits.  Moreover, I worry that, in the  long term, an industry that develops a reputation for dubious ethics will not  attract the best talent. 3\n\nIn contrast, a trustworthy  financial services sector will be more productive and better able to support  the economy.  Reliable financial  intermediaries can help increase the flow of credit, promote economic growth  and make the financial system more stable.   This is why restoring trustworthiness must be the ultimate goal of reforming  culture.\n\nThe industry's shared norms—its  culture—will not change by mere exhortation to the good, whether from me or  from the industry's CEOs.  In my  experience, people respond far more to incentives and clear accountability than  to statements of virtues and values.  The  latter are worthy and necessary, but remain aspirational or even illusory  unless they are tied to real consequences. 4 What does it mean for a firm to profess to putting  the customer first, if employees are compensated and promoted regardless of  what's good for customers?  Or, worse, if  they are not held to account for activities that can harm customers?  If we focus on nothing else in today's  conference, let's explore how best to structure incentives and reinforce  accountability to align with core purposes and first principles.\n\nTo put it very simply, incentives  drive behavior, and behavior establishes the social norms that drive  culture.  If the incentives are wrong and  accountability is weak, we will get bad behavior and cultures.  This implies a role for both firms and  supervisors.  Firms need to continually  assess their incentive regimes so that they are consistent with good conduct  and culture.  When they are not  consistent, the incentives need to be changed.\n\nSupervisors should also play a role  in assessing firms' incentive structures.   For example, they should evaluate:\n\nThe answers to these questions  should indicate whether incentives must be changed in order to foster the  appropriate behaviors and culture.\n\nThe primary responsibility for  reforming culture—and changing incentives—belongs to the industry.  However, the industry does not act  alone.  The public sector can play an  important role as well.  I'll discuss  that issue this morning with my colleagues Norman Chan, chief executive of the  Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Minouche Shafik, deputy governor of the Bank  of England.  Later this morning another  panel will discuss the ways in which supervision can further contribute to  improving bank culture.\n\nLet's also consider ways in which  new laws or regulations might help—especially to overcome perennial collective  action and first-mover problems that are common across the industry.  Two years ago I proposed solutions to two  such obstacles to reforming culture.   First, there should be a database of banker misconduct to combat the  problem of \"rolling bad apples.\" 5 Second, a baseline assessment of culture is  needed in order to measure progress.  I  proposed an industry-wide survey, but there may be other good alternatives.  Once again, I invite the industry to take the  initiative on these issues, and to look to the public sector for support.\n\nI also hope that we will attend to  issues that we may have overlooked in our earlier discussions.  Gillian Tett of the Financial Times argues in her new book, The Silo Effect , that the key to understanding any culture is  identifying and explaining \"social silences\"—the issues that are not being  discussed. 6\n\nWhere do we encounter those issues  in reforming the culture of financial services?   One place might be the role of investors in firms.  Are their expectations of returns reasonable  and consistent with a trustworthy financial services industry?  Another place might be the boardroom.  Boards should establish and promote a culture  based on ethics and respect for law.   Have boards risen to this challenge?   If not, what's needed?  And, going  forward, are we thinking hard about how technological change will influence  incentives, behavior and culture?  We'll  hear these issues discussed in several panels today.\n\nThese issues require thoughtful  reflection by the industry.  The need for  reflection, though, is not limited to boards, or even to banks.  Regulators and bankers alike can benefit from  such a habit.  In that vein, I want to  share with you an everyday checklist proposed by Ignazio Angeloni of the  European Central Bank. 7 He has posed six questions that seek to make  responsibility for culture both individual and routine:\n\nI suspect that while seemingly  simple, the discipline of asking ourselves these questions on a regular basis  and answering them thoughtfully and honestly may be more challenging, thought  provoking and effective than one might initially think.\n\nI thank the staff at the New York  Fed who put together today's program, and their colleagues who are in the  audience and watching today.  The diverse  professional training and experience of our staff are among the New York Fed's  strengths.  Bank supervisors, risk managers,  economists, traders and lawyers contribute insights from their respective  professions that lead to better outcomes.\n\nIn the spirit of learning from  other disciplines, I am delighted to introduce today's keynote speaker.  Some of you may recall that, two years ago,  Sir David Walker opened our first culture conference with the words, \"I am  grateful to the philosopher Onora O'Neill for reference to very relevant  advice.\" 8 Today we have gone to the source.\n\nBaroness O'Neill is professor  emeritus of philosophy at the University of Cambridge, former president of the  British Academy, and former chair of the United Kingdom's Equality and Human  Rights Commission.  She was appointed a  life peer and member of the House of Lords in 1999, and, in 2007, was elected  an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society.\n\nToday, Baroness O'Neill serves as a  member of the Banking Standards Board.   Her 2002 lectures on trustworthiness—reprinted in the book A Question of Trust —have been  tremendously influential among New York Fed staff working on culture.  Baroness O'Neill, the floor is yours.\n\n1 Stephanie  Chaly, James Hennessy, Jacqueline McCormack, Thomas Noone and Joseph Tracy  assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 William C.

    "text": "I am glad that Narayana Kocherlakota is here as well as I don’t think I qualify as the most “objective” person to be a panelist on this particular topic. After all, I have long been a proponent of using a financial conditions framework to think about the economic outlook and monetary policy. When I was working as the chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, we built one of the earliest financial conditions indexes, the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index (GSFCI).\n\nI am going to divide my remarks today into two parts. First, I will discuss why a financial conditions framework is useful when thinking about the economic outlook and monetary policy. Second, I will discuss the paper, “Financial Conditions Indexes: A New Look after the Financial Crisis,” by Jan Hatzius, Peter Hooper, Frederic Mishkin, Kermit L. Schoenholtz and Mark W. Watson, in some detail—evaluating its considerable strengths and pointing out some areas where additional work would be useful.\n\nThere are a number of reasons that a financial conditions framework is likely to be useful when evaluating the economic outlook and the conduct of monetary policy. Most important, monetary policy works its magic through its effect on financial conditions; it does not operate directly on real economic variables. That is because the level of the federal funds rate influences other financial market variables such as money market rates, long-term interest rates, credit spreads, stock prices and the value of the dollar, and it is these variables that influence real economic activity. 1 This means that if the linkage between the fed funds rate and this broader constellation of financial indicators is not stable or completely predictable, then knowing what is happening to the fed funds rate is not sufficient to predict economic activity. The instability of the linkage between the fed funds rate and financial conditions indicators means that these indicators provide additional information about real activity and also are relevant in deciding the appropriate fed funds rate target. In contrast, if the transmission mechanism from the fed funds rate to financial conditions and onward to real economic activity were completely predictable, then there would be no need to focus on financial conditions as an intermediate target variable. The level and path of the fed funds rate matters, but it also matters how this gets transmitted to the real economy through the financial sector.\n\nOver the past 15 years, there have been two important instances in which the relationship between the fed funds rate and financial conditions have diverged significantly. The first was the late 1990s technology stock market bubble and its aftermath. The second was the mid-2000s credit market bubble that culminated in the recent financial crisis. During these episodes, the relationship between the fed funds rate and financial conditions was particularly unstable. As a result, developments in the financial markets became very important in the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nIn this respect, I would note that financial conditions indicators have implications for “Taylor Rule” formulations for monetary policy. As you all know, Taylor-type rules provide a short-hand metric for the appropriate stance of monetary policy. In such rules, the fed funds rate is set at a level equal to the equilibrium real fed funds rate, plus the inflation objective, plus the weighted deviation of output from its potential and of the inflation objective from actual or, if forward looking, expected inflation. Often, analysts and economists assume that the equilibrium real fed funds rate is equal to 2 percent, its long-term historical value. Although, in principle, such rules allow the equilibrium rate to be time varying, it typically is assumed to be constant.\n\nI have always been uncomfortable with this usage of a 2 percent equilibrium real rate assumption because it ignores the possibility that the equilibrium rate changes in response to technology shocks or in response to changes in how monetary policy is transmitted via the financial system to the real economy. For example, in the late 1990s, when trend productivity growth shifted upward, it seemed logical that this would also push up the equilibrium short-term real interest rate. That is because higher productivity growth, by raising the return on capital, spurs greater investment, thereby driving the equilibrium rate higher. Similarly, if stock prices rose sharply in response to higher productivity growth, this should also lead to a higher equilibrium real rate through the effect of greater stock market wealth on consumer spending. Higher stock prices meant that financial conditions were easier. This needed to be offset by a somewhat higher fed funds rate target.\n\nFinancial conditions also appear to have become more important in terms of their influence on business cycles. On the one hand, the fed funds rate has been more stable and the range of the fed funds rate over the cycle has been smaller. However, on the other hand, relative to what has happened to the fed funds rate target, financial conditions have become more volatile. The hypothesis that Ed McKelvey and I put forward in 1997 in response to evidence of the so-called “Great Moderation” seems to be well supported by the past two economic downturns and their aftermaths:\n\nPut simply, longer stretches of economic growth imply greater leverage and complacency and thus, greater financial problems when recessions do occur. In brief, longer U.S. business cycles logically lead to four linked consequences—more financial leverage, longer bouts of balance sheet repair, more subdued recoveries and longer periods of decline in inflation and interest rates during the early stages of recovery. 2\n\nIf the economy is more stable, then market participants will have more appetite for risk. This works fine during the expansion stage, when growth is relatively stable. However, when a recession finally arrives, it is a bigger shock than when recessions were more frequent. This surprise results in a more substantial adjustment in financial conditions. Ironically, the increased stability of the business cycle during the expansion phase appears to increase the volatility and importance of financial conditions when recessions do occur.\n\nAt this stage, incorporating indicators of financial conditions into forecasting and into evaluating the conduct of monetary policy probably requires relying on constructing a “rough and ready” index. Macroeconomic models—especially dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models—do not incorporate robust financial sectors. Instead, these models have implicitly assumed that the monetary transmission mechanism and the financial intermediation process always works smoothly and predictably. 3\n\nEvents of the past decade confirm that financial conditions matter and that the fed funds rate is not a sufficient statistic with which to assess the impact of monetary policy on the real economy. Of course, this is not news to the Federal Reserve, which has explicitly taken financial conditions into account in its conduct of monetary policy. This is evident in the transcripts of the FOMC meetings that are publicly available and the numerous references to financial conditions in the FOMC minutes that go back more than a decade.\n\nAn analysis of the FOMC minutes over the past decade indicates that references to financial conditions have been frequent, especially recently. Exhibit 1 illustrates the percentage of paragraphs in the minutes (excluding the directive and some other paragraphs associated with administrative matters such as the election of the chairman) that mention the phrase \"financial conditions.\" As can be seen, there have been frequent references over the past decade. One peak occurred in 2000 when the stock market peaked and began to deflate. Thereafter, references fell off a bit until rising sharply again recently. Clearly, the recent financial crisis has underscored the importance of financial conditions.\n\nToday’s paper makes clear the importance of financial conditions. The paper’s analysis of the many financial conditions indexes that have been constructed as proxies for overall financial conditions finds that many of these indexes have done better than the fed funds rate or other single-variable financial indicators as predictors of real economic activity.\n\nHowever, as the paper also makes very clear, the indexes that have been developed are still very rudimentary. In particular, most financial conditions indexes are ad hoc and incomplete. In their review of the existing financial condition indexes, the authors find considerable differences across the indexes in the way that they are constructed and in terms of the variables included.\n\nIn addition, there is another difficulty. As the financial system changes over time, both in terms of structure and in terms of financial products, the financial variables that we might determine to be important are also changing. For example, in the wake of the recent financial crisis, the variables that the paper’s authors call “neoclassical”—such as the yield curve and stock market prices—appear to have become less important relative to the variables that the authors term “non-neoclassical”—such as quantity and survey measures of credit availability. Variables that would work best 10 years ago as forecasting tools may no longer be very useful. As the structure of the financial system changes, the identity of variables that capture financial conditions naturally changes.\n\nLet me now discuss the paper in more detail. I will do this in two steps. First, I will discuss the considerable contributions of the paper. Second, I will talk about where the paper might be extended and other areas of future research that might seem appropriate.\n\nIn general, I liked the paper. I think it makes some important contributions in how to construct a more complete and robust financial conditions index. In particular, I thought the paper makes two important points:\n\nThe authors deserve considerable credit for constructing a financial conditions index (FCI) that is more rigorous and complete than any that have been developed in the past—44 financial variables divided across five categories. Moreover, this is not just innovation for its own sake. The new FCI does a better job than single-factor models in forecasting real gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nSo what are the shortcomings of this approach? First, including 44 variables may generate good results more because the additional variables add greater flexibility to soak up variability in real GDP, rather than providing a more solid theoretical underpinning. As the authors note, the variables were selected, in part, on the basis of what we know today about which variables are likely to be important. But this type of selection process—even if conducted on a pseudo real-time basis—introduces selection bias, which the authors do admit could be important.\n\nSecond, despite the inclusion of a large number of variables, some important ones may still be missing. In particular, leverage variables—such as the leverage ratio of the major securities dealers—may be an important component of financial conditions. The work of Tobias Adrian and Hyun Shin suggests that the increase in leverage of the major securities was a major factor that fueled the asset bubble preceding the recent crisis. If this was indeed the case as seems likely, this type of variable should also be included in a financial conditions framework. 4\n\nThird, as the authors note, the resulting FCI is complex; it is difficult to estimate, update and to communicate what the results mean. I think FCIs have value as heuristic devices in highlighting what is important. One loses that benefit when the number of variables becomes large and the indexes become complex.\n\nFourth, it would be interesting to know how financial conditions indexes for other countries and regions would differ. The authors focus only on the United States. Thus, it is difficult to know whether the value of financial conditions indexes are specific to the United States or should be applied more broadly.\n\nFifth, I thought the paper could have gone further in exploring the implications of its results. The focus of the paper is on how to construct a financial conditions index that does a good job of forecasting economic activity. The paper does not tackle the implications for monetary policy stemming from developments in financial conditions as measured by the new FCI. If financial conditions evolve in an unanticipated way, how should this influence the conduct of monetary policy?\n\nIn particular, the authors note that during the 2003-06 period, financial conditions tightened less than expected given the rise in the fed funds rate and, during the 2007-08 period tightened even as the Federal Reserve slashed its fed funds rate target. These results raise a number of interesting questions. In particular, does the behavior of the new FCI imply that the Federal Reserve should have tightened more aggressively during the 2003-06 period or eased more aggressively during the 2007-09 period? The paper’s results seem to imply this, but it would be interesting to see whether this is the case or not.\n\nIt also would be useful to know how qualitatively important these differences are. If the differences are worth only a few basis points on the fed funds rate, then having a good indicator of financial conditions is not going to be a very important input in the formulation of monetary policy. In contrast, if a shift in financial conditions implies that the fed funds rate path was “off” by a hundred basis points relative to what actually occurred, then this obviously has big implications for monetary policy. The development of equilibrium models that incorporate financial conditions in a meaningful manner might prove helpful in answering these types of questions. 5\n\nIn addition, I would like to know how the various linkages have changed over time. Is the linkage between the fed funds rate and financial conditions as measured by the new FCI loosening over time or not? If so, why is this happening? Is it due to financial market innovation or the growth in share of the non-bank financial sector? I also would like to know how the linkage between financial conditions and the real economy is changing over time. If this is happening, what are the implications for macroeconomic stability and monetary policy?\n\nFinally, I would like to know about the dynamic properties of the new FCI. Are particularly high (expansive) readings dangerous and should they be taken as suggestive of asset bubbles? Should the Federal Reserve try to prevent such occurrences because loose financial conditions precede episodes of financial instability? In this respect, when financial conditions become unusually expansive, is the fed funds rate the right tool to use to constrain or counteract such expansiveness? Or would it be better to use macroprudential tools such as leverage limits or loan-to-value requirements on residential real estate to keep financial conditions from becoming unusually expansive in the first place? I could imagine circumstances in which macroprudential tools might be used to tighten up the relationship between the fed funds rate and financial conditions. Would the use of such tools be helpful in achieving greater macroeconomic stability?\n\nAt this stage, there are many more questions than answers. I would strongly encourage the authors and others to continue their work on financial conditions and in exploring how developments in the financial sector influence both the real economy and monetary policy. The financial crisis has demonstrated that financial market developments matter greatly. The paper successfully makes the case that it would be useful to have a good set of summary statistics to serve as benchmarks to keep track of such developments. It also would be useful to have a better understanding of how shifts in financial conditions should be considered in the ongoing conduct of monetary policy.\n\nEXHIBIT 1\n\nThe percentage of paragraphs in the FOMC minutes that mention the phrase \"financial conditions,\" excluding the directive and paragraphs associated with administrative matters such as election of the chairman.\n\n__________________________________________ 1 In my comments, I am going to assume that inflation expectations are always well anchored so that I do not need to distinguish between the real and nominal fed funds rate. 2 See The Brave New Business Cycle: No Recession in Sight , William Dudley and Edward McKelvey, January 1997, Goldman Sachs Economic Research Group. 3 Adding financial intermediation to these models has become a very active area of research. See, for example, the recent work of Vasco Curdia and Michael Woodford in “Credit Spreads and Monetary Policy,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 385. 4 See, for example, Tobias Adrian and Hyun Shin, manuscript in preparation for the forthcoming Handbook of Monetary Economics , volume 3, currently circulated as Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, No. 398 , October 2009. 5 The work of Vasco Curdia and Michael Woodford referenced above is one step in this direction.\n\nFinancial Conditions Indexes: A Fresh Look after the Financial Crisis Jan Hatzius, Peter Hooper, Frederic Mishkin, Kermit L.

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have an opportunity to speak here at the Economic Club of New York.  As the current chair of the Club, I’m admittedly biased, but this is a great venue to have the opportunity to share my thoughts about the U.S. economic outlook and the implications for monetary policy.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nBefore I start, I want to be clear about one specific issue I will not address today—that is, whether or not I expect the monetary policy normalization process to commence at the next FOMC meeting in December.  Let me just say that my view will depend on how incoming data, broadly defined, influences my assessment of the prospects for further improvement in the U.S. labor market and my confidence that inflation will return to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.\n\nWith that caveat out of the way, how do I assess the U.S. economic outlook?  On balance, I believe we have been making progress toward our goals, recognizing that a few issues still cloud the outlook.  Most noteworthy is the fact that inflation continues to run well below our 2 percent objective.\n\nWith respect to the economic growth outlook, the softness in third-quarter real GDP—which according to its initial estimate rose at only a 1.5 percent annualized pace—and the weakness of the manufacturing sector have raised concerns that the U.S. economy may be losing some forward momentum.  Sharp reductions in oil and gas drilling activity and a loss of international competitiveness associated with the dollar’s appreciation over the past year have restrained factory output.  Judging from historical experience, the impact of the dollar’s recent strength has the potential to be protracted, so that the trade sector probably will continue to be a drag on growth in 2016.  Thus, the manufacturing sector is likely to continue to lag behind the rest of economy.\n\nBut these negatives need to be set against the many positive aspects of the economic outlook.  In particular, domestic demand continues to grow at a solid pace as increases in consumer spending, housing and business fixed investment all contributed to the third quarter’s 2.9 percent annualized gain in real domestic final sales.  A large decline in the pace of inventory accumulation was the main reason why real GDP growth faltered in the third quarter.  Because the contribution to growth from inventory investment can be quite volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the growth in real final sales probably provides a better sense of the state of economic activity than does the GDP figure.\n\nMoreover, when one digs deeper, the fundamentals supporting domestic demand look quite sturdy.  For example, consumer spending has been well-supported by real income gains and rising household net worth.  Household balance sheets do not appear over-extended.  The household debt service burden is low, the household saving rate is not low relative to household net worth, and household credit growth has been slow.\n\nHousing fundamentals are solid as well.  Decent payroll gains have supported household formation over the past year and mortgage rates remain low.  Housing prices are rising and the constraint on growth in residential investment now appears to be more on the supply side, as building contractors struggle to mobilize the resources needed to construct more homes.  The National Association of Home Builders’ index rose in October to the highest level since late 2005.  While the housing indicators will likely continue to be volatile on a month-to-month basis, I expect the gradual improvement in the housing sector to continue.\n\nAlso, the international outlook appears less problematic than it did just a few months ago.  Although substantial questions remain about the Chinese growth outlook and the consequences of lower commodity prices for major commodity-exporting countries, we have seen two important positive developments.  First, the Chinese transition to a more balanced growth path appears to be underway—with stronger consumption and less emphasis on investment.  And the Chinese authorities have a range of tools available to support their economy during this transition.\n\nSecond, despite the intense strain placed on many emerging market economies by the substantial deterioration in recent years in their terms of trade, this stress does not yet appear to have led to the type of financial system breakage that might lead to widespread contagion and large capital flow reversals.  In fact, in recent weeks, emerging market equity markets have recovered substantial ground and many countries’ currencies have stabilized.\n\nIt is also important that the forward momentum in the jobs market persists.  The August and September employment reports raised some concerns that the U.S. labor market might be faltering.  Those concerns should be at least partially put to rest given the strength of the October employment report, recognizing that the employment news can be volatile on a month-to-month basis.  Most noteworthy to me are the strong payroll employment gains in October and the solid 0.3 percent rise in aggregate hours worked.  Over the past three months, payroll gains have averaged 187,000 per month, not much below the average payroll growth of 213,000 per month during the first half of 2015.\n\nWe are now much closer to our goal of maximum sustainable employment than at the start of the year.  The civilian unemployment rate is 5 percent, not much above the level generally viewed as consistent with full employment.  For example, in the September FOMC Summary of Economic Projections, the median estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate was 4.9 percent.  And, broader measures of unemployment―such as indicators that include people that are working part-time for economic reasons and discouraged workers who have left the labor market but still want a job—have also shown substantial improvement over the past year.\n\nDiscerning the degree of slack remaining in the labor market becomes more difficult as the margin of unused and underused labor resources shrinks.  My own assessment is that some margin still remains.  I reach that conclusion for two reasons.  First, broader measures of unemployment are still high relative to where you would expect them to be given a 5 percent civilian unemployment rate.  Part-time workers and discouraged workers remain a potential source of additional labor, and the labor market participation rate seems low even when adjusting for demographic factors.  If the normal historical relationship between the broader U6 measure of unemployment—which includes part-time workers that want a full-time job and discouraged workers—and the narrower U3 measure of unemployment—which excludes these workers—were to reassert itself, this would imply about an additional ¼ to ½ percentage point of labor market slack in my assessment.\n\nSecond, we have still not seen compelling evidence that a tightening labor market is leading to more rapid labor compensation gains.  Although average hourly earnings rose more quickly in October―pushing the year-over-year pace up to 2.5 percent―this indicator can be volatile on a month-to-month basis, and it has not been borne out by some other important measures of labor compensation.  For example, over the past year, the Employment Cost Index for private sector worker compensation has risen 1.9 percent, remaining within the narrow range of recent years.  This is important because my assessment of what constitutes maximum sustainable or full employment depends in large part on how a tighter labor market translates into compensation gains.  At the same time, one needs to be cautious about interpreting compensation trends in the current environment.  It is possible that factors such as very low headline inflation and weak productivity growth are holding down what workers receive in compensation.  Therefore, because of such factors, compensation growth may not provide a reliable signal about whether we are approaching full employment.\n\nTo sum up on the growth side, the economy looks to be in decent shape and is likely to continue to grow at a slightly above-trend pace.  Spare labor resources are shrinking.  But there still is some risk that the growth pace could slow as the trade sector acts as a drag on aggregate economic activity.\n\nOn the inflation side of the ledger, I have greater concerns because we continue to fall substantially short of our inflation objective of 2 percent for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator.  Over the past year, the PCE deflator has risen only 0.2 percent—held down by lower import prices and falling energy prices—and the core PCE deflator, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components, has risen 1.3 percent.\n\nThere is also some evidence that suggests that inflation expectations are under downward pressure.  In particular, some survey measures of long-term inflation expectations are at the low end of the ranges that have prevailed in recent years.  For example, the University of Michigan median measure of inflation expectations at a five-to-ten year horizon fell last month to 2.5 percent, the lowest level since September 2002.  Similarly, the New York Fed’s three-year median inflation expectations measure from our Survey of Consumer Expectations is currently at 2.8 percent, down from 3 percent a year ago.  The good news, however, is that these declines are very modest in magnitude.  Thus, I would still judge that inflation expectations remain well-anchored based upon these survey measures.\n\nSimilarly, measures of inflation compensation based on the interest rate spread between nominal Treasury securities and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) have fallen sharply over the past year.  For example, the Board of Governors’ 5-year, 5-year forward measure—in other words, what inflation compensation would be for the period five-to-ten years from now—currently stands at around 1.8 percent, down about 40 basis points from a year ago.\n\nHowever, I put even less weight on this development than on the survey evidence for two reasons.  First, the decline in these forward inflation compensation measures has been highly correlated with the fall in oil prices—a pattern that is hard to explain.  Second, a careful analysis of the factors behind the decline in inflation compensation suggests that changes in liquidity risk premia and what investors are willing to pay for inflation protection account for most of the decline, rather than the decline reflecting a change in inflation expectations.  Still, we need to continue to monitor inflation compensation closely, while recognizing that sorting out the allocation of the decline in inflation compensation across the three factors—liquidity risk premia, the price for inflation protection and inflation expectations—is admittedly difficult.  And also, the conclusions reached in such models are sensitive to these models’ assumptions and structures.\n\nRegardless of how much signal one takes from these recent data, a decline in inflation expectations below levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective would be problematic because inflation expectations are an important influence on actual inflation.  Businesses, for example, make decisions about the size of annual wage increases based, in part, on their expectations of future inflation.  And, households base their spending decisions, in part, on how fast they expect their incomes to rise, and inflation expectations play a role in that process.  Lower inflation expectations also raise the level of real interest rates, all else equal, which can undercut the power of monetary policy to support economic activity.  This is particularly relevant at the zero lower bound for interest rates.\n\nIf the economy continues to grow at an above-trend pace, then I think worries about inflation remaining too low should begin to recede.  After all, headline inflation on a year-over-year basis is likely to rise early next year as much of the past year’s decline in energy prices falls out of the year-over-year inflation rate calculations.  Also, some of the factors holding down headline and core inflation are likely to be transitory.  Energy prices will not go down forever and, as the dollar stabilizes, import prices will likely stop falling.  In addition, despite these factors that are weighing on core inflation, the recent trend of core inflation has been very steady, with the 12-month change in the core PCE deflator in a tight range of 1.2 to 1.7 percent since the beginning of 2013.  This suggests that core inflation should rise once these transitory factors dissipate.  Finally, I take some signal from the fact that the spread between the core services inflation rate and core goods inflation rate is wider than normal.  Core services likely better reflect the underlying trend, while core goods prices are more sensitive to external factors such as the drop in commodity prices and import prices.\n\nSo what does this imply for monetary policy and the likely timing and pace of interest rate normalization?  As you may be able to infer from my earlier remarks, I think it is quite possible that the conditions the Committee has established to begin to normalize monetary policy could soon be satisfied.  In particular, I will be evaluating the incoming information to see if it confirms my expectation that growth will be sufficient to further tighten the U.S. labor market.\n\nAfter lift-off commences, I expect that the pace of tightening will be quite gradual.  In part, that is because monetary policy is not as stimulative as the low level of the federal funds rate might suggest.  There is strong evidence that the short-term neutral real interest rate—let’s call that r*—is currently quite low, certainly below the level that historically has applied on a longer-term basis. 2\n\nA wide range of models suggest that the short-run real r* is currently around 0 percent, far below its historical longer-run level that is estimated to be about 2 percent. 3 This benchmark “neutral” rate needs to be compared to the actual real federal funds rate.  If we measure the latter by subtracting the core PCE inflation rate from the nominal federal funds rate, the actual real federal funds rate is slightly below -1 percent.  Thus, current short-term real interest rates are not far below their neutral counterparts, suggesting that the current monetary policy stance is not exceptionally stimulative.\n\nThe notion that r* is currently very low is also evident by more casual empiricism.  Simply ask the following question:  If r* were close to its long-run historical value of 2 percent, would we expect to see the economy growing at only slightly above its potential growth rate?  The fact that the economy is growing quite slowly despite a low federal funds rate and a very large Federal Reserve balance sheet suggests that monetary policy currently is not providing that much stimulus to the economy.  In other words, the gap between r* and the federal funds rate is relatively narrow.\n\nWhy is r* depressed and how is it likely to evolve over time?  In my view, several short-term factors are restraining r*.  First, the short-run r* is low because the foreign exchange value of the dollar has risen, reflecting both the fact that foreign economies are growing slowly and as well as an expectation that the monetary policies of the U.S. and other major economies will continue to diverge for some time.  If foreign demand picks up and the dollar weakens, then r* would likely rise over time as the persistent drag from the trade sector lessens.  Second, short-run r* is low because of the hangover of the financial crisis.  For example, mortgage credit availability for households with low FICO scores is still very limited compared to pre-housing boom standards.  This is constraining their ability to purchase housing, which holds back the pace of residential investment.  Also, because the searing experience of the Great Recession has likely caused households and businesses to be more cautious in terms of their saving and investment decisions, this has also pulled down the short-run value of r*.  Some of these factors should fade over time, gradually pushing up short-run r* toward its long-run value.\n\nAt the same time, there are some longer-term factors that are likely to keep r* below its long-run historical average far into the future.  In particular, potential real GDP growth in the U.S. appears to have declined in recent years—held down by slower productivity growth and demographic factors that are causing the workforce to grow more slowly.  This is the main reason why I have cut my estimate of the longer-run federal funds rate in recent years.  And I’m not alone.  In the FOMC’s September Summary of Economic Projections, the median projection for the long-run federal funds rate was 3 ½ percent, 50 basis points below  the level of two years earlier.\n\nMy discussion about short-run r* and long-run r* has implications for how I think about monetary policy.  The likelihood that we face a situation where the short-run r* is depressed, the economy is growing only slightly at an above-trend pace and inflation is too low relative to our objectives, suggests that we need to think carefully whether the time is right to begin to normalize monetary policy.  Additionally, the likelihood that long-run r* is lower than it has been historically, suggests that after lift-off the upward trajectory of the short-term rates is likely to be quite shallow.\n\nAnother factor that weighs on the timing and pace of normalization is risk management.  What are the relative costs of going too early versus too late?  As I see it, there are risks on both sides, and I think this explains why reasonable people can differ as to the appropriate path for the policy rate.  Consider the two main risks of normalizing too quickly.  First, we could just be too optimistic about our growth and inflation forecasts.  Second, we could be right about our forecasts, but the rise in short-term rates could provoke an outsized tightening of financial conditions that might cause the economy’s forward momentum to slow more than we anticipate.  In either case, the economy would not be growing fast enough to put increased pressure on resources.  In such circumstances, underlying inflation might not rise and inflation expectations could become unanchored to the downside.  Consequently, not only might the FOMC be forced to reverse course and ease monetary policy, but the efficacy of additional stimulus measures could be attenuated by the fall in inflation expectations.  Avoiding a Japan-like experience in which inflation expectations have become unanchored to the downside should be an important consideration in the conduct of monetary policy.\n\nOn the other side, there are several risks of delaying the start of lift-off and normalizing more slowly.  The first one is that the unemployment rate could fall to an unsustainably low level that is not consistent with our long-run price stability objectives.  Monetary policy works with long and variable lags, so overheating is a risk.  If overheating did occur, the FOMC might need to tighten monetary policy more aggressively in order to keep inflation from significantly overshooting its 2 percent objective.  In such circumstances, the risk of a recession would probably climb significantly.  In the past, it has been very difficult for the Federal Reserve to engineer a soft landing for the economy when it had to tighten policy aggressively in order to keep inflation in check.  Historically, once the unemployment rate rises above a small threshold of 0.3 to 0.4 percentage points, the next stop has always been a full-blown recession.  I very much would want to avoid such an outcome.  A long-lived economic expansion is always desirable, but especially so in the aftermath of the financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nThe second risk of delaying lift-off and normalizing more slowly is that the low level of the federal funds rate may be distorting financial markets and increasing financial stability risks.  I don’t think this has yet occurred to any significant degree, but it is a real risk that we should continue to monitor closely.\n\nI see the risks right now of moving too quickly versus moving too slowly as nearly balanced.  The weight that one puts on each undoubtedly influences one’s views on when the time will be right to begin to normalize monetary policy and the appropriate short-term rate trajectory thereafter.\n\nFinally, in conclusion, a few words about the importance of financial conditions in thinking about the future path of short-term interest rates.  Monetary policy does not work directly on the economy, but instead works through its effect on financial conditions.  By financial conditions, I mean all those financial factors that weigh on spending, saving and borrowing decisions.  Financial conditions include the level of the stock prices, the level of short- and long-term interest rates, the size of credit spreads, the foreign exchange value of the dollar and factors that weigh on the availability of credit.  If the linkage between financial conditions and the short-term interest rate controlled by the Federal Reserve were stable and predictable, then there would be no need to also monitor financial conditions.  But the linkage is not stable and predictable.  Sometimes financial conditions loosen or tighten in response to economic developments independent of our monetary policy decisions.  At other times, the response of financial conditions can be much larger or smaller than anticipated for a given change in interest rates.\n\nSeveral examples will help me make these points.  During 2004 to 2007, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate target 17 meetings in a row, lifting the federal funds to 5.25 percent from 1.0 percent.  Yet, during this period, financial conditions eased, as evidenced by the fact that the stock market rose, bond yields fell and credit availability—especially to housing—eased substantially.  In hindsight, perhaps monetary policy should have been tightened more aggressively.  In contrast, during the Fall of 2008, financial conditions tightened substantially even as the FOMC was cutting short-term rates.  Again, in hindsight, perhaps monetary policy should have been eased more aggressively.\n\nHow financial conditions evolve and how markets respond to our actions are important in influencing the economic outlook, and we need to take that into consideration in our monetary policy decision-making.  When we begin to normalize monetary policy, will we provoke another “taper tantrum,” or will market participants be relaxed as was the case when we actually tapered the rate of our asset purchases in 2014?  If financial conditions were to tighten more than expected when we began to normalize monetary policy, then I suspect we would go more slowly.  In contrast, if financial conditions did not respond at all, or eased, then I suspect we would go more quickly, all else equal.\n\nAlso, I don’t think there is a particular set of financial conditions that we should target.  After all, the linkage between financial conditions and the economy is variable and the economic outlook is influenced by much more than financial conditions.  Thus, I have no target in mind for the U.S. equity market or other indicators of financial conditions.  But I do care about how financial conditions evolve when the changes are sufficiently large or persistent enough so they are likely to influence the economic outlook.  In that case, financial conditions need to be taken into consideration in the design and conduct of monetary policy.\n\nIt has been a pleasure to speak here today.  I hope my comments have made it clear that the monetary policy decision-making process is difficult when the margins of excess capacity narrow, but inflation remains below our objectives.  The world is highly complex and there is much we don’t know about how the economy will evolve in the future.  As a Fed policymaker, I strive to be clear in my communications.  But I can’t tell you today precisely what I’d favor doing in the future, because that future remains uncertain.  Thank you very much for your kind attention.\n\n1 Jonathan McCarthy, Paolo Pesenti and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 This is also a reason to not rely on mechanical monetary policy rules that assume that short-run r* is constant over time.  The widely-cited Taylor rule, for example, typically utilizes an r* of 2 percent.  For my thoughts on the… shortcomings of using monetary policy rules versus an approach that considers a broader range of factors, see Panel Remarks at the Brookings Institute , October 15, 2015.\n\n3 The Laubach-Williams model constructed to estimate the short-run level of r* estimates that r* is currently about -0.1 percent. Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models, which take a very different approach to estimating r*, typically generate similar results.  For example, the New York Fed’s DSGE model currently puts the short-run r* at between -0.1 and 0.1 percent.

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here in Bali.  Today I plan to provide a brief summary of the U.S. economic outlook, incorporating recent U.S. economic data and global and financial market developments.  I will then discuss the implications of the outlook for U.S. monetary policy, and explain how international and financial market developments influence my thinking.  I will emphasize two key points.\n\nFirst, financial market conditions matter in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  Financial conditions affect households’ and firms’ decisions, so that the transmission of U.S. monetary policy to the real economy depends, to a large extent, on how changes in monetary policy help deliver the appropriate financial market conditions to support our objectives of price stability and maximum employment.   But financial conditions also evolve in response to domestic and international events.  Thus, when I reiterate that U.S. monetary policy is data dependent, that includes not just the information gleaned from important economic releases such as payroll employment and retail sales, but also how financial market conditions react to economic and financial market developments in the global economy.\n\nSecond, external events―such as Brexit―can have effects that go beyond just their impact on global trade.  Conversely, what we do in the United States has an impact far beyond our borders, and we need to take that into consideration in how we conduct and communicate monetary policy in the United States.  Put simply, monetary policy is a two-way street, and we all need to be cognizant of that. As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe U.S. Economic Outlook\n\nDespite the many twists and turns in the road so far, my baseline outlook for growth and inflation in the United States has not changed much in recent months.  After a weak first quarter, real GDP continued to grow sluggishly in the second quarter.  On the positive side, consumer spending rose more quickly during the second quarter.  On the negative side, business fixed-investment spending continued to disappoint, residential investment was weak and inventory investment was a substantial drag on growth.\n\nLooking forward, I expect economic activity to expand at roughly a 2 percent annualized pace over the next 18 months, appreciably above that of the past three quarters.  Over the remainder of this year, the economy should continue to get some lift from consumption and from a fiscal policy stance that remains mildly stimulative.  Moreover, I anticipate that residential investment will rebound from its decline in the second quarter.  This pace of growth would likely be sufficient to continue to absorb any remaining slack in the labor market and to support inflation moving back to our 2 percent objective.\n\nHowever, any forecast is uncertain and growth could end up higher or lower.  Let me turn to an assessment of the balance of risks around my growth outlook.  I believe that a sizable pickup in the rate of growth of economic activity relative to that in my forecast seems unlikely for a number of reasons.  Although consumer spending strengthened substantially in the second quarter, that stronger pace is unlikely to be sustained going forward.  That is because the fundamentals supporting consumption have softened somewhat.  Real income growth moderated in the second quarter as the pace of job gains slowed and the inflation rate rose, boosted by somewhat higher energy prices.  Even with the surprisingly large addition of 287,000 payroll jobs in June, the pace of improvement in the U.S. labor market appears to have slowed somewhat.  For example, over the past three months, payroll gains have averaged about 150,000 per month, as compared to an average of more than 200,000 per month over the course of 2015 and the first quarter of this year.  But even 150,000 job gains per month would be consistent with gradually using up any remaining slack present in the U.S. labor market.\n\nAlthough I expect business fixed investment to begin to grow again in the second half, it will likely remain soft as profits have stagnated and election year uncertainty could act as an additional depressant.  All else equal, investment tends to be weaker when uncertainty rises because this creates an incentive for businesses to delay decisions until the uncertainty is resolved. Also, trade seems likely to exert a net drag on growth.  There are two factors at play here: the sluggish growth rate of aggregate demand abroad and the continuing impact of earlier dollar appreciation on U.S. export competitiveness.\n\nWith respect to downside risks to the growth outlook, one that is hard to gauge is the potential fallout from the result of the recent U.K. referendum.  It is widely anticipated that U.K. growth will slow as a consequence.  Although the direct impact of slower U.K. growth on U.S. trade will almost certainly be very small—total U.S. exports to the U.K. are only about 0.7 percent  of U.S. GDP—there are a number of other channels that could amplify the impact of the Brexit decision on U.S. economic activity.  These include the potential adverse effects on European economic activity, on the perceived health of the global banking system, and on broader financial market conditions. To date, the global financial market fallout from the Brexit vote has been short-lived, and U.S. financial market conditions remain supportive to economic growth.  Nevertheless, I believe that the potential aftershocks pose medium-term downside risks to the global economy, and that these risks need to be monitored. With respect to inflation, I think the outlook has not changed much recently.  Headline inflation, as anticipated, has climbed a bit this year as earlier energy price declines have fallen out of the year-over-year inflation calculations.   In contrast, core inflation has been broadly stable, with the core PCE deflator rising by 1.6 percent over the past four quarters, moderately below our 2 percent objective.\n\nThe fact that core inflation has been broadly stable over recent months in the face of the earlier declines in energy and non-energy import prices is notable. It makes me somewhat more confident that overall inflation will return to our 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term as long as the economic growth that I expect actually materializes.  If the economy were to grow at the pace I discussed earlier, this would likely translate into sufficient job gains to continue to remove any remaining slack in the labor market—which, by my assessment, is already operating quite close to a level that is consistent with what is achievable on a sustainable basis.  This would likely lead to further pressure on labor resources, higher wages and, over time, somewhat higher inflation. In contrast, if growth were instead to fall below my forecast, then I would be less confident that inflation would return to our 2 percent objective.  In addition, I put some weight on the fact that surveys from both the University of Michigan and the New York Fed indicate that household longer-term inflation expectations have declined somewhat over the past year and are in the lower end of their historical ranges.  Nevertheless, I am not unduly worried because the magnitude of these declines has been modest, and because the New York Fed’s three-year-ahead inflation measure has been gradually increasing since January and has reversed much of the decline observed in the second half of 2015. Low longer-term inflation expectations, if allowed to become entrenched, would act as a restraint on actual inflation making it more difficult for us to meet our inflation objective.\n\nIn contrast, I put less weight on the significantly larger declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation over the past two years.   From my perspective, these declines seem driven more by changes in bond term premia and the relative liquidity characteristics of nominal versus inflation-protected Treasury securities than by sharply falling inflation expectations.\n\nImplications of the Outlook for U.S. Monetary Policy\n\nIf, as I have indicated, the U.S. growth and inflation outlooks have not changed notably, then why have expectations about U.S. monetary policy shifted so much?   Compared to the start of the year, the expected timing of any further Fed interest rate hikes has been pushed back, and the expected upward trajectory of U.S. short-term rates is now much flatter.\n\nThere are several reasons to explain these shifts.  First, assessments of the neutral real short-term interest rate have declined as economic growth has consistently fallen short of consensus forecasts.  With the U.S. economy having grown at only a 2.1 percent annual rate over the past seven years, it has become harder to sustain the view that the neutral real short-term interest rate is close to, or will soon be close to, its historical level of around 2 percent.  Estimates of the neutral real short-term interest rate obtained from many of the DSGE models used within the Federal Reserve System are currently clustered around zero, and this seems reasonable to me.  An implication is that at present there is only a small gap between the actual real short-term rate of about -1 percent and the neutral real short-term rate.  In other words, U.S. monetary policy is accommodative, but only moderately so.\n\nIn addition, I suspect that many have come to question the view that headwinds from the financial crisis are temporarily depressing the neutral short-term rate, and that the neutral short-term rate will significantly rise in the near-future as these headwinds dissipate.  If the headwinds have not dissipated to a meaningful degree in the seven years since the recession ended, then why should one expect them to necessarily diminish quickly over the next couple of years?  Evidence is accumulating that some of the headwinds are likely to prove more persistent.  For example, the reduced availability of mortgage financing for those with lower credit scores seems likely to continue.  Lenders now appreciate that home prices can decline significantly.  Thus, they cannot rely as much on the value of the housing collateral in securing their mortgage loans, and consequently now put more weight on the credit histories of the borrowers.\n\nMarket participants may also be taking some signal from the gradual decline in the median long-run federal funds rate projection of FOMC participants shown in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).  I think this indicates a growing consensus that the neutral real short-term rate will not return anytime soon to its historical norm of 2 percent.\n\nA second reason for the downward adjustment in U.S. interest rate expectations is that U.S. financial market conditions depend, in part, on the stance of U.S. monetary policy relative to monetary policies abroad.  If the economic outlook abroad deteriorates and this causes foreign countries to pursue a more accommodative set of monetary policies, then the dollar would likely appreciate―other things equal― reflecting expectations of lower interest rates abroad relative to U.S. interest rates. In this case, the U.S. may need to adjust its own monetary policy path.  If the FOMC did not make this adjustment, the stronger dollar could result in an undesired tightening of U.S. financial conditions.   The expected forward interest rate paths in Europe and Japan have fallen considerably this year.  If the FOMC had followed the median federal funds rate path from the December 2015 SEP projection, then the U.S. dollar would likely have appreciated much more significantly.   Instead, the U.S. interest rate path has come down in tandem with the foreign interest rate paths and the dollar has appreciated only modestly.\n\nThis is a crucial point and I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding.  The Federal Reserve is not targeting the exchange value of the U.S. dollar.   What the FOMC considers are financial conditions broadly defined, because they affect the saving and investment decisions of households and firms. The dollar is but one component of these financial conditions.  The level of short- and long-term rates, credit spreads, and equity prices are also important components of the financial conditions that we closely monitor.  If international developments shift U.S. financial market conditions―including the dollar―then we need to take this into consideration in our U.S. monetary policy decisions.\n\nThird, I have found that market participants broadly appreciate that the FOMC needs to take a risk management approach in its conduct of monetary policy.  There are at least two important aspects of this approach.  The first is whether the balance of risks to the outlooks for either economic growth or inflation are skewed to the upside or downside.  The second is whether the efficacy of monetary policy itself is asymmetric when monetary policy is at, or close to, the zero lower bound for interest rates. In this situation, it may be easier to implement a tighter monetary policy through raising rates, than it would be to implement a looser policy using unconventional tools.  Also, the effects of a policy of raising rates may be more predictable compared to the effects from using unconventional tools.\n\nAs I noted earlier, I think the medium-term risks to the U.S. economic growth outlook are somewhat skewed to the down side.  Thus, this needs to be taken into consideration in terms of the appropriate stance for U.S. monetary policy.  With respect to the efficacy of monetary policy, given how close we remain to the zero lower bound for interest rates, I also think the risks are asymmetric.  Therefore, we need to be a bit more careful about the risk of tightening monetary policy in a manner that proves to be premature, as compared to the alternative risk of being a little late.  If we were to realize that we were slightly late, policy can be adjusted by raising short-term interest rates more quickly. 2\n\nAll three of these reasons—evidence that U.S. monetary policy is currently only moderately accommodative, the fact that U.S. financial conditions have been influenced by economic and financial market developments abroad, and risk management considerations—argue, at the moment, for caution in raising U.S. short-term interest rates.   So, directionally, the movement in investor expectations towards a flatter path for U.S. short-term interest rates seems broadly appropriate.\n\nThat said, to my eye, market expectations derived from futures prices—which price in about one 25 basis point rate hike through the end of 2017—appear to be too complacent.  If the incoming information validates my view of the outlook, then I believe that U.S. monetary policy will likely need to move at a faster pace than implied by futures prices towards a more neutral posture as the labor market tightens further and U.S. inflation rises.  Moreover, market expectations may be putting insufficient weight on the possibility that the economy could outperform our expectations, that financial conditions could ease, or that the risks to growth from Brexit and other international developments could fade away.  If such events were to occur, this might necessitate a faster pace of adjustment.\n\nFor these reasons, I think it is premature to rule out further monetary policy tightening this year.  As I said before, it depends on the data, broadly defined, and, as we all know, that is not something one can predict with any accuracy.\n\nIt’s a Two-Way Street\n\nThe U.S. economy plays a large role in the global economy.  Most significantly, the U.S. economy represents a sizable share of world GDP—roughly 25 percent at current exchange rates—and the U.S. dollar is the most important international reserve currency.  More than 60 percent of central bank reserve assets are denominated in dollars, and that share has been stable to rising in recent years.  Most foreign trade is denominated in dollars and most of the foreign currency debt issued by corporations abroad is denominated in dollars.  Thus, what happens to the U.S. economy, U.S. financial asset prices and the exchange value of the dollar has important implications for the global economy.\n\nAt the same time, prosperity is very much a two-way street.  Developments outside the United States affect our domestic economic outlook through their impact on trade and financial market conditions, and we have to take such developments into consideration in our monetary policy decision-making.\n\nIn many ways, international linkages have become more important over time.  This is because international trade has increased rapidly over the past few decades as the world economy has become more developed and globalized—notwithstanding the flattening of the global trade-to-GDP ratio over the past few years.  And, global trade interactions have become more complex as supply chains have become more extensive and intricate, often involving many different countries.\n\nFinancial markets across the globe have also become more integrated.  Developments in one market now appear to have larger effects on other markets than was generally the case historically.   Consider, for example, how European and Japanese central bank quantitative easing activity has helped drive the sharp decline in long-term U.S. Treasury yields this year.  Or, in the other direction, consider the global bond market taper tantrum in 2013. In this case, markets reacted to then-Chairman Bernanke’s musing that the Federal Reserve was beginning to evaluate when the time would be right to begin the tapering of the Fed’s asset purchase program.  Or, in a similar vein, consider the international financial market reaction to China’s decision to alter its foreign exchange rate regime and how the RMB is managed relative to the dollar versus a broader basket of foreign currencies.\n\nThe growing interdependence can be seen in the increased correlation of market movements both across countries and across asset classes.  Periods of “risk on” versus “risk off” trading now occur on a global basis.   For example, equity market movements in developed and emerging markets have exhibited a 76 percent positive correlation over the past six months. This is only slightly below the all-time peak of 82 percent in 2009, and significantly above the 57 percent correlation that prevailed from 1995 through 2007.\n\nCorrelations across asset classes have also been increasing. For example, consider the set of assets comprised of the 10-year U.S. Treasury, U.S. equities, international equities, oil, the VIX, a trade-weighted dollar index and the BAA credit spread. We can construct a variable—called a common factor—to capture as much of the overall movement and co-movements for the series in this set.  The more closely the series’ movements are tied together, the greater the explanatory content of the common factor.  Currently, the derived common factor accounts for 50 percent of the variation in these financial variables, up from 30 percent in early 2014.\n\nOil, in particular, has become more correlated with other assets. Prior to 2008, oil was virtually uncorrelated with equities and Treasuries.  Whereas, in 2016, its correlation with these two asset classes has been more than 45 percent.\n\nThese effects are transmitted via many linkages, not just through trade and financial markets.  Consider, the many different channels of potential Brexit influence—not only the impact on international trade and global interest rates and currencies, but also on bank equity prices and on political uncertainty.\n\nGiven this interdependency, what should we do about it?   Interdependency and linkages do not mean that U.S. monetary policy should subordinate its domestic goals for international ones.  The Federal Reserve has a clear domestic-oriented mandate that was set by the U.S. Congress. Instead, I believe that setting U.S. monetary policy to best achieve our domestic mandate will help to support sustainable growth and development abroad.  As I see it, there are two key steps that are essential in the design of an appropriate monetary policy strategy.\n\nStep one is to take an expansive view of the global eco-system in which we all operate.  We need to take into consideration that our decisions have broad consequences for the global economy and, conversely, that international developments can have significant consequences for the U.S. economic outlook and therefore the appropriate stance of U.S. monetary policy.  As part of this, we need to be nimble in incorporating new developments into our monetary policy decision-making.\n\nStep two is to communicate clearly and consistently.  That means clarity about the objectives of monetary policy, how the Fed plans to meet those objectives in light of the economic and financial market environment, and how it formulates its responses to unforeseen circumstances that lead to revisions to its economic forecast.\n\nIn my view the Federal Reserve is making progress in both of these areas.  With respect to the first step, I believe we do take an expansive view of those factors that might affect the U.S. outlook and we revise our views accordingly.  Our speeches, statements, and actions this year illustrate this is how we operate.  For example, after the market turbulence at the start of the year, we kept monetary policy on hold at the March FOMC meeting and explicitly referenced “readings on financial and international developments” in the FOMC statement.   Similarly, in speeches prior to the Brexit vote and in the FOMC minutes, we raised our concerns about the risks of disorderly outcomes associated with the U.K. referendum.  For instance, the June FOMC minutes state:  “Most participants noted that the upcoming British referendum on membership in the European Union could generate financial market turbulence that could adversely affect domestic economic performance.” In addition we are doing a reasonably good job incorporating the flow of new information into our forecasts.  The fact that the federal funds rate projections from the SEP have changed significantly from quarter to quarter indicates that FOMC participants are responsive to new information.\n\nNow, some have expressed an alternative view that the movement in these rate projections is an indication that the FOMC’s reaction function is unstable and unmoored.  I do not see it that way at all.  The forecasts of FOMC participants with respect to growth and inflation have not changed much this year.  What have changed are expectations about the monetary policy stance that would be appropriate in order to achieve those outcomes.  It is important to emphasize that these interest rate projections are not commitments.  They are point-in-time views of the appropriate interest rate path and are updated as economic circumstances and financial market conditions change and evolve.\n\nWith respect to communication, in recent years the Federal Reserve has shifted towards much greater transparency.  This includes quarterly press conferences by the Fed chair following FOMC meetings; publishing growth, inflation and short-term interest rate forecasts of FOMC participants on a quarterly basis; and a concerted effort to lay out the guideposts that the FOMC will look at in assessing progress towards our dual mandate objectives.\n\nOn the communication front, although we have come a long way, I would admit that there is still room for further improvement.  For example, the focus of the SEP on the each participant’s modal forecast does not convey how much uncertainty there is about the economic outlook.  Similarly, language used in FOMC statements can become stale over time.  We tend to make relatively few changes to the statement language each meeting because of the acute market sensitivity to such changes.  One could argue that this might not be the best practice to follow, but we should recognize that there would also be significant transition costs if we were to make more extensive revisions to the statement at each meeting.\n\nFor monetary policy to be effective, it is important to have clarity about what the FOMC can be clear and consistent about—its manner of responses to mitigate the potential harmful effects of disturbances and the goals of policy.   In contrast, our monetary policy projections and the actions we take cannot be static.  If economic circumstances change, then monetary policy needs to change too. Otherwise, we will not be able to achieve our objectives.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 Tobias Adrian, Matthew Higgins, Jonathan McCarthy, Paolo Pesenti, Robert Rich, Giorgio Topa, Joseph Tracy and Peter Van Tassel assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 Of course, if the economy were to weaken, we still have plenty of tools.  Not only could we cut short-term interest rates, but we also could extend the maturity of our Treasury and agency MBS portfolio, purchase additional Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities and engage in forward guidance with respect to the future path of short-term interest rates.",

    "text": "As I noted earlier at the start of today’s workshop, improving culture in the financial services industry is an imperative.  This endeavor is important in order to ensure financial stability over time, but also to ensure the public trust in our financial system.  In my remarks today, I will first talk about what I see as the culture problem.  Then, I will focus on how incentives could be improved within the financial services industry to encourage better culture and behavior.  This includes how we compensate employees of a financial institution, but it also extends to how these firms identify wrong-doers and punish them.  As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe Existing Culture Problem\n\nIn recent years, there have been ongoing occurrences of serious professional misbehavior, ethical lapses and compliance failures at financial institutions.  This has resulted in a long list of large fines and penalties, and, to a lesser degree than I would have desired employee dismissals and punishment.  Since 2008, fines imposed on the nation’s largest banks have far exceeded $100 billion. 2 The pattern of bad behavior did not end with the financial crisis, but continued despite the considerable public sector intervention that was necessary to stabilize the financial system.  As a consequence, the financial industry has largely lost the public trust.  To illustrate, a 2012 Harris poll found that 42 percent of people responded either “somewhat” or “a lot” to the statement that Wall Street “harms the country”; furthermore, 68 percent disagreed with the statement: “In general, people on Wall Street are as honest and moral as other people.”\n\nI reject the narrative that the current state of affairs is simply the result of the actions of isolated rogue traders or a few bad actors within these firms.  As James O’Toole and Warren Bennis observed in their Harvard Business Review article about corporate culture: “Ethical problems in organizations originate not with ‘a few bad apples’ but with the ‘barrel makers’.” 3 That is, the problems originate from the culture of the firms, and this culture is largely shaped by the firms’ leadership.  This means that the solution needs to originate from within the firms, from their leaders.\n\nWhat do I mean by the culture within a firm? Culture relates to the implicit norms that guide behavior in the absence of regulations or compliance rules—and sometimes despite those explicit restraints.  Culture exists within every firm whether it is recognized or ignored, whether it is nurtured or neglected, and whether it is embraced or disavowed.  Culture reflects the prevailing attitudes and behaviors within a firm.  It is how people react not only to black and white, but to all of the shades of grey.  Like a gentle breeze, culture may be hard to see, but you can feel it.  Culture relates to what “should” I do, and not to what “can” I do.\n\nA number of factors have contributed to the cultural failures that we have seen.  An important question is whether the sheer size, complexity and global scope of large financial firms today have left them “too big to manage.”  Large problems can originate in small corners of these firms, as illustrated by the Financial Products Group experience at AIG, and the “London Whale” episode at JPMorgan.  Differences in attitudes and business practices across countries can also be difficult to reconcile within a firm’s overall compliance function.  Recent fines against BNP Paribas for violating U.S. sanctions programs and providing dollar funding to a country engaged in genocide and against Credit Suisse for facilitating tax evasion by U.S. citizens, point to these challenges.  Another important element affecting culture has been the shift in the prevailing business model away from traditional commercial and investment banking activities to trading; that is, from client-oriented to transaction-oriented activities.  Clients became counterparties—the other side of a trade—rather than partners in a long-term business relationship.  In general, interactions became more depersonalized, making it easier to rationalize away bad behavior, and more difficult to identify who would be harmed by any unethical actions.\n\nHigh-powered pay incentives linked to short-term profits, combined with a flexible and fluid job market, have also contributed to a lessening of firm loyalty—and, sometimes, to a disregard for the law—in an effort to generate larger bonuses.  Often allegiance to an external network of traders has been more important than the ties the trader has to his or her particular employer.  This is particularly evident in the illegal manipulations of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and with respect to reference rates in the foreign exchange markets.\n\nAlthough cultural and ethical problems are not unique to the finance industry, financial firms are different from other firms in important ways. First, the financial sector plays a key public role in allocating scarce capital and exerting market discipline throughout a complex, global economy.  For the economy to achieve its long-term growth potential, we need a sound and vibrant financial sector.  Financial firms exist, in part, to benefit the public, not simply their shareholders, employees and corporate clients.  Unless the financial industry can rebuild the public trust, it cannot effectively perform its essential functions.  For this reason alone, the industry must do much better.\n\nAs was discussed earlier, in the U.K., seven of its largest banking institutions have recently founded the Banking Standards Review Council under the leadership of Sir Richard Lambert, who joined us today.  I would strongly encourage the largest institutions based here in the United States to work to develop collaborative solutions aimed at improving culture and rebuilding the public trust.\n\nThe Key Role for Senior Leadership\n\nCorrecting this problem must start with senior leadership of the firm.  The “tone at the top” and the example that senior leaders set is critical to an institution’s culture—it largely determines the “quality of the barrel.”  As a first step, senior leaders need to hold up a mirror to their own behavior and critically examine behavioral norms at their firm.  Sustainable change at any firm will take time.  Turning around a firm’s culture is a marathon not a sprint.  Senior leaders must take responsibility for the solution and communicate frequently, credibly and consistently about the importance of culture.  Boards of directors have a critical role to play in setting the tone and holding senior leaders accountable for delivering sustainable change.  A healthy culture must be carefully nurtured for it to have any chance of becoming self-sustaining.\n\nFirms must take a comprehensive approach to improving their culture that encompasses recruitment, onboarding, career development, performance reviews, pay and promotion.  All of these elements need to be aligned with the desired culture.  Through our supervisory process, we have seen that a number of firms have started this process by developing or refining employee surveys and 360 feedback processes to target issues of behavior and culture.  Some firms are incorporating case study discussions into training programs to highlight ethical dilemmas and decision-making.  Some are revamping senior level promotion criteria to reinforce what are the desired characteristics and behaviors of leaders.  These efforts are at various stages in terms of their depth, breadth and maturity.  Supervisors will need to see how these frameworks evolve, and more importantly, see evidence of how these efforts yield results in the form of more open and routine escalation of issues, consistent application of “should we” versus “could we” in business decisions, rigor in identifying and controlling of conduct risk, and how compliance breaches factor into compensation.\n\nMeasurement and accountability for progress in developing a healthier culture across the industry is paramount to us as supervisors and central bankers.  An important measurement of progress is employees’ assessment of their firm’s culture.  To this end, we encourage the industry to harness the various individual efforts that have been initiated at a number of firms in order to develop a comprehensive culture survey.  This anonymous survey would be fielded across firms each year by an independent third-party and the results shared with supervisors.  Having a common survey instrument would promote benchmarking of, and accountability for, progress on culture and behavior.\n\nA core element of any firm’s mission and culture must be a respect for law.  Federal Reserve guidance advises that banks should strive to “[m]aintain a corporate culture that emphasizes the importance of compliance with laws and regulations and consumer protection.” 4 To maintain such a culture, senior leaders must promote effective self-policing.  If audit uncovers an instance of fraud in one unit, the firm’s leadership should ask, “Where else could this behavior occur?”  If the press reports fraud at a competitor in a particular business line, the same self-assessment should apply.  “Could this happen to us, could we have a similar problem here?”  When fraud is detected, boards and senior leaders must ensure that they are informed promptly, and that a thorough inquiry is undertaken at once.  The senior leaders of financial firms, and those who report to them, must also be proactive in reporting illegal or unethical activity.  Early self-reporting sends a powerful message to employees and to regulators about a firm’s respect for law.  This is one important reason why those who self-report in a timely way should be treated preferentially, compared to those that drag their feet and whose bad behaviors are only uncovered by enforcement investigations.\n\nHow will a firm know if it is making real progress?  Not having to plead guilty to felony charges or being assessed large fines is a good start.  Firms should also pay closer attention to how they and the industry are broadly viewed by the public.  Internally, one important marker for progress is the frequency of problems, and whether small problems stay small, or instead, grow into large problems.  A healthy culture is one where problems are identified early and promptly addressed.\n\nIn addition to a strong compliance function, firms need to foster an environment that rewards the free exchange of ideas and views.  Individuals should feel that they can raise a concern, and have confidence that the issues will be escalated and fully considered.  This is a critical element to prevention.  A firm’s employees are its best monitors, but this only works well if they feel a shared responsibility to speak up, expect to be heard and their efforts supported by senior management.\n\nLet me give you an example to take this from the abstract to the more specific.  As I noted in a speech a few weeks ago on the issue of reference rate reform, in the case of the LIBOR setting process, the information barriers between the traders and LIBOR submitters were paper thin and porous. 5 At times, traders and LIBOR submitters colluded to manipulate LIBOR for the gain of the traders and the firm.\n\nWhat should have happened instead goes like this:  A trader asks the LIBOR submitter to adjust the submitted rate.  The submitter says “no way,” tells the trader that this request is inappropriate and that the trader will be reported to compliance.  The submitter reports the trader’s attempt at manipulation to legal and compliance.  Compliance investigates to confirm the facts.  The trader is fired and is fully prosecuted for any criminal actions.  For this all to happen, a firm doesn’t just have to have the right rules and procedures in place, but it also needs the right culture to ensure that those rules and procedures are followed, that the bad behavior sees the light of day immediately and that the transgressors are punished in a way that is known broadly throughout the firm—that is, a clear example of the consequences is demonstrated to others.\n\nHow Can Better Incentives Help?\n\nIn my example, for matters to work properly, I think it is important that all the players—traders, compliance, risk and legal, have the right incentives to behave in the way that is appropriate and that aligns their interests with the broader interests of the firm in rooting out bad behaviors.  One way in which incentives can be shaped is through the structure of compensation.  I believe that a proper compensation system can be an important tool for enhancing culture, promoting financial stability and rebuilding the public trust in the financial industry.\n\nIncentives matter for individual behaviors and decisions in all industries, including the financial industry.  Some might argue, however, that risk-takers are drawn to finance like they are drawn to Formula One racing, and that regardless of risk or reward, these types of individuals will always want to push the boundaries.  This logic might lead one to conclude that incentives are unlikely to be an effective tool to limit excessive risk-taking and to promote more ethical behavior in the financial sector.  I disagree.  First, the degree to which an industry attracts risk-takers is not pre-ordained, but reflects the prevailing incentives in the industry.  After all, risk-takers have options.  Second, and, more importantly, incentives matter even for risk-takers.\n\nIn my speech on ending too big to fail, I stressed the importance of reducing the likelihood that large financial firms would face insolvency, as well as the need for a credible resolution plan that does not involve taxpayer money.  Compensation policies can play a useful role in reducing excessive risk-taking.  Similarly, compensation policies can complement an improved culture, and play a role in reducing unethical and fraudulent behavior.  Individuals who decide to bend the rules or to step over the line usually do this in the context of an assessment of the expected risks and rewards of their actions.\n\nThis implies that one objective should be to rebalance the scales so that the expected risks from unwanted behaviors are more likely to outweigh the expected rewards.  The expected risks are a function of the likelihood that an individual (or set of individuals) is caught and the attendant consequences.  The expected rewards include any financial and psychic benefits to the individual from the behavior if undetected.  Improved culture helps to tip the balance in the favor of better behaviors by increasing the likelihood that an individual will both feel an obligation to behave properly, and be prevented by others from carrying out bad behavior.  In addition, a strong culture can also reduce the rewards some employees may hope to enjoy.  In its simplest form, a strong culture means that individuals who get away with unethical or illegal activities will not have the satisfaction of “bragging rights” about their actions because there are no congratulations for breaking the law or outwitting compliance.  A strong culture will reinforce the simple reward of having done the right thing. A clear conscience can be a powerful reward.\n\nA well-designed compensation structure can also help favorably tip the balance by effectively extending the time horizon of senior management and material risk-takers, and by forcing them to more fully internalize the consequences of their actions.  There are two important dimensions of the structure of compensation—first, how much compensation is paid out immediately versus deferred into the future, and second, the form of the compensation that is deferred—cash, equity, equity options or debt.  For deferred compensation, the rules for how it vests and under what conditions it can be forfeited are important.  Getting the balance right is critical.  For my part, I believe that in order to improve financial stability and rebuild the public trust, more compensation in finance needs to be deferred and for longer periods.  Also, I think there needs to be a shift in the mix of deferred compensation away from equity and towards debt.\n\nThe optimal structure of deferred compensation likely differs with respect to the goals of providing incentives to support prudent risk-taking versus encouraging the right culture.  For example, consider trades that might appear to be highly profitable on a mark-to-market basis, but take some time to be closed out and for the profits to be realized in fact, not just on paper.  In this case, as long as deferred compensation is set at a horizon longer than the life of the trade, this can ensure the firm’s and the trader’s incentives are aligned and the “trader’s option” is effectively mitigated.  This component of deferred compensation could take the form of either cash or equity.\n\nHowever, in contrast to the issue of trading risk, unethical and illegal behavior may take a much longer period of time—measured in many years—to surface and to be fully resolved.  For this reason, I believe that it is also important to have a component of deferred compensation that does not begin to vest for several years.  For example, the deferral period might be five years, with uniform vesting over an additional five years.  Given recent experience, a decade would seem to be a reasonable timeframe to provide sufficient time and space for any illegal actions or violations of the firm’s culture to materialize and fines and legal penalties realized.  As I will argue below, I also believe that this longer vesting portion of the deferred compensation should be debt as opposed to equity. 6\n\nI noted earlier that improving a financial firm’s culture will take sustained determination and commitment from its senior leaders.  Deferred compensation can play a useful role in reinforcing buy-in of senior leadership to this endeavor.  As I discussed last November, an important element of a Title II resolution under Dodd-Frank is that there is sufficient long-term unsecured debt at the holding company level to recapitalize a failing bank.  I indicated in my remarks that it would be useful if a meaningful component of this debt was contributed by the senior management and the firm’s material risk-takers.  That is, if a bank ran into solvency problems, this component of deferred compensation would be used to recapitalize the restructured bank.  The goal is to incent senior management and the material risk-takers to focus on maximizing the long-term “enterprise” value of the firm, not just the short-term share price.  In this framework, I would expect the relative size of the debt component of deferred compensation to increase as one moved up the management ranks to the senior managers of the firm.  That is, the individuals who have the greatest impact on a firm’s strategic direction should have the strongest incentives to maximize the firm’s long-term enterprise value.\n\nIf we have this deferred compensation structure in place for financial firms, then we can leverage it to strengthen the incentives for senior leaders to design and implement the necessary changes to improve their firm’s culture.  That is, this deferred debt compensation can be used as a “performance bond.”  Performance bonds are used in many situations such as security deposits on rental properties.  Today, when a financial firm is assessed a large fine it is paid by the shareholders of the firm.  Although senior management may own equity in the firm, their combined ownership share is likely small, and so management bears only a small fraction of the fine.  Now, having shareholders pay may create market discipline in that they have an incentive to better monitor the firm’s actions.  However, financial firms are not transparent enterprises, and it would be difficult even for a diligent shareholder to be able to know when these bad behaviors are taking place, much less to be able to take actions to prevent them.  This limits the potential effectiveness of market discipline exerted by shareholders.\n\nHow can we improve on this situation? Assume instead that a sizeable portion of the fine is now paid for out of the firm’s deferred debt compensation, with only the remaining balance paid for by shareholders.  In other words, in the case of a large fine, the senior management and the material risk-takers would forfeit their performance bond.  This would increase the financial incentive of those individuals who are best placed to identify bad activities at an early stage, or prevent them from occurring in the first place.  In addition, if paying the fine were to deplete the pool of deferred debt below a minimum required level, the solution could be to reduce the ratio of current to deferred pay until the minimum deferred compensation debt requirement is again satisfied—that is, until a new performance bond is posted.\n\nNot only would this deferred debt compensation discipline individual behavior and decision-making, but it would provide strong incentives for individuals to flag issues when problems develop.  Each individual’s ability to realize their deferred debt compensation would depend not only on their own behavior, but also on the behavior of their colleagues.  This would create a strong incentive for individuals to monitor the actions of their colleagues, and to call attention to any issues.  This could be expected to help to keep small problems from growing into larger ones.  Importantly, individuals would not be able to “opt out” of the firm as a way of escaping the problem.  If a person knew that something is amiss and decided to leave the firm, their deferred debt compensation would still be at risk.  This would reinforce the incentive for the individual to stay at the firm and to try to get the problem fixed.\n\nThis might work for senior managers, but what about those material risk-takers who are early in their careers at a firm and do not have much wealth tied up through deferred compensation to serve as an effective performance bond?  How do we provide strong incentives for these traders not to put the firm at risk by their potential illegal behavior?  In these cases, we can create the performance bond in a slightly different manner.  Individuals who enter finance have generally invested heavily to develop the specialized skills required in the field.  These skills typically have a higher return in finance than they do in any other occupation.  That is, workers in finance earn a premium relative to their next best alternative job outside of the industry.  Over the course of a career, this premium can be expected to add up to a significant sum of money.  This cumulative premium can act like a performance bond.  For this to be the case, however, an individual who is convicted of illegal activities, or who violates a firm’s code of conduct would need to face the risk of being permanently denied employment in the financial industry.  Rather than paying for the performance bond upfront, the bond is posted in terms of the privilege to continue to work in the industry.\n\nThere are several steps that can be taken to implement this concept.  The first step is to make it more difficult for employees in finance who cross ethical boundaries to be able to move from one firm to another in order to escape the consequences.  Currently, lenders who are considering making a loan to a borrower can look up the borrower’s credit score which reflects the borrower’s performance on past loans.  In a similar manner, it would be helpful if financial firms, prior to making a hiring decision, could look up a candidate’s “ethics and compliance score” that reflects the individual’s past performance at other financial firms.\n\nAlong these lines, one approach would be to create a central registry that tracks the hiring and firing of traders and other financial professionals across the industry.  There would be many details to sort out regarding how to do this in a manner that was both transparent and consistent with due process.  The database could be maintained by the official sector—specifically, by financial institution supervisors—based on information provided by supervised financial institutions.  A similar regime already exists in the broker-dealer context, in which supervised institutions are required to file U4 and U5 forms when they hire and part ways with licensed professionals.  Banking supervisors could consider whether it was appropriate to import these concepts to the banking industry.  To help support the completeness and accuracy of the filings, the filing firms could be subject to a safe harbor, akin to the civil immunity for filing a Suspicious Activity Report, so that employers do not fear liability for good faith reporting.  Under this approach, new regulations could also require that all financial institutions search the database prior to hiring any trader or financial professional; so that any prior reported events could be taken into account in the course of a hiring decision.  As I mentioned, there would, of course, need to be adequate safeguards for employees to challenge an entry, consistent with due process.\n\nFurthermore, as a complementary step to the registry, it would be helpful if individuals in finance who are convicted of an illegal activity were prohibited from future employment in the financial services industry.  Currently, Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act prohibits anyone convicted of a crime of dishonesty, breach of trust, or money laundering from working at an insured depository institution or bank holding company. 7 One possibility could be to amend Section 19 to cover the entire financial services industry.  The precise formulation of an amendment would need to be worked out, but the application should be sufficiently broad so that it also covers asset managers, hedge funds and private equity funds.  Like the registry, a broad and permanent industry prohibition changes the time horizon for the perceived costs of misconduct—from a one-time fine, or perhaps a few years in prison, to a lifetime prohibition from earning a living in finance, regardless of the type of employer involved.  I would welcome the industry’s participation in developing this concept.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo ensure the behavior that is required for a safe, sound and trusted financial system, we must also be effective in our role as regulators and supervisors.  As part of this, we as supervisors must continually work to improve our own cultures to ensure that we can successively carry out our responsibilities.  But it also requires good culture at the institutions that we supervise.  Supervisors simply do not have sufficient “boots on the ground” to ferret out all forms of bad behavior within a giant, global, financial institution.  Moreover, regardless what supervisors want to do, a good culture cannot simply be mandated by regulation or imposed by supervision.\n\nIn conclusion, if those of you here today as stewards of these large financial institutions do not do your part in pushing forcefully for change across the industry, then bad behavior will undoubtedly persist.  If that were to occur, the inevitable conclusion will be reached that your firms are too big and complex to manage effectively.  In that case, financial stability concerns would dictate that your firms need to be dramatically downsized and simplified so they can be managed effectively.  It is up to you to address this cultural and ethical challenge.  The consequences of inaction seem obvious to me—they are both fully appropriate and unattractive—compared to the alternative of improving the culture at the large financial firms and the behavior that stems from it.  So let’s get on with it.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\n1 Stephanie Chaly, James Hennessy, Steven Manzari, Hamid Mehran, Thomas Noone and Joseph Tracy contributed to this speech.\n\n2 Saabira Chaudhuri, “Banks’ Legal Tab Still Running Higher.” Wall Street Journal , July 23, 2014.\n\n3 O’Toole and Bennis, “What’s Needed Next: A Culture of Candor.” Harvard Business Review, June 2009.\n\n4 Supervisory Letter SR 12-17 .\n\n5 Restoring Confidence in Reference Rates\n\n6 Given the length of the vesting of this component, firms might want to allow this vesting to continue even if an individual leaves the firm. That is, one may not want an individual’s accumulated deferred debt compensation to act as a friction to job mobility. However, even if an individual leaves the firm, the debt compensation would still be at risk of forfeiture.\n\n7 See 12 U.S.C. § 1829.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure  to be here today.  I would like to thank  the University of South Florida for sponsoring this conference.  As always, what I have to say today reflects  my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nOne aspect of  today’s event is the dedication of a financial laboratory to help students  learn about financial markets, which I think has great value.  Knowledge of how financial markets operate is  an important aspect of financial and economic literacy, and it leads to greater  financial security over time.  For  example, one important lesson is that when the promised returns on an  investment offering are extraordinarily high, it is because the investment is  either very risky or fraudulent.  When  investing, it is important to remember that if it seems to be too good to be  true, it likely is!\n\nToday, I want to  take the opportunity to talk about the importance of financial markets in  influencing the economic outlook and, in turn, U.S. monetary policy.  This is a subject near and dear to my  heart.  Nearly 20 years ago—when I was  working in the private sector—my colleagues and I introduced an index of  financial conditions. 2 I believe that my long-standing focus on  financial conditions has, over time, helped me become a better economic  forecaster.  And, I am pleased that  economists and analysts increasingly incorporate financial conditions into  their assessments of the economic outlook.\n\nAs I will argue,  financial conditions in the United States play an important role in influencing  economic conditions.  Because movements  in financial markets are a major factor influencing broader financial  conditions, it is necessary to understand how financial market developments can  affect the economic outlook and, therefore, the appropriate setting of monetary  policy.  But, this story gets more  complicated, as the setting of monetary policy, in turn, affects market  developments and financial conditions.   This two-way feedback is an important feature of the interaction between  financial conditions and monetary policy.\n\nTo begin, let me  be clear about what we mean by “financial conditions.”  Focusing on the United States, financial  conditions can be broadly summarized by five key measures: short- and long-term  Treasury rates, credit spreads, the foreign exchange value of the dollar, and  equity prices.  Although many other  measures and prices can also be included in one’s assessment, I think these  five are the most essential. 3\n\nIn the conduct  of monetary policy, the FOMC does not have targets for either specific  components of financial conditions or for financial conditions more  broadly.  We care about financial  conditions not for themselves, but instead for how they can affect economic  activity and ultimately our ability to achieve the statutory objectives of the  Federal Reserve—maximum employment and price stability.  Let me provide a few examples.  A decline in mortgage rates can lift the  demand for owner-occupied housing and support construction activity.  A rise in equity prices can boost household  wealth, which is one factor that underpins consumer spending.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar can  affect the relative competitiveness of importers and exporters, which, in turn,  influences the country’s trade performance.   Narrower credit spreads can reduce the cost of capital for business and  help support greater business investment.\n\nIn sum,  financial conditions affect households’ and firms’ saving and investment plans,  and, therefore, play a key role in influencing economic activity and the  economic outlook.  This is why the  evaluation of financial conditions is so crucial in the conduct of monetary  policy.\n\nThe FOMC  traditionally implements monetary policy by adjusting the federal funds  rate—the short-term interest rate paid by banks that borrow reserves from other  financial institutions.  However, few  economic decisions directly depend on the federal funds rate.  Rather, changes in the federal funds rate affect  the economy through their impact on other interest rates, which, consequently,  influence broader financial conditions.   If financial conditions moved predictably with the policy rate, then  there would be no need for the FOMC to focus on financial conditions.  In such a world, by adjusting the level of  the federal funds rate, the FOMC could be fully confident that it could  generate the appropriate financial conditions necessary to support achievement  of full employment and price stability.\n\nIn fact, the  response of financial conditions to changes in short-term interest rates is not  rigid and predictable.  Instead, as we  shall see shortly, the linkage between the federal funds rate and financial  conditions changes over time, as it is influenced by a whole host of other  factors.  Recent evidence suggests that  even the relation between short-term and long-term rates has shifted  substantially over the past 15 years. 4 Moreover, at times, we have observed cases in  which financial conditions did not move in the same direction as the monetary  policy stance.  Let me highlight two  recent divergences which indicate that we need to keep a separate eye on the  evolution of financial conditions.\n\nThe first  occurred in the mid-2000s.  In June 2004,  the FOMC decided to begin raising the federal funds rate target in order to  remove policy accommodation.  It raised  the target in 25-basis-point increments at 17 consecutive meetings, pushing the  rate up from a starting point of 1.0 percent to a peak of 5.25 percent.  Despite this tightening of monetary policy  over two years, financial conditions failed to tighten in a similar  manner.  This can be seen by looking at  the behavior of well-known measures of financial conditions during this period (Exhibit 1) .  The rise in short-term  rates was offset by a decline in long-term yields, a rise in equity prices and  narrower credit spreads.\n\nIn contrast,  there have been times when financial conditions tightened even as the FOMC  reduced short-term interest rates.  For  example, consider what happened during the heart of the financial crisis.  Even as the FOMC lowered the federal funds  rate in the fall of 2008—eventually hitting its effective lower bound that  December—credit spreads widened sharply, household and business loan  underwriting standards tightened sharply, liquidity in many financial markets  dried up, and the U.S. stock market plummeted.   Financial conditions tightened despite the aggressive easing of monetary  policy during this period.\n\nThere are many  explanations for why the relationship between the federal funds rate and  financial conditions is so variable.   Without being exhaustive, let me highlight three.  First, animal spirits in financial markets  wax and wane, pushing asset values up or down in a manner that can more than  offset the effects of movements in short-term interest rates.  The movements in many financial markets  following last year’s presidential election are a notable example of this  phenomenon.  Second, domestic financial  conditions are influenced by what happens abroad.  If the monetary policy of major U.S. trading  partners becomes easier relative to policy in the United States, then it could  lead to a dollar appreciation that would weigh on U.S. trade performance, all  else equal.  Third, financial instability  and stress can cause risk-averse investors to increase their demand for safe  assets.  This can push up risk premia and  credit spreads, and push down stock prices—which can more than offset the  impact of an easier monetary policy.\n\nDivergences  between short-term interest rates and financial conditions often appear to be  larger and more persistent in the United States than in most other advanced  economies.  There are several reasons for  this.  First, the U.S. financial system  depends less on its banking system to intermediate financial flows than in  other countries.  The share of credit supplied  by the banking sector fluctuates around 50 percent in the United States, which  is much lower than in the euro area, Japan and the United Kingdom (Exhibit 2) .  Second, in contrast to most other  countries, U.S. residential housing is financed mainly by 30-year fixed-rate  mortgages, rather than—as is the case in most other countries—adjustable-rate  mortgages with rates that much more closely track their central banks’  short-term interest rate targets.  Third,  the equity market plays a much more important role in the United States than  elsewhere.  The total market  capitalization of the U.S. equity market is considerably higher than in the  euro area and Japan (Exhibit 3) .\n\nBecause the  evolution of financial conditions can diverge from the path of the federal  funds rate, financial conditions need to be carefully considered in the conduct  of monetary policy.  However, I want to  reiterate that what we care about is not financial conditions themselves, but  rather their influence on economic activity.   Accordingly, we should care much more about longer-term movements in  financial conditions than about higher-frequency, transitory movements.  That is because behavior in firms and  households will be influenced much more by how financial conditions evolve over  time, rather than by where they happen to be at a particular moment.\n\nTo emphasize  this point, let me give two contrasting examples—one where financial conditions  moved sharply but not persistently, and another where financial conditions  moved systematically over a longer time period.   We will see that it is the long-lived movements that have the largest  influence on the economic outlook.\n\nFor the first  example, consider the U.S. equity market in 1987.  The S&P 500 index began the year at 242,  shot up to a peak of 337 in August (an increase of almost 40 percent) and  plummeted to a trough of 225 in October (a fall of 33 percent).  When the stock market fell more than 20  percent on October 19th—which came to be known as “Black  Monday”—many feared that the decline would lead to a recession.  After all, that crash was the largest-ever  one-day percentage decline of the U.S. stock market.  But, no recession occurred.  Importantly, households sustained their  spending despite the sharp decline in household wealth.  This happened, in part, because household  spending had not yet responded much to the sharp run-up in stock prices earlier  in the year, so consumer spending turned out to be relatively insensitive to  the market’s sharp reversal.  In  addition, the damage from the sharp stock market decline was mitigated by the  Federal Reserve’s commitment “to serve as a source of liquidity to support the  economic and financial system.” 5\n\nA contrasting  example is the sharp appreciation of the dollar that began in 1978 and reached  a peak in March 1985.  The persistent  strength of the dollar had a significant negative consequence for U.S. trade  performance.  Our trade deficit widened  sharply in 1985 and 1986, which contributed to the sharp slowdown in U.S.  manufacturing production growth—and a milder slowdown in GDP growth—over this  period.\n\nThis leads to an  important question:  When should the FOMC  take changes in financial conditions into consideration in its conduct of  monetary policy?  I don’t think there is  a simple answer.  Financial conditions  matter in influencing the economic outlook, but so do many other factors.  It is true that monitoring financial  conditions can help improve the effectiveness of the policy decision-making  process.  However, as I hope is clear  from my previous examples, there is no mechanical link between policy rates and  financial conditions that monetary policymakers can systematically rely upon to  set policy.\n\nAnother key  question is what one should focus on in assessing financial conditions.  Again, I don’t think there is a simple  answer, as the significance of any particular aspect of changes in financial  conditions depends on the economic circumstances and environment.  In the early- to mid-2000s, the combination of  looser mortgage underwriting practices and home equity withdrawal were major  financial factors contributing to that economic expansion.  The subsequent housing crash was exacerbated  by the sharp reversals of mortgage lending standards and home equity withdrawal,  which together contributed to the severity of the Great Recession.  Today, these factors seem less important  because lending practices in the housing market have been much more stable in  recent years.\n\nThe importance  and complexity of financial conditions also underscore the need for caution in  following any mechanical monetary policy rule.   For example, the most well-known rule—the Taylor Rule—does not  explicitly take financial conditions into account in terms of its monetary  policy prescription.  In that rule, the  federal funds rate depends only on the deviations of output from its potential  and inflation from the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent objective, and on the level  of the real short-term interest rate consistent with a neutral stance of  monetary policy.  Because the  interactions can shift between financial conditions and the economic outlook—as  well as between financial conditions and the federal funds rate—the absence of  financial conditions in this rule can cause it to perform poorly as a guide for  monetary policy.\n\nAs a case in point,  consider what the 1999 variant of the Taylor Rule indicated as the appropriate  monetary policy setting in September 2008, just prior to the failure of Lehman  Brothers.  In the Bluebook document that  the Federal Reserve Board staff prepared for the September 2008 FOMC meeting,  the 1999 Taylor Rule called for a federal funds rate setting of 3.5 percent for  the fourth quarter of 2008, well above the 2 percent setting at the time of the  meeting.  The standard 1993 Taylor  Rule—which puts a greater weight on inflation—called for an even higher federal  funds rate target of 4.1 percent.  Given  the rapid deterioration in financial conditions, instead of following the  prescription from these rules, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate rapidly over  the next three months, pushing the federal funds rate down to a range of 0 to a  quarter of 1 percent by year-end.\n\nConsistent with  this episode, such rules often perform poorly at times when the economic  environment and outlook are rapidly changing.   This is one important reason why I do not support proposals that would  require the Federal Reserve to explain to Congress whenever its federal funds  rate target deviates from a particular prescriptive monetary policy rule.  As Federal Reserve Chair Yellen explained in  a recent speech, not only are there a plethora of rules to choose from, but  following any monetary policy rule in a perfunctory manner would likely lead to  inappropriate monetary policy at times—especially during economic turning  points when the outlook is changing rapidly. 6\n\nAlso, requiring  the Federal Reserve Chair to explain frequently why the FOMC had deviated from  a particular rule would unduly impinge on the ability of the FOMC to conduct  monetary policy in a manner insulated from short-term political  considerations.  Of course, Congress has  the right to hear from the Federal Reserve about its conduct of U.S. monetary  policy.  There are already several  opportunities, including regular testimony and semiannual monetary policy  reports.  If Congress desires, such  communications could become more frequent or enhanced.  But, my point is that these exchanges should  not be triggered by deviations from a mechanical rule.  And, of course, I feel that this is  especially true for a rule that does not account for financial conditions.\n\nNow that I have  expounded upon the importance of financial conditions, I would like to discuss  their implications for the current stance of U.S. monetary policy.  As I see it, there were a number of factors  behind the FOMC’s decision in March to take another step in gradually removing  accommodation by raising the federal funds rate target by 25 basis points to a  range of three quarters of a percent to 1 percent.\n\nMost  importantly, the economy has continued to grow modestly above its sustainable  long-term pace.  This has led to  continued, sturdy monthly job gains and a gradual diminution of the amount of  slack in the U.S. labor market.  Forward-looking  indicators foreshadow a continuation of this trend.  For example, household and business  confidence has increased markedly over the past few months.\n\nThe economic  outlook abroad also appears to have brightened.   Growth has picked up in Europe. Commodity prices have risen, reducing  the pressure on emerging market economies that are major commodity  exporters.  There are still significant  uncertainties and risks abroad, but overall, these risks seem significantly  lower than they were a year ago.\n\nInflation has  moved closer to our 2 percent longer-run objective.  Headline inflation on a year-over-year basis  has moved up in the past few months as the sharp declines in energy prices in  late 2015 and early 2016 have fallen out of the calculation.  Core inflation—which ignores the more  volatile movements in energy and food prices—also has moved slightly  higher.  Over the 12 months through  January 2017, the core personal consumption expenditure deflator has risen at about  1.75 percent, up from 1.6 percent a year earlier.  Thus, I have become more confident that  inflation will stabilize around the FOMC’s objective over the medium term.\n\nWhile there is  still considerable uncertainty about fiscal policy and its potential  contribution to economic activity, it seems likely that it will shift over time  to a more stimulative setting.   Consequently, it appears that the risks for both economic growth and  inflation over the medium to longer term may be shifting gradually to the upside.\n\nEven after the  latest increase, the federal funds rate target range at three quarters of a  percent to 1 percent is still unusually low in both nominal and  inflation-adjusted terms.  While most  FOMC participants judge the equilibrium short-term real interest rate that is  consistent with a neutral monetary policy to be low—perhaps in a range of 0 to  1 percent—this is still above the current inflation-adjusted federal funds  rate.  In such circumstances, it seems  appropriate to scale back monetary policy accommodation gradually in order to reduce  the risk of the economy overheating, and to avoid a significant inflation  overshoot in the medium term.\n\nFinally, prior  to the March FOMC meeting, financial conditions were generally easing rather  than becoming tighter, even as the FOMC raised its policy rate in December and  market participants increasingly expected further policy tightening in the  coming year.  Between the December and  March FOMC meetings, U.S. equity prices rose by about 4 percent, and credit  spreads, such as those for high-yield bonds, narrowed.  Long-term yields and the trade-weighted  dollar were little changed over this period.\n\nWilliam  McChesney Martin, the ninth chair of the FOMC, once famously opined that the  Federal Reserve is “in the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch  bowl removed just when the party was really warming up.”  I don’t think we are removing the punch bowl,  yet.  We’re just adding a bit more fruit  juice.\n\nBefore I  conclude, let me make a few comments about the Federal Reserve’s balance  sheet.  As you are undoubtedly aware, the  Federal Reserve dramatically expanded the size of its balance sheet during and  following the financial crisis to provide accommodation to support the economy  when short-term interest rates were constrained by their effective lower  bound.  Currently, we are reinvesting  maturing Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities repayments  to keep the size of the balance sheet generally stable.  We have said that we plan to continue this  policy of reinvestment until we are well along in the process of normalizing  the level of the federal funds rate.  As  the FOMC has raised the federal funds rate three times, this process seems to  have proceeded smoothly so far, prompting renewed interest in our balance sheet  and reinvestment policy.\n\nThe anticipation  of and actual announcement by the FOMC of changes in reinvestment policy is  likely to push up longer-term interest rates and tighten financial conditions  somewhat, just as the earlier purchases pushed down long-term interest  rates.  To what extent is difficult to  judge.  Presumably, financial conditions  would tighten by more if we were to end reinvestments earlier and more  abruptly.  This suggests a better course  may be to taper reinvestments gradually and predictably.\n\nIn addition,  because changes in reinvestment policy will likely tighten financial  conditions, we will have to take this into account in our interest rate  decisions.  My view is that reducing the  Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and raising short-term interest rates are two  different, yet related, ways of removing monetary policy accommodation.  Therefore, I would expect that, when we begin  to end reinvestment, we will have to consider the implications for the  appropriate short-term interest rate trajectory.\n\nIn conclusion,  financial conditions are important.  They  matter enormously to monetary policy because their movements can often diverge  from the trajectory of short-term rates, and because they affect economic  activity and the economic outlook.  While  it is essential to account for financial conditions appropriately in conducting  monetary policy, it is also important not to overreact to every short-term  wiggle in financial markets.  In  addition, it is important to remember that the policy goal is not the level of  financial conditions per se, but the achievement of the Federal Reserve’s dual  mandate objectives.  Sometimes, that will  be consistent with easing financial conditions, and at other times, it will be  consistent with tighter financial conditions.   At all times, our focus will be on achieving our objectives of maximum  sustainable employment and price stability, thereby supporting the livelihoods  of households and businesses throughout the United States.\n\nThank you for  your kind attention.  I would be happy to  take a few questions.",

part in making this event possible.  My meeting with you today is part of our continuing efforts to understand what is going on at the grassroots level of our economy.  During these trips I meet with a variety of stakeholders, which helps me develop a comprehensive view of local conditions and a fuller understanding of any major issues and concerns.  This is my third visit to Rochester in the past five years.  In my remarks, I will provide an overview of the regional economy and discuss the importance of workforce development, both for Rochester and the broader economy.  As always, what I have

generally, the Rochester economy has lagged behind the nation for a number of decades.  During this time, Rochester has been going through a prolonged period of economic transformation and reinvention.  While this process has been a painful one in many respects, I believe that it is well-advanced and the area is well-positioned for the years ahead.  Rochester possesses a unique set of assets that are key to a successful economic reinvention, including a highly skilled workforce, world class higher education institutions, a diverse economic base, and a forward-looking cooperative engagement between the public and private sector.  There is strong evidence that Rochester is already tapping into these assets to great success.  To prove my point, I would note that my colleague, Narayana Kocherlakota, is leaving the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis at the end of the year to become a professor at the University of Rochester.  Our loss is your gain!\n\nConsider how we got to where we are today.  Early in the 20th century, with the explosive growth of the \"Big 3\"—Kodak, Xerox and Bausch & Lomb—came a great demand for innovative and skilled workers, especially engineers, who helped make these companies highly successful.  At their peak, these three companies alone employed roughly 20 percent of the Rochester workforce.  These workers developed innovative new products and processes, which often resulted in patents that remain valuable to this day.  In many ways, Rochester, and its skilled workforce, was ahead of its time.\n\nThese companies, though, came under pressure in the 1980s as a result of rapid technological changes and increased global competition.  As their employment began to decline, some workers left the area while others remained.  Indeed the legacy of the \"Big 3\" lies not in what was lost, but in what remains in the skills and entrepreneurial spirit of the many talented people that are here today.  Some of these talented people started their own companies, while others found different ways to contribute their unique talents to the local economy.\n\nAs a result, Rochester continues to reinvent itself, and is now much more diverse, with an employment base that is no longer concentrated among a few large manufacturers.  The top employers in the region, like the University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), Wegmans, the Rochester General Health System and Paychex, just to name a few, perform a variety of activities, from health care and education to consumer and business services.\n\nThe process of reinvention and economic diversification, in part, allowed the region to better weather the storm of the Great Recession compared to past economic recessions.  For Rochester, the downturn was both shorter and less severe in terms of job loss than for the nation as a whole—a situation quite different from what had occurred before.  Though it still lags the nation, the Rochester area has continued to grow at a solid pace through the recovery.  This is no small feat, and it certainly is not true for all of Upstate New York.  For example, the recovery has been much more sluggish in Syracuse and Utica, and Binghamton has yet to see any meaningful recovery.\n\nDespite Rochester's relatively favorable economic performance in recent years, the region's job base is actually slightly lower today than it was at the start of this century.  While at first blush it may seem that such a statistic indicates a stagnant economy, that couldn't be further from the truth.  When you look deeper, you see an economy that has been very active and dynamic in a number of respects.  While some parts of the economy have declined, other areas have grown to fill in the gaps.\n\nThe most familiar part of this story is the swift and severe loss of the region's manufacturing jobs.  Ongoing technological change has increased worker productivity and has reduced the demand for many \"middle-skill\" workers, while globalization shifted many manufacturing jobs to other parts of the world.  These forces have reduced manufacturing employment nationwide, but the effects on Rochester have been particularly potent.  Between 2000 and 2010, the number of manufacturing jobs in Rochester declined by over 40 percent.  That's a huge loss to incur in just a single decade.  Moreover, the loss was on top of the previous significant decline in manufacturing that the region experienced throughout the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nHowever, what's impressive is that in the midst of this decline, Rochester's manufacturing sector has been very dynamic.  While once focused on the \"Big 3,\" the region is now producing a much more diverse set of products, such as foods, computers and electronics.  And, the manufacturing companies that remained are leaner and have an even higher-skilled workforce than in the past.\n\nFortunately, Rochester has also experienced significant job growth outside of the manufacturing sector.  The regional economy added over 44,000 non-manufacturing jobs since 2000, keeping its overall employment fairly steady.  The vast majority of these jobs are in the education and health sectors, which together have grown by more than 40 percent over the past 15 years in Rochester.  Many of the jobs added in these sectors are high-paying jobs.  And, importantly, these sectors tend to be less susceptible to cyclical downturns than other parts of the economy, which helps make the region more stable.  There has also been solid growth in business services, leisure and hospitality and even construction.\n\nThe Importance of Workforce Development With today's economy going through such enormous change, what people do in the workplace and how they do it is also changing significantly.  It is no longer the case that people can easily find good-paying, career-oriented jobs with a high school diploma.  The jobs of today typically require more knowledge, skill and flexibility.  Often, this means that today's workers must invest more in education and training than earlier generations.  In addition, the depreciation rate for many skills is much higher now than in the past.  This requires workers to continuously reinvest in skill development.  Broadly speaking, workers who can build skills and remain nimble can do very well in today's economy, while those who can't are much more likely to fall into lower-paying jobs and get stuck there.\n\nA skilled workforce that is matched to the needs of employers is also necessary for the economy to grow and prosper.  By pursuing its mandated goals of maximum employment and price stability, monetary policy can help labor markets recover by providing incentives for firms to invest and grow.  However, monetary policy cannot by itself solve skill mismatches that may exist in the economy.  These frictions must be addressed in other ways, such as by workforce development policies.  That is, monetary policy can complement workforce development policies, but is not a substitute for these policies.\n\nThat is why I believe workforce development is so important for the long-term health of the economy.  We need to help workers build the skills necessary to adapt to change.  This makes workforce development a top priority for everyone involved: workers, their employers, their communities and the public sector, as well as education and job training institutions.  We all need to share in the responsibility of helping people increase and maintain their skills.\n\nSuccessful workforce development needs to include what I call the 3 P's: Partnerships, Programs and Placement.  Partnerships entail the cooperative endeavors between local employers and educational institutions to determine the best strategies to help workers develop the skills that employers need.  Programs must be tailored to the current skills required by local employers.  Placement needs to be a priority, and should be considered even before people are accepted into these programs.  Workers need to know that a job will be waiting for them after they go through the effort of building their specific skills.  There are several examples from Rochester and other parts of the region that illustrate the potential for this approach to workforce development.\n\nIn fact, Rochester has a long history of involvement in workforce development.  In 1885, a group of Rochester businessmen founded the Mechanics Institute.  The Institute's mission was to establish free evening schools in the city for instruction in mechanical drawing and other technical skills important for industrial firms.  Funding was provided by contributions from Rochester residents.  The first class drew more than 400 students. This endeavor evolved over time into RIT.\n\nStrong partnerships between Rochester's higher education institutions and local businesses continue to this day. For example, RIT's Center for Bioscience Education and Training provides local businesses and associations with workforce training tailor-made to specific organizational needs.  And at RIT's newly created Knorr-Bremse Mechatronics Laboratory, the university works with the companies that employ its graduates to make sure they have the technical skills they need to be successful.  At the University of Rochester, the Center for Emerging & Innovative Sciences as well as the Center for Medical Technology partner with local companies to leverage the cutting edge research being done by the university's faculty and students. Forward-looking partnerships such as these create \"win-win\" opportunities for everyone involved, and help the local economy grow and prosper.\n\nMonroe Community College (MCC) also stands out with its significant workforce development initiatives.  In fact, earlier this year Vice President Joe Biden—who was back in Rochester recently to announce the creation of a new manufacturing photonics hub—presented the college as a model for developing meaningful collaborations with employers to create job-training programs that align with current employment opportunities.  MCC has taken a uniquely data driven approach to the development of tools and programs that work to address the most pressing workforce development needs in the greater Rochester area, and to provide diverse learners with clear paths to sustaining meaningful careers.\n\nFor instance, the MCC Corporate College program has designed and delivered more than 100 new noncredit courses and provided education and training to more than 2,000 individuals.  Additionally, the college has partnered with 128 employers, including CooperVision and Thermo Fisher Scientific, to deliver customized training to their employees.  The Corporate College takes an innovative approach in providing workforce learning and development solutions informed by current labor market data and expert analysis.\n\nThere is increased awareness, both locally and nationally, of a growing skills gap within industries.  Supporting middle-skill occupations has become a critical theme for many in the business community and within the workforce development community.  In response to this issue, MCC announced a new collaboration with JPMorgan Chase called the Middle-Skills Bridge Program. This program targets the disadvantaged and underrepresented populations within Rochester's urban center to provide access to skill-based careers.  Participants receive intensive developmental education to improve their literacy and math skills before transitioning into one of MCC's accelerated certificate programs.\n\nThere are many other good examples of cooperative workforce development programs in the New York Fed's District.  In Buffalo, the Overhead Electric Line Worker training program at Erie Community College (ECC) was created in conjunction with National Grid to address the critical shortage of overhead line workers and technicians.  To date, the program has graduated 132 students, including 42 who are currently employed at National Grid.\n\nAnother example is OnForce Solar, which sells and installs solar energy packages for commercial and residential customers.  In 2010, OnForce Solar CEO Charles Feit moved his rapidly growing company to a then unoccupied building in the Port Morris area of the Bronx.  After struggling to find skilled workers, OnForce Solar partnered with Bronx Community College to create a $7 million technology hub which will be paid for by the company.  The partnership was made possible by the Governor's Start-Up NY Program, which was launched in 2013 to spur job growth in distressed areas by designating tax-free zones at various colleges and universities.  OnForce Solar also developed and taught a newly designed technology course at Bronx Community College.\n\nAnother example is Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey.  When I visited Stevens in April, I learned how they are preparing their students to meet local workforce needs.  During discussions with university leaders, I heard about their exciting new partnership with NBC Universal.  By working together, a new Media/Broadcast minor was created to provide the necessary coursework to prepare students for employment at NBC Universal and similar companies.\n\nTo better understand the extent to which local workforce development programs are addressing skills gaps throughout Upstate New York, the New York Fed has engaged with community leaders from across the region.  Our first meeting took place here in Rochester in March 2014.  An important issue raised by many participants was the lack of information about available well-paying middle-skills career opportunities. To help address this concern, the New York Fed partnered with the Rochester Community Foundation, MCC, Finger Lakes Community College and Genesee Community College to launch a pilot video contest.\n\nThe purpose of the contest was to increase awareness about specific middle-skill occupations identified as in demand by analysis conducted by the Finger Lakes Economic Regional Council.  The contest challenged college students to create a 30-second video that identifies the skills required, expected wages and job demands for an occupational group within a targeted set of industries.  At an awards ceremony held in The Little Theatre here in downtown Rochester a panel of judges selected the winning video \" Not Just a Geek ,\" submitted by students from Finger Lakes Community College.  The video focuses on the field of computer science. Local Rochester movie theaters will air the winning video for two weeks in September, and we will explore additional outlets for this video throughout the region as a public service announcement.\n\nThese success stories that I've highlighted today illustrate the potential for workforce development to help cities such as Rochester continue to reinvent themselves for today's economy.  We need to be vigilant in our focus on those in danger of being left behind. Too many individuals, especially in our urban centers, lack a high school diploma.  For example, the Rochester City School District has a dropout rate of 25 percent, and an alarmingly low graduation rate of just 50 percent.  Without a high school diploma, people are in danger of being left behind without the skills they will need to truly participate in the economy.  Succeeding in the international competition for jobs with a 50 percent graduation rate is like trying to win a boxing match with one hand tied behind your back.  We must do better.  While there are no easy answers, for the regional economy to thrive everyone needs to be an active participant.  We need to figure out ways to re-engage those who have become detached from the workforce, or who feel like they don't have the skills to compete in today's challenging economic environment.\n\nIn closing, Rochester is a metropolitan area in the midst of a process of transformation and reinvention.  While this process is not easy, Rochester possesses a unique set of assets that will help it succeed, and in many ways is on the cutting edge of adapting to these changes. Rochester is, in fact, becoming a leader in workforce development.  Reinvention like reform can be difficult, and requires a degree of boldness.  This sentiment was expressed by Rochester's social reformer, Susan B. Anthony, who said that \"Cautious, careful people, always casting about to preserve their reputation and social standing, can never bring about a reform.\"  Rochester is doing Susan B. Anthony proud, showing spirit and determination.\n\nThank you for your attention, I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n1 Jaison Abel, Chelsea Cruz, Tony Davis, Richard Deitz, Eric Pajonk and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.",

    "text": "Introduction to the New York Fed As many of you know, this is my first chance to speak at the University of Rochester since I became president of the New York Fed. So, by way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New York Fed is, what we do and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, and was created by Congress in 1913. With this act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the money supply—and designed it be decentralized, representative of all of America and independent of the political process. The Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 autonomous Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each Reserve Bank is autonomous, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made us independent so we can make decisions in the national interest free from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe FOMC meets in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy. As New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings and have a permanent vote. At these meetings, the 16 other members (the Board of Governors and the other Reserve Bank Presidents) and I each present our current outlook for the economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders. You may know that one of my councils, the Upstate New York Regional Advisory Board, is designed specifically to provide me with timely information from this area. In this way, decisions by the FOMC are continually informed by views gathered from all parts of the country, including Upstate New York.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. Let me tell you about some of them. We, alone, implement monetary policy. At the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world.\n\nFinally, I must mention that the New York Fed's district could be the most diverse in the System: ranging from the urban density of Manhattan to the forested sparseness of the northern Adirondacks, to the Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. All in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nThe Crisis and Response Of course these are anything but normal times. The financial crisis that broke in mid-2007 and intensified dramatically following the failure of Lehman Brothers has been among the most virulent ever. And it was followed by the longest and one of the deepest recessions since World War II, called by many the \"Great Recession.\"\n\nThe Fed responded aggressively and creatively in an effort to pursue our dual mandate. Our actions fell into two broad buckets.\n\nFirst, we took steps to supply liquidity to the financial system, so that financial markets could continue to function properly and to enable households and businesses to maintain access to credit. Carrying out an age-old central banking role, we loaned funds to financial firms, secured against their high-quality collateral.\n\nTraditionally, such loans were only made to depository institutions, such as banks. Of course, the modern U.S. financial system includes many lenders that are not banks. These companies and markets provide vital financing for credit card loans, short-term business needs and many other activities. Many years ago, Congress gave the Fed the emergency authority to lend to nonbanks in \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\" During the crisis—in order to limit damage to the wider economy—we exercised this authority to lend to a wide variety of financial firms and markets.\n\nA handful of times, we made the difficult decision to make emergency loans to prevent the disorderly failure of particular firms. We did so not because we wanted to help the firms, but because allowing them to collapse in a disorderly fashion in the midst of a global crisis would have harmed households and business throughout the United States. All the Fed's loans were collateralized and we are confident they will be repaid in full.\n\nSecond, we took aggressive steps to ease monetary policy in order to support economic activity and employment. By the end of 2008 we reduced short-term interest rates to virtually zero—the lowest level in the history of the Fed. In order to provide still further support for the economy, we bought more than $1.5 trillion of long-term assets—principally mortgage bonds guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with the support of U.S. Treasury—between December 2008 and March 2010.\n\nWhen the Fed buys long-term assets, it pushes down long-term interest rates. This supports economic activity in a number of ways, including by making housing more affordable and boosting consumption in households that can refinance their mortgages at lower rates. In addition, low long-term rates reduce the cost of capital for businesses, thereby fostering more hiring and investment spending (on equipment, construction and machinery, for example) for any given economic outlook.\n\nNational Economic Conditions So where are we today? Let me start my discussion of economic conditions with a few comments about national economic conditions.\n\nAs I discussed in a recent speech, the Great Recession has been followed by a tepid recovery. Since June 2009, economic activity has grown—but not robustly.\n\nIn recent months, the momentum has slowed. After rising at a 3.25 percent annual rate during the second half of 2009, real gross domestic product growth has slowed. With demand growth barely keeping pace with firms' ability to increase productivity, job creation has been too weak to significantly reduce unemployment, which stands today at 9.6 percent. And, as is typical in such circumstances of considerable slack, the rate of inflation has declined.\n\nWhy are we experiencing this soft patch now? There are several reasons:\n\nThe slow recovery of consumer spending and housing in the face of very substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus reflects the painful unwinding of the dynamics at work during the expansion that preceded it. Beginning around 2003, underwriting standards for residential mortgages were significantly relaxed, leading to a sharp rise in household borrowing and in home prices. The rise in home prices helped support more borrowing as households used lines of credit and second mortgages to tap into their rising home equity. This also fueled a strong boom in home construction. But house price increases could not be sustained without limit. When home prices peaked and started to turn down, the dynamic linking house prices, credit and consumption went into reverse.\n\nLet's consider first what this means for consumption. Consumption of goods and services rose at a slow 2 percent annual rate over the first half of 2010 and with no sign of a rebound. Several factors are inhibiting families from spending, including: job or income losses, low confidence and declines in wealth as real estate and stock prices dipped. Households have been saving more and paying down their debts. Of course, lenders have also reinforced this tendency with tightened underwriting for credit relative to prerecession standards. Have households completed their deleveraging, so they will soon spend more? Although we believe that substantial progress has been made, it is hard to tell how much further this process has to run.\n\nNow, let's consider why housing market activity—both new construction and sales—remains depressed. One reason for this is that many existing homes stand vacant. We estimate that there are roughly 3 million vacant housing units more than usual. This stock of vacant homes will shrink when foreclosures fall and more empty homes are sold or rented out.\n\nOn the sales side, even though low mortgage interest rates and falling home prices have together boosted housing affordability to its highest level in 40 years, the current pace of sales is quite sluggish. Impediments to home sales include tight lending standards, a weak job market and continued uncertainty about home prices. Importantly, the large drop in home prices between 2006 and 2008 also reduced homeowner equity broadly, making it more difficult to \"trade-up\" and move into better homes.\n\nWith lower home prices, many families now owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. This means that they cannot refinance or sell their homes easily if they experience a crisis such as a job loss or a serious illness. Foreclosure completions are at an all-time high, although the initiation of new foreclosures may be finally slowing. Recently, attention has focused on cases where some of the documentation used in the foreclosure process may have been flawed. The Fed actively encourages efforts to find viable alternatives to foreclosure. Not many people know this, but a team of New York Fed officials work with mortgage counselors and community activists to support distressed homeowners, and our lawyers support legal aid programs for people facing foreclosure. At the same time, it is important that foreclosures that comply with the law can ultimately take place. This is a necessary part of returning the housing market to more normal conditions.\n\nAlong with two other agencies, the Fed is reviewing the foreclosure practices at the major bank mortgage servicers. We are also keeping an eye on banks' potential liabilities where they made representations about mortgages bought by investors that may not have been correct in all cases. We want to ensure that the housing finance business is supported by robust back-office operations—for processing of new mortgages as well as foreclosures—so that homebuyers and investors have full confidence in the process. We are monitoring developments closely in order to evaluate any potential impact on housing or financial markets and the overall economy.\n\nEconomic Conditions in Upstate New York Now let me turn to economic conditions in Upstate New York. It is no secret that this region has struggled with weak economic growth and population loss in recent decades. The region has experienced some very painful economic restructuring, particularly as it lost so many of its high-paying manufacturing jobs. Yet the process has yielded a productive and more diversified economy, with a larger service sector. For this and other reasons I will discuss, the Upstate New York economy has weathered the Great Recession relatively well.\n\nWhile the Upstate economy generally underperformed the nation during the 1980s and 1990s, its recent experience has been quite different. During the Great Recession, Upstate New York's job losses began later than they did for the United States as a whole, and those losses were generally less severe.\n\nThe relatively strong economic performance of the region of late is also clearly tied to its stable housing markets. Upstate New York's relatively slow economic performance and lack of population growth during the expansion in the 2000s supported only modest increases in home prices and sales during the housing boom. When home prices and sales began to decline quite rapidly in many parts of the nation, they held steady across the region. As a result, Upstate New York has largely been spared the boom-and-bust cycle in housing that occurred in other parts of the country. In fact, many of Upstate New York's metropolitan areas even experienced home price appreciation during the housing bust, making these places among the best performing in the country during this period. Many parts of the country experienced severe housing busts, with sharp drops in housing-related activity (such as construction and purchases of major appliances). For example, in fast-growing places such as California and Florida, construction jobs grew to be a large share of employment, but the number of these jobs then plummeted during the recession. This dynamic did not occur in places like Rochester, where the housing sector was small and thus, had few jobs to lose.\n\nAnother part of the story is that homeowners in Upstate New York did not take on as much debt, and households have been less strained here than elsewhere. One reason is that home prices did not appreciate rapidly here, so homes remained affordable. Moreover, there was generally lower penetration of risky nonprime loans into the region's housing markets. So, Upstate New York's home loans have generally performed better than elsewhere in the country, with fewer delinquencies and foreclosures. Indeed, much of the region was spared the worst effects of the nonprime mortgage boom and bust.\n\nThus, compared with other parts of the nation, the Upstate economy has performed well over the past few years. As a large and growing sector, local colleges and universities have surely contributed to the region's economic stability over the past few years. Indeed, the University of Rochester provides a clear example of how a university can play a key role in its local economy. The benefits of the higher education industry go beyond their direct economic contributions, such as employment and spending, for a very important reason: they can increase a region's stock of human capital—that is, the total supply of knowledge and skills in its workforce.\n\nA region's human capital contributes to its economic success and resiliency. The educational activities of a region's colleges and universities help build the skills of the local workforce. In addition, the knowledge created by colleges and universities through research activities can play a key role in starting and supporting local businesses. Businesses can use university expertise, infrastructure and research findings to help them develop cutting edge products and services. Furthermore, universities often employ local businesses to develop and commercialize products that arise from their research activities. This dynamic can expand local economic activity and consequently create new jobs for high-skilled workers in a region. Institutions such as the University of Rochester play a vital role of this sort in the Upstate economy.\n\nThe diversification of Rochester's economy has helped the region weather the Great Recession. In particular, major investments in the University of Rochester Medical Center have allowed the health care and education sectors to expand and become an increasingly important part of the local economy. These sectors tend to provide stability to their local economies because they are less susceptible to contraction during economic downturns than other sectors of the economy. Moreover, despite the decline in manufacturing, Rochester is well known for its world-class optics and imaging business cluster. Local businesses work closely with the University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology to leverage their joint expertise in fields such as imaging technologies and lenses to develop cutting edge products. As a result, Rochester has remained a highly productive and relatively stable region.\n\nWhat Is the Fed Doing Now? Since the beginning of the downturn, the Fed has actively used monetary and regulatory policy to help support economic activity and improve economic outcomes—here in Rochester and across the nation—relative to what would have happened in the absence of this support.\n\nWith regard to monetary policy, the Fed has in place a highly accommodative stance. The FOMC has said that it will keep short term interest rates at exceptionally low levels for an extended period of time. The Fed also retains large amounts of mortgage-backed bonds acquired in order to support the housing market and help bring down mortgage and other long-term interest rates to the historically low rates in place today.\n\nThe FOMC and the Chairman have stated their commitment to take further actions to bring interest rates down further should economic conditions warrant. In a recent speech, I said that both the current levels of unemployment and inflation and the timeframe over which they are likely to return to levels consistent with our mandate are unacceptable. I said that I thought further Fed action was likely to be warranted unless the economic outlook were to evolve in a way that made me more confident we would see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before too long.\n\nTurning to regulatory policy, the biggest lesson of the financial crisis is that severe financial disruptions can inflict very large and persistent costs on people's lives and jobs. Over the past year, with Fed leadership and support, important new regulatory initiatives have been advanced to create a global financial system where the players cannot slide back into the risky \"business as usual\" that created this crisis. These include the recent agreement with international bank regulators (sometimes called \"Basel III\") to impose stricter standards for globally active banks and the considerable regulatory changes embodied in the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThese measures recognize that to avert or contain future financial crises, we need a financial system that can withstand large negative shocks. First, market participants must not have incentives to take excessive risks. Instead, incentives should reward actions that support economic growth and financial stability. And financial firms must set aside enough capital and liquidity so that when things go wrong they can absorb losses with their own resources. Finally, if these buffers prove inadequate and a financial firm veers toward failure, the official sector needs the tools to wind them down in an orderly manner without having to make the terrible choice between a chaotic failure that harms the whole economy and a taxpayer-funded rescue.\n\nConclusion I appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about how my job at the New York Fed ties in with your lives and work here in Upstate New York. The links are many, including\n\nTo summarize conditions at the moment: after a recession that was milder in Upstate New York than in many parts of the country, the region is showing signs of a modest recovery. A more diversified, more knowledge-based economy and a relatively small housing sector helped to limit the recession's impact on many communities. Nevertheless, the Great Recession spread much pain throughout this region and unemployment remains much higher than we would like.\n\nThe Fed cannot wave a magic wand and make the problems remaining from the preceding period of excess vanish immediately. But we can provide essential support for the needed adjustments. Even with our best efforts, the road to full recovery here in Upstate New York and across the nation is likely to be long and bumpy. But I am confident that we will make it. And, the dynamism that is represented in this room—the private sector combined with academic learning and research—will provide a strong underpinning for future prosperity.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I will now be happy to take some questions.",

    "text": "I very  much appreciate having the opportunity to participate in today’s program.  Improving the culture of financial services  is an important issue for me and my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York, as well as for many senior policymakers both domestically and abroad.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own  views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the  Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nWhy  should we seek better culture in the financial services industry?  We do this to achieve better outcomes in  terms of conduct and behavior—and, with that, greater trustworthiness in our  nation’s financial system.  Greater  trustworthiness will make it easier for the financial industry to perform its  role in supporting economic activity and rising living standards.  Greater trustworthiness will also make it  easier to attract top talent into the industry.   Without that, the industry will suffer.\n\nThe  focus of today’s event is the role you can play as future leaders of the  industry.  Your firms selected you to  attend because of your career success thus far and your potential for senior  leadership.  It is timely, therefore, for  you to consider what type of leader you want to be, what type of firm you want  to lead, and what type of industry you want to work in and influence.  I have some views on all three, which we will  get to in a moment.\n\nI am  encouraged that members of the industry have convened here today to engage on  these issues.  I think it is important  that the industry tackle this together.   You can learn from one another.   And, given the scandals of recent years, you really do have to sink or  swim together.\n\nBefore  the recent spate of conduct problems, there were times when one might be  secretly happy when a competitor stumbled through some sort of misconduct.  All the better if such a stumble generated  negative publicity and headlines.  Today,  the situation is vastly different.  When  each new scandal emerges, the industry is painted with the same broad  brush.  This underscores the importance  of taking both individual and collective responsibility for reform.  You have a personal stake in improving bank  culture.  Your firms have a stake too.  And so does the industry.\n\nThere  are three messages I am going to focus on today:\n\nFirst , stay in banking and be good  role models of the behaviors and conduct that we all want to see.  It’s important.  The banking industry needs your talents.  And, if done the right way, it will result in  a fulfilling career.\n\nSecond , banking does not have its  own ethics—nor should it have its own ethics.   The qualities that you value in other aspects of your life should be the  same qualities you apply at work and encourage in your colleagues.\n\nThird , candid assessment is  critical to improving culture.  I invite  you to think in particular about the incentives and norms of behavior within  your organizations.  Do they support or  impair the qualities and principles that guide you and that your firm  espouses?\n\nBefore  expanding on those points, let me explain why I believe that reforming culture  is important, and justifies the time and effort of not only of today’s program,  but of the ongoing work at your institutions and collectively across the  industry.\n\nThe  manipulations of LIBOR and foreign exchange rates prompted the New York Fed’s  work on culture.  Of course, widespread  misconduct did not originate with either episode.  The timing, however, was significant.  Despite the near-death experience of the  financial crisis, new rules and regulations, and―in some  cases―large  fines and penalties, the LIBOR and FX events made clear that serious ethical  and behavioral problems had persisted in the industry.  I was particularly struck by how the  manipulation of foreign exchange rates occurred even after the LIBOR fixing was  widely known.  The appropriate lessons  from the LIBOR scandal did not seem to have been learned.  That was both surprising and profoundly  disappointing to me.\n\nThe  LIBOR and FX collusions were not occasional atonalities in an otherwise  harmonious financial system.  They were  not two remote tail risks that both happened to materialize, or just a bad  coincidence.  There have been too many  examples of other misconduct to list.   Wells Fargo is the most recent example, but serious misconduct is not  confined to a single jurisdiction or a business model.  The evidence, which now stretches over a  decade, has only reaffirmed my initial belief that there is an industry-wide  problem.\n\nIn light  of these continuing and widespread failures, my colleagues and I recognize the  importance of culture—that is the unwritten norms and accepted practices of an  organization.  The culture of each firm  will necessarily be its own.  But the  pervasiveness of problems—across firms and countries—points to common,  industry-wide norms that need attention.\n\nAn  industry-wide problem needs an industry-wide solution.  I also think that, when the problem is  cultural, any solution must be industry-driven.   It is the public sector’s job to establish and enforce rules, but rules  face some inherent limits in shaping conduct and behavior.  It is natural to adapt to the behaviors that  we observe around us.  A common  illustration of this point is the speed limit.   Most drivers move with the flow of traffic.  They pay less attention to a number posted on  a sign.\n\nThis is  not to deny the necessity and importance of regulation, or to criticize any of  the particular rules imposed in response to the financial crisis.  But, we also must recognize that it is  impossible to create a rule for every situation.  Also, rules tend to be reactive rather than  proactive.  Rulemakers—whether they be  members of Congress, regulators or judges—are almost always responding to events.  And, even if rules could cover every  situation, having a rule does not mean that people will always follow it.  In many recent examples, the behaviors we  observed violated rules already on the books.   Thus, more rules and penalties alone will not cure the industry’s  underlying problems.  They are necessary,  but not sufficient.\n\nWhat’s  more, establishment of too many brightline rules may prove counterproductive in  encouraging a good culture.  For one  thing, intricate and detailed rules can be construed as implying that the  responsibility for good conduct rests with supervisors and regulators.  For another, rules may create opportunities  or incentives for legal or regulatory arbitrage—finding creative ways around  rules.  And this activity may, in itself,  have insidious effects on culture.\n\nAs I see  it, the problem occurs when an organization’s culture equates “what is right”  with what is legally permissible, and when “what is wrong” becomes equivalent  to what is legally impermissible.  The  technical legality of the rule, not the propriety of our conduct, becomes the  arbiter of our actions.  A proliferation  of rules may prompt us to ask first what we can do, not what we should do.  Legal arbitrage is intellectually energetic,  but ethically lazy.\n\nAnd, as  U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara has observed,  if you spend your time thinking about how close to the line you can get, it is  inevitable that you will at some point cross that line.  No one gets the arbitrage right 100 percent  of the time. 2 When you make that mistake, you will not only  have a bad culture, but you will also have to deal with Preet Bharara’s office.\n\nTherefore,  what’s needed is a better culture.   Culture can help to fill in the spaces between and beyond rules.  Culture also shapes our attitude toward  rules.  A strong, ethical culture is one  in which individuals within an organization demonstrate to each other a  commitment to certain first principles.   These principles must align with both the private purpose of the  organization and the public rules governing its operations.\n\nOf  course, it is possible for principles to conflict.  When that occurs, determining the right  course will be difficult.  But, the more  you wrestle with that conflict, the better you will become at resolving ethical  quandaries.  Aristotle called this aspect  of ethics “habit,” but I prefer to think of it as ethical muscle memory.  The more practice you have in thinking about  it, the better you will be at determining what is right.\n\nBankers  will be more likely to think about what is right, as opposed to what is merely  legal, the more often they observe their colleagues doing the same.  I doubt that rules alone can accomplish  this.  Telling people to be ethical  doesn’t make it so.  Seeing others engage  in ethical decision-making is, by contrast, quite powerful.\n\nWith  that prologue, let me turn to my first message: Stay in banking.  This might be a surprising message in light  of my introduction.  Nonetheless, banking  is important work.  Society relies on its  financial system to “create substantial value for our society.” 3 As investor and author John Bogle has  written:\n\nTo  fulfill its potential for creating value for society, the financial system  needs talented and dedicated people at the helm.  This is especially true for banks, which are  indispensable to our economic system.\n\nAs the  philosopher Onora O’Neill has observed, banking requires more than just  technical competence. 5 Bankers must reproduce their efforts and  results with reliability.  And, above  all, bankers must be honest.  They must  do what they say and say what they mean.   This is necessary for the financial system to be viewed as  trustworthy.  Without that, the financial  industry cannot be effective in performing its key roles.\n\nCultivating  these three traits emphasized by Onora O’Neill—competence, reliability and  honesty—will help enable you to have a personally fulfilling career.  The best doctors or lawyers do their work not  only because it pays well, but because it is interesting and contributes an  important service to society.  I hope you  feel the same about what you do.  And if  you don’t, I urge you to consider how your industry can become more  professionally fulfilling.  What is  needed for you to feel better about your work, to sleep more soundly, to worry  less about the risk posed to your business by potential misconduct?\n\nYour  professional fulfillment will grow if you also contribute to promoting these  qualities in others—that is, by helping to improve the culture of financial  services.  It is easier to be smart,  dependable and trustworthy when you are surrounded by other people who also fit  that description.\n\nMy  second message is to reject the idea that a separate regime of ethics or  morality applies in banking.  I’m sure  you have heard this, or perhaps even thought this, at some point in your  career.  Let it end there.  We often teach our children by asking them if  they would engage in that type of behavior at home.  This is good professional advice as well.\n\nBankers  have been criticized for their ethical and moral shortcomings.  That criticism has legitimate grievances at  its roots.  There have been far too many  instances in which bankers have not lived up to expectations.  But it is also true—and I’m sure you have  experienced this—that you have advanced in your careers because you have demonstrated  personal attributes that anyone would be proud to possess.  I mentioned before honesty, competence and  reliability.  You could add to that list  hard work, perseverance and responsiveness.\n\nMoreover,  if you are like me, your careers will have benefitted from teamwork—the good  fortune to work with capable colleagues.   Individual effort is essential, but success often depends as well on the  contributions of others. 6 Whatever list you have come up with, make  sure that teamwork is among your core personal principles.\n\nI would  also like to make a slightly different observation on banker ethics.  What’s missing is not so much a personal  commitment to good conduct, but rather a commitment to call out bad conduct  observed in others.  You might think it  is a paradox or a contradiction to praise teamwork in one breath, and then in  the next breath to call for raising the red flag when you see bad conduct in  others.  I do not see it that way.\n\nWe hear  often that integrity is a corporate value.   I think what is often meant by this is honesty—doing what you say, and  saying what you mean.  But integrity, to  me, has an additional meaning.  It means  operating according to a single, internally consistent set of principles.  If you are honest only in some places or  circumstances, but not others—or only with some people, but not others—then  honesty is hardly integral or integrated into your life and work.\n\nThe  importance of this particular meaning of “integrity” was made apparent to me on  a recent visit I made to the United States Military Academy at West Point.  The faculty and students there believe that  strong individual ethics are what make large organizations like the U.S. armed  forces succeed.  The commitment of cadets  to living the ideals of the institution was impressive and humbling.  They embodied the word integrity—alignment of  word and deed in all aspects of life.\n\nAnother  lesson that I took from West Point is that cadets commit to integrity because  their careers—and, in combat, their lives—depend on others.  We are in this together—this city, this  industry, this country.  And if we’re in  it together, we all have to behave in ways that benefit the group. 7 We have to behave in ways that merit the  trust of others.\n\nWhether  we are citizens or soldiers, the most important relationships in our lives are  built on trust.  In our personal lives,  we take action when our trust has been betrayed.  To reform financial services, we need to  bring the same expectations of trust—and the consequences of a breach of that  trust—to the office each day.  If you  would not tolerate a practice in your personal life, do not tolerate it in the  office.\n\nCalling  out bad conduct is not easy.  Let me  share with you another observation from Preet Bharara.  A common element in many of the frauds his  office has prosecuted is the failure of colleagues to call out bad conduct by  raising their hands.  This is so telling  of a culture that condones or promotes misconduct.  People see something, but do not say  something.  And, it is so  shortsighted.  It prevents problems from  being addressed while they are small.  By  not raising their hands, these colleagues are “quietly adding risk to your  books [and] invisibly enlarging your liabilities.” 8 They are also tacitly encouraging bad conduct  by skewing incentives.\n\nThere  may be many reasons for choosing silence over raising your hand.  You may face a conflict of loyalties.  It’s uncomfortable to tell on a colleague.  You may think that the problem will just go  away, or that calling attention to a problem will harm the firm.  Raising your hand is difficult.  But, it is also absolutely necessary.  As rising leaders in the industry, you need  to lead by example.  In doing so, you  will make it easier for others to follow your lead.\n\nMy final  message is a request that each of you commit to a candid assessment of  yourselves, your firms and your industry.   For Adam Smith, candid observation was a cornerstone of economic behavior:\n\nCandid  self-assessment is essential to knowing where you stand and how you are  progressing toward your goal.  Industry  groups here and in other financial centers are working on useful ways to  measure culture—consistent with the maxim, “if it’s important, you will measure  it.”  But, assessment cannot stop there,  and it cannot be the job of someone else—such as management, compliance, audit  or a regulator.  Each of us must also be  reflective about our own faults.  We must  also commit to do better going forward.\n\nWhen it  comes to making a candid assessment of your group, your firm and your industry,  I would like to suggest that you devote significant attention to  incentives.  I believe that incentives  shape behavior, and behavior drives culture.   If you want a culture that will support your long-term business  strategy, you need to align incentives with the behaviors that will sustain  your business over the long haul.\n\nThere  are many ways of encouraging certain behavior through incentives.  Promotion is quite powerful, as is  compensation.  They are powerful, in  part, because they convey values and community esteem.  People work hard to earn money.  But, most also work hard to earn the trust  and respect of colleagues, peers, subordinates and seniors.  If you want to know what behaviors are valued  or esteemed in reality, look to see who is promoted and well-compensated and  the behaviors that they embody.  Do the  results match what is said?  Do they  match your expectation of fairness?  Do  you aspire to be one of these individuals, not because of their status and  compensation alone, but because of the esteem you hold for them and their  values?\n\nOver the  long haul, the economy needs a vibrant and trustworthy financial sector in order  to thrive, just as the financial sector needs a vibrant economy to thrive as  well.  You are the rising leaders of your  firms.  You can help accomplish these  aims.  A strong and ethical culture in  the banking industry will make it more trustworthy, and therefore more  effective in performing its mission.  It  will also help the industry be held in higher esteem and this will help attract  the talent needed to sustain the industry.   I am encouraged by today’s gathering, and hope you will take heart that  an improved culture in the financial services industry is both necessary and  possible.  Thank you for your continued  efforts and your kind attention.\n\n1 Stephanie Chaly, James  Hennessy, Thomas Noone, Joseph Sommer and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 See Criminal Accountability and  Culture ,  Remarks by Preet Bharara, Reforming Culture and Behavior in the Financial  Services Industry: Expanding the Dialogue, October 20, 2016.\n\n3 See John C.

    "text": "We have three distinguished panelists in this opening session—Claudio Borio, the head of the Monetary and Economic Department at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), William Coen, the Secretary General of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and Masa Kono, who is currently the Vice-Minister of International Affairs at the Japan Financial Services Agency and who earlier chaired the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) during the development of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI).  They will offer their thoughts on how the role of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure (CPMI) has changed and is likely to continue to evolve in its task of setting and helping implement global financial, operational and risk standards for the world’s key financial market infrastructures (FMI).\n\nBefore I turn to our panelists, let me offer some brief comments on the evolution of the CPMI.  As I see it, there have been three broad complementary trends that have been important in influencing the evolution of the CPMI and have contributed to its increased importance over time.  As always, what I have to say represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe first trend has been the development of a global financial system.  This has increased financial system interdependencies and, hence, the importance of harmonizing standards across national regulatory regimes.  It also has made it more important to avoid regulatory arbitrage and race to the bottom types of behavior that could weaken the resiliency and robustness of the global financial market infrastructure.\n\nThe second trend is the increasing importance of FMIs within the financial system.  As trading across a more complex array of instruments and products proliferates, and as more trades are centrally cleared, well-managed FMIs play an increasingly important role within the financial system.\n\nThe third trend stems directly from the first two.  With the global financial system becoming more prominent and FMIs playing a bigger role within this global financial system, it has become ever more essential that major FMIs operate safely.  When run well, they mitigate risk.  But, run poorly, they could be a source of contagion and risk propagation throughout the global financial system.  This means that the CPMI’s work has become much more critical in ensuring a safe and sound global financial system.\n\nThe growing influence of the CPMI can be seen in its success in staying ahead of these trends.  It was the CPMI’s analysis and standard-setting that led to the adoption of payment systems that provide “real-time gross settlement with intraday finality,” securities settlement systems that ensure “delivery versus payment,” and foreign exchange settlement systems that ensure “payment versus payment.”  This fundamental evolution of systemically important payment and settlement systems was instrumental in mitigating significant sources of systemic risk and laying a solid foundation to support the increasingly global financial system.\n\nIn parallel, it was the CPMI that first defined the concept and processes of \"central bank oversight of payment and settlement systems\" and implemented the associated principles for \"central bank cooperation.\"  This also supported many central banks and securities regulators in their efforts to gain explicit legal responsibility and power to apply standards aimed at promoting broader \"financial stability\" and containing \"systemic risk.”  Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States is a good example of this.  This means that many authorities now have greater capacity and responsibility to apply and enforce the PFMI as requirements, where previously a number of regulators were constrained to treating earlier standards merely as \"recommendations.\"  Taken together, we have made considerable progress in terms of the global regulatory regime to reflect the growing importance of FMIs and central counterparties (CCPs) within the financial system.\n\nLet me briefly list a few of the accomplishments of the PFMI:\n\nAs I see it, great progress has been made, but there is more work to do in a number of areas:\n\nI am very fortunate to have had the opportunity to chair the Committee during the period in which the PFMI were created.  I recognize that this was just an initial step in the process, but it was an essential first step.  Subsequent CPMI committees, under the leadership of Paul Tucker and Benoit Coeure, have been working with the other Basel Committees, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), IOSCO and individual country regulators to continue to take this effort forward.\n\nWe have placed a lot of financial stability eggs in the FMI basket.  It is important that we monitor and oversee that basket carefully.\n\nI would now like to turn the floor over to our first panelist, Claudio Borio.  Claudio, the floor is yours, you have 10 minutes.\n\n1 Shari Bower, Caren Cox, Alex Merle-Huet, John Rutigliano, Johanna Schwab, Larry Sweet and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.",

    "text": "In this discussion I will highlight how the recent financial crisis and its aftermath have accelerated the shift in the relative importance of the so-called developed and emerging market economies.\n\nI will then discuss how the global economic system needs to adapt in light of the growing relative importance of the EMEs in the global economy. I will explore the implications of these changes for U.S. economic policy and I will also touch on some of the challenges the EMEs face as they seek to consolidate their gains and sustain their success.\n\nI will argue that the developed countries and the EMEs need to adjust in mutually supportive ways. In my view, the current relationship between the EMEs and the United States is not sustainable for either side. Not only has an unusually wide divergence in cyclical positions opened up that creates immediate strains, but there are also important structural imbalances that have developed that must be addressed.\n\nI will close by turning my attention to what can be done to address these cyclical and secular challenges. Although I will discuss the role of U.S. monetary policy in this context, I will also discuss what other steps can be taken to strengthen the relationship and make it more sustainable.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOver the past few decades, the most salient feature of the global economy has been the growing importance of the emerging market economies and the ever-deepening integration of these economies into the global economic system. A shift toward more market-based and outwardly oriented development on the part of the EMEs has enabled hundreds of millions of people across the emerging world to become integrated into the global economy for the first time. The outcome has been a rapid rise in living standards and a reduction in poverty on a scale that is without precedent in human history.\n\nThese changes have been most evident in China, with a historic transformation that began with the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping and continues to this day. But the EME story is much broader than China. Over the past decade, 1 excluding China, the emerging world has grown at a 4.7 percent annual rate— its fastest rate on record.\n\nThe EME world is, of course, not monolithic. There are the dynamic large economies, EMEs that are broadly complementary to them, and some countries that are both less complementary and less competitive than their peers. Happily, for the most part, EME success is proving mutually reinforcing, as witnessed by growing intra-EME trade.\n\nAs EME output has grown rapidly, their share of the global economy has increased markedly. EMEs now account for 38 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), up from 23 percent in 1990. And it is the EMEs, not the developed economies, that have been the engine of global growth in recent years. For example, during the 2000s, EME growth accounted for 59 percent of global growth, up from 33 percent and 25 percent, respectively, in the two preceding decades.\n\nBy other measures, the EMEs have been even more important. For example, EME growth has been very commodity intensive. Thus, while China is still only two-fifths the size of the United States in GDP terms, it dwarfs the United States in terms of its demand for some key commodities.\n\nThe growth momentum among the EMEs is the result of years of tough choices and sound decisionmaking across the emerging world. Policymakers learned from the mistakes of past crises and capitalized on globalization and technological change. However, while the rise of the EMEs is due mainly to the efforts of the EMEs themselves, the reaction of the developed countries in maintaining an open global trading system and resisting calls for protectionism has also been essential.\n\nEven before the financial crisis, the sustained dynamism of the emerging economies was bringing about a profound shift in the role of the EMEs within the global economy. The traditional distinction between the industrialized \"core\" of the system and the emerging \"periphery\" was becoming harder to justify as an analytical construct—still less an organizing framework for policy—as the periphery took on more weight and became a much more important driver of global economic developments.\n\nHowever, the crisis and its aftermath accelerated this transition. Although many emerging market economies contracted sharply following the peak of the financial crisis in late 2008, economic activity in the EMEs has since rebounded powerfully. In contrast, the recovery for the developed economies has been anemic. Economic output for the BRICs this year will be about 31 percent higher than it was in 2007; for the G7 just 1 percent higher. 2\n\nThe rapid rebound of the EMEs occurred mainly because the locus of the financial crisis was elsewhere and that helped limit the damage to their financial system and balance sheets. But many EMEs also recovered quickly because they had the capacity and credibility to pursue countercyclical policies in response to large external shocks to aggregate demand for the first time.\n\nOn many fiscal metrics, some economies in the emerging world now look in better shape than many of those in the advanced world. This challenges the traditional distinction between developed country and emerging market sovereign creditworthiness. Where the developed world still stands apart is in the quality of its institutions, legal and policy frameworks, and the sophistication of its technologies and markets. But even here the gap is narrowing.\n\nThe story of the EMEs has generally been an extraordinarily positive one for the world as hundreds of millions of people have lifted themselves out of poverty.\n\nNevertheless, even before the crisis, it was evident that the relationship between developed and emerging economies was becoming strained and needed to be adjusted; the status quo would clearly be unsustainable. Consider, for example, the economic relationships between the United States and China that prevailed over the past decade or so.\n\nSome experts have summarized the arrangements as follows. The United States bought Chinese exports at low prices, which bolstered U.S. living standards and held down U.S. inflation. The United States did not take extreme steps to try to force China to revalue the renminbi upward against the dollar, and China, in turn, invested its trade surplus and capital inflows into U.S. Treasuries in order to keep the renminbi from appreciating too rapidly. The U.S. terms of trade improved as the cost of imported goods dropped, and U.S. interest rates stayed relatively low as China recycled its trade surpluses back into U.S. financial assets. For China, the benefits included strong economic growth, technology transfer and the creation of many manufacturing jobs. These developments, in turn, helped foster rising living standards and political stability in China.\n\nThese outcomes were by no means all the result of a deliberate grand strategy. But I think this is a reasonable, albeit overly simplistic, description of what happened.\n\nAlthough the pre-crisis arrangements worked reasonably well for a while, the flaws became increasingly evident over time. Looked at from the lens of the developed world, the combination of rapid gains in production capacity and relatively repressed consumption in the EME world helped foster a global deficiency of demand relative to supply. In these circumstances, the United States and many other industrialized economies had to sustain domestic demand at elevated levels in order to achieve \"full employment\" and prevent deflation.\n\nFor the United States, the consequence was elevated consumption facilitated by asset price inflation, easy underwriting standards for credit and structural budget deficits. Of course, this particular outcome was not preordained or caused by the EMEs. There were multiple combinations of domestic demand consistent with full employment in the United States during the pre-crisis period. For example, if the United States had adopted different policies, it might have shifted the composition of growth toward more business investment and less consumption and housing. But in a disinflationary global environment amid chronic EME trade surpluses, the United States could not achieve a high level of employment with a high level of national saving.\n\nLooked at from the lens of the emerging world, sustained consumption demand in developed nations induced the EMEs to continue to emphasize investment and exports. This meant that still poor populations did not reap the full benefit of their labors in the form of increases in real income and consumption commensurate with the gains achieved in productivity and output.\n\nAlso, this system led, in many cases, to poor returns to EME savers. This resulted, in part, from the cost of sterilizing reserves accumulated in the process of managing exchange rates and the use of the banking system as a tool of industrial policy.\n\nWhile it is tempting to draw a line of causation from actions in one part of the global system to the other, this is overly simplistic. Rather, we have to think of the global economy as a single system, with outcomes based simultaneously on all the choices and preferences throughout the system. What is new is that the so-called periphery is now weighty enough to have a large impact on the pattern of economic activity in the core, as well as vice versa.\n\nAlthough the outcomes were not caused by currency arrangements per se, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that regimes with limited exchange rate flexibility linked to the dollar at undervalued exchange rates frustrated one channel through which relative prices might otherwise have adjusted in a way to induce more balanced global growth.\n\nIt is clear that the pre-crisis formula for global growth was not sustainable. This is obvious in the case of industrialized nations where private consumption and fiscal deficits reached unsustainable levels and needed to be cut back.\n\nLess obviously, this is also the case for EMEs, as growth strategies that rely on excessive consumption elsewhere in the system are no longer viable. Put simply, we now have a problem of arithmetic—particularly for China as the largest and most dynamic EME.\n\nAs China becomes increasingly weighty in the global economy, it will not be able to sustain export growth in the high teens annually 3 in a world that is growing (ex China) at less than 4 percent a year on average. For China, the business fixed investment side of the ledger also appears unsustainably high as a share of GDP. In this context, China's ongoing rapid accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, which carries real economic costs, seems less a sign of strength than an indication of how difficult it is to shift to a different growth path.\n\nThe financial crisis did not cause the old growth patterns to become unsustainable. They already were. But its aftermath forces us to confront the need for adjustment with greater urgency, due to the added imposition of extreme cyclical pressures on what were already unsustainable structural relationships.\n\nThere are now two additional dimensions to the problem: (1) the stress created by exchange rate regimes that link the monetary conditions of economies at very different stages in the business cycle, and (2) the need for far-reaching fiscal adjustment in the crisis-hit economies of the developed world in the coming years.\n\nAgain, to simplify, take the case of the United States and China. The Chinese economy is experiencing the pressures of rapid economic growth that threaten to lead to overheating. Chinese wages—especially in the coastal regions are rising rapidly and consumer prices, on a year-over-year basis, are rising at about a 5 percent annual rate. In contrast, U.S. inflation is considerably lower, growth is subdued, and the United States is still 7 million jobs short of the peak reached in 2007.\n\nAn extreme cyclical imbalance exists between the EME world and the United States. The monetary policy appropriate for the United States is increasingly inappropriate for the vast majority of EMEs and vice versa. This creates for EME authorities a dilemma that cannot be resolved entirely via macro-prudential regulatory policies, regardless of their merit.\n\nAn EME faces the choice: let its currency appreciate more rapidly and risk losing competitiveness in international markets, or restrain the rise in its currency through intervention and risk inflation. The steps required to mitigate the inflation risk through sterilization can involve big fiscal costs. 4 Neither option is attractive, though the former strategy of currency appreciation is much less problematic if other EMEs are acting in a similar manner.\n\nMeanwhile, we all have to bear in mind that current circumstances put stress on the support for open global markets in the developed world.\n\nOn the U.S. side, the recovery remains distinctly subpar in spite of aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus. On the monetary policy front, short-term rates remain near zero and the Federal Reserve is just about to complete its $600 billion Treasury purchase program. On the fiscal policy front, the U.S. government has engaged in large stimulus program. This supported demand and employment while the private sector shifted its saving balance into surplus in an effort to repair balance sheets.\n\nHowever, the large size of the fiscal deficit and the rapid increase in the country's federal debt-to-GDP ratio means that this is not sustainable for much longer.\n\nUltimately, the composition of economic activity in the United States needs to be rebalanced. There are two issues here. First, the consumption share of GDP may still be too high. Second, the need for U.S. fiscal consolidation implies that there will have to be offsetting increases in investment and the U.S. trade balance as the recovery proceeds.\n\nTo illustrate this second point consider the following accounting identity: The public sector balance + the private sector balance = the current account balance\n\nRight now the identity holds as roughly: -10 percent of GDP public sector balance + 7 percent of GDP private sector balance = -3 percent of GDP current account balance. 5\n\nIf the public sector balance must over time move from around -10 percent to around -3 percent to stabilize the federal debt-to-GDP ratio at tolerable levels, then the private sector balance and the current account balance must move by roughly 7 percentage points of GDP to take up the slack.\n\nAssuming that the consumption share of GDP still needs to fall over the medium term, the adjustment in the U.S. private balance will have to occur primarily in terms of rising residential or business fixed investment.\n\nThere does seem to be room for business investment to expand significantly when firms become more confident in the economic outlook, provided that the United States remains a competitive location for investment. But residential investment is unlikely to climb very much for some time given the chronic overhang of unsold homes.\n\nIf these two sectors cannot take up all the slack created by necessary fiscal retrenchment in the years ahead—as seems likely—then the U.S. trade balance will need to improve as well. This implies that EMEs will no longer be able to rely on expanding U.S. demand as a key driver of their own economic growth.\n\nOf course, this is not just an issue of U.S. and EME adjustment. Adjustments will be required in other industrialized countries, too—and not just the deficit countries. There has to be recognition on all sides that global rebalancing in terms of the composition of activity and growth and in terms of global capital flows is necessary.\n\nFortunately, this is not a zero-sum game: it is in the interests of all sides. However, it is still very difficult to accomplish because it is not in the short-term interests of some interest groups in many nations. This means that there are likely to be considerable political obstacles to adjustment in many parts of the global economy.\n\nIn this process, the United States needs to show leadership in contributing to a smooth adjustment. In this regard, I think there are a number of actions that the United States can take—unilaterally and in its own interest—that will make this rebalancing process easier and less prone to disruption.\n\nAs discussed earlier, no issue is more important than a credible commitment for getting our fiscal house in order, but at a pace that does not forestall a sustained economic recovery. What is needed here is fiscal consolidation that begins slowly, builds over time to substantial magnitude, and is difficult to dismantle—i.e., it requires the commitment of both political parties. The decision of how big the U.S. government should be and what functions it should perform is a political decision that I leave to the voters and our legislators. However, as a nation we need to acknowledge that we must be willing to pay for whatever government services and transfers we want to have. We should not assume that an excess of global savings will always be available to easily finance our public deficits.\n\nThe choice of fiscal sustainability is not a political one, it is an economic one and if we do not act voluntarily and preemptively, the market will inevitably force the outcome later—most likely in a much more difficult and messy fashion.\n\nMoreover, we must recognize that the rest of the world is closely monitoring our ability as a nation to come to grips with our long-term fiscal challenges, and to pay our debts when they come due. This is an important litmus test of our credibility and ability to exercise global economic leadership.\n\nBut the challenges extend far beyond fiscal policy. We, as a nation, have to take steps that facilitate the needed structural adjustment of U.S. economic activity that will position us to thrive in the next chapter of global economic transformation. We need to make sure the next business cycle will be more sustainable than the last, which was built on an unstable foundation of asset price gains, easy credit and outsized financial-sector profits.\n\nThis will require a shift in orientation from consumption to export and investment-led growth. As EMEs have shown us, comparative advantage and global competitiveness are not inevitable consequences of factor endowments—they are the result of the choices we make as nations.\n\nThere are no easy answers or quick-fix solutions. But in this regard, ensuring broad access to educational opportunity and improving opportunities for people to retool their skills mid-career so they can compete in a rapidly evolving global economy are important.\n\nSo too is ensuring that regulation is calibrated such that it achieves public policy goals in the most efficient manner possible, with the least compliance costs and unnecessary delays. A continued commitment to open markets and free trade is essential. Enlightened immigration policies can play a role—making sure that U.S. companies doing business here in the United States can augment the skill sets of workers here with those attracted from abroad.\n\nTax reform, energy policy, and housing policy also have crucial roles to play—as does financial reform, a subject to which I will return later in the speech.\n\nLeveraging the comparative advantage that the United States has in higher education also makes sense. This should include encouraging foreign students to come here to study. Also, closer partnerships between universities and business could leverage the technological discoveries and advances that occur in university research so that the benefits accrue to a greater degree to U.S. firms and workers.\n\nThese are fundamentally structural issues—not cyclical issues. They cannot be tackled primarily through monetary policy. Instead, monetary policy is mainly a tool for stabilizing the macroeconomy and keeping inflation expectations well-anchored.\n\nNevertheless, monetary policy has an important role in supporting the transitions that need to take place, consistent with our dual mandate of full employment and price stability. As we do so, we must take international developments fully into account.\n\nThe integration of the EMEs into the global economy has been associated with some major shifts in relative prices. For a number of years, the United States and other industrialized nations benefited from disinflation in manufactured goods produced in EMEs. This shift in relative prices—a positive terms of trade gain—helped contain inflation.\n\nMore recently, the disinflationary tailwind in traded manufactured goods imported from China may have come to an end, at least for a period, as more of the increase in productivity there is captured in wage gains.\n\nMeanwhile, growing prosperity and urbanization in highly populous countries such as China and India has been the principal driver of a major, multiyear upward shift in the relative price of commodities. This move—a negative terms of trade hit for the United States—has pushed up the overall rate of inflation, at least temporarily.\n\nThere are good reasons to believe that commodity prices will not continue to increase at the explosive rate of recent months. Households and businesses will adjust their activities in response to higher prices, and there will be a supply response to higher prices that will gradually build over time.\n\nIn any event, a shift in relative prices, even if spread out over a number of years, should not to be confused with the onset of an ongoing inflation problem. But the uncertain future path of commodity prices does make the task of the central banker harder.\n\nIt is the job of central bankers to ensure that changes in relative prices do not infect the general trend in prices. In the United States —unlike in many EMEs that are appropriately tightening policy—a large amount of slack and low unit labor cost increases provide a disinflationary counterbalance to commodity price gains. Of course, as I noted in a speech earlier this year, we will have to monitor inflation expectations closely to ensure that they do not become unanchored.\n\nWe also need to keep a close eye on the degree to which unit labor cost increases in EMEs and real exchange rate appreciation abroad are passed through into U.S. import prices and consumer inflation. Although the historic evidence is that pass-through has been limited in the United States, we cannot be complacent about this.\n\nMeanwhile, we have to recognize that monetary policy works somewhat differently in a world in which a large share of global GDP is part of a de facto dollar block. In particular, we must take into account the feedback loops this creates—how U.S. monetary policy influences financial conditions elsewhere and, how these changes, in turn, influence activity and prices in the United States.\n\nAt the same time, other nations should recognize that we cannot and do not seek to make monetary policy for the world. Responsibility for ensuring that financial conditions in other nations are appropriate for their own circumstances appropriately lies with their national authorities, and they have a wide range of fiscal, monetary, exchange rate and other policy tools available for this purpose.\n\nI do not see any fundamental conflict between U.S. domestic economic objectives and the interests of the global system as a whole. But the existing system of global currency and monetary arrangements does render effective pursuit of these objectives more difficult.\n\nI believe that we would all be better off if the system evolved toward more flexible exchange rates and greater monetary independence in the EME world.\n\nNotwithstanding this, we can and do pursue our monetary policy objectives in the United States ever mindful of how our policy choices affect other parts of the global economic system, recognizing that these impacts will, in turn, influence U.S. economic outcomes.\n\nFor the Federal Reserve, pursuing the dual mandate of full employment and price stability allows us to make an important contribution to global stability and growth. Ensuring low and stable inflation preserves the purchasing power of the dollar and sustains its attractiveness as a medium of exchange. Supporting maximum sustainable employment means that we have an important growth mandate.\n\nThis remains the case even when we are at the so-called zero bound with respect to short-term rates. In this context, I believe that our large-scale asset purchase programs were fully consistent with our global responsibilities. For example, our recent program to purchase $600 billion of Treasury securities sought to prevent a relapse into recession and to lessen the risk of deflation—outcomes that would have been very damaging to global economy.\n\nI do not mean to dismiss lightly the concerns raised by some EMEs about the program. By removing long-duration Treasury assets from private investors' hands, we encouraged those investors to purchase other assets, including foreign assets. This eased U.S. financial conditions and, thus, boosted U.S. demand for both domestically and foreign-produced goods. The portfolio rebalancing also may have encouraged greater gross capital outflows. It is at least possible that this amplified the fundamentally driven rise in EME asset prices and put some upward pressure on some EME currencies.\n\nBut, in my opinion, it would have been irresponsible for us to allow the risk of a deflationary outcome in the United States to persist without decisive policy action. If the United States had slipped back into recession, the global economy and financial system would have been destabilized in unpredictable ways, and capital flight to the EMEs and upward pressure on EME currencies would have likely increased rather than diminished.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is fully committed to keeping inflation in check and maintaining the purchasing power of the dollar. This is important for U.S. economic stability and growth. It is also critical if the United States is to retain foreign investor confidence, which, as an importer of capital, we should never take for granted.\n\nIn fact, we recognize that the United States, as the issuer of the global reserve currency, has singular responsibilities within the global system. The central role of the dollar and dollar assets rests on several pillars:\n\nThese are strengths that we must constantly maintain.\n\nEnsuring financial stability is essential to advancing the common interests of the global economic system. We have much work still to do in the developed world. But the EMEs also need to be active participants in this conversation, given their rising weight in the world economy, already large contribution to global savings and growing importance in the creation of financial assets. Everyone benefits if the EMEs can liberalize and deepen their financial systems in ways that avoid some of the mistakes that we in the United States and others have made.\n\nTo sum up, the rapid ascendancy of the EMEs in the world economy and the widespread improvement in living conditions associated with globalization are to be applauded. But aspects of this process have occurred in a manner that has led to strains on both a cyclical and secular basis. The current relationships in terms of capital flows and composition of growth are not likely to prove sustainable on a long-term basis.\n\nThe issue of global rebalancing has received plenty of attention elsewhere. My goal today is not to play the blame game. We all share responsibility for addressing our current set of challenges. Rather, it is to lay out the reasons why it is imperative that the United States and the EMEs collectively move toward arrangements that put us on a mutually sustainable path. I hope I have been convincing.\n\nThe United States must provide leadership in this global process. This is in our own national interest. The policy response we need combines fiscal and structural adjustments that would enable the United States to prosper in the next phase of global economic transformation. These issues cannot be addressed primarily thorough monetary policy. However, monetary policy has a role to play in supporting the necessary transitions, and it too needs to be conducted mindful of its global context.\n\nAs we step up to our responsibilities, we should look to the leading nations of the EME world to provide leadership too, commensurate with their growing importance in the global system, in rebalancing demand and increasing currency flexibility. If we lead together, with mutually supportive actions, we can achieve better outcomes than any of us can achieve on our own.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.",

    "text": "Welcome.  It is great to see all of you here today to  discuss the objectives and measurement of supervision for large, complex  financial institutions.\n\nNearly eight years have passed  since the financial crisis hit, pushing the financial system and the U.S.  economy to the brink, and leaving scars that are still evident today.  The hardships of the financial crisis are  unfortunately still open wounds for too many people, especially those who lost  their jobs, homes or businesses, or those who struggled with the sharp fall in  value of their homes and with staying current on their debts and bills.  Understanding what went wrong and how to  avoid severe financial crises in the future is, I am sure, an issue foremost in  the minds of all the distinguished speakers here today, and I am no  exception.  Before continuing, let me  indicate that what I have to say today reflects my own views and not  necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve  System. 1\n\nA central part of the financial  crisis was the failure or near-failure of many large financial  institutions—both institutions that were supervised by the Federal Reserve and  many that were not—which constrained their ability to play their crucial role  in supplying credit and financial services to businesses and consumers.  In the wake of the crisis, considerable  attention has been devoted to the role that supervisors—including those here at  the New York Fed—played in this meltdown.   But much of this discussion has taken place without a broad  understanding of what supervisors actually do—the scope, breadth, and limits of  their activities and authorities.  Within  the official sector, we make a distinction between regulation —the rules governing what financial institutions must and  must not do, and supervision —which  involves monitoring, oversight and enforcing compliance with law, regulation  and supervisory expectations for firms’ governance, internal processes and  controls, and financial condition.  This  distinction between regulation and supervision is often not well-understood,  and thus their complementary roles are not always fully appreciated.\n\nAddressing this distinction, as  we see it, is one important motivation for this conference.  Through the papers presented today and the  discussions by noted academic researchers, policymakers and senior supervisors  from the U.S. and overseas, we hope to broaden the understanding of the role  and objectives of supervision.  The goal  is to spur conversation and new research on what supervision should be trying  to achieve and the best means for achieving those ends.  Just as important, we want to generate ideas  for how to better assess the effectiveness of supervisory activities.  In a world of limited resources, how do we  deploy our people and technology in the most effective way to limit disruption  and distress at individual firms and to the financial system, while still  fostering an efficient and innovative financial system?\n\nIn considering these questions,  a good starting point is to understand more fully what supervisors do and how  they do it in the current environment.   The papers that are being presented here today are largely aimed at  achieving this goal.  As described in the  first paper—“Supervising Large, Complex Financial Institutions: What do  Supervisors Do?”—bank supervision has long been an integral component of the  Federal Reserve’s responsibilities.  At a  broad level, Federal Reserve supervision of large financial institutions is  guided by two key objectives: “enhancing the resiliency of a firm to lower the  probability of its failure or inability to serve as a financial intermediary [and]  reducing the impact on the financial system and the broader economy in the  event of a firm’s failure or material weakness.” 2 In addressing these objectives, bank  supervisors enforce laws and regulations, but there is much more to supervision  than just enforcement.  The activities  and practices at large, complex financial organizations are simply too intricate  and evolve too quickly to be fully described ex ante in regulation.   Banking supervision works in concert with regulation as the more  flexible element of banking policy.  Supervisory  policy and standards can, and do, evolve over time to reflect the evolution in  practice in the banking industry and in financial markets.\n\nOverall, supervisors are guided  by the mandate to identify any practices or conditions at supervised firms that  are a threat to the safety and soundness of those firms—and, of course, to  ensure that the firms take all necessary steps to promptly remediate any such  conditions.  Critically, the definition  of what constitutes “safe and sound” is not hard-coded into regulation, but is  guided by the information and analysis done by supervisors and other Federal  Reserve staff, such as economists, attorneys and market analysts.  Supervisory expectations and standards are  expressed through public guidance such as Supervision and Regulation Letters  (SR Letters), publicly-posted examination manuals and other guidance.\n\nOn a day-to-day basis, banking  supervisors collect information on financial institutions through examinations  and analysis.  Examiners look at key  aspects of a supervised firm’s businesses and risk management functions.  They use this information to assess the  adequacy of the firm’s systems and processes for identifying, measuring,  monitoring and controlling risks at the firm and in the financial sector more  generally.  That said, the ultimate  responsibility for risk identification and risk management remains with the  supervised institution.  The Federal  Reserve’s role is to ensure that the institution has the necessary strong  processes in place to achieve this objective.   As risks emerge, supervisors intervene, within the realms of their  safety and soundness mandates, to require that banks take corrective actions as  necessary.  Supervision can reduce the  chance that a financial firm fails, but it can never provide a guarantee  against failure. Supervisory policies have  undergone important changes over the past few years, especially in the context  of the largest financial institutions.   Banking supervision no longer focuses solely on the safety and soundness  of individual institutions—so-called micro-prudential supervision—but now also  focuses on the implications for financial stability more generally.  The evolving supervisory framework has  resulted in a number of organizational changes in the way supervision is  conducted at the New York Fed and in the Federal Reserve System more broadly. A  very important change in the Federal Reserve System is that supervision of the  largest, most systemically important financial institutions are now coordinated  across districts through the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating  Committee (LISCC).  The LISCC is a  System-wide committee, chaired by the director of the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve’s Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, and composed  of senior officers at the Board and Reserve Banks.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve  has instituted three major horizontal evaluations, which are a key element of  the new enhanced supervisory framework for large banking companies.  These horizontal evaluations, which focus on  capital adequacy, liquidity resiliency and preparedness for recovery and  resolution, examine practices and conditions across a group of firms  simultaneously, enabling supervisors to develop peer perspectives about best  practices and approaches.  These programs  involve a consistent and systematic assessment of the financial strength and  operational resiliency of the largest and most complex financial institutions,  addressing both micro-prudential safety-and-soundness supervisory goals and  broader macro-prudential financial stability objectives.\n\nSpecifically, in the Comprehensive  Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which applies to firms with at least $50  billion in total assets, Federal Reserve supervisors assess whether bank  holding companies have sufficient capital to continue operations through times  of economic and financial stress, and whether they have robust, forward-looking  capital-planning processes that take into account whatever unique risks they  might face.  By including forward-looking  elements, the CCAR complements the enhanced Basel capital requirements now being  implemented in the United States.  In  addition, the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review (CLAR), which applies  to LISCC firms, reviews the liquidity positions and liquidity risk management  of large, complex banking organizations, including internal stress-testing  practices.  Finally, the Federal Reserve  does an annual evaluation of the LISCC firms' options to support recovery and  progress in removing impediments to orderly resolution in the Supervisory  Assessment of Recovery and Resolution Preparedness (SRP).\n\nWhile these evaluations form the  core of the supervisory program for large, complex banking companies, they are  far from the only important activities pursued by supervisors.  Day-to-day oversight of individual firms is a  critical complement to these cross-firm, horizontal evaluations.  There are three key channels that generate  insight on firms: 1) continuous monitoring through meetings with bank senior  management, business line management, risk managers, auditors and others; 2)  review and analysis of internal reports; and 3) independent analysis by  supervisory teams.  These insights guide  supervisory assessments and supervisory actions for individual institutions, as  well as contributing to the assessments made as part of CCAR, CLAR and other  horizontal exercises.\n\nWe have come a long way since  the financial crisis, and the financial sector today is much more resilient as  a result of the evolving supervisory framework.   However, more work still lies ahead.  A key challenge in assessing the effectiveness  of supervision is that much of what supervisors do, by necessity, is  confidential.  This reliance on  confidential information and confidential actions can make supervision seem  mysterious to outsiders, which complicates the evaluation of what policies may  be effective or ineffective.  For  example, if a bank fails, is this evidence of poor supervision, or instead  evidence that even good supervision can’t prevent all bank failures? Improving  our ability to do this diagnosis is critical.  I am confident that today's panels and paper  discussions will help us move forward in this direction.\n\nThank you for participating in  this conference.\n\n1 Beverly Hirtle, David Lucca and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these  remarks.\n\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. “Consolidated Supervision Framework  for Large Financial Institutions.”   Supervision and Regulation Letter 12-17.

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak today at the Japan Society. 1 Our countries have very close relations and this is particularly true at the central banker level.  I just got back from the BIS last week where I had a chance to spend some time with Governor Kuroda.\n\nToday, I will discuss the challenge that we both have been working to solve—how best to conduct monetary policy when short-term interest rates are already pinned close to zero, but the economy is still operating well below its potential.   This has required considerable learning.  After all, until Japan’s experience began in the 1990s, no major country had actually faced this problem since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nAs the first nation to experience the zero bound in modern times, Japan was an early pioneer in developing unconventional tools and strategies.  Its experiences, both good and bad, along with lessons from other periods such as the Great Depression, have helped to inform the policies adopted by the United States (U.S.) and other nations in recent years.  The evolution of policy in Japan, in turn, has been informed, in part, by the experience of the U.S. and other nations.\n\nSo what have we learned to date?  Let me highlight six key points.\n\nFirst, and most importantly, managing expectations is critical in the execution of monetary policy at the zero bound.  This includes expectations about the central bank’s objectives for inflation and the economy, and expectations about how the central bank will use its tools in the future to achieve these goals.\n\nSecond, in managing expectations, good communication is essential.  Expectations will not be well anchored when communications are muddled or inconsistent, or when a central bank acts in ways that are not consistent with its guidance.\n\nThird, actions speak louder than words alone.  Thus, there is an important role for asset purchases that ease financial conditions to support growth and keep inflation expectations well anchored.\n\nFourth, the policy instruments interact so that policy as a whole exceeds the sum of its parts.\n\nFifth, at the zero lower bound, risk management becomes extremely important.  In particular, because the costs of getting stuck in a liquidity trap with chronic deflation are high, a central bank should put substantial weight on avoiding this outcome.\n\nSixth, the constraints imposed by the zero bound limit what monetary policy can accomplish by itself.  This increases the importance of complementary fiscal, financial, and structural policy actions.  Credible fiscal policies, actions to ensure a healthy financial system, and structural reforms that lift the potential for growth are very important.\n\nAs always, what I will say here today represents my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC, Committee) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nReview of the experience in Japan and the United States\n\nLet me start by briefly reviewing the experience of Japan and the United States.  As you all know, Japan’s rapid economic ascent and investment boom came to an abrupt halt in the early 1990s with the bursting of a gigantic bubble in equities and real estate.\n\nAsset price deflation resulted in a huge decline in wealth.  This led to a sharp fall in demand, a balance sheet squeeze for both businesses and households, and a large increase in problem loans for Japanese financial intermediaries.  By some measures—such as the loss of wealth relative to the size of the economy—this was a bigger shock than the U.S. experienced in 2008.  Growth slowed sharply and inflation fell.\n\nThe Bank of Japan (BoJ) responded by reducing overnight interest rates from a peak of more than 8 percent in early 1991 to ½ a percent by the fall of 1995. 2 Most studies of this period suggest that policy was generally appropriate given economic forecasts at the time, but too tight relative to the actual outcomes. 3 Economic forecasts for Japan—both by the official community and by private sector agents—were consistently more optimistic than the actual outturns.   It is noteworthy that as late as January 1995—on the eve of deflation—10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields were still at 4.7 percent.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, we now understand that the disinflationary consequences of the asset price bust and financial stress where vastly more powerful than was widely realized at the time.  As we later saw in the U.S., the forces of contraction and disinflation operated through many different channels—not just directly on household wealth, for example, but also through the impact of the asset price bust on the health of financial intermediaries and the supply of credit to households and businesses.\n\nOver time, the Japanese banking system came under mounting stress.  This was a slow-motion crisis, as the assets were mainly loans that were not marked-to-market.   Accounting practices and regulatory forbearance allowed banks to delay charging off bad loans and recapitalizing at the cost of impairing the availability of credit to new potential borrowers.   A full-blown banking crisis finally materialized in 1997.  Although some banks were recapitalized in 1999, the full regulatory response took several more years.\n\nThe monetary and fiscal stimulus that was provided helped Japan avoid a deep recession.  But expectations about future nominal income growth for both households and businesses ground lower over time.  With inflation expectations sinking, inflation-adjusted real interest rates rose, and Japan became mired in deflation.\n\nWhile deflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, structural elements were also important.  Long-term demographic factors added to the deflationary pressures and structural rigidities, and credit supply problems constrained the reallocation of resources to growth sectors.  These structural factors made it substantially more difficult to escape the deflation trap.\n\nThe Bank of Japan was active during this period.   From the late 1990s onwards, it pioneered an extremely broad array of innovative tools—many of which were later adopted, in amended form, by the Fed and other major central banks.  These included forward guidance on the future path of the policy rate, quantitative easing through purchases of government securities and private assets including asset-backed securities, equities and real estate investment trusts (REITs), a more quantitative inflation objective, and funding for bank lending.\n\nFrom my perspective, Japan’s experience with forward guidance for the policy rate, asset purchases  and a more formal inflation goal are particularly instructive, as this helped inform the later use of such tools in the United States.\n\nIn early 1999, the Bank of Japan said it would maintain its zero interest rate policy until “deflationary concerns” were “dispelled.”   This commitment was lifted in August 2000, and the BoJ raised the policy rate by a quarter-point.   However, the BoJ was subsequently obliged to reverse course, and reintroduced forward guidance in March 2001.  This guidance was tied to the realization of a new inflation objective.\n\nWith deflation intensifying, the Bank of Japan embarked on a quantitative easing (QE) program in 2001 designed to increase the size of the monetary base.  The Bank of Japan engaged in purchases of JGBs that were large in scale, but confined to short-dated maturities.  This reflected a view that such purchases primarily acted through the liabilities side of the central bank's balance sheet—pushing up the amount of reserves in the banking system.  Because the growth of the monetary base was deemed the goal of policy, it was logical to purchase short-dated assets, which could be allowed to run off once a sustainable recovery was in place.\n\nThe downside of this approach was that the purchases did not change the composition of the private sector’s balance sheet very much because the policy essentially resulted in the exchange of one short-term risk-free asset for another.  As a consequence, the purchases had only modest direct effects on financial conditions. 4\n\nStarting in 2006, when the initial wave of QE ended, the BoJ began to formalize its inflation goal in numerical terms. This was initially expressed as an “understanding of medium- to long-term price stability” based on individual policymakers’ views. The inflation objective went through several iterations before being defined in 2012 as a Committee “goal” of a positive range of 2 percent or lower, with a lower interim goal of 1 percent.\n\nFollowing the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007-2008, Japan resumed QE, and gradually tightened the link between its policy actions and its objectives.  By January 2012, the BoJ had committed to keep rates at the zero bound and to continue purchasing assets until the 1 percent goal was “in sight.”\n\nSeveral prominent Japanese experts have argued that there was a “start-stop” aspect to monetary policy during the 1990s and 2000s with reversals in policy beginning before deflationary expectations were eliminated. 5 Fiscal policy also reversed abruptly on several occasions before economic recovery was firmly established.  While Japan did enjoy a period of respectable real per capita growth in the mid-2000s, escape from deflation proved elusive.\n\nMore than a decade after Japan’s bubble burst, the U.S. housing bubble burst.  This exposed extensive vulnerabilities in our financial system and triggered a global financial crisis. 6 Unlike Japan, we had the advantage of being able to learn from another nation’s recent experience.  We applied what we understood to be the lessons from Japan, though with hindsight, perhaps not in every respect as completely as we could have.\n\nIn particular, Japan’s experience reinforced the lessons of the Great Depression here in the U.S. and made us sensitive to the disinflationary force of an asset price bust and financial crisis. We recognized that we had to be very aggressive to prevent deflation and deflation expectations from becoming well entrenched.\n\nThe Federal Reserve reduced short-term interest rates to nearly zero by late 2008—a little over a year and a half after the initial shock hit in August 2007.   Immediately upon reaching the zero bound, we provided additional stimulus by expanding our balance sheet and deploying forward guidance on the policy rate. These actions, in the context of a strong commitment to both our inflation and employment mandates, succeeded in preventing deflation expectations from taking hold, even though real outcomes were disappointing.  We also took steps to formalize our 2 percent inflation objective. 7\n\nThe Fed’s large-scale asset purchase programs differed from those originally undertaken in Japan both in theory and in practice.  They were concentrated in longer-term securities—Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities.  This reflected a different perspective on how purchases affect financial conditions and the economy, as well as the different structure of our financial system.\n\nOur view is that asset purchases work primarily through the asset side of the balance sheet by transferring duration risk from the private sector to the central bank’s balance sheet.  This pushes down risk premia, and prompts private sector investors to move into riskier assets.  As a result, financial market conditions ease, supporting wealth and aggregate demand.  The fact that such purchases increase the amount of reserves in the banking system and the size of the monetary base is a byproduct—not the goal—of these actions.\n\nThe U.S. also moved relatively quickly to recapitalize core financial institutions—partly as a result of good judgment, but also because the intense pressures of a capital markets-based financial system forced us to confront these issues. The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in early 2009 identified and addressed the potential capital shortfalls of the major U.S. bank holding companies in a stressed scenario.  The SCAP forced the banks to recapitalize either through the use of private funds or the injection of government convertible preferred equity from the TARP program.\n\nHowever, our policy approach was far from perfect.  Comparing actual growth to the growth projections by FOMC participants in the Summary of Economic Projections shows that we were consistently too optimistic about growth over the 2009-2012 period.  As a result, with the benefit of hindsight, we did not provide enough stimulus.  Perhaps, if we had paid more attention to the persistent divergence between growth forecasts and outturns in Japan in the 1990s, we might have been more skeptical about the prospects for a strong economic recovery, even with a more aggressive monetary policy regime.\n\nAlso, we could have done better in communicating our intentions and goals.  We put too much emphasis, too early, on the exit.  At an earlier stage, we should have put greater emphasis on our commitment to use all our tools to the fullest extent possible for as long as needed to achieve our dual mandate objectives.\n\nOur policies also had a “start-stop” aspect to them that may have undercut their effectiveness.  For example, until September 2012, our large-scale asset programs generally specified the total size of the program, with a purchase rate and an expected ending date.  This created a void when the programs ended and made our policy response sporadic and hard to forecast.  This limited the scope for market prices to adjust in anticipation of our future actions in ways that would help stabilize the economy.\n\nAnother shortcoming was in our use of forward guidance with respect to the path of short-term interest rates.  Although calendar-based guidance worked reasonably well in influencing expectations about the future path of short-term rates and thus the shape of the yield curve, it was clumsy in a number of respects.  For example, if we moved the forward date guidance out in time, did this reflect a change in our reaction function, the amount of desired policy stimulus or greater pessimism about the outlook?\n\nOf course, as we have learned, we have acted to rectify these shortcomings.  For example, our asset purchases are now outcome based, tied to the goal of substantial improvement in the labor market outlook, and our forward guidance on short-term rates is tied to unemployment and inflation thresholds rather than to a calendar date.\n\nThe Japanese authorities have also capitalized on our joint experiences and actions.  Thus, we have witnessed a convergence in the monetary policy regimes of our two countries.\n\nToday, the two regimes are quite similar in three important respects.  Both the Fed and the Bank of Japan place considerable emphasis on an explicit inflation objective, commit the central bank to use all available tools to achieve its objectives, and use forward guidance on interest rates and large scale purchases of long duration assets as the main tools to achieve these objectives.\n\nAlthough there are still some important distinctions in how policy is conducted, much of these relate more to differences in legal frameworks and the current starting point for economic activity and inflation rather than fundamental differences in philosophy.  For example, the BoJ’s asset purchases are broader than the Fed’s, extending to equity ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) and REITs.  This option is not available to the Federal Reserve because the Federal Reserve Act sets tighter limits as to the types of assets that the Federal Reserve can purchase.\n\nSimilarly, current circumstances in the two countries are different, with deflationary expectations still in the process of being dislodged in Japan.  The BoJ needs to push up inflation expectations, whereas in the U.S. the current level of inflation expectations is consistent with the long-term objective of the Fed. Therefore, the BoJ, relative to the respective sizes of the two economies, has adopted a purchase program that is more aggressive that the U.S. program.  This is true whether measured in terms of the amount of duration being pulled out of the market or purchases as a share of total issuance.\n\nLessons learned\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, there have been at least six major areas where there has been significant learning, which has influenced the evolution of policy.  Let me turn to them.\n\nThe importance of managing expectations\n\nManaging expectations is always central to monetary policy.  However, at the zero bound this is even more critical than usual.\n\nThere are two aspects of this.   First, keeping inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with the central bank’s medium-term inflation objective—2 percent on the personal consumption expenditures deflator in our case—is vitally important. Once deflation expectations become well entrenched, it is very difficult to change them.  And, because inflationary expectations are an important driver of actual inflation outcomes, deflationary expectations can be self-fulfilling in driving actual deflation outcomes.  Also, if inflation expectations were allowed to fall, this would raise the level of expected real interest rates, making monetary policy less accommodative.\n\nConversely, a central bank does not want medium-term inflation expectations to climb above levels consistent with its inflation objective.  If inflation expectations were to become unanchored to the upside, that could damage credibility and result in higher risk premia for financial assets and tighter financial market conditions.  Thus, a policy that maintains medium-term inflation expectations in line with our inflation objective is most consistent with our mandate. 8\n\nSecond, at the zero bound, the ability to provide credible forward guidance—both in terms of the future path of the policy rate and the future path of the balance sheet— becomes the predominant vehicle by which a central bank’s actions affect financial market conditions.  If this expectations channel did not work, then it would be very difficult to provide additional monetary accommodation because short-term rates cannot be reduced materially.\n\nIn the U.S., in recent months we have communicated that short-term rates are likely to stay very low for a long time; our balance sheet is likely to increase further in size and then stay large for a long time; and that we will not be overly hasty in tightening monetary policy once the recovery gets well established.  By doing this, we are influencing expectations about the likely future path of short-term rates and the interest rate term premium.  By utilizing the expectations channel in this way, we have been able to make policy more accommodative and generate easier financial market conditions.\n\nGood communication is essential\n\nTo manage expectations well, both credibility and good communication is essential.  This means explaining clearly the policy framework, the relationship between the use of tools and the central bank’s mandated objectives at the zero bound, and how the use of these tools will evolve with changes in the outlook.\n\nIn this regard, a central bank’s credibility is crucial.  Only if a central bank does what it promises to do will expectations be solidly anchored.  Of course, this does not mean mechanically following a set policy trajectory regardless of how the outlook changes, but it does mean that the stance of policy over time must evolve in ways consistent with the criteria established in the guidance.\n\nIt is important to communicate how policy will respond to changing economic circumstances over time.  This is particularly important when the outlook changes, because expectations about how policy will respond can be an important self-stabilizing element of monetary policy.   In this regard, a framework that ties the use of policy tools explicitly to economic outcomes has many advantages.\n\nGood public communication is also important.   For example, press conferences offer an opportunity to ground the policy actions and stance in a framework that is explicit about how the central bank plans to achieve its mandated objectives.\n\nAsset purchases are an effective tool\n\nCredibility requires taking action in the present as well as providing guidance for the future, and we are fortunate to have learned that asset purchases can indeed be an effective tool to support growth, employment and inflation expectations at the zero bound. While I believe that managing expectations is crucial, I am somewhat skeptical of the view that forward guidance on the policy rate alone is sufficient in these circumstances.  This is particularly the case when guidance extends out several years in the future.  Promises about future actions may be seen as not fully credible given the potential for changes in a central bank’s leadership and policy committee and the degree of uncertainty about economic conditions that will prevail far out in the future.\n\nIn recent years, we have developed considerable positive experience providing accommodation through changes in the size and composition of the central bank balance sheet.  Taking interest rate risk and mortgage prepayment risk out of private hands has proven to be effective in easing financial conditions, increasing wealth and lowering private sector borrowing costs. 9 The impact of purchases may be attenuated to some degree by deleveraging and ongoing adjustments in markets such as real estate. But it is material even in these circumstances, and builds over time as these needed adjustments proceed.\n\nThe sum is greater than its parts\n\nAnother important insight is that each of the components of policy—the current stance in terms of the policy rate and the balance sheet, expectations about the future stance, the degree of commitment to future policy, and the clarity of communications—all interact.  Our tools are more powerful used in combination, and, when their use is explicitly tied to the outcomes we seek to achieve.  As a result, the sum is more powerful than the component parts.\n\nRisk management is particularly important\n\nRisk management is particularly important at the zero bound. At the zero lower bound, once you are caught in deflation, it is very hard to get out.  Thus, policymakers need to put considerable weight on this risk and conduct monetary policy with sufficient aggressiveness to ensure that they avoid such an outcome.\n\nIt is also true that we have less experience with the monetary policy tools used at the zero bound.  As a result, there is greater uncertainty around the efficacy and costs of these tools.   This pushes in the opposite direction of being more cautious.\n\nThis means that risk management is essential—what are the costs of being wrong in either direction?  Sometimes a cautious, incremental approach may not always be the right strategy.\n\nLimits to monetary policy\n\nAt the zero bound, monetary policy encounters additional constraints.  These fall into three broad buckets.\n\nFirst, there are costs associated with non-conventional tools.  This means they cannot simply be used without limit, though the appropriate limit will vary based on the outlook and balance of risks.   The most obvious example of this is our large-scale asset purchase program.  As the balance sheet increases in size, the potential costs increase in terms of market functioning, risks to financial stability, and the path of future remittances to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nSecond, there is a limit on how far the expectations channel can be exploited.  As I discussed earlier, since the current FOMC cannot bind future FOMCs and the economic outlook is highly uncertain, it isn’t reasonable to expect that policies that affect expectations many years in the future will have a powerful impact today.  I believe that the effectiveness of the expectations channel decays as the length of the horizon extends.\n\nThird, monetary policy is only one leg of the stool necessary to generate a vibrant and sustained economic expansion.  In particular, as noted earlier, the health of the financial system is critical.  For without it, the monetary transmission channels will be impaired and monetary policy will be less effective in influencing the cost and availability of credit. Similarly, it is critical that fiscal policy be set appropriately.  This means the short-term impulse needs to be properly calibrated to the current set of economic circumstances (not too much restraint) and the long-run budget trajectory needs to credible and consistent with fiscal sustainability.  Finally, removing structural impediments that hinder growth and economic rebalancing are also important.  In the case of the U.S., this could include changes in immigration policy, infrastructure investments that remove bottlenecks and job training programs that improve the quality of human capital.\n\nImplications for U.S. monetary policy\n\nUndoubtedly, we will continue to learn as we seek to implement monetary policy most effectively.\n\nLet me give a few examples of how my own thinking may evolve.  In terms of our asset purchase program, I believe we should be prepared to adjust the total amount of purchases to that needed to deliver a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook in the context of price stability.  In doing this, we might adjust the pace of purchases up or down as the labor market and inflation outlook changes in a material way. For me, the base case forecast is not the sole consideration—how confident we are about that outcome is also important.\n\nBecause the outlook is uncertain, I cannot be sure which way—up or down—the next change will be.  But at some point, I expect to see sufficient evidence to make me more confident about the prospect for substantial improvement in the labor market outlook. At that time, in my view, it will be appropriate to reduce the pace at which we are adding accommodation through asset purchases.  Over the coming months, how well the economy fights its way through the significant fiscal drag currently in force will be an important aspect of this judgment.\n\nWe are also learning about how best to prepare for the eventual normalization of monetary policy. For example, we may need to update our thinking with respect to the so-called exit principles that we published in June 2011 in order to bring them up to date with developments since then, and ensure they do not unnecessarily constrain our ability to conduct policy in the most effective way  today.\n\nThose exit principles stated that we would first stop reinvesting, then raise short-term interest rates, and finally sell agency mortgage backed securities over a three-to-five year period. This seems stale in several respects.  In particular, how does one time the end of reinvestment given that we now have economic thresholds that govern the timing of liftoff?  Also, the thresholds are thresholds, not triggers.  Thus it is hard to link the timing of the end of reinvestment to the unknown liftoff date for short-term rates.\n\nMore broadly, it may be desirable to update our thinking around the path and composition of the balance sheet over time, in light of our capacity to shape this path in a way that mitigates potential costs and risks. For example, the agency MBS portfolio is substantially larger today than it was when the original exit principles were devised. To the extent that the Committee wants to reduce the risk of disrupting market functioning during normalization, it could decide to indicate that it will avoid selling the MBS portfolio during the early stages of the normalization process.  Moreover, to the extent that the Committee wants to mitigate the risk of a sharp increase in long-term rates, it could judge that it would prefer not to commit to agency MBS sales. Expectations about future MBS sales or actual sales have the potential to generate or amplify such an upward spike in long-term rates.  If the Committee believes that it could be costly in terms of credibility to incur a period of no remittances to Treasury—a notion I am personally somewhat skeptical about—avoiding MBS sales would also reduce this risk.  Indeed, the Committee might conclude that it was better on all three counts to allow the agency MBS securities to run off passively over time. 10\n\nAn important challenge for us will be to think carefully about what combination of actions and communications will best ensure that when we do eventually judge that it is appropriate to begin normalizing policy, the initial tightening of financial market conditions is commensurate to what we desire. There is a risk is that market participants could overreact to any move in the process of normalization.  Indeed, there is some risk that market participants could overreact even before normalization begins, when the pace of purchases is adjusted but the level of accommodation is still increasing month by month. 11 Not only could such responses threaten financial stability, but also they might make it harder to calibrate monetary policy appropriately to the economic situation. We will need to think long and hard about how best to develop policy in a way that enables us to respond flexibly to a changing economic outlook, but in a way that is not disruptive to the economy. 12\n\nBased on what we have learned to date at the zero bound, I believe that it will be important for us to anchor all our communication around the core principle: The path of the policy rate and the size and composition of the balance sheet over time will be driven by our unbending commitment to our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.\n\nAs you can see, there will be much more to learn as we go.  Thank you for your kind attention.  I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 Krishna Guha, Paolo Pesenti, Simon Potter, Jamie McAndrews, Jonathan McCarthy, Lorie Logan, John Clark, Eben Lazarus and others on my staff helped with the preparation of these remarks.\n\n2 Actual overnight rates; the Bank of Japan did not publish its rate target until 1998.\n\n3 See “Preventing Deflation: Lessons from Japan’s Experience in the 1990s, ” Alan Ahearn, Joseph Gagnon, Jane Haltmaier, and Steve Kamin et. al., International Finance Discussion Papers, No 729, June 2002, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n4 However, research suggests that the purchases did reinforce the forward commitment.  See, for example, “Policy commitment and expectation formation: Japan’s experience under zero interest rates” Kunio Okina and Shigenori  Shiratsuka North American Journal of Economics and Finance, Vol 15, No 1, pp 75-100.\n\n5 See, for example, “Deleveraging and Monetary Policy: Japan Since the 1990s and the United States Since 2007”, Kazuo Ueda, Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol 26, No 3, Summer 2012, pp 177-202.\n\n6 Some commentators prefer the term “North Atlantic financial crisis” as the failure and near-failure of financial institutions was concentrated in the U.S. and Europe. However, the crisis was global in the sense that financial markets transmitted the shock throughout the world and this resulted in a severe global economic downturn.\n\n7 Committee members, through their submissions to the Summary of Economic Projections, had already indicated that their inflation objective was close to 2 percent as measured by the personal consumption expenditures deflator; in January 2012 the Committee formalized the inflation objective as a 2 percent “longer run goal” (see http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm).\n\n8 In addition to acting to manage inflation expectations, the central bank can also support expectations about the outlook for growth and job creation.  This can be implemented by making it clear that, subject to medium-term price stability, it will seek to stabilize the economy and has the means to do so even at the zero bound.\n\n9 With respect to borrowing costs, this is particularly true in real terms.\n\n10 This would also provide additional stimulus at the margin, since the degree of accommodation provided by our balance sheet holdings is related to how long the public expects us to hold the assets.\n\n11 The move to economic thresholds-based guidance for the federal funds rate should help in this regard. While the thresholds are certainly not triggers, they should help market participants adjust expectations about the likely timing of lift-off in a relatively continuous manner and guard against these expectations being pulled further forward in time than is warranted by changes in the economic outlook.\n\n12 Indeed, even when purchases of additional longer-term securities cease, the enlarged balance sheet will provide substantial ongoing stimulus. It is important to recognize that the Fed could remain in this posture with policy “on hold” for a significant period.",

    "text": "But before I begin, I would like to express my deepest sympathies and those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve to the people of Japan following the tragic events of the past month. We mourn your loss even as we admire the heroism of those who risked their lives to help others and the quiet fortitude with which so many of your citizens have borne their suffering and grief. We know that the character of the Japanese people will enable you to overcome the challenges before you, working together in common national purpose to rebuild and restore.\n\nOn the subject of my talk today, a stable and resilient financial system that allocates credit in an efficient manner underpins and supports economic growth and rising standards of living around the world. As we saw recently, however, a financial system that is prone to booms and crashes can not only lead to an inefficient allocation of real resources during the booms but can also have devastating consequences for global economic activity and employment during the crashes. In an integrated global economy, severe negative consequences can be felt far away from the center of the financial crisis—as they were in Asia in late 2008 and early 2009. This underscores our common interest in promoting financial stability on a global basis.\n\nTruly effective reform would generate sizable and widespread benefits. However, there are significant challenges to achieving this. One challenge arises from the fact that we have a global economy with many large, globally active financial firms, but our regulatory regimes are implemented at the national level. Another is that any attempt to improve regulatory standards will inevitably meet with resistance from parties that have a vested interest in the status quo.\n\nToday I will comment on the actions underway in the United States and internationally to make the financial system more resilient and robust. I will focus on the logic behind the reform efforts, progress to date, and areas where there still is considerable work to do. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve System, or my international supervisory colleagues with whom I work closely with on a regular basis.\n\nThe financial crisis exposed significant vulnerabilities in the financial system. Without revisiting all the causes and consequences of the credit boom and bust that led to a boom and bust in the U.S. housing market, the bottom line is that our regulatory system failed in two important dimensions. First, a significant number of large, internationally active financial firms reached the brink of failure. Second, the financial system was not very resilient when these firms got into difficulty. Instead, the threat of failure propagated further shocks that reverberated throughout the global financial system.\n\nThese two shortcomings reflect many factors including inadequate capital and liquidity buffers, poor incentives to correctly measure, price and manage risks ex ante, the opacity of firm balance sheet and counterparty exposures, and the manner in which large financial firms were interconnected within the financial system. In the end, there was too much leverage in which large amounts of highly illiquid, long-term assets were financed by short-term liabilities. The fact that a large amount of the wholesale funding used to finance these assets was provided by leveraged financial intermediaries to other financial intermediaries increased the system's vulnerability to adverse shocks. As it turned out, the amount and quality of capital was grossly inadequate relative to the quality of the assets and off-balance-sheet exposures of many of the major global banking institutions. Moreover, many institutions had inadequate liquidity buffers. The lack of liquidity forced the fire sale of assets, which depressed prices and increased the pressure on capital.\n\nWhen troubled institutions did fail, this exacerbated the pressure on the remaining institutions. Aggravated by the lack of transparency about their counterparty exposures and the contingent liabilities they faced, the problems of a single institution quickly became the problems of many. This was fueled in part by concern that the counterparty claims on failed institutions would be frozen and unable to be realized quickly.\n\nNot only did some core firms have inadequate capital and liquidity, they also faced conflicting incentives as to how to manage their capital resources. For example, many firms that came under stress were slow to cut their dividends or to raise new capital because of fears that such actions would signal their underlying weakness. Obviously, the failure to conserve capital made these institutions weaker rather than stronger.\n\nThe crisis also underscored severe deficiencies in the international dimension of the regulatory environment. Financial institutions, flows and activities are global, but the vast majority of regulation and information sharing is contained within national boundaries. Where resolution regimes existed, they generally existed only for banking entities and were not set up to handle the orderly resolution of a large internationally active bank holding company or non-bank financial firm. This cross-border problem persists to this day.\n\nThe interconnectedness of the financial system also caused shocks to spread quickly. For example, the failure of Lehman Brothers led to losses at the Reserve Fund, which precipitated a widespread money market mutual fund panic. It also led to actions by U.K. bankruptcy authorities that had the effect of freezing the assets owned by hedge fund and other clients of the firm and this encouraged such investors to pull assets from other institutions perceived to be weak. These and other propagation channels in turn, led to virtual stoppage of lending and borrowing activity in the money markets and, ultimately, a credit crunch that reverberated throughout the global financial system. For example, the crisis led to a sharp constraint on the availability of trade credit in the fall of 2008 that had a devastating impact on economic activity in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, as well as Japan. This region felt the full economic consequences of the crisis even though banks in the region were generally healthy and far from the U.S. housing boom and bust and the subprime mortgage debacle that could be viewed as the initial spark that ignited the crisis.\n\nSo what steps have been taken to address some of these sources of vulnerability? There are literally dozens of initiatives underway nationally and globally, not only in traditional bodies for such cooperation such as the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision, but also among newer international groups such as the Financial Stability Board. Most of these initiatives can be grouped into three major categories:\n\nTurning to the first set of initiatives designed to reduce the probability of failure of large, systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), the tougher capital and liquidity regimes that the Basel Committee has devised are probably the most important elements. On the capital side, Basel III significantly increases requirements with respect to both the quantity and quality of capital. On the quantity side, there have been two important changes. First, the capital requirements have been raised so that internationally active banks must have common equity ratios of at least 7 percent of risk-weighted assets when the standards are fully phased in by 2019. This 7 percent standard consists of a 4.5 percent minimum plus a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer. Banks whose capital ratios fall into the buffer range will face increasingly stringent restrictions on capital distributions such as dividends and share repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to staff. This should act as a form of \"automatic stabilizer\" to their capital resources and change the incentives banks face during periods of stress. Second, for many globally active banks, the amount of capital required will also rise because the amount of risk-weighted assets against which the capital ratios are calculated will increase. Explicit capital requirements for operational risk and counterparty credit risk, as well as increased requirements for certain trading activity and transactions between financial institutions should result in a significant rise in risk-weighted assets.\n\nOn the quality side, capital requirements have been toughened by narrowing the definition of what can be counted toward common equity capital for regulatory capital purposes. The emphasis has been put on common equity because of the superior loss-absorbing capacity of this type of capital on a going concern basis. Tighter limits have been put on certain types of assets—such as mortgage servicing rights and tax-deferred assets—in which the values depend on a firm remaining viable, and that might not be easy to realize in the midst of a financial crisis.\n\nOn the liquidity regime side, several major initiatives are underway. The Basel Committee has proposed a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement for globally active banks. In essence, this standard would require that large, internationally active banks hold sufficient short-term, liquid assets so that a bank could fund its operations for at least 30 days, without needing to borrow funds from the central bank. By creating a pool of liquid assets that the bank could sell or allow to mature, the liquidity buffer would buy time for the bank to explore options to restore market confidence. Such steps might include selling businesses and other asset dispositions, raising additional capital, or by making changes in senior management. The LCR requirement is being carefully evaluated to ensure that there will be no deleterious, unintended consequences when it becomes effective.\n\nAlso, apart from the Basel initiative, supervisors are placing greater emphasis on liquidity. For example, in the United States, supervisors have emphasized the importance of adequate liquidity buffers and many banks have been pushed to bolster their liquidity resources through the supervisory process.\n\nTogether, this emphasis on a greater quantity and higher quality of capital and larger liquidity buffers should make banks individually, and the banking system as a whole, more resilient to adverse shocks. The goal is to enable banks to retain market access to capital and funding even when large losses occur or the banks are subject to other adverse shocks. The ability to retain access should enable banks to manage through their problems, avoiding the types of liquidity runs that led to the forced unwinding of positions and that pushed what might have been solvent institutions over the edge into insolvency.\n\nIn addition to the Basel III standards for capital and liquidity, an international effort is underway to further reduce the probability of failure for systemically important financial institutions or SIFIs. The basic logic behind this effort is that the failure of a larger, more complex firm can have disproportionately large negative systemic consequences. As a result, such firms should be forced to hold additional capital in order to reduce their probability of failure below that of smaller firms. An additional capital requirement on such SIFIs would also help to level the playing field between larger and smaller firms by offsetting the funding advantage that accrues to the largest firms that stems from the perception that they are \"too big to fail.\" Although there are potentially other options, I believe that a SIFI surcharge could best be satisfied by requiring SIFIs to hold additional common equity above and beyond the Basel 7 percent Tier I common standard.\n\nThe move toward a tougher capital and liquidity regime undoubtedly receives the greatest attention in terms of the measures being implemented to make large banks safer. However, there also are a number of other important changes being made to supervisory practices in the United States and elsewhere. One noteworthy example is the more widespread use of horizontal stress tests to ensure that banks have adequate capital. This is a very important development, because it makes the evaluation of capital more forward-looking. The issue is not just how much regulatory capital a bank has currently but how that bank’s capital level is likely to evolve over time in adverse economic circumstances.\n\nIn the United States, another important change is that we are refocusing our supervisory practices to identify structural weaknesses and to push firm managements to remedy their shortcomings relative to \"best practice\" standards. Horizontal reviews across the large banks are being undertaken to identify firm-specific deficiencies. At the Federal Reserve, we are placing greater emphasis on understanding banking organizations' business models and strategies—in other words, better understanding the specific markets and activities from which the banking organizations make money over time and the nature of the risks they take in this process. Strong risk management practices within organizations are particularly important, as risk managers must be empowered to stand up to those in the front office and prevent activities and practices that create risks or incentives that are incompatible with bank safety and soundness. Compensation practices are being reviewed to ensure that the incentives created by the compensation regime are consistent with a banking organization remaining in sound financial condition.\n\nAnother key supervisory innovation has been the more extensive supervisory engagement on the processes that banking organizations use to assess and plan for their capital needs. Recently, the Federal Reserve completed a Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) program for the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies. The purpose of the CCAR process was to assess the way these institutions allocate capital over time against the risks they run, including how robust that allocation is to changes in the economic and financial environment. As part of this exercise, banking organizations had to show how their capital would hold up under a stress environment specified by the Federal Reserve, as well as how they expected their activities and capital positions to be affected by changes such as Basel III. The CCAR built on lessons learned during the crisis about the importance of taking a forward-looking and comprehensive approach to assessing capital adequacy, including an assessment of the level and composition of a bank holding company's capital resources under stressed economic and financial market conditions.\n\nThis exercise received considerable attention because an assessment of bank holding companies’ plans for increasing dividend payments and implementing stock buyback plans were an important part of the review. However, the CCAR's focus was much broader than simply assessing proposed capital distributions. Instead, the goal of the CCAR was to help ensure that large bank holding companies have strong, firmwide risk measurement and management processes to support their internal assessments of capital adequacy and that their capital resources are sufficient given their business activities and the resulting risk exposures.\n\nThe second important strand of reform is to ensure that regulatory oversight is sufficiently broad to include the activities of the so-called shadow banking system. This aspect of reform and oversight is still in its early days. But work is underway. For example, the Financial Stability Board is undertaking work to identify potential sources of vulnerability caused by the activities in the shadow banking system and how such vulnerabilities could be addressed. Also, in the United States, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) views its mandate broadly with respect to identifying systemic risks and proposing remedies. For example, on an ongoing basis, the FSOC will monitor and assess which non-bank financial intermediaries in the United States are systemically important and, thus, require greater regulatory oversight.\n\nBut the focus will not just be on large financial firms. Activities and practices that occur outside of the core institutions are also important. For example, the activities of money market mutual funds is one area receiving close scrutiny. As you know, a run on the money market funds developed in the fall of 2008 when the Reserve Fund broke the buck when Lehman Brothers failed. This underscored a critical structural weakness of money market mutual funds created by the convention that the net stable asset value could be fixed at par. When a money market mutual fund incurs losses that cause it to \"break the buck,\" this encourages investors to rush to withdraw their funds from other funds before they break the buck. The result can be a run on money market mutual fund assets. In the United States, the Securities Exchange Commission has already tightened the rules with respect to liquidity, quality and the average maturity of so-called 2a-7 fund assets, but there is still more to be done to address the remaining vulnerabilities.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the final major strand of regulatory reform is to strengthen the core of the financial system and make the system as a whole robust to the failure of a large bank or non-bank financial institution. In this realm, there are several notable initiatives.\n\nFirst, an effort is underway to create robust resolution regimes that allow large systemically important financial institutions to be wound down smoothly in a way that minimizes contagion and the risk of a broader panic or that causes damage to other parts of the financial system. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act gives enhanced resolution powers to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to use to wind down large, complex non-bank financial institutions. If such a firm becomes troubled, the regulators, with concurrence from the U.S. Treasury, can avert a bankruptcy filing and instead put the non-bank financial company into resolution. As part of such a resolution process, regulators are working to ensure that systemically important firms have viable recovery plans and that such firms have \"living wills\" that can help guide how such firms can be managed through a resolution situation.\n\nSecond, to reduce the likelihood of disruptive and highly costly failures, regulators around the world are evaluating whether bail-in forms of capital might be used to help recapitalize firms when they would otherwise lose their viability, or, alternatively, to help facilitate the orderly wind-down of a firm. Bail-in capital might consist of a well-identified tranche of debt that would convert to equity only if and when a particular set of trigger conditions were met. Such triggers might include breaching a certain level of regulatory capital and/or a regulatory determination that without conversion the firm would no longer be viable. One considerable challenge is how to define a set of triggers in a way that is sufficiently transparent and objective so that the bail-in process does not act as a catalyst and precipitate a run on other firms that might appear to have similar characteristics. In principle, however, by helping to recapitalize the firm, bail-in capital could help to forestall the need for a forced, rapid liquidation of assets and this might help to facilitate the orderly wind-down of a large, global firm that otherwise could not otherwise be easily resolved.\n\nThird, efforts are underway to reduce counterparty risk exposures by requiring that over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, and equity and commodity derivative trades be standardized where feasible—and that all standardized trades be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). Standardized clearing through CCPs reduces the complex web of counterparty exposures that exist in the bilateral world of OTC derivatives. Everyone that centrally clears becomes the counterparty to the CCP. This enables a high level of gross bilateral exposures to be netted down to a much more manageable set of net exposures to the CCP.\n\nFourth, recognizing that mandated central clearing will only reduce risk if the CCPs themselves are robust, efforts are underway to strengthen financial market infrastructures. In the United States, for example, the Dodd-Frank Act instructs the Financial Stability Oversight Council to designate certain financial market utilities (FMUs) as systemically important. Such FMUs would be subject to a tougher regulatory oversight regime. On a parallel track, at the international level, the Committee for Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) are revising and strengthening a set of regulatory oversight principles and minimum business standards for financial market infrastructures (FMIs). These principles include numerous standards with respect to governance, access, risk management practices, and capital and liquidity standards. As Chair of the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems and someone deeply involved in the CPSS-IOSCO work, I believe that adoption of an agreed-upon global set of minimum standards for FMIs is essential if we are to have a safe global financial system.\n\nRecently, CPSS-IOSCO issued a revised set of such principles for consultation. Responses to the proposed principles are due back by late July. The CPSS-IOSCO plans to publish a final set of standards early next year. I hope and anticipate that countries will adopt these principles as the minimum regulatory standards for the systemically important FMIs that operate in their jurisdictions.\n\nIn summary, considerable effort is underway to enhance financial stability.\n\nThat said, I think it is important to recognize some of the important challenges in designing and implementing effective reform. Four broad challenges immediately come to mind. First, the resolution of large financial firms that operate in multiple jurisdictions remains largely out of reach—at least in the near- to medium-term. This is due to the fact that legal rules are not harmonized across the different regulatory regimes with respect to bankruptcy and liquidation. For example, although the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a resolution regime for the U.S. operations of a large global financial firm domiciled in the United States, this resolution framework stops at the nation's borders. Supervisors from different nations are working together in an effort to create more effective cross-border crisis management tools and resolution regimes, but this work is still in its very early stages and there are formidable obstacles to overcome.\n\nA second challenge is the uneven progress that has been made in reforming bank regulation and supervision across the different jurisdictions. For example, in some cases, the supervisory authorities have been quite forceful in making banks domiciled in their countries raise capital. In other cases, the response has been less aggressive. The uneven progress of reform makes comprehensive reform more difficult. It shifts the tenor of the discussion away from what is the proper macroprudential framework and set of capital and liquidity requirements to one that focuses too much on issues of relative competitiveness. Too often the questions asked are: What is most beneficial to the banks of my particular country? Do the regulations bolster or harm my \"national champion\"? The focus shifts away from the goal of bolstering global financial stability to finding ways of tilting or adjusting the new standards to achieve a national competitive advantage.\n\nThis is in not in anyone's interest. As discussed earlier, every nation has an interest in promoting financial stability globally, since the effects of systemic financial stress in one place can swiftly spread throughout the global economy. Moreover, although a relatively loose regulatory regime may attract business from other financial centers, there is no free lunch here. A more lax regulatory regime is likely to expose that country’s taxpayers to huge tail risks.\n\nA third challenge is the sequencing of reforms. For example, many jurisdictions are focusing on banking reforms, but have not yet applied the same intensity to shadow banking activities. If regulatory requirements for banks are increased significantly, the risk of stimulating the growth of the non-regulated shadow banking sector also increases. This suggests that the regulatory oversight effort has to be broadly applied so we just don’t trade one problem—for example, undercapitalized large banks—for another—a shrunken regulated banking sector and an enlarged, unregulated non-banking sector.\n\nSo what needs to be done? In short, plenty. Although we have made some progress in making the global financial system safer and more secure, there is much more to do. Several examples illustrate the range of issues that are still outstanding.\n\nFirst, we do need to adopt an additional capital requirement on large global systemically important financial institutions. We need this to reduce the risk of failure of such institutions to very low levels because we do not yet have the tools in place to resolve these institutions on a cross-border basis in a non-disruptive manner. We also need to do this because such institutions—by being perceived to be too big to fail—obtain a funding advantage, which higher capital charges can help offset. Without such a requirement, large banks can gain a competitive advantage just through their size.\n\nSecond, as discussed earlier, we have much more to do to ensure that we have a relatively level playing field. We need that to discourage regulatory arbitrage and beggar-thy-neighbor policies that might benefit narrow national constituencies at the expense of global financial stability.\n\nThird, we need closer cooperation among regulators. While regulators have successfully worked toward a much tougher regulatory regime for capital and liquidity, there are still huge opportunities for further progress. For example, regulators need to adopt more far-reaching protocols that allow for greater sharing of supervisory information on a cross-border basis to facilitate more effective supervision. But, this needs to be done carefully, so that proprietary business information is protected. Currently, regulators generally do not have access to the necessary information to fully assess the condition of foreign banks that operate within their borders. They have supervisory information about the activities and state of condition of the foreign bank branches and subsidiaries within their borders, but do not always have good access to information about the parent company or what the banking entity looks like on a consolidated basis. This has long been a difficult issue, though efforts are underway to find ways to enhance information-sharing.\n\nSimilarly, protocols need to be developed to share regulatory information about systemically important financial market infrastructures that operate on a cross-border basis. Access to the trade records of OTC derivatives activity that will be recorded in trade repositories also needs to be made available to be shared among regulators.\n\nFourth, we need greater clarity concerning the responsibilities of the home versus the host country, especially when a bank encounters problems.\n\nFifth, we need to work out how emergency liquidity should be provided on a cross-border basis. If a major financial market utility in London, for example, needs dollar liquidity to stay in operation, who will provide in it? Who will bear the risk and on what terms and conditions?\n\nThe political unrest in the Middle East and North Africa underscores once again the fact that we operate in a shared world economy in which events in one country and region can have large impacts globally. And to support this globalized economy, global financial firms and a global payments and settlement infrastructure are needed to support this activity. Yet, we currently operate with a financial system that is largely regulated on a country-by-country basis.\n\nThis is not tenable. What’s required is not some global authority dictating what national authorities can do but instead greater cooperation and trust in exchanging information and agreement on harmonized standards such as those laid out in the Basel III capital requirements and the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. There needs to be a good faith commitment to try to achieve a level playing field. The regulations and supervisory practices that are put in place should be determined by what is good for the public good writ large, rather than what benefits some narrow set of private financial institutions or markets.\n\nFinally, we need to be persistent. There is much work that still lies ahead. As the crisis recedes in memory, the natural reflex will be to relax and grow complacent. Already, some bankers are arguing that it is time to get back to \"business as usual.\" We have seen that \"business as usual\" results in unacceptable outcomes. So we need to keep working on a continual basis to make the global financial system more resilient and robust. We will not be able to avert all future failures or crises, but I know we can do much better in limiting the frequency, severity and the breadth of their impact when they occur if we keep pushing forward.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.",

    "text": "Each visit to this area gives me a chance to deepen the Bank's relationship with the people whom I represent as head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Last summer I travelled through central and western New York and met with community leaders, business people, academics, bankers and government officials.\n\nOn this visit I will also meet with a wide range of people to talk about what we do and to hear first-hand the economic and financial issues important to you in the Hudson Valley so that I can best represent all my constituents in my work at the Fed. I also look forward to walking across that magnificent old railroad bridge, the Walkway Over the Hudson, for the spectacular view that I’m told awaits me.\n\nI thank the Dutchess County Regional Chamber of Commerce Center for inviting me to speak here in Fishkill today. This morning I will talk about economic conditions in the nation and the region, paying particular attention to how the recession has affected the labor market here. As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (that is, the committee that sets interest rates—also known by its initials as the FOMC).\n\nIntroduction to the New York Fed By way of introduction, let me start with a synopsis of what the New York Fed is, what we do, and what makes my job so interesting.\n\nThe New York Fed is part of the Federal Reserve System, America's central bank, which was created by Congress in 1913. With this act, Congress delegated to the Fed System its constitutional authority to manage the supply of money in the nation's economy.\n\nThe Fed System is comprised of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.—a federal agency currently led by Chairman Ben Bernanke—plus 12 regional Reserve Banks that span the country. For example, the district overseen by the New York Fed includes all of New York, the 12 northern counties of New Jersey; Fairfield County, Connecticut; Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nEach Reserve Bank is distinct, with its own charter and a board of directors drawn from its district, but overseen by the Board of Governors. The law that created the Federal Reserve made the central bank independent so that policymakers could make decisions about monetary policy—such as whether to adjust interest rates—in the national interest, somewhat insulated from political pressure. However, the Fed is accountable to Congress.\n\nCongress has set an explicit objective for monetary policy: To pursue the highest level of employment consistent with price stability. This objective is often referred to as our \"dual mandate,\" because it combines two goals: high employment, and low and stable inflation. In order to promote these objectives, we also pay close attention to financial stability, because without financial stability, it is very hard to achieve our goals for jobs and inflation.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee consists of the Board of Governors plus the presidents of each of the 12 district Banks. It meets in Washington, D.C., eight times per year to deliberate and vote on monetary policy, that is—should we change interest rates and, if so, how much. As the current New York Fed president, I am vice chairman at these meetings. At these meetings, each committee member presents his or her current outlook for the economy. For these assessments, we augment input from our research departments with critical information about local economic conditions supplied by our boards of directors, regional advisory councils and conversations with local stakeholders. My visit to Fishkill today is a part of these regional activities in which I learn first-hand about the economic and financial conditions important to you.\n\nOne thing that makes my job even more interesting is that New York has some roles unique within the Fed. For example, the New York Fed is the Reserve Bank charged with implementing monetary policy. This means that at the direction of the FOMC, we buy and sell Treasury securities in order to adjust short-term interest rates. We are also the eyes and ears of the Fed on Wall Street, and we supervise many of the largest financial institutions in the country. We operate Fedwire®—the conduit for large money transfers between banks. And, we provide banking services to the U.S. Treasury, and central banks and governments from around the world.\n\nAt the regional level, we continually track economic conditions in our District with the help of a number of tools that we have created for this purpose. For example, to fill a void in current measures of economic output, my staff produces indexes of economic activity which approximate output for New York State and New York City on a monthly basis. We also have initiated a consumer credit panel so that we can monitor local credit conditions. And, we have begun a quarterly survey of small business finances to track the issues related to credit and financing for this key job-generating sector. If you are not already part of the survey, I invite you to give your business card to my staff and we will add you to our survey universe, so that it can reflect your views, too.\n\nTo share the information that we gather and produce about our diverse district, we have created a rich website with very localized current data and maps on conditions in the region. I invite you to visit us on the web to explore the highly detailed information on small business, credit and housing conditions that we provide.\n\nFinally, and crucially, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, we are working with our colleagues in Washington and at other agencies in the United States and abroad to help put the nation’s financial system on a firmer footing. As regulators, we have made progress, for instance, in crafting tougher capital rules for the biggest banks, but much remains to be completed and we are determined to keep at it. I recognize fully that there can be no return to pre-crisis business as usual—whether on the part of the financial sector or on the part of regulators like ourselves. We must learn from the economic catastrophe of the past few years so that the financial system is able to perform its essential role in supporting economic activity without being a source of instability for the economy as a whole.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot to keep my colleagues and me quite busy—even in normal times.\n\nNational Economic Conditions Now, what is the outlook for and risks to economic activity, employment and inflation in the nation?\n\nSince the recession ended in 2009, the economy has grown at a relatively modest pace. Economic growth in the first quarter of 2011 was somewhat softer than anticipated, with the advanced reading of real gross domestic product (GDP)—that’s the economic output of the economy—increasing at only a 1.8 percent annual rate. A number of factors contributed to the slowdown. Construction activity fell—likely reflecting the continued large supply of unsold homes—and government expenditures at the federal, state and local levels declined.\n\nIn addition, real consumption growth (that is, spending on goods and services adjusted for price increases) in the first quarter was slower than in the last quarter of 2010. This occurred, in part, because of the rise in gasoline and food prices that pushed up consumer price inflation last quarter and reduced the amount of income available for other household purchases, a pattern that continued to be evident in retail sales for April. High energy prices have contributed to weaker consumer confidence, which also may have negatively affected consumer spending.\n\nHowever, the weakness of real output growth in the first quarter probably will prove temporary. Although manufacturing production fell in April, largely because of supply disruptions associated with the earthquake in Japan, business survey indicators, including the New York Fed’s own Empire State Manufacturing Survey, generally continue to signal growth, suggesting that production should soon return to more robust growth. And financial conditions have continued to improve, albeit gradually. The temporary reduction in payroll taxes and other fiscal measures also are providing support to demand. In addition, demand abroad—particularly in Asia—remains robust, supporting our exports.\n\nMost importantly, the labor market has shown further improvement, as demonstrated by the latest employment report. Although payroll job growth has been subdued during most of this recovery, the latest figures show the economy added 244,000 jobs in April—and an average of 233,000 over the past three months. While the unemployment rate—which is based on a different survey—ticked higher last month to 9 percent it is nonetheless 0.8 percentage points lower than it was in November, a relatively rapid decline by historic standards. Private-sector job growth has been strong enough to more than offset government layoffs, particularly at the state and local levels.\n\nA particularly encouraging sign is the rapid growth of manufacturing jobs over the past year and the recent broadening strength in services employment. While the exact pace of a jobs market recovery is always hard to predict, we were expecting the rate of job growth to pick up over the first half, and I am hopeful that job growth will continue to strengthen in the coming months. We would welcome this. However, even if the economy added 300,000 jobs per month from now on, we would likely still have considerable labor market slack at the end of 2012.\n\nDespite these clearly encouraging signs, there are still some downside risks to the growth outlook that bear watching. Let me list them for you:\n\nAlthough these issues bear watching, they remain risks rather than likely outcomes.\n\nIn regard to inflation, after a period in which inflation was below the levels the Fed judges to be most consistent with its statutory objectives, on a year-over-year basis, headline CPI (consumer price index) has increased more than 3 percent, which is somewhat above this desired level. The rise in commodity prices over the past year probably will push up headline inflation further in the next few months. It is noteworthy, however, that even with the sharp rise in oil and food prices over the past year (and notwithstanding the more recent drops), there has been limited pass-through into the prices of other goods and services. In fact, most measures of underlying inflation trends—such as core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy prices)—remain below levels consistent with our mandate for price stability.\n\nGoing forward, futures markets do not signal that investors expect rapid ongoing increases in commodity prices from current levels. Provided these prices stabilize (or indeed retreat further), I would expect headline inflation to move back to a more mandate-consistent rate. While this process plays out, however, it is critical that we ensure that inflation expectations do not become unmoored. It is much harder to keep inflation in check if people begin to raise their expectations of inflation. At this point, measures of inflation expectations overall remain stable.\n\nEconomists at the New York Fed have examined inflation expectations using a unique survey that we sponsor. As reported in a recent post on our new Liberty Street Economics blog, they find no evidence to suggest that a wage-price inflation spiral is getting underway. However, we will continue to monitor expectations for medium-term inflation very closely.\n\nTo sum up, economic conditions have improved in the past year. Yet, the recovery remains moderate and we still have a considerable way to go to meet the Fed’s dual mandate of full employment and price stability.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions So, how is our region doing? As some of you may know, the New York Fed produces Indexes of Coincident Economic Indicators to help monitor the performance of the region. Based on these measures, the downturn in economic activity in New York ended in November of 2009, and since then activity in New York State and New York City has been recovering steadily at a moderate pace.\n\nRegional Employment Trends Let me turn specifically to employment trends in the region. In particular, I want to describe our region’s experience during the recession and recovery.\n\nNationally, the Great Recession, which began in December 2007, has been the deepest economic downturn since World War II. When employment finally bottomed out in February 2010—about seven months after the official end of the recession—the country had lost almost 6.5 percent of its jobs and the unemployment rate had more than doubled. Many people lost their jobs or saw their hours or income cut, and the duration of unemployment for jobless workers reached a historical high. For many families, this distress was compounded by losses of wealth from declining home prices. Since that low point of employment, job creation has resumed, albeit at a slower pace than we would like, and unemployment has retreated by a percentage point. As in other parts of the country, employment in our region declined substantially during the recession. But, the various parts of our region had very different experiences.\n\nEmployment in much of New York State, including the Hudson Valley, declined less severely than the nation. Both the state and city lost about 3.8 percent of their jobs. Part of the reason for the more moderate decline in jobs in New York during the recession was a less pronounced boom-bust housing cycle. Indeed, as a percentage, the city and state lost fewer jobs during this recession than they did during either of the last two downturns.\n\nNow, as in the nation, a labor market recovery has begun across much of the region. Over the past year, New York State has added roughly 100,000 private-sector jobs. Within the state, the recovery has been somewhat uneven. New York City has been gaining jobs for more than a year now—at roughly the same pace as the nation, while to date, the Hudson Valley has seen little overall job growth.\n\nConditions in the Hudson Valley Continuing to drill down geographically, let me talk in more detail about conditions here the mid-Hudson Valley. I am referring to Dutchess and Orange counties, which comprise the Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown metropolitan area, which includes Fishkill; and Ulster County—which is also the Kingston metropolitan area.\n\nFirst, what does the mid-Hudson Valley region look like from an economic standpoint? There is a lot of economic activity here. All told, about 850,000 people live here and 420,000 jobs are located here. And, over the past decade, all three counties added people more rapidly than the state. People here are, on average, more highly educated than in the nation as a whole, as measured by the over 30 percent of residents who have college degrees. So, it is not surprising that median household income in all three counties is above the national median.\n\nThe industrial composition varies by county.\n\nNow, how has the area fared during the recent recession and recovery? I will address this from three perspectives: housing, credit conditions and jobs.\n\nUnlike central and western New York, this region experienced a modest boom and bust housing cycle. During the boom period from 2000 to 2006, home prices more than doubled in the Poughkeepsie area and increased by 150 percent around Kingston—exceeding the U.S. rise of roughly 90 percent and the average rise of roughly 50 percent that prevailed in our region. The price declines in the bust period, from 2007 to 2009, were somewhat less severe than the nation, falling by roughly 20 percent in both areas, compared with 30 percent nationally. Recently—and this is a hopeful sign—home prices in both areas have steadied.\n\nNext, how are families in the Hudson Valley doing in restoring their finances? During the recession, all across the nation, debt delinquencies soared and many families found that they needed to reduce their debt to a sustainable level. We keep track of the credit conditions in the Second District—including the average debt that people in area carry and whether they are current with their payments—using the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Consumer Credit Panel. In the Hudson Valley, debt per person with a credit report is now down by 5 percent from its peak level in 2008. As of the first quarter of this year, debt was continuing to fall modestly. At the same time, delinquency rates continue to rise. The proportion of debt that is at least 90 days delinquent has risen from 2 percent in 2005—which was low for New York—to 9 percent currently, matching the delinquency rate statewide. These patterns suggest that households in the area are making progress on restoring their balance sheets, but they may not have completed the process.\n\nWith regard to jobs, employment losses in the area during the 2008-09 downturn were steeper than in most of New York State, although less severe than for the Unites States as a whole. As of the first quarter of 2011, the Hudson Valley had yet to see a clear upturn in employment. The private sector has actually seen brisk job gains in the leisure and hospitality sector, and the professional and business service sector added jobs in the Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown metro area. And private-sector employment has held steady in the Kingston area over the past year. Both areas, however, have seen continuing job losses in retail trade and, especially, government employment. State and local government employment has declined by about 3.5 percent in the past year and has weighed down overall job growth in both areas.\n\nUnemployment rates in the mid-Hudson valley peaked at 8.4 percent in late 2009—well below the national peak of 10 percent and moderately below the state-wide peak of 8.9 percent. Nevertheless, as in much of the region and the nation, jobless rates have not retreated much thus far and remain stubbornly high.\n\nThus, the area was severely affected by the recession, but somewhat less so than the rest of the country. The recovery has begun, but some signs of distress remain in housing, credit and labor markets.\n\nIn the near-term, the regional economy, and indeed the economy of the entire state, faces a number of challenges. Among them is the need to address the large state budget gap. New York is not alone in having seen its tax revenue decline as the economy weakened and, thus, facing hard choices. As I mentioned, state and local government employment has already weakened in many areas. Going forward, further contraction in this sector continues to pose some risks to the recovery.\n\nLonger term, one of the key challenges for this region is to ensure that it trains and attracts a highly skilled workforce that can meet the needs of innovative and rapidly changing firms. A region's human capital—that is, the skills and education of its work force—determines a large part of its economic success and resiliency.\n\nConclusion To sum up, the national economy experienced a soft patch in activity during the first quarter of 2011, while the recovery in much of the region continued at a good pace.\n\nIn the region, the continued expansion of employment across the nation should help increase economic activity and employment in the Hudson Valley. Yet, as elsewhere, state and local government will likely be a drag for some time.\n\nAnd, both nationally and regionally, unemployment remains unacceptably high.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I will now be happy to answer some questions.",

    "text": "Good morning. I am Bill Dudley, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I would like to welcome you to today's conference titled \"Distressed Residential Real Estate: Dimensions, Impacts, and Remedies,\" which we are co-sponsoring with the Rockefeller Institute of Government.\n\nIn addition to my role at this institution, I serve as vice chair of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is charged with conducting the monetary policy for the United States. As I am sure you are aware, the FOMC has taken some extraordinary measures over the past few years to ease financial conditions and thereby improve the pace of economic recovery. While those measures have certainly helped to make the economy stronger than it otherwise would have been, nonetheless, the pace of the recovery to date has been disappointing. Over the three year period from mid-2009 to mid-2012, the real output of the U.S. economy has grown at a compound annual rate of just over 2 percent. As a result, employment gains have been modest, only matching the growth in the population, and the unemployment rate remains unacceptably high.\n\nWhile there are several headwinds that have been restraining economic growth, a key impediment is that the housing market has failed to respond fully to the significant easing of monetary policy. Now it is true that various housing market indicators have looked somewhat better of late. Housing starts and sales of new and existing single-family homes are trending up gradually. Nationally, home prices have stabilized and begun to rise modestly after falling roughly 30 percent from their 2006 peak. However, the absolute level of starts and sales remain quite low, particularly when viewed on a per capita basis. Moreover, housing market conditions still vary significantly across the country, with the worst performing counties still experiencing high volumes of distressed sales and annual house price declines of around 5 percent. The net result is that while housing’s contribution to growth has finally turned positive, its magnitude is far below that experienced in previous recoveries.\n\nThere are several factors behind the relative sluggishness of housing market activity. Although mortgage credit availability is slowly improving, it remains impaired, especially for households with less-than-sterling credit histories. Moreover, we are still dealing with the legacy of the housing boom and bust. According to CoreLogic, more than one out of four homeowners with a mortgage are \"underwater,\" making it difficult for the borrowers to either refinance or sell. In addition, as the conference speakers who follow me will make clear, there continue to be large volumes of properties for which the homeowner is either seriously delinquent or already in the foreclosure process. It is quite likely that most of these properties will eventually end up on lenders’ balance sheets and then be offered for sale.\n\nAs I discussed in a speech given earlier this year in New Jersey, the New York Fed is deeply committed to contributing to efforts to resolve the housing crisis that continues to impede our economic performance. Our economists monitor the housing market and analyze its impact on the national economy. My outreach staff works with community groups and housing practitioners to support local programs that aid distressed homeowners. Our lawyers perform pro bono work for homeowners facing foreclosure and advise on legal reforms, while our researchers and market analysts have developed proposals to mitigate current problems and improve the future structure of housing finance. Indeed, today’s conference is an outgrowth of these efforts, and many of these ideas will be presented in today’s various panels.\n\nThank you for your attention. I hope today’s conference proves both stimulating and useful for you. I’ll now turn the mic over to Thomas Gais, director of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government and our co-sponsor of this conference.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today. I am glad to see the progress our city and region have made recovering from Sandy, but obviously significant challenges remain.\n\nI am going to focus my remarks today on what is popularly known as the “too big to fail” (TBTF) problem. In particular, should society tolerate a financial system in which certain financial institutions are deemed to be too big to fail? And, if not, then what should we do about it?\n\nThe answer to the first question is clearly “no.” We cannot tolerate a financial system in which some firms are too big to fail—at least not ones that operate in any form other than that of a very tightly regulated utility.\n\nThe second question is the more interesting one. Is the current approach of the official sector to ending TBTF the right one? I’d characterize this approach as reducing the incentives for firms to operate with a large systemic footprint, reducing the likelihood of them failing, and lowering the cost to society when they do fail. Or would it be better to take the more direct, but less nuanced approach advocated by some and simply break up the most systemically important firms into smaller or simpler pieces in the hope that what emerges is no longer systemic and too big to fail? 1\n\nAs I will explain tonight, I believe we should continue to press forward on the first path. But, if we fail to reach our destination by this route, then a blunter approach may yet prove necessary. As always, my views may not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat Is the Too-Big-to-Fail Problem? The root cause of “too big to fail’ is the fact that in our financial system as it exists today, the failure of large complex financial firms generate large, undesirable externalities. These include disruption of the stability of the financial system and its ability to provide credit and other essential financial services to households and businesses. When this happens, not only is the financial sector disrupted, but its troubles cascade over into the real economy.\n\nThere are negative externalities associated with the failure of any financial firm, but these are disproportionately high in the case of large, complex and interconnected firms. Although the moniker is “too big to fail,” the magnitude of these externalities does not depend simply on size. The size of the externalities also depends on the particular mix of business activities and the degree of interconnectedness with the rest of the financial industry. One important element is the importance of the services the firm provides to the broader financial system and the economy and the ease with which customers can move their business to other providers. Another is the extent to which the firm’s structure and activities create the potential for contagion—that is, direct losses for counterparties, fire sales of assets held by other leveraged financial institutions, or loss of confidence that might precipitate runs on other firms with similar business models.\n\nThe presence of large negative externalities creates a dilemma for policymakers when such firms are in danger of failing, particularly if the wider financial system is also under stress at the same moment. At that point in time, the expected costs to society of failure are very large compared to the short-run costs from providing the extraordinary liquidity support, capital or other emergency assistance necessary to prevent catastrophic failure.\n\nThe market's belief that a TBTF firm is more likely to be rescued in the event of distress than other firms weakens the degree of market discipline exerted by capital providers and counterparties. This reduces the firm's cost of funds and incents the firm to take more risk than would be the case if there were no prospect of rescue and funding costs were higher.\n\nThe fact that firms deemed by the market to be TBTF enjoy an artificial subsidy in the form of lower funding costs distorts competition to the detriment of smaller, less complex firms. This advantage, in turn, creates an unfortunate incentive for firms to get even larger and more complex. The funding benefit of being seen to be TBTF causes the financial system to become artificially skewed toward larger and more complex firms—in ways that are unrelated to true economies of scale and scope.\n\nNow to be clear, I don't believe that firms necessarily deliberately set out to become TBTF. Nor do I think that TBTF was the main cause of the breakdown in market discipline that preceded the financial crisis. Many factors were at work, including the failure to grasp the riskiness of new types of credit products and business models, and principal-agent problems such as the “trader’s put.” But I do think TBTF contributed to the underpricing of risk in the system and did create a bad set of incentives, and if not addressed comprehensively, would likely be an even larger problem in the future.\n\nSo How Did the Problem Become So Serious? The TBTF problem is not new. For example, the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) and other federal regulatory agencies intervened to prevent the abrupt failure of Continental Illinois, then the seventh largest bank in the United States, in the 1980s. Had Continental Illinois been allowed to fail without any intervention, the comptroller of the currency later testified, “we could very well have seen a national, if not an international, financial crisis the dimensions of which were difficult to imagine.” 2\n\nBut the problem has become more significant since that time for several reasons. First, the biggest financial institutions have become much larger, both in absolute terms and relative to the overall size of the banking system. This reflects many factors including the end of prohibitions on interstate banking, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act restrictions separating investment from commercial banking, the rapid growth of the capital markets, and the globalization of the economy—all of which created intense competitive pressures to expand in order to gain economies of scale and scope.\n\nIn commercial banking, consolidation occurred at a rapid pace. For example, Bank of America was the outgrowth of over 160 different mergers, which pushed up the size of the original acquirer from $23 billion of assets in 1980 to $2.2 trillion today. In the securities industry, some partnerships became public companies, in part, so that they could more easily obtain the capital needed to expand rapidly. For example, when Goldman Sachs went public in 1999, it had about 15,000 employees and $250 billion of assets. Just eight years later, the firm had expanded to 35,000 employees and $1.1 trillion of assets.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the top five banks in the United States had total assets of $1 trillion or about 14 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The top securities firms had total assets of $718 billion, or about 9 percent of GDP. By the end of 2007, the top five banks had assets of $6.8 trillion or 49 percent of GDP. Similarly, the top securities firms accounted for $3.8 trillion, or about 27 percent of GDP. In addition, the firms’ off-balance-sheet exposures rose sharply.\n\nSecond, the complexity and interconnectedness of the largest financial firms increased markedly. Factors behind this include the adoption of a universal banking model by some commercial bank holding companies and the rapid growth of trading businesses, especially the over the counter (OTC) derivatives market. In the early 1980s, there were no true U.S. “universal banks” that combined traditional commercial banking with capital markets and underwriting activities. By 2007, there were several operating in the United States, including Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, UBS, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank. Also, the OTC derivatives business in foreign exchange, interest rate swaps and credit default swaps had exploded from its start in the early 1980s. The total notional value of the OTC derivatives outstanding for the five largest banks and securities firms currently totals about $200 trillion.\n\nDuring this period, there was inadequate attention to the risks that were building up in the system. The regulatory and supervisory framework did not keep up with the changes in size, complexity, interconnectedness and globalization that created growing systemic risk externalities and widened the wedge between private and social costs in the event of failure.\n\nLet me mention just a few of the issues:\n\nThe TBTF problem was further aggravated by the financial crisis and the policy response. Faced with systemwide stress, the Federal Reserve, with the support of the U.S. Treasury, intervened to prevent the disorderly failure of Bear Stearns, a firm that would not have been high on the list of TBTF firms a few years earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, the failure of Lehman Brothers demonstrated that the cost to society of the uncontrolled failure of a TBTF firm in a period of generalized stress was considerably greater than anticipated. Following the bankruptcy of Lehman, contagion spread by many channels, including prime brokerage, OTC derivatives positions, money market mutual funds, tri-party repo and wholesale funding markets. The loss in confidence disrupted the flow of credit throughout the global financial system, generating a global economic downturn and the worst contraction in the United States since the Great Depression.\n\nRecognition of the costs generated by the Lehman failure led to extraordinary interventions to prevent further catastrophic failures. These included the rescue of AIG, the FDIC’s TLGP program, the ring-fence of Citigroup’s poorer quality assets, and the TARP injection of capital into the largest U.S. financial institutions. Because this solidified in investors’ minds that TBTF firms—after the Lehman debacle—would be protected, this worsened the TBTF problem.\n\nThe problem was exacerbated during the crisis by the acquisition of weakened firms by stronger firms, a development that was actively promoted by policymakers in a bid to avoid or temper the consequences of their failure. J.P. Morgan absorbed Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual and its assets grew from $1.5 trillion in 2007 to $2.3 trillion today; Wells Fargo purchased Wachovia and its assets increased from $575 billion in 2007 to $1.3 trillion today; and Bank of America purchased Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, increasing its assets from $1.7 trillion in 2007 to $2.2 trillion today. This, of course, made the surviving firms even bigger and more complex.\n\nWhen the smoke had cleared, the situation was clearly untenable. The experience of the crisis increased the advantage from being perceived as TBTF, and, thus, strengthened the incentives to become bigger, more complex, and interconnected.\n\nThe Dodd Frank Act (DFA) set out to end TBTF. One means was by eliminating the Federal Reserve’s discretion to provide emergency financial support through a program open only to a single financial institution, and, in general, raising the bar for broader-based emergency interventions under section 13.3 of the Federal Reserve Act.\n\nBut, as the DFA recognized, simply tying the Fed’s hands on intervention is insufficient. It does not reduce the cost to society from the failure of a large and complex firm. In order for the non-intervention strategy to be both fully credible and consistent with the public interest, we need to tackle the underlying externalities and incentive problems that give rise to TBTF in the first place.\n\nTackling Too Big to Fail As I see it, solving the TBTF problem requires working on a number of different margins. These include measures that are firm-specific and those that address the structure of the financial system more broadly.\n\nOne set of measures works to reduce the incentives for excessive risk-taking and to lower the probability that large financial firms fail or come close to failure. Another set lessens the disruption to the financial system and hence the cost their failure imposes on the broader economy and society as a whole. Along with measures that penalize characteristics associated with the negative externalities from failure, these changes work against the incentive to be too big to fail.\n\nPolicy measures that alter incentives and reduce the probability of distress\n\nA number of steps have already been taken that reduce the probability of failure. For example, there has already been considerable progress in forcing firms to bolster their capital and liquidity resources. On the capital side, consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III significantly raises the quantity and quality of capital required of internationally active bank holding companies. This ensures that the firm’s shareholders will bear all the firm’s losses across a much wider range of scenarios than before. This should strengthen market discipline. Meanwhile, to the extent that some of the specific activities that generate significant externalities are now subject to higher capital charges, this should cause banks to alter their business activities in ways that reduce both the likelihood and social cost of their failure.\n\nMoreover, the new Basel regime explicitly adjusts capital requirements upward based on size, complexity, interconnectedness, global exposure and substitutability—attributes that are proxies for the negative externalities generated by failure. If a bank is deemed a global systemic financial institution or G-SIFI, then it will have to hold a greater amount of capital relative to its risk-weighted assets compared to a less systemic institution. 4\n\nThe notion behind the SIFI surcharge is a simple one. The cost to society from the failure of a large, complex firm is proportionally considerably higher than the cost to society of the failure of a non-systemic firm. As a result the capital buffer for the more systemic firm should be higher so that its expected probability of failure will be lower than for the less systemic firm.\n\nThe SIFI surcharge acts as a penalty for size and complexity, leaning against the funding cost advantage a firm may have because it is perceived to be TBTF. This helps level the playing field for smaller firms and reduces the incentive to seek to become TBTF in the first place.\n\nDomestically, we have adopted a more forward-looking approach to capital through the use of stress tests, in particular the annual Comprehensive Capital Assessment Review (CCAR) program. By promoting transparency, CCAR also strengthens market discipline.\n\nOn the liquidity front, the largest, most systemically important bank holding companies will be required to hold a 30-day liquidity buffer—the so-called liquidity coverage ratio or LCR. The purpose of the LCR is to ensure that such a bank will have sufficient liquid resources so if it were to encounter business difficulties and temporarily lose access to market funding, it would still have some time to address its underlying problems. With a liquidity buffer, banks will not immediately be forced to sell illiquid assets during times of stress. This should enhance their stability, and provide some protection against the fire sale externalities we saw during the crisis: forced asset sales, falling asset prices, leading to rising capital losses at other firms that led, in turn, to further funding difficulties, asset sales and so on.\n\nOn the supervisory side, firms are now increasingly being evaluated on a cross-industry basis in order to identify best practices and to identify laggards that need to upgrade areas such as MIS, governance, model validation, and risk management practices.\n\nActivity restrictions are another potential means to reduce the risk of failure. The biggest initiative in this area is the Volcker Rule. By limiting proprietary trading activities, the Volcker Rules seeks to reduce trading risk and the likelihood of failure.\n\nIn addition, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) is in the process of identifying those non-bank financial firms that are systemically important. These firms will be subject to tougher prudential standards and supervisory oversight by the Federal Reserve.\n\nSome argue that this designation process merely creates more TBTF firms. I see it differently. The system risk externalities do not depend on whether we label them systemic or not. If these risks are present, then we should face up to the issue with tougher standards and enhanced supervisory oversight rather than leave the issue unaddressed. This has to be a superior approach relative to pretending these firms could not be TBTF and the problem doesn’t exist.\n\nPolicy measures to reduce the adverse systemic consequences from failure\n\nBecause no plausible level of capital and liquidity standards will be sufficient to reduce the probability of failure to zero, it also makes sense to work on the other major margin—to reduce the cost of the failure of a large, complex financial firm. We can do this by making changes so that such failures are less likely to impair the functioning of the broader financial system. In this area, although many initiatives are in train, I would conclude that we are still very far from where we need to be.\n\nOne simple but meaningful step that already has been enacted is to put a brake on the ability of the largest and most complex firms to become even larger and more complex. To this end, the Dodd-Frank Act adds “the risk to stability of the U.S. banking or financial system” as an additional factor to be considered in evaluating a proposed merger or acquisition under the Bank Merger Act and the Bank Holding Company Act. As Governor Daniel Tarullo discussed in a recent speech, there is not a hard and fast rule to be applied here. But his view, which I share, is that there would be a “a strong, though not irrebuttable, presumption of denial [of a merger or acquisition] by any firm that falls in the higher end of the list of global systemically important banks…” 5 , 6\n\nAnother step for dealing with the firms that might be viewed by some as already TBTF is to understand better the interconnections and pathways through which the distress or failure of one firm impairs the larger system and causes harm to society. We have made progress through the supervisory process in mapping out critical activities performed by firms. Also, we have identified a number of areas, such as collateral management, where better practices could both improve the safety and soundness of the individual firm and reduce the negative externalities generated by a firm’s failure.\n\nWork is also underway to evaluate what changes would be required to make the future bankruptcy of large complex firms less disruptive, while also developing an alternative means for the orderly resolution of such firms outside the normal bankruptcy process.\n\nThe costs to society of large complex financial firms failing can be reduced at least to some degree by having firms, working in conjunction with their regulators, “pre-plan” their own failure through the so-called “living will” process. The largest and most systemically important banks submitted their “living wills” to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC this summer. We have reviewed the first iterations of their plans and are currently drafting feedback for the firms to incorporate in their next submissions. Through such “living wills,” regulators are gaining a better understanding of the impediments to an orderly bankruptcy. This is the necessary first phase in the process of determining how to ameliorate these impediments over time and then doing so.\n\nIn my view, this initial exercise has confirmed that we are a long way from the desired situation in which large complex firms could be allowed to go bankrupt without major disruptions to the financial system and large costs to society. Significant changes in structure and organization will ultimately be required for this to be achieved. However, the “living will” exercise is an iterative process, and we have only taken the first step in a long journey.\n\nThe second way to potentially minimize the negative externalities from a firm’s failure would be to avoid a bankruptcy proceeding altogether and instead resolve the firm under the Dodd-Frank Act’s Title II orderly liquidation 7 authority. 8 The “single point of entry” model has much promise, but much remains to be done before it could be implemented with confidence for a globally active firm. Title II authority is U.S. law. Subsidiaries and affiliates chartered in other countries could be wound down under the bankruptcy laws of those countries, if authorities there did not have full confidence that local interests would be protected. Certain Title II measures including the one-day stay provision with respect to OTC derivatives and other qualified financial contracts may not apply through the force of law outside the United States, making orderly resolution difficult. The other essential dimension of solving TBTF is to make the financial system more robust—addressing structural vulnerabilities that tend to amplify shocks rather than absorb them. If the financial system can be made more resilient, it will be better positioned to withstand the failure of a large and complex firm and continue to provide essential financial services to the real economy. I would highlight three areas of work that are critical to solving the TBTF problem. First, regulators and supervisors are pushing for changes in wholesale funding markets, a source of particular vulnerability during the crisis. This includes reforms to tri-party repo, which are underway, and necessary reforms to the money market mutual fund industry, which are being evaluated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Second, the financial market infrastructures are being strengthened to make them more robust to the failure of individual firms. The Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have published a set of standards for financial market infrastructures called “Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures” that will serve as minimum standards globally. Finally, the OTC derivatives market is being reformed with the aim of reducing bilateral exposures between firms and, thus, the systemic impact from any one firm failing. All standardized OTC derivatives in the interest rate, credit default, and equities markets will soon have to be centrally cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). The clearing of standardized derivatives trades through CCPs should reduce risk in the overall financial system by facilitating the netting down of OTC derivative exposures. Such trades will also have to be reported to trade repositories and information about the trades will be made available on a post-trade basis. This should make the OTC derivatives market more transparent and, thus, reduce the risk of contagion. The Way Forward We have made some progress on the TBTF problem, particularly in reducing the likelihood that a large complex firm will reach the point of distress at which society faces serious costs. But we have a considerable ways to go to finish the job and reduce to tolerable levels the social costs associated with such failures. Further international coordination is almost certainly going to be necessary to ensure that bankruptcy regimes interact in ways that minimize negative externalities. At home we also need to ensure that different authorities and resolution regimes operate in a mutually consistent manner. In particular, we may need to revisit the SIPC regime that governs securities firms in bankruptcy. At present, the bankruptcy of a securities firm is very disruptive because the claims of all counterparties are typically frozen for a considerable period and the value of these claims is not easy to ascertain or monetize quickly. As I have argued above, we shouldn’t focus on solving TBTF exclusively at the level of the individual firm. We need significant changes in market structures and practices as well in order to have a financial system in which the key players can fail without big social costs. We also must continue to ask ourselves the question of whether the steps in train go far enough. For example, one could make a good case that the capital surcharge for systemically important firms should be higher than that contemplated by the Basel Committee. Of course, such a judgment depends on how much other policies succeed in reducing the negative externalities their failure would generate. Critics of our approach believe it would be better to just break up firms deemed TBTF now—perhaps through legislation requiring the separation of retail banking and capital markets activities or by imposing size restrictions that require firms to shrink dramatically from their current scale. My own view is that while this could yet prove necessary, it is premature to give up on the current approach: changing the incentives facing large and complex firms, forcing them to become more resilient, and making the financial system more robust to their failure. In my opinion, there are shortcomings to reimposing Glass-Steagall-type activity restrictions or strict size limits. With respect to Glass-Steagall, it is not obvious to me that the pairing of securities and banking businesses was an important causal element behind the crisis. In fact, independent investment banks were much more vulnerable during 2008 than the universal banking firms which conducted both banking and securities activities. More important is to address the well-known sources of instability in wholesale funding markets and give careful consideration to whether there should be a more robust lender of last resort regime for securities activities. With respect to size limitations, it is important to recognize that a new and much reduced size threshold could sacrifice socially useful economies of scale and scope benefits. And it could do this without actually solving the problem of system risk externalities that aren’t related to balance sheet size. Evaluating the socially optimal size, scope and organizational structure of financial firms is a complicated business, and so is establishing a viable transition path to a system of much smaller firms. It would be helpful in this regard if advocates of break-up solutions would put a bit more flesh on the bones and develop detailed proposals that address essential questions of how such downsizing or functional separation would be accomplished, and what benefits and costs could be expected. Such an analysis should answer several questions: How would you force divestiture (in good times and bad)? Should firms be split up by activity or reduced pro-rata in size? How much would they have to be shrunk in order for the externalities of failure to no longer create TBTF problems? How would global trading and investment banking services and network-type activities be supported? Should some activities be retained in natural monopoly form, but subject to utility type regulation? How costly would it be to replicate support services or to manage liquidity and capital locally? Are there ways of designing size limits that cannot be arbitraged by banks via off-balance-sheet structures and other forms of financial innovation? So far, advocacy for the break-up path has been strong, but without the detail to assess whether this is indeed superior to the course we are currently following. But, I’m open-minded. It is important to recognize that any credible approach to addressing the TBTF problem, including the one we are pursuing today, necessarily implies changes to the structure and business mix of financial firms and financial markets. Moreover, it is important to stress that not all of these adjustments will be in the private interests of these firms, and some will result in changes to the price and volume of certain financial services. These are intended consequences, not unintended consequences. Too big to fail is an unacceptable regime. The good news is there are many efforts underway to address this problem. The bad news is that some of these efforts are just in their nascent stages. It is important that as the crisis recedes in memory, that these efforts not flag—this is a project that needs to be seen to a successful conclusion and then sustained on a permanent basis. Thank you for your attention, I would be happy to take a few questions. 1 This would presumably require legislation. 2 Conover, C.T. 1984. “Testimony: Inquiry Into the Continental Illinois Corp. and Continental Illinois National Bank.” Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions Supervision, Regulation, and Insurance of the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives, 98th Cong., 2nd Session, September 18, 19 and October 4: 172-391. P. 288 3 Under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal Reserve is authorized to lend to individuals, corporations and partnerships. But this may occur only if a super majority of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has determined that circumstances are “unusual and exigent.” Subsequently, the Dodd-Frank Act further constrained this authority by prohibiting its use to rescue an individual company from bankruptcy. 4 Earlier this month, the Financial Stability Board published a list of 28 global systemically important banks or G-SIBs that will be subject to capital surcharges. The firms were arrayed in four buckets, with an increasing capital surcharge as a percent of risk-weighted assets imposed as one ascended upward to the higher buckets. 5 See Governor Daniel K. Tarullo, “Financial Stability Regulation,” October 10, 2012. Mr Tarullo added that “I would not apply the presumption in the case of certain de minimis acquisitions or in cases where asset dispositions were judged to offset any increase in systemic risk from the proposed new acquisiton.\" 6 Earlier this year, the Board of Governors issued an order approving Capital One Financial Corporation's acquisition of a federal savings bank, ING Bank. In that order, the Board set forth two principles that are relevant to this particular issue. First, the Board stated that it would generally find a significant adverse effect if the failure of the firm resulting from a merger or acquisition \"would likely impair financial intermediation or financial market functioning so as to inflict material damage on the broader economy.\" Second, the Board observed that there are some small acquisitions or mergers that would not raise a financial stability concern, such as “a proposal that involves an acquisition of less than $2 billion in assets, [or] results in a firm with less than $25 billion in total assets . . . . “ 7 The FDIC's \"single point of entry\" framework for implementing this authority envisages establishing a bridge company into which all the operating subsidiaries of the parent company would be transferred. The bridge company would be recapitalized by converting all or some of the parent company’s subordinated and senior unsecured debt into fresh equity in the bridge company. The parent company would be allowed to fail. The transfer of the operating subsidiaries to the bridge company would allow critical operations to continue and provide time for the FDIC to move the systemically important operations back into private hands. 8 The DFA orderly liquidation authority is viewed as to be used only as a last resort under a very well-defined set of circumstances. To resolve a firm under the FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority, a number of determinations must be satisfied. First, the troubled firm must be designated a covered financial company (CFC) and that it is in default or danger of default and a resolution under bankruptcy would result in adverse consequences. The determination to use OLA authority requires the assent of the Treasury Secretary after consultation with the President.\n\nThe “single point of entry” model has much promise, but much remains to be done before it could be implemented with confidence for a globally active firm. Title II authority is U.S. law. Subsidiaries and affiliates chartered in other countries could be wound down under the bankruptcy laws of those countries, if authorities there did not have full confidence that local interests would be protected. Certain Title II measures including the one-day stay provision with respect to OTC derivatives and other qualified financial contracts may not apply through the force of law outside the United States, making orderly resolution difficult.\n\nThe other essential dimension of solving TBTF is to make the financial system more robust—addressing structural vulnerabilities that tend to amplify shocks rather than absorb them. If the financial system can be made more resilient, it will be better positioned to withstand the failure of a large and complex firm and continue to provide essential financial services to the real economy.\n\nI would highlight three areas of work that are critical to solving the TBTF problem.

These are intended consequences, not unintended consequences.\n\nToo big to fail is an unacceptable regime. The good news is there are many efforts underway to address this problem. The bad news is that some of these efforts are just in their nascent stages. It is important that as the crisis recedes in memory, that these efforts not flag—this is a project that needs to be seen to a successful conclusion and then sustained on a permanent basis.\n\nThank you for your attention, I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n1 This would presumably require legislation.\n\n2 Conover, C.T. 1984. “Testimony: Inquiry Into the Continental Illinois Corp. and Continental Illinois National Bank.” Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions Supervision, Regulation, and Insurance of the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives, 98th Cong., 2nd Session, September 18, 19 and October 4: 172-391.

    "text": "I want to thank Noel and Gonzalo and the Foreign Policy Association (FPA)\n  for this award, for this great honor—and for bringing together so many\n  old friends.\n\nI also want to thank Bill, Jerry and Paul for their exceedingly generous comments.\n  More importantly, I would like to thank them, and all of you with whom I have\n  worked over the years, for your patience as you educated me, and for your generosity\nin sharing your insights and your understanding.  I am very grateful.\n\nIt is no secret that I believe the best public policy is made quietly, behind\n  the scenes.  So it is not often that I allow myself to be on this side\n  of a microphone.  Actually, I am still wondering how I did let\n  this happen.\n\nAs you know, much of my career at the New York Fed has been spent working\n  with countries in the Emerging World.  And for much of that time, the\n  focus was on dealing with episodes of financial stress originating there.  There\n  have also been events closer to home—9/11, Long-Term Capital Management\n  (LTCM), the 1987 stock market crash—in which the Federal Reserve played\n  a role in helping our markets and economy work their way through.\n\nThose experiences taught those of us that went through them a great deal about\n  how crises develop and unfold, and about ways they are best managed.\n\nBut even for those of us who have seen their fair share of stressful episodes,\n  the events of the past year and a half were without precedent in terms of complexity,\n  speed, magnitude, and frightening implications.\n\nThis was not merely distress at an institution, or troubles in a market,\n  it was a run on the system.  Liquidity, trading, and confidence collapsed\n  virtually overnight.  In an industry that runs on confidence—the\n  root of the word credit comes from the Latin “to trust”—suddenly\n  no institution in the world trusted or wanted to deal with another unless a\n  central bank stood between them.\n\nHow did we get ourselves into such a mess?  Much of recent commentary\n  has focused on assigning blame, and surely there is plenty to go around.  But\n  a narrative focused mainly on finding culprits risks obscuring the deeper structural\n  issues that were integral to the crisis, and that will need to be dealt with\nif we are to successfully move to a more resilient system.\n\nThe vulnerabilities at the heart of the problem—excessive complexity,\n  leverage, and opacity—did not emerge overnight.  They evolved over\n  a period of years, against a backdrop of benign macroeconomic and financial\n  conditions that fostered an under-appreciation of risk and a reach for yield\nby investors.\n\nThe past two decades were a period of enormous financial innovation, reflecting\n  changes in technology, accounting, regulation, instrumentation and market practice.\n  Our system evolved from one funded by intermediaries, to one largely financed by\n  markets.  The traditional ties between borrower and creditor were weakened\n  as credit risk became just another commodity to be traded and distributed.\n\nThese developments contributed to economic vibrancy and efficiency.  But\n  they also helped obscure growing leverage and declining underwriting standards,\n  and encouraged the fanciful belief that the US economy and financial system\n  were infinitely resilient and could support our living beyond our means indefinitely.\n\nThe tipping point at which confidence is lost and replaced by uncertainty,\n  mistrust and fear is never visible until after it occurs.  And so it was\n  this time.\n\nUnprecedented policy interventions were needed to put a floor under\n  confidence and pull us back from the brink.\n\nAnd while we have come a long way since the\n  dark days of last year, the history of this episode is still being written,\n  and the recent celebration in markets seems oddly premature. The decline in\n  global manufacturing and trade over the last year (which was as or more severe\n  than the first year of the Great Depression), will cast a long shadow, notwithstanding\n  recent improvement.\n\nA range of vulnerabilities still remain, not only for the\n  economy, but also with regard to the unfinished business of cleaning up the\n  banking system and the prudent exit from unprecedented policy interventions—processes\n  that present complex challenges, that involve potentially important indirect\n  as well as direct effects, and that will need to be carried out without a guide\n  book.  We have been using experimental drugs on a rare disease—and while\n  the patient’s vitals are improving, the cure could have important and\n  long-term side-effects that need to be closely monitored.\n\nThe upshot is that a quick return to business as usual is highly unlikely.\n  And also undesirable. Restoring growth and stability will require movement\n  toward a new economic equilibrium, a more sustainable one; one based more on\n  competing in the global economy, and less on spending and borrowing.  Needless\n  to say, establishing such a shift will not be without its challenges.\n\nThe broad parameters of what needs to be done seem reasonably well understood:\n\nMeeting these challenges will not be easy, and the process will necessarily\n  take time.  We need to navigate the transition from near-term support\n  for our convalescing economy and markets into longer-term thrift and higher\n  margins for safety in the financial sector.  We face difficult choices\n  regarding spending priorities and the means to pay for them, as well as thorny\n  questions regarding appropriate design and oversight of our financial system.\n\nWe also face challenges in terms of our global leadership. Economics and\n  finance have increasingly become the principle theater of engagement globally.\n  We have enjoyed many advantages in this realm over the years: the large size\n  of our economy and its historical dynamism, the vitality and sophistication\n  of our financial markets, and our track record for economic management.\n\nBut the world has been changing in important ways, many of them related to\n  continued growth in the emerging world. There is no question that the current\n  crisis has given additional impetus to a dynamic that was already well in train:\n  a shift in the economic center of gravity from the so-called advanced economies\n  toward the emerging world.\n\nThe emerging world already accounts for about half\n  of global output, and that share will almost certainly rise significantly in\n  the years ahead, as the combination of demographics, investment and continued\n  policy improvements propels many economies forward. We already have one new\n  entrant to the short list of largest economies, and others are likely to join\n  the club.\n\nThis has been a remarkable era; we are no longer alone as the central\n  axis for the global economy. New linkages are developing across and between\n  regions and countries, new economic and financial arrangements are being discussed,\n  and the groundwork for new currency arrangements are being explored.\n\nThe choice\n  that faces us is to attempt to shape these various developments—the\n  evolution of the global financial and trade architecture and global patterns\n  of saving and investment—or risk being shaped by them now and in the\n  future.  For my money, better to be one of the shapers than just a “shapee.”\n\nAs we strive to exert leadership in the economic and financial realm, we need\n  to keep in mind that, while we have many cards to play, our hand is not as\n  strong as it once was, and therefore we will have to play it differently if\n  we are to be effective.\n\nThe crisis has affected the United States’ standing in the world, confidence\n  in our economic management, and has called into question our ability to lead.\n  We can help answer those questions by putting our house in order and delivering\n  on the reform agenda confronting us—but this will take time. Meanwhile,\n  our relative status is changing, as other countries expand their economic and\n  financial footprints, and their influence.\n\nThe recent move to the G20 as the key forum for addressing global governance\n  issues was necessary and overdue.  But making that process work will be\n  far more challenging than achieving consensus in the old club of rich nations. While we have much common ground with the emerging world, there are numerous\n  differences as well, with regard to income levels, views on the role of the\n  state and markets, institutional development, political histories, and alignment\n  on security issues.  Matters are further complicated by the heterogeneity\n  within the emerging world itself.\n\nAll of this implies a greater premium on consensus\n  building and diplomacy on our part, recognizing that our leverage will not\n  be what it once was. We also need to be attentive to the messages we receive\n  (such as rumblings about the dollar and our policies and priorities) even when\n  we disagree with them, and sensitive to signs of change in the economic environment\n  and their potential implications (such as new trade linkages, the growth of\n  state-linked investment vehicles, and shifts in attitudes toward capital mobility).\n\nIn sum, whether the continued evolution of the global economic and financial\n  landscape will be an opportunity or a threat depends in part on the rest of\n  the world, but mostly it depends on us.  It depends on whether we will\n  be ready to compete in the realm of business and finance and of ideas, and\n  on whether we can adapt our leadership style to changing circumstances and\n  imperatives.  There is no question we have our work cut out for us, but\n  if history has shown us anything, it is that we are at our best when we are\n  challenged.\n\nLet me conclude on personal note.  It would be difficult to miss\n  the criticisms that have been swirling about the Fed recently. One lesson that\n  has been driven home to me over the years (and I think now about the examples\n  set forth by Chairman Volcker and Secretary Brady and others in this room and\n  elsewhere) is that it takes wisdom to know what to do in the face of crisis—and\n  it takes courage to actually do it.\n\nNow I am not suggesting that the decisions\n  taken during those frenzied days last year, when markets were melting down\n  and institutions were lined up like so many dominoes ready to topple, were\n  wise or even necessarily right.\n\nBut what I can tell you is that those decisions were made for the right reasons.\n  They were based on the facts as we understood them at the time—not\n  as we wanted them to be, but as we found them—and in the time frames\n  that circumstances required.  And they were based on what we believed\n  was needed to turn the tide and protect the citizens of this country—indeed\n  the globe—from the unthinkable:  an economic and financial breakdown\n  of catastrophic proportion. The broad societal costs that may have been averted\n  will remain unknowable, but those who would ignore them do little service to\n  the public debate.\n\nThe men and women of the Federal Reserve—Bill Dudley and some of my\n  colleagues are here tonight—are acutely aware that they hold a unique\n  public trust; it is a rare privilege and a unifying, motivating force for them,\n  and they execute on it every day with great skill, integrity and dedication.\n  As they deal with the challenges ahead, I know they would welcome your encouragement\n  and support.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Good afternoon and welcome once again to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Economic Press Briefing.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak with you.  Today I want to focus on how economic outcomes often differ substantially across different segments of the population.  As always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.  While these mandates are expressed at an aggregate national level, it is important for policymakers to understand how they impact different groups of individuals across the country.  Consequently, in addition to monitoring macroeconomic conditions closely on a day-to-day basis, economists at the New York Fed have been doing a substantial amount of work to understand how economic experiences differ across individuals and regions.  As highlighted by the Nobel Prize Committee’s recent recognition of Professor Angus Deaton’s work, analyzing individual outcomes is vital to fully understanding the workings of the macroeconomy.  With that in mind, I want to talk about two important areas that impact household well-being: labor income and housing opportunities.\n\nLet me start with labor income, which for most households is the dominant source of household income.  As one would expect, differences in labor income across individuals of a given age tend to increase as people get older.  Some of this is due to education and occupation choices—and how they impact income growth―and some is due to various events that individuals face in their working lives.  Unemployment risk is an example of an adverse development that can substantially affect people’s careers and labor income during their lifetime.  Over the period from 1976 to 2015, the overall unemployment rate averaged around 6.5 percent, but unemployment varied substantially across regions and across worker backgrounds.  Unemployment was especially high for workers with lower earnings, a group that tends to have little savings to draw upon.  Looking across demographic groups, younger workers, less-educated workers and those in manual occupations, as well as workers who identify as Black or Hispanic, experienced significantly higher average unemployment rates when compared to older and college-educated workers.  These stark differences across demographic groups in terms of levels of unemployment are also evident in terms of how unemployment changed over business cycles, including the Great Recession.  While the overall unemployment rate increased from 5 percent in December 2007 to 10 percent in October 2009, it increased substantially more for workers with lower earnings.  In other words, looking at the national unemployment rate tells only part of the story of the labor market experiences for different groups of individuals.  Understanding this diversity is critical to better understanding the health of the labor market and the overall economy, and is important for informing policy.\n\nNow let’s turn to housing.  Macroeconomists focus on aggregate residential construction as a measure of how the housing sector is contributing to overall economic growth.  It is important to note, however, that housing market experiences vary substantially across individuals in ways not reflected in the aggregate construction data.  For example, the type of housing units typically occupied by low-income households saw higher-than-average rent inflation from 2009 to 2011.  Much of this difference appears to be due to contrasting ways that additions to the housing stock enter into different segments of the housing market.  For households in the highest income quintile, new construction more than accounts for the net increase in housing units, which in turn tends to hold down rent increases for these households.  However, as one moves down the income distribution, new construction represents a smaller share of the net increase in housing units.  For households in the lowest income quintile, additions to rental supply come more from units that with age have depreciated and are no longer rented by higher income households.  These supply additions tend to have higher rents than existing units rented by low-income households, thus putting upward pressure on rental costs.\n\nThe diversity of experiences is also evident with respect to access to mortgage credit, both for households attempting to transition to homeownership and for homeowners who want to trade up.  We have also been monitoring mortgage originations at the zip code level using the New York Fed’s Consumer Credit Panel.  When we rank zip codes by their 2012 average adjusted gross income, we see mortgage origination volume in the lowest quintile locations was 38 percent of the volume for the highest quintile locations in 2007.  By early 2015, this ratio had fallen to only 14 percent.\n\nAs highlighted by these examples, and as you’ll hear during today’s presentation, data at the aggregate level and at a more micro-level illustrate different sides of the same picture.  As such, both must be considered as we work toward fully understanding the economy.\n\nI will now ask Aysegul Sahin to provide a detailed account of how various economic outcomes vary across individuals, households and regions.\n\n1 Aysegul Sahin and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.",

    "text": "Eugene White:\n\nDr.  Dudley is going to first give some general comments about the regional economy,  and then we're going to move over here for a fireside chat to talk using some  pre-prepared questions, and then from the audience.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nGreat  to be here. My wife is a graduate of at the school and she sends her regards.  She's the Chair of the Douglass investment fund, so she's actually involved  with the college on an ongoing basis. It's also great to see Christine Cumming,  whom I worked very closely with at the Fed. She was the First Vice President of the Fed, and is now on the faculty  here. So, glad to see you here, Chris, as well.\n\nI  thought I'd just talk a little bit about what we're doing on these kind of  roadshows. Like, why do we do this?  And talk a little bit about the regional  economic outlook. The New York Fed—the Second District of the Federal Reserve, it's New York's Fed district, and it consists of New York State,  Fairfield County, Connecticut, Northern New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin  Islands. And we think it's important that in terms of how we interact with our  community, to actually go out into the community and find out what's really  going on. It's one thing to look at  economics, statistics, and data, but it's also very valuable to actually hear  from people in terms of what are they experiencing in terms of the economy.  What's happening to the labor market, what's happening to job availability,  what's happening to the housing market. We learned a lot during the financial crisis  about the difficulties people were having with maintaining their mortgages, staying  current on their mortgages.\n\nSo,  you get that information by reaching out into the community. I basically go out  on four road trips a year throughout the district. So this is the fourth one  for Northern New Jersey.  We're going  down to Puerto Rico which has been devastated by the hurricanes, in a couple of  months. That’ll be the next one. It's been very valuable for me in terms of  really understanding what's going on, on the ground.\n\nSo,  basically is important. It informs how we think about the appropriate course of  monetary policy. It's one thing to look at economic statistics, it's another  thing to hear from real people on how the economy is actually affecting them on  a day-to-day basis. The  second thing we do on these trips is we're really trying to understand what we  can help bring to the community in terms of our own outreach efforts. We have a  function in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York which is Outreach &  Education, and we like to use that to try to actually help the communities that  are in our district.\n\nSome  of the ways that we do that, for example, is we recently ran a small business  forum in New Brunswick about how small businesses can gain access to capital.  In the wake of Superstorm Sandy, we actually had a set of workshops in New York  about how could people actually navigate through the various aid programs and  help people recover from the hurricane.\n\nWe  also publish a lot of economic data that is actually helpful to the  policymakers locally. So we do a small business survey for the region.  We're also now starting to compile a lot of  micro-data at the local level, so you'll actually sort of see how is it one day  we're doing well and another day we're not very far away from doing much more  poorly. And that actually helps policymakers make better decisions about how  they can actually help their local community.\n\nAnd  the last thing we do is I think we have a pretty strong ability to convene  people. If we say something is important, a lot of people will sort of take  this pretty seriously. And so if we can  have various stakeholders come in—people from the education communities, from  government, from private businesses, from community development groups—and have  conversations about real issues, which I think actually pushes the ball forward  in terms of making progress on tackling some of the tough public policy issues  we face.\n\nOne  of the things that I’m very focused on is income mobility. I think people they  get in the United States, there's the American Dream, the idea that you can  start from the bottom, work hard, and make your way up. But the fact is, income  mobility in the United States isn't really good. And that's really something that we need to  work on. That's why places like Rutgers are so important because it's really  the educational communities that essentially give people that leg up. So, for  example, Milton Friedman has a story, I thought was a very interesting one. His  parents didn't go to college. Just like my wife Ann. Her parents didn't go to  college, and so she came to Rutgers. Her family thought she should go to the  local community college, and she said no, I'm going to go to Rutgers, I'm going  to go to a four-year college.\n\nSo  I think what happens in the educational communities in our region are really,  really important in terms of giving people the job skills and that head start  so they can actually make a success of themselves throughout their career.  That's the one thing in the Second District, where we really have a comparative  advantage, the number of really high quality educational institutions in the  Second District is really without parallel.\n\nI  mean, the only district that could even sort of, maybe slightly compete with  us, might be the Boston Federal Reserve’s district. Having those educational  communities work closely with business, I think is also important. So that's  something else we very much stress. We want to have people graduate with the  skills that businesses actually need so that those people can actually get jobs  quite easily.\n\nSo  that's really sort of the purpose of why we go on these road trips. Also we can  give our views about the economy. So Eugene’s going to ask me a lot of  questions, which I'll answer. I'm sure we'll cover not just the local economy  but we'll also talk about the national economic outlook and things of that  nature.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nWe're  going to have a fireside chat here. We're going to move over here.\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nI'm  looking for the fire.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nI  don't think in these buildings they allow you to light anything. Except maybe intellectual  discussion. So, I've had a series of questions handed to me by faculty and  graduate students and undergraduates to ask you.\n\nSo,  one question which is submitted was a quote from Charles Steindel, the former  Chief Economist for Chris Christie, who used to also work at the Fed. And he  said that the New Jersey economy consistently grows at a 0.5 to 1% slower than  the national economy. This has been going on for a half century or more. Given  this regional divergence, how do regional considerations figure into the Fed's  policy decisions?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  clearly, we set monetary policy for the nation as a whole. So some regions are  doing better, some regions are doing less well. And we take all that in  consideration in terms of monetary policy. We can't set monetary policy  differentially. You can't have one monetary policy for New Jersey, another one  for New York City, another one for upstate New York.\n\nSo,  we have to understand that monetary policy is going to be set for the country  as a whole. But the way the Federal Reserve is constructed, you have these 12  Federal Reserve Bank presidents, and they can very much come to the FOMC  meetings and reflect what's going on in their regions. So the regional views  and what's happening in the various regions do get very reflected in those  monetary policy discussions and the decision-making.\n\nNow  in terms of New Jersey, growing a little bit more slowly than the national  average, I think that's part of a much broader story, which is the migration of  people from the Northeast and Midwest to the South and West that's been going  on for 30 years. Population growth in New Jersey is well below the national  average, and that's really probably the primary driver of the fact that the  growth rate in New Jersey is going to be a little bit weaker than the country  as a whole.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nOne  of the things I think in terms of the Fed that people aren't aware, they might  think that this is all self-chosen by bankers, and so forth. But really the  Board of Directors is a very diverse group, right?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nYes,  it is a very diverse group, and in fact, the bankers—so the Federal Reserve Act  sets a mandate of we have to have a board of directors, and the board of  directors consists of three groups. There's the Class A directors, which are  the bankers—three of them. There's the Class B directors that are supposed to  represent commerce. And the Class C directors that represent I think the  community sort of broadly. The Class A directors, the bankers, they have no part  in the selection process for the President of the Federal Reserve banks, which  I think is a good thing. So, it makes it very clear that we're here to  represent Main Street, not represent Wall Street.\n\nI've  announced that I'm going to be stepping down sometime late spring, early  summer. So we have a search committee composed of four members of the Board of  Directors, excluding the bank directors, and they begin the process of a search  for my successor.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nSo,  yesterday, bitcoin topped $10,000. How does the use of digital currencies  impact monetary policy, and should the Fed play a greater role in adopting  digital currencies to the payment system?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nRight  now, bitcoin is tiny relative to the amount of payment transactions that are  executed in the United States. It's essentially trivial in the broad scheme of  things. But there are some aspects of bitcoin that are quite interesting. So  like the ledger, you know, blockchain ledger technology is something that we  think actually could be used in other applications.\n\nI  think at this point it's really very premature to be talking about the Federal  Reserve offering digital currencies, but it is something we are starting to  think about. So, what would it mean to have a digital currency? How would we  offer it? Do we actually need it? I think that in terms of bitcoin, I would be  pretty cautionary about it. I think that it's not a stable store of value. It  doesn't really have the characteristics you would like to have of a currency or  a payment medium. It's not a stable store of value. The price goes up and down  very sharply. And it's not legal tender. So someone doesn't actually have to  accept bitcoin for your transaction. If I go in the store with dollars, or  currencies, people actually have to accept my currency and make that  transaction. So, I think that I would be, at this point, pretty skeptical of bitcoin.  I think it's really more of a speculative activity at this point.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nAlthough  some central banks have moved ahead of the digital front. Sweden, for example, pushing  very hard.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nYes,  Sweden is an interesting case. Sweden, the use of cash is much less than in the  United States, so that makes digital currency more easy to migrate to. Also more  people are participating in the banking system. One of the challenges for the  U.S. to move to a digital currency that a central bank offered is a lot of  people are not really actually plugged into the banking system.\n\nSo,  you'd have to have a system in place that actually brings those people that are  currently unbanked into the financial system. To really have an effective  digital currency in the U.S., we have to overcome that challenge.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nYou  mentioned about the income distribution. We know that in the U.S. that income  distribution, we've had vast growth but it hasn't benefited everyone. Is there  anything in monetary or perhaps banking policy that the Fed could do to perhaps  improve the performance?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  monetary policy is a pretty blunt tool in terms of its ability to affect income  distribution. But there are parts of banking regulation that do relate to  income distribution, the Community Reinvestment Act basically says that you  have to actually supply credit to disadvantaged neighborhoods. You can't  discriminate based on location. So there are things in banking regulation that  can actually help make sure that credit is flowing freely to areas that maybe  otherwise would not get those funds.\n\nI  think that the issue of income distribution, income mobility, I don't think we  can do much directly in terms of our policy tools, in terms of monetary policy.  But I think we can do a lot from the bully pulpit, basically put attention on  this issue, underscore how important it is, and talk about things that we can  do address it. Educational opportunity, workforce development, job retraining,  the ability to actually have the ability to move from the inner city to where  the jobs are. Because a lot of times we see, when we're traveling around the  region, we see people in the inner cities actually can't literally get to where  the jobs are because there's not appropriate transportation networks.\n\nChildcare  is another issue. People have trouble holding down a job if they have a young  child. Who's going to take care of their child during the day? And how do the  economics of that work, if they're not making a very good salary? So I think  there's a lot of issues. I think it's really an important issue for us to solve  as the country because if you don't have a sense that wherever you're born, you  have sort of a roughly similar opportunity to succeed based on your work  effort, you don't really have a fair country, in some fundamental sense.\n\nRaj  Chetty is a researcher who's done some terrific work on this issue and the work  that he's done basically shows that where you're born, where you live  geographically affects your future prospects. That is really quite disturbing.  That means it's not about the person, it's about literally the luck of the draw  of where they were born and raised. And so that shows that we have a lot of  work to do on this front.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nAnd  in fact, mobility in the U.S. has actually declined. Interstate mobility has  declined significantly.\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nExactly.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nLet  me ask you a question, which is more about something which is within the Fed's  compass of authority. What do you think the biggest risks to financial  stability currently are, and where the next crisis—well, hard to ask the  question—where the next crisis might originate? But suppose there were another  failure on the order of Lehman Brothers. Are you concerned about the  limitations that have been imposed on the Fed in terms of emergency lending?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nLet's  have first with the issue of financial stability, how worried am I about it  today? It's true that financial markets are pretty buoyant, and so that's  raised the question, how concerned should we be about that? I would say at this  point, I would say not that concerned, and the reason for that is that the  markets I think really reflect the state of the economy. The economy's doing very well, it's been very  stable. The economy has been growing 2, 2.5% a year consistently.\n\nWe're  at a very low unemployment rate, 4.1%, and it looks like the expansion has got  lots of room to go. There are not a lot of excesses in the economy. The credit  growth is growing only slowly. Households seem to be in good shape, businesses  are starting to ramp up their investment.\n\nSo,  it seems to me like we actually have a very good prospects for this expansion  to continue for quite some time. So, the financial markets in my mind sort of  reflect that. If the financial markets were behaving in a way totally  disjointed from how the economy is performing, I'd be a lot more worried.\n\nThe  second reason I'm not so worried is that I think the banking system and the  financial system is a lot more robust to stress today than it was 10 years ago.  So banks have a lot more capital and have a lot more liquidity. There's a lot  less leverage in the system. There's a lot less maturity transformation where  people are borrowing short and lending long. And so that means even if markets  were to go down, if the market prices were to go down, I think the financial  system could bear that stress much, much better today than 10 years ago.\n\nThe  issue that I'm actually a little bit worried about that no one else seems to be  worried about is really the issue of fiscal sustainability. The budget deficit  last year was 3.5% of GDP. In 2007, the budget deficit was 1.1% of GDP roughly  at the same point in the economic cycle. So we're pretty deep into this  economic cycle, and we still have a sizeable budget deficit, and we have a baby  boom generation that's just about to retire, driving up costs for Medicare and  Social Security.\n\nOn  top of that, interest rates, the Federal Reserve is gradually normalizing  interest rates, raising interest rates. So debt service costs, which have been  very, very subdued due to the low level of interest rates over the last 10  years, those are also going to be going up. I'm a little surprised that  financial markets aren't at all concerned about the sustainability of our  fiscal position. I think that's something that people should be more focused  on.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nSince  you brought up fiscal questions, I have to ask, since we have a tax package  going through, and there's a partial rollback with the mortgage interest  deduction, do you think that would have any effect perhaps on booming house  prices? If that was rolled back?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nI  think to the extent that—in terms of the provisions that I see in the two tax  bills in the House and the Senate, there could be some downward pressure on  high-end housing, but the mortgage interest deductibility I think is going to  be retained for about half a million dollars. So that means that for most  homes, in most areas, I don't think that you're going to have a big  consequence.\n\nI  would hesitate to say, get too concerned about the fact that very high-end  houses could go down in price a little bit. I think the economy can manage that  just fine.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nI  know you have a busy schedule, but I'd like to take a few questions from the  audience, if that's all right?\n\nAudience  Member:\n\nI  was really struck that after a report by the U.S. Treasury in June about  financial reform for depository institutions, which really started out with the  idea that the principle elements of Dodd-Frank and Basel III, et cetera, should  probably stay in place? That both Chair Yellen and you have given very important  speeches that have talked about the importance of preserving that basic  structure.\n\nAre  there particular things that concern you in the environment that led both you  and the Chair to speak about this?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  I think the concern on my part, and I think Chair Yellen can of course speak  for herself, is that if you open up the Dodd-Frank Act, make sure you don't  throw the baby out with the bathwater.\n\nThere's  elements of the Act that I think are very, very important in making the  financial system more strong and stable and resilient. Capital and liquidity  for banks, especially large systemically important banks, the ability to have a  resolution regime in place where you can actually liquidate a large financial  institution that gets under stress; the ability to clear derivatives centrally  through central counterparties, and make sure that you can actually then have  the ability to examine those central counterparties, and make sure that they're  well-run and operated.\n\nSo,  as long as you keep those major pieces in place, then I think you can make some  minor adjustments to the Dodd-Frank Act. Things that I've talked about and I  think other people at the Fed have talked about these same things is relief for  smaller banking institutions because smaller banks, if they fail, it's not  going to be systemic, it's not going to threaten the viability of the financial  system.\n\nThe  Volcker Rule probably could be implemented in a way that is less burdensome to  banks, and maybe gives banks and securities firms a little bit more flexibility  to intervene when prices go up sharply or down sharply, which is what you  actually want them to do in financial markets.\n\nI  think the news that we've seen in terms of financial reform actually seems to  be pretty positive. It's really more of about doing some changes at the margins  as opposed to wholesale changes that would really dismantle Dodd-Frank.\n\nI  think we really do remember the financial crisis, still, thank God. It was the  worst financial crisis that we've had since the Great Depression. The  unemployment rate soared, millions of people lost their homes. That's why we  got the Dodd-Frank Act. We just have to remember that we need to have a  financial system that's strong and resilient, and that the Dodd-Frank Act helps  us achieve that goal.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nQuestions? Yes? Audience Member: Yes,  I want to know how did working for Goldman Sachs impact your outlook as the  President?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nI  don't think it was the fact that I sort of worked for an investment bank that  was important. I think it was more important what I did in the investment bank.  I was in the economic research department, and I was basically someone who  basically supported the trading functions of the bank. And that was valuable to  me when I came to the Fed because it allowed me to learn a lot about how  markets actually work, how markets actually function.\n\nAnd  we got deep into the financial crisis. What we saw is the financial markets  started to not work well. People lost confidence, they lost trust. They started  to disengage, and so my experience at Goldman Sachs, I think, actually helped  me understand what was going wrong and then maybe how to address it.\n\nSo,  in the fall of 2008, we introduced a number of very special liquidity  facilities, things that we'd never done before, and I think my experience at  Goldman and my understanding of how markets work, and my ability to reach out  to people that I knew in the marketplace to talk to them, like what's going  on?, and understand what they were saying to me, probably helped me.\n\nYou  want to have—we're having a lot of transition at the Federal Reserve right now,  and people ask me the question of, “What do you want with the Fed?” I think you  want diversity. Diversity, I'm not just talking about diversity of gender and  ethnicity but I'm also talking about diversity of background. So you don't want  everyone to be a PhD economist from academia. You don't want everyone to be a  markets person from Goldman Sachs. You want to have a mix because those  different perspectives, when blended together, can lead to better policy  outcomes.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nSomeone  else?  This is a quiet audience.  Yes?\n\nAudience  Member: I  had a question. You mentioned that you wanted diversity, both through academics  and bankers. The new Fed Chairman-elect Jerome Powell, he doesn’t have an academic  background. He's more of a Wall Street kind of guy. Do you think that's going  to have an impact on his term looking at the Fed?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nI  think Jay's going to do very well. The thing that you really want I think as a  Fed Chair—I don't think an Economic PhD is required. There are plenty of PhD  economists within the Federal Reserve system. The Chair does not have to have a  PhD in Economics.\n\nWhat  you want is someone who's smart—which he is.   You want someone who actually works hard—which he does. And you want  someone who's not an ideologue. And the reason why I say not an ideologue,  because you don't want people to think that they're so convinced that they know  how the world works, that they ignore the evidence that contradicts that. And  Jay is not an ideologue. So I think he's a fine choice to lead the Fed. I'm not  concerned about it in the least.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nOne  more question, or two more? Certainly, yes? Audience  Member: You  mentioned a lot of things to address income mobility, but I'm wondering where  you see the role of community banks going forward? Back in the day, they were  very important. But now we have a sort of new different kind of large bank  system. Do you see community banks still playing a role in that mobility?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nI  think community banks play a hugely important role. We basically still have  about 7,000 banks in the United States.   And only about five or six of them are really, really large.\n\nSo,  community banks play a unique role because I think they basically are much  closer to their customers than large banks are. And so they play a particularly  important role in local communities in terms of supplying credit to small  businesses and to other customers where they know more about the customer. And  so they can actually make more nuanced credit-lending decisions.\n\nSo,  I think they're really important. They also play a very important role in  community, in supporting the community. So, I'm a big fan of community banks. I  mean my great-grandfather was a community banker, actually, in Sylvania, Ohio.\n\nI  remember when I was young, I got shown his bank book during the Great  Depression, and the bank book had a lot of debits, and these were debits where  he was basically putting money into the bank to keep the bank alive during the  Great Depression, and the bank did actually make it through the Great  Depression.\n\nAnd  so I'm very much a supporter of community banks.  I think they perform a very important role.  Which is why we want to have a regulatory regime that suits, not just the big  banks, but also is appropriate for the small banks.  We need to have a regulatory regime that's  proportioned to the risks that the institution poses to the financial system  and the role that the institutions play supplying credit, especially to small  businesses and households where I think community banks play a very  particularly important role.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nWe  have time for one more question?\n\nAudience Member: To  follow up on that then, could you comment on the role of fintech lenders  vis-a-vis community banks?\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nWell,  fintech lending I think is still very much in its early days, early stages.  This is like peer-to-peer lending. I think it's something that we are following  quite closely. I think there's a couple of questions about it. One is how will  it actually perform through the business cycle?\n\nSo,  today, it's performing okay—that doesn't really tell us that much because  economic times are relatively good. So the real question is how it's going to  perform through the business cycle. And the second question I think is going to  be about regulation. Are there regulations that need to be put in place to make  sure that they're on an equivalent playing field to lenders that are subject to  bank regulations.\n\nSo,  I think those are sort of the two questions on the table. I think we want to be  careful not to just tamp down any innovation. I think we need to be open-minded  to new innovations and developments that we see in the marketplace, but at the  same time we don't want to necessarily sort of buy into them hook, line and  sinker until we've actually seen that the business models are robust to the  entire business cycle.\n\nEugene  White:\n\nWell,  thank you very much!\n\nPresident  Dudley:\n\nYes,  thank you.",

    "text": "It is always a pleasure to speak with the business community given your important role in the community and in the region. I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce and to be part of this distinguished panel. Thank you for inviting me today.\n\nAs you know I have the honor of serving as the president and CEO of the New York Fed, one of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks that together with the Board of Governors in Washington make up the Federal Reserve System, our nation’s central bank. As head of the New York Fed I am vice-chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body that sets our nation’s monetary policy.\n\nThe Fed was founded 100 years ago in 1913 to advance economic and financial stability. Over this century our nation’s economic output and standard of living has increased greatly, but the United States also faced many different challenges—ranging from the Great Depression of the 1930s to the Great Inflation of the 1970s and most recently the financial crisis.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is independent from politics and the national government but is subject to oversight by Congress, which has set our dual mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment and price stability. The Federal Reserve is structured to ensure that the economic needs of people and businesses in every part of our country are fully considered in our policy deliberations.  What I learn in my visit to Staten Island today is an important input to our policymaking process.\n\nAs New York Fed president I try to get out of my New York City office as much as I can to get a sense of regional economic conditions across what is known as the second Federal Reserve District. I’ve traveled throughout New York, New Jersey and Puerto Rico in recent years and plan to visit Fairfield County, upstate New York and Queens later this year.\n\nThese visits give me the opportunity to explain what the Federal Reserve is doing and to get your thoughts about the state of our economy and the challenges that you face.\n\nToday, I will focus on the economic outlook regionally and nationally.  After that, I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about what the Fed does, and about the economic outlook.  As always, my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the FOMC or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nRegional Economic Conditions\n\nThe financial crisis underscored the fact that the world is a complicated place and that the insights of professional economists and financial experts must be supplemented with a broader set of perspectives from households and businesses. Today’s visit is in that spirit—I want to talk about what we are seeing in the economy but also to hear from you firsthand about your assessment of economic conditions.\n\nSo what do we see? Let me start with basic economic characteristics. While Staten Island is the city’s least populous borough, its population has grown steadily and rapidly, more than doubling in the last half-century to close to one-half million residents.  On its own, Staten Island is larger than all other cities in the entire New York-New Jersey region, with the obvious exception of New York City.\n\nIn many ways—homeownership, educational attainment, income, and demographics—Staten Island more closely resembles the nation than the rest of New York City.  For example, the homeownership rate on Staten Island is almost 70 percent, well above the 30 percent average homeownership rate citywide.  Still, with a sizable proportion of the borough’s workers commuting to Manhattan (about ¼ of the island’s workers or more than 50,000 people) Staten Island’s economy is closely tied to the rest of the city’s economy, as well as to northern New Jersey’s.  Thus, when Manhattan sees brisk job growth, the residents of Staten Island have better opportunities.\n\nThe New York City economy continues to rebound strongly from the 2008-09 downturn—more strongly than the nation as a whole.  The New York Fed’s index of economic activity for the city has grown solidly and steadily for the past three years, signaling a robust rebound in the local economy.  This strength is reflected in strong job creation: while the U.S. economy has thus far recovered only about two-thirds of the jobs lost during the recession, New York City has recovered all its lost jobs and then some.  In fact, total employment in the Big Apple recently surpassed not only its pre-crisis peak of 2008 but also its all-time peak of 1969.\n\nHere on Staten Island job creation has not been quite as robust over the past couple years.  It should be recognized, however, that Staten Island’s economy was actually more resilient than Manhattan’s during the recession, experiencing only minimal job losses.  Staten Island’s key industries—local-market sectors like health, education and retail trade—tend to be less susceptible to sharp economic downturns than more cyclical sectors, like manufacturing, construction and finance.\n\nEven so, not all indicators of the local economy are improving.  Unemployment remains stubbornly high, at just over 8 percent.  And home prices, though recovering gradually, are still down about 15 percent from where they were back in 2007.  This compares to nationally where they are down about 25 percent on average.\n\nThe New York Fed’s quarterly measures of household credit conditions signal some recent improvement, though there clearly remain pockets of financial stress among families here.  At year-end, for those people with a credit report, average debt per person in Staten Island ticked up, rising to about $67,000, after trending down for a number of years.  A similar uptick in debt was observed nationwide, potentially signaling that households are now somewhat more willing to take on debt.  Delinquency rates, however, are still fairly high:  9.7 percent of all debt in the county is seriously delinquent, well above the national rate.  On a more positive note, delinquency rates on Staten Island are declining and are at their lowest level in 3½ years.  Mortgage delinquency rates, though still above the national rate, are also at a 3½-year low.\n\nRecently, of course, Staten Island’s greatest challenge has been the massive disruption and destruction caused by Superstorm Sandy.  While many parts of the New York City metropolitan region were hard-hit by the storm, the devastation was particularly severe here on Staten Island.  And this is something that has had large consequences for some of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Nearly 150 of our employees call Staten Island their home.  While many, thankfully, were spared the full brunt of the storm, I know quite a few people whose homes were destroyed or severely damaged and others who lost many of their belongings.\n\nImmediately following Sandy, our Regional and Community Outreach function reached out to all of the affected communities as part of a needs assessment. We asked: \"How can the New York Fed best leverage our resources to help our community?\"\n\nAfter dozens of conversations with leaders of the community, we determined that pulling together key service providers under one roof would make a useful contribution. Our outreach team organized a free relief clinic in this very building. We brought together a wide variety of government agency representatives and other service providers.  I would like to acknowledge what is a long list:  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Office of the New York Attorney General, the New York State Department of Financial Services, the New York Legal Assistance Group, Staten Island Legal Services, the Legal Aid Society, MFY Legal Services, various bar associations, New York City Department of Small Business Services, Center for New York City Neighborhoods, Neighborhood Housing Services of Staten Island and the Northfield Local Community Development Corporation. I’m proud to say we were able to assist over 150 Staten Islanders, including homeowners, tenants and small business owners.\n\nWe also heard that it could be challenging to find key recovery information and advice online. So once again, we pulled key resources under one roof—or I should say one URL. We developed a Sandy Information Center with the best information we could find for folks impacted by Sandy—including key deadline dates along with expert legal, finance and insurance guidance. Over 2,000 have benefited from our web resources.\n\nWhile we are not yet back to normal in neighborhoods like Midland Beach, Oakwood Beach, New Dorp Beach and Tottenville, the situation is improving and I expect that this recovery will continue over the coming year.  We are going to continue to examine where we can provide assistance in supporting this effort.  One effort, for example, is to provide assistance in collecting detailed data on the areas that were impacted by the storm.\n\nFrom talking to some local business people late last November, we know that many residents and businesses had to wait a long time for insurance claims and small business loans, as well as to get their heat and power restored.  We also know that eight public schools were closed.\n\nUnfortunately, timely statistics pertaining specifically to Staten Island’s economy are scarce, thus making it hard to accurately gauge the impact from Sandy or the strength and breadth of the ensuing recovery.  So we truly value input from all of you—people on the front lines of the local economy—to assist us in gauging recent trends and developments in Staten Island’s economy.\n\nNational Economic Conditions\n\nTurning to the national outlook, the U.S. economy remains on the slow growth track that has persisted since the recession ended in mid-2009. In fact, real gross domestic product (GDP) grew just 1.7 percent in 2012, below the 2.2 percent rate of the preceding two years. This lackluster and disappointing performance masks the fact that the underlying conditions that support growth have been gradually improving. However, in the near-term, this improvement in fundamentals is being offset by federal tax increases and spending cuts, which economists call “fiscal drag.”  The most obvious example of this is the end of the partial payroll tax holiday at the beginning of this year.  This reduced the take-home pay for all those that pay into the Social Security system.\n\nIn a recent speech to the Economic Club of New York, I discussed a number of areas where economic fundamentals have improved.  Here, let me concentrate instead on some areas of the economy where the impact of this improvement in fundamentals has been most evident: consumer spending, the housing market, and investment in equipment and software.\n\nDespite the increase in payroll taxes and in high-income tax rates, real—that is, inflation-adjusted—personal consumption expenditures rose solidly in January and February.  As has been the case for some time, the growth of consumer spending has been led by purchases of durable goods.  Car and light truck sales in the first quarter were at the highest pace since the fourth quarter of 2007.  This growth in consumer spending probably is due, in part, to improvements in labor market conditions, household balance sheets and household access to credit.  However, retail sales were quite weak in March, suggesting that the tax increases that occurred at the start of the year may be beginning to have a material effect.\n\nAfter a long period of being a drag on the economy, the housing market is now providing lift to economic activity, with upward trends evident in housing starts, home sales, and home prices.  To see why this is so important, in 2009 residential investment exerted a 0.4 percentage point drag on GDP growth, while in 2013 it is likely to provide a boost to growth on the order of 0.5 percentage point—a swing of nearly a full percentage point.  In addition, rising home prices can create positive spillovers to the rest of the economy as higher home prices lift household wealth and reduce the number of homeowners with negative equity.\n\nBusiness investment in equipment and software, another component of private final demand, strengthened in the fourth quarter, and shipments and orders for nondefense capital goods suggest further growth in the first quarter.  Moreover, indicators of the U.S. manufacturing sector, including the ISM manufacturing index and most Federal Reserve regional manufacturing indexes, point to continued moderate growth in the sector.\n\nSo why isn't the U.S. economy growing more quickly? The most important reason is the sharp shift in federal fiscal policy from mild restraint in 2012 to much greater restraint in 2013. The increase in payroll tax rates, the rise in high income tax rates, the increase in taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act, and the sequester will result in fiscal drag of about 1¾ percentage points of GDP in 2013, an unusually large amount of fiscal restraint when the economy doesn’t have strong forward momentum and unemployment is still elevated.\n\nIn terms of the labor market, we have seen only a moderate improvement in labor market conditions over the past six months or so. After an encouraging pick up in the pace of job creation around the turn of the year, the employment report for March showed a gain of only 88,000 jobs. While I don’t want to read too much into a single month’s data, this underscores the need to wait and see how the economy develops before declaring victory prematurely.  I’d note that we saw similar slowdowns in job creation in 2011 and 2012 after pickups in the job creation rate and this, along with the large amount of fiscal restraint hitting the economy now, makes me more cautious.\n\nSince September, payroll employment has increased an average of 188,000 per month, compared with an average of 172,000 per month over the previous two years.  The unemployment rate has declined from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009 to 7.6 percent in March; however, much of the decrease is due to a fall in the number of people actively looking for a job.  Furthermore, as of March there were still almost 3 million fewer jobs than at the end of 2007, and the ratio of employed Americans to the working age population was actually lower than it was at the end of the recession.  Also, in an indication that employment is far from healthy, job finding rates have changed little since the recession. New York Fed staff research agrees with the broad consensus that cyclical factors are the major reason for the continued weakness in labor market conditions.\n\nIn sum, these developments lead me to expect sluggish real GDP growth over the course of 2013 of about 2 to 2½ percent.  As such, I anticipate that the unemployment rate will decline only modestly through the rest of the year.\n\nIn the near term, there is considerable uncertainty about the outlook, particularly because the multiplier effects from fiscal drag and sequestration are still unclear. This uncertainty should gradually decline—for better or for worse—over the coming months, as the sequester’s impact takes hold and more economic data come in, giving us a clearer picture of the forward momentum of the economy.\n\nInflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditure deflator, is currently well below the Federal Reserve's objective of 2 percent. There is substantial slack in the labor market and in the markets for goods and services, and underlying measures of inflation are subdued.  Moreover, peoples’ expectations of inflation remain well anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent longer-run objective. Thus, I conclude that the risk that inflation could significantly exceed our 2 percent objective is quite low over the next few years, even if the economy were to strengthen considerably.\n\nWith inflation well below its longer-run goal and high unemployment, the FOMC decided at its March meeting to maintain a “highly accommodative” policy stance: a federal funds rate in a range of 0 to 25 basis points with forward guidance based on economic thresholds.   Moreover, to support a stronger economic recovery, the FOMC is purchasing long-term Treasury securities at a rate of $45 billion per month and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at a rate of $40 billion per month, and will continue purchasing assets until it sees substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, conditional on ongoing assessment of benefits and costs.  Combined, these actions are intended to ease financial conditions and thereby help to establish a self-sustaining economic expansion.\n\nAs I stated in my recent Economic Club speech, the benefits of our asset purchases—as reflected in improving financial conditions and the quickening pace of interest-sensitive spending such as that on consumer durable goods, housing, and capital goods—exceeds the costs.  Furthermore, the labor market outlook has yet to show substantial improvement.  Consequently, I see the current pace of asset purchases as appropriate.\n\nAt some point, I expect that I will see sufficient evidence of improved economic momentum to lead me to favor gradually dialing back the pace of asset purchases.  Of course, any subsequent bad news could lead me to favor dialing them back up again. As Chairman Bernanke said in his press conference following the March FOMC meeting \"when we see that the…situation has changed in a meaningful way, then we may well adjust the pace of purchases in order to keep the level of accommodation consistent with the outlook.\"\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me reiterate how pleased I am to be here on Staten Island and to have the opportunity to speak to the members of the Chamber.  Parts of Staten Island were among the most devastated areas in the region and we at the Federal Reserve Bank are committed to doing all that we can to help people and businesses recover. Many obstacles remain to be overcome but I am confident that Staten Island will meet the challenges that lay ahead.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to be here.  Who wouldn’t want to be in Paris—anytime—let alone in September?  My comments today will focus on how over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives reform fits in with the broader financial reform agenda and those aspects of the reform effort in OTC derivatives that could potentially fall short relative to those broader objectives.  My short answer, which I will elaborate on in my remarks, is that the OTC derivatives reform effort fits in very well with the broader reform agenda, but there are significant risks that we will fall short in this arena relative to what we are likely to achieve elsewhere.\n\nAs I see it, the G20 reform effort for OTC derivatives has three broad goals:\n\nSystemic risk is being reduced in a number of different ways.  First, mandating the standardization, whenever possible, and central clearing of OTC derivative trades can reduce risk by transforming a complex web of bilateral firm exposures into a smaller set of net exposures between each dealer and the central counterparty (CCP).  Given their role in fostering financial stability, robust financial market infrastructures (FMIs) that are properly risk-managed can serve as a source of strength in times of stress.  Central clearing can also reduce systemic risk by requiring collateral from the participants.  To the extent that the OTCD reform effort results in the greater use of collateral, that should also help make the system safer.\n\nSecond, increasing capital and liquidity requirements, improving governance, risk management, and resolution and recovery, as well as implementation of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) promulgated by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) should make FMIs more robust and resilient.  FMIs performed well during the financial crisis, but with OTCD reform, we are asking FMIs to do even more, so the bar needs to be higher.\n\nThird, firm-level risk management is being strengthened in a variety of ways such as requiring mandatory margin requirements for bespoke, non-cleared trades.  Firms need to understand the risks associated with OTC derivatives activity and set aside capital and exchange margin to cover these risks.  Moreover, authorities are developing supervisory approaches to oversee market infrastructures and participants to ensure compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks.\n\nActivity in the OTC derivatives market is gradually being moved into clearer view.  In particular, over time, mandatory reporting to trade repositories (TRs) and access to that data by regulators should facilitate the ability for supervisors and others to assess building risks in the global financial market more quickly and comprehensively.\n\nImproving competition and protecting against market abuse are also important.  These objectives are being accomplished by the increased use of electronic trading platforms and improving access to CCPs.  This should lead to more competitive markets that will offer participants better liquidity and pricing and a greater degree of transparency.\n\nIn general, I think that the first two objectives of OTC derivatives reform fit in well with the goals of the broader financial reform effort undertaken in the wake of the financial crisis.  I would characterize the goals of the broader effort as:\n\nImplementation of OTC derivatives reform should make the markets more resilient and should reduce the risk that they will be a source of contagion in stressed environments.    Also, the risk of funding runs should be reduced by the increase in the quality of information on firm exposures that can be made available to regulators, and, in principle, through increased disclosure to market participants.\n\nI also think that OTC derivatives reform is an important complement to the emphasis placed on strengthening individual institutions, which is part of the broader reform agenda.  Financial stability is not just about individual institutions but also about how the entire system interacts.  For example, are the incentives in the system appropriate and does the system amplify or dampen shocks?  Thus, it is important that reform efforts not concentrate exclusively on the systemically important financial institutions, but also that these efforts focus on the market products and practices and the linkages among markets, market participants and infrastructures.\n\nDespite the progress made to date, I do have some concerns about the OTC derivatives reform effort.  My first concern is about pace.  For example, it seems to me that we have made much more progress in strengthening individual institutions through higher bank capital and liquidity requirements than we have made in reducing risk in the OTCD space.   Now some of this is inevitable because OTCD reform is harder and we are not as far along.  It requires the creation of new institutions to clear such trades or to house the trade information.  It also requires national legislation to be flexible enough so that it can work coherently on a global basis.  The difficulty in harmonizing the regulatory treatment of cross-border OTCD activity is a good example of this.  Parenthetically, I’d add that I am very pleased to see the breakthrough achieved between Europe and the U.S. this summer.\n\nRegardless of the cause, because of the slower pace, we are not yet close to a harmonized, robust OTCD system.  Thus, we can’t ascertain whether we have achieved what we set out to achieve—that is, reducing the amount of risk in the system, making the infrastructure more secure, and increasing the flow of information so that regulators and others can develop a more coherent view of what is happening in the global financial system.\n\nI’m also worried that even when we have finished revamping the architecture and regulation of OTC derivatives activities, reform may not go far enough in a number of respects.  First, I am concerned that trades may not be standardized to the fullest degree possible.  A preliminary analysis undertaken by the Financial Stability Board that compares the costs of clearing and margin requirements of standardized trades versus bespoke trades suggests that the economics with respect to costs favors standardizing OTCD trades whenever possible. However, the wider spreads that might be earned on bespoke trades, because of their greater opacity, could swing the needle the other way, with the higher profits on bespoke trades more than offsetting their higher costs.  It is too soon to say yet, but we should be prepared to push harder for further standardization should the desired degree of standardization that we are striving for not materialize.\n\nI also worry that implementation of the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures could falter over time.  This could happen for several reasons.  In particular, we should recognize that there is a tension between the profit motive of for-profit CCPs and full compliance with the PFMIs.  Put simply, some CCPs will prefer to avoid the full costs of compliance.   In other words, there will always be a risk of a race to the bottom, which we must continually push against.\n\nIn this respect, the effort could also falter if countries were to fail to enact the relevant legislation and policies to put the PFMIs in practice.  For the global system to be robust, the requirements for CCPs will need to be enforced across the different geographic regimes.  I am also worried about fragmentation.  In particular, I worry about the proliferation of TRs and CCPs geographically—in some cases in each of the major asset classes.  In the case of CCPs, fragmentation would bring two costs.  First, the netting benefits would be reduced and, second, the system would be more complex.  In an ideal world, I would prefer very few, very robust CCPs, rather than a proliferation of many, less robust CCPs.  But whether that is what we will get is unclear to me at this point.\n\nFinally, I am worried that we are not going to achieve the full benefits from trade repositories.  Regulators, market participants and TRs must continue to work together to ensure that comprehensive, and meaningful data are being reported to TRs and that authorities have the ability to access and analyze the data from the TRs.  Although authorities currently receive data, the data are often fragmented and reported in different formats or are not comparable across TRs. This poses challenges for regulators and supervisors of market participants and global CCPs as well as authorities more broadly.  Aside from the issues with TR fragmentation, data quality and regulatory access to data, we could be leaving considerable money on the table by not using the TR dataset to increase transparency into the marketplace more broadly.\n\nMoving forward on all of these issues will require global coordination and continued efforts across all stakeholders.  Authorities must continue to coordinate their oversight of global infrastructures . Where FMIs are “global,” that is providing services across multiple jurisdictions and in multiple currencies, it is important for the relevant authorities to find efficient ways to cooperate with each other to effectively carry out their respective responsibilities.  Additionally, where there are overlapping or contradicting regulations, authorities must provide clear guidance to the market on how regulation will be applied.\n\nOne final point: What matters is not the standardization of OTC derivatives, central clearing or the use of the trade repositories per se, but instead the results that flow from these efforts.  These institutions are just devices to achieve an end—less risk, more robustness and greater transparency.  In the end, we will need to assess our progress on OTCD reforms against those broader qualitative metrics.\n\nThank you very much for your kind attention.",

    "text": "It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak here today alongside my fellow Reserve Bank presidents, Loretta Mester and Dennis Lockhart.  Today’s event comes almost exactly two years since I delivered a set of remarks at NYU School of Law that covered various aspects of what we know as the “too big to fail” problem.  In view of some significant milestones that have occurred over the past two years, I would like today to briefly review my sense of the work that has been accomplished on this critical issue, and the work that still remains to be completed.\n\nAs always, what I have to say reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System. 1\n\nBroadly speaking, the regulatory reforms that the U.S. has adopted since the crisis have been designed to address the risks posed by large financial institutions in two related ways.  First, our reforms are designed to reduce the probability that large financial institutions will fail by requiring those institutions to be more resilient to stress.  Second, a set of resolution-related reforms are intended to limit the consequences to the financial sector if a failure by such an institution still were to occur.\n\nGiven the limited time on this panel, I will not review in detail the post-crisis comprehensive capital and liquidity framework that the Federal Reserve has put in place.  However, from the perspective of addressing too big to fail, it is important to highlight the Federal Reserve rule finalized this year that imposes risk-based capital surcharges on the handful of U.S. global systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs).  Under this framework, a GSIB’s risk-based capital surcharge will reflect the degree to which its failure would impact the financial system.  In effect, the risk-based capital surcharge confronts each U.S. GSIB with the choice to either reduce its systemic footprint or instead to hold more capital.\n\nThe policy approach to too big to fail recognizes, of course, that we can reduce but cannot completely eliminate the possibility of a large financial institution’s failure.  Therefore, a second aim of our post-crisis reforms has been to limit the adverse consequences that would result if a large financial institution were to fail.  That is, large financial firms need to be capable of being successfully resolved without creating unacceptable collateral damage to the rest of the financial system and to the economy.\n\nIn my November 2013 speech, I noted that an important foundation for making the resolution of our largest banking firms feasible would be to require, at the holding company level, sufficient minimum amounts of long-term debt that could be used to absorb losses in a single point of entry resolution.  Important progress has been made on this front, both in the form of the Federal Reserve’s recent issuance of a proposed rule to establish long-term debt and total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements for U.S. GSIBs and the announcement last week by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) of an agreed upon international minimum TLAC standard.  It is notable that in several important respects the proposed U.S. rules are stronger than the FSB standard.\n\nWith these new proposed requirements, if losses were to wipe out a firm’s capital and push a firm into resolution, a sufficient amount of long-term unsecured debt would be available to absorb additional losses through a “bail in” process, recapitalizing the firm with no taxpayer bailout and without generating systemic financial contagion.  These proposed requirements should also improve market discipline by ensuring that each GSIB has a class of creditors who are clearly “at risk,” and therefore have an incentive to monitor the firm’s risk-taking.\n\nIn my 2013 speech, I also called for further work to address the challenges in a resolution scenario posed by potentially disruptive close-out of cross-border derivatives contracts.  Here too, important progress has been achieved over the past two years.\n\nThanks to productive collective action by the private sector in dialogue with U.S. and international authorities, an initial set of 18 GSIBs and other large dealer banks have adhered to the 2014 International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) resolution stay protocol covering OTC bilateral derivatives in connection with last year’s G-20 summit.  Under the protocol, counterparties agreed to the cross-border enforceability of existing statutory stays on resolution-related early termination and other default rights in OTC bilateral derivatives contracts.\n\nWith support from the U.S. and other key jurisdictions, the FSB subsequently called on all GSIBs and other firms with significant derivatives exposures to adhere to the protocol by the end of 2015.  In addition, the FSB requested that such contractual terms be incorporated into other financial contracts with resolution-related termination features−such as contracts relating to repo and securities lending arrangements.  This goal has been accomplished this past week, and represents another positive milestone in improving cross-border resolvability.  Importantly, both the proposed U.S. long-term debt requirement and provisions in the resolution stay protocol support resolution under both Title I and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nWhile we should recognize the extent of progress that has been made to set the basic foundations for the cross-border resolution of a GSIB, it is equally important in my view to recognize the significant challenges that still remain, and the important work that still needs to be carried out by both firms and authorities.\n\nBoth within the official sector and within the largest banking firms, important work remains to be done to advance the capacity to effectively operationalize a GSIB resolution.\n\nExamples include: establishing a more rational and less complex legal entity structure that takes into account the best alignment of legal entities and business lines to improve the firm’s resolvability; ensuring the continuity of shared services that support critical operations and core business lines throughout the resolution process; and improved arrangements to enable appropriate access by the firm in resolution to Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs), in a manner that is consistent with the need to ensure the safe and sound operation of FMIs. This ongoing work is being pursued through a variety of channels, including through the joint Federal Reserve / FDIC review of Title I resolution plans, the Federal Reserve’s horizontal supervisory review of recovery and resolution preparedness, and in the international work of the FSB. In addition, while Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes the FDIC Orderly Liquidation Fund as a source of backstop liquidity provision for a firm undergoing a Title II resolution, no equivalent official sector liquidity backstop is available under the bankruptcy regime.  Since it is the bankruptcy regime that is relevant for the purposes of resolution planning under Title I, this is a challenge that firms need to address under that framework. Further work remains as well with respect to the derivatives close-out issue in resolution.  A key next step will be for the U.S. and other major jurisdictions to put in place regulations and supervisory measures that will require non-bank counterparties of GSIBs to trade with the GSIBs on terms equivalent to those found in the ISDA resolution stay protocol.  This further step is needed in order to limit the potential for arbitrage within the market and to promote greater stability in the event of a necessary resolution. As we move this work forward, we should acknowledge and take stock of the significant advances achieved over the past few years, while at the same time remain focused on our responsibility to address the challenges that remain. Thank you for your kind attention. 1 Dianne Dobbeck, Robert Fitchette, Charles Gray, Joyce Hansen, HaeRan Kim, Kristin Malcarney and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\nThis ongoing work is being pursued through a variety of channels, including through the joint Federal Reserve / FDIC review of Title I resolution plans, the Federal Reserve’s horizontal supervisory review of recovery and resolution preparedness, and in the international work of the FSB.\n\nIn addition, while Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes the FDIC Orderly Liquidation Fund as a source of backstop liquidity provision for a firm undergoing a Title II resolution, no equivalent official sector liquidity backstop is available under the bankruptcy regime.

    "text": "On behalf of the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York and our co-sponsors—the U.S. Department of the  Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading  Commission—I would like to welcome you to this year’s conference on the  structure of the U.S. Treasury market.   As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not  necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve  System. 1\n\nThis is the  third year the New York Fed has co-hosted the Treasury market structure  conference, which provides an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the  changing landscape of the Treasury market.   Many of you remember the market volatility of October 15, 2014, that  precipitated the need for additional engagement between the private and public  sectors about Treasury market structure.   The Joint Staff Report on the Treasury flash event, the Treasury  Department’s subsequent request for information, and the work that has followed  identified a number of changes that have reshaped the Treasury market over the  last decade.  These include the increased  electronification of trading, the changing nature of intermediation and  liquidity, and the entry of new market participants.  In light of these changes, the Joint Staff  Report highlighted four important priority areas for additional work.  In taking these efforts forward, we have benefited  from ongoing engagement with market participants and other members of the  public.\n\nThe first  priority is gatherings like this one, where both private and official sector  participants come together to study and share views on what the market’s  evolution means for its structure and liquidity.  Understanding how the Treasury market is  evolving can enable us to be good stewards of its trajectory.\n\nA second  priority is improving the availability of data on activities in the cash  market.  After the historic volatility  that occurred on October 15, 2014, the official sector had limited access to  transaction data.  This resulted in a  months-long lag in the process to gather and analyze data from the event.  The introduction this year of transaction  data reporting by broker-dealers to the official sector is thus a critical step  forward.  While closing this data gap for  the official sector is an important milestone, work remains to ensure that the  scope of collection is sufficiently complete and dynamic to maintain coverage of relevant firms, as intermediaries and liquidity providers evolve.  One initiative in this direction is the Board of Governors’ plan to collect transaction data from depository institutions.\n\nLooking ahead, I  expect that a continuing priority will be increasing data transparency to all  market participants and to the public in a manner that supports—and does not  harm—market liquidity and integrity.   Part of the successful evolution of the modern Treasury market will be  adapting to the data needs of its participants. I believe transaction data reporting  to the public based on careful study will ensure that the Treasury market does  not fall behind other markets, will promote a robust and level playing field,  and will help safeguard the liquidity characteristics that make the Treasury  market the benchmark for risk-free trading around the world.\n\nThe rise of  electronic trading, another market feature highlighted in the Joint Staff  Report, helped to identify a third priority area: the market practices and  risks associated with the Treasury market.   Market infrastructure—including the financing of Treasury transactions,  as well as the clearing and settlement of those transactions—seldom merits  investor attention until an element that is vital to smooth functioning of the  market goes awry.  The history of financial  markets is filled with examples—some recent—in which confidence in trading  collapsed after market participants no longer knew or could assess the  underlying risk of market engagement, leading them to disengage.  While such disengagement may be rational from  the perspective of an individual participant, it is destructive to the  collective market function.\n\nA major  infrastructure issue for the Treasury market has been the clearing and  settlement practices of the cash market.   This can be opaque, with a majority of trades cleared away from central  counterparties (CCPs).  While central  clearing is more uniformly used in other segments of the Treasury market—such  as futures—many market participants elect to clear and settle cash Treasury  transactions in a bilateral fashion.   This process includes many market participants: trading venues, clearing  agents, and clearing banks.  No single  participant has a view of the entire clearing and settlement system.\n\nThe Treasury  Market Practices Group (TMPG), a New York Fed-sponsored group of market  professionals working to support the integrity and efficiency of the Treasury  market, has concentrated its recent efforts on this topic.  Preliminary findings include an increasing  volume of linked trades that clear centrally on one side and bilaterally on the  other. This work has also uncovered  information asymmetries in clearance and settlement risk management, which  potentially could lead to a mispricing of these risks.  Moreover, increased understanding about the  depth, breadth, and durability of credit arrangements that support clearance  and settlement seems desirable.  This  would improve market integrity through greater understanding of risk throughout  the clearing and settlement process and how it is affected by different conditions.\n\nSince the  financial crisis, there has been an effort to strengthen the resiliency of repo  market infrastructure, which is another important element of Treasury market  plumbing.  Immediately after the crisis,  the Federal Reserve was active in pushing reform of the tri-party repo market,  which had been a locus of stress in 2008.   More recently, Treasury repo markets have undergone further changes,  including market adaptations to post-financial crisis regulations, and the  introduction of multiple programs expanding access to central clearing to a  wider range of market participants.   These markets also have been affected by efforts to set heightened  expectations for CCPs with regard to liquidity risk management, margins, and  governance and recovery planning.  This  is consistent with the Treasury Department’s recommendation that regulators  ensure appropriate risk management at CCPs and other financial market  infrastructures.  For example, earlier  this month, the SEC approved the Capped Contingency Liquidity Facility—a  liquidity risk management tool for the DTCC’s Fixed Income Clearing Corporation  (FICC).  This tool helps to ensure that  FICC will have sufficient liquidity to cover the default of a Government  Securities Division member to which FICC has the largest exposure.  This development reflects another positive  step toward a safer centrally cleared repo market, and aligns well with broader  official sector efforts to maintain a well-functioning and robust Treasury repo  market.\n\nFinally, the  Joint Staff Report identified the importance of strong interagency monitoring  of the Treasury market, in close collaboration with the public.  Judging by this gathering, the commitment to  this task is strong—which is good because many questions remain.  How can the Joint Member Staffs and private  stakeholders best collaborate to ensure stability in the Treasury market as the  market structure evolves and new technologies are applied?  How should practices and culture evolve  accordingly?  Will new technology and  automation in the marketplace introduce unexpected challenges or risks to  Treasury market participants?  Are there  opportunities to improve market transparency in a way that sheds light on risk  issues that emerge as the market continues to evolve?  Are the regulatory requirements imposed upon  the Treasury market appropriate in the current environment?  Has a competitive level playing field been  maintained given the evolving structure?   And, are there any changes that could improve the functioning,  efficiency and/or integrity of the Treasury market?\n\nAs I highlighted  before, answering such questions well could require greater transparency.  It is important for officials and market  participants to fully understand the range of market elements.  These include the relative size of  transaction volumes by various players, the breadth and resiliency of platforms  used to facilitate risk transfer, and the robustness of market infrastructure  under contingent circumstances.  More  broadly, interagency efforts and collaboration with the public to shed light on  the evolving structure and its risks are critical to protecting Treasury market  function and supporting investor confidence.   Because we benefit from the Treasury market being the deepest and most  liquid market for government securities, complacency should not be an  option.  We need to work together to  ensure that the longstanding confidence in the Treasury market is sustained in  the future.\n\nThis conference  provides an excellent opportunity to continue this discussion and work on these  issues.  Thank you for coming.  I look forward to today’s dialogue and the  ongoing engagement between the Joint Member Staffs and the public.",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to be here today and to have the opportunity to talk about the role of economics and economists at the Reserve Banks.  Economics is a critical discipline at the New York Fed, just as it is at the Board of Governors and the other Reserve Banks.\n\nNevertheless, I expect that my perspective will differ a bit from that of Eric, Charlie, or Narayana 1 . In part, this is because my background is different.  Although I have a Ph.D. from Berkeley, unlike Charlie and Narayana, I never spent time in academia, and, unlike Eric, I spent most of my career not in public service, but working in the private sector.  My focus during my time in the private sector was also somewhat different than my colleagues, with an emphasis on those issues that affect financial markets. Don't get me wrong, I am very happy I got a Ph.D. in economics, the training has been invaluable.  It's just that my career path is a bit unusual relative to other central bankers, so that must influence my perspective.\n\nOf course, another important point of differentiation is where I am now and the unique role that the New York Fed performs within the Federal Reserve System.  All of the Federal Reserve Banks have their areas of specialization.  In my opinion, the New York Fed has at least four that are worthy of mention today because these affect the work of the New York Fed's economists.\n\nFirst, we are the operational arm of the Federal Reserve, responsible for the implementation of monetary policy.  This means we have a unique set of relationships with the securities dealer community and with respect to monitoring financial markets.  It also means that we work very closely with the Board of Governors and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in implementing monetary policy.\n\nSecond, we have a unique endowment and responsibility by virtue of our location.  New York City is a global financial center, and finance is a very important aspect of the Second District's economy. Most of the largest global financial institutions have a major presence here.  With delegated authority from the Board of Governors, we are responsible for the supervision of most of the major financial institutions headquartered in our district, as well as numerous foreign banking organizations that do business here.\n\nThird, we are the fiscal agent for the Treasury and conduct the Treasury debt auctions on their behalf.  Additionally, we are responsible for Fedwire, which along with Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), is one of the two large-dollar, real-time payment systems in the U.S.\n\nFourth, we have a unique set of international duties.  We provide banking services to foreign central banks, including investment of reserves and administration of foreign exchange swap lines.  We also have a seat at the table in Basel with respect to the activities of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), its various committees, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).\n\nAs I noted earlier, economics is a critical discipline at the New York Fed.   The New York Fed economists are not just theoreticians.  Most have a strong empirical orientation and work very closely with those in the Bank that are responsible for the execution of policy—be it with respect to monetary policy, financial stability, supervision or payments services.  What's special to me about the Bank is how the economists and non-economists work together to develop practical policy solutions to real-world problems and then implement those policies effectively.\n\nThe breadth of activities at the New York Fed means that our economists contribute to policy in many different ways, working closely with other areas of the Bank including those who execute on our supervision, monetary policy, and payments responsibilities.  We have about 60 Ph.D. economists in our Research Group.  But we also have many more in other areas of the Bank, such as part of our open markets desk, in our supervision group, and in our risk functions.  In fact, many of those with economics Ph.D.s elsewhere in the Bank started their careers at the Bank in the Research Group.  They moved to other areas of the Bank as their interests evolved and they became less focused on research and more focused on policy development.  This movement of economists throughout the organization has helped build a deep reservoir of human capital within the Bank and has fostered close collaboration between Research and other areas of the Bank.\n\nOur model with respect to attracting economists into our Research Group is to hire people with strong research skills, with the highest academic credentials and who already have or are likely to develop a policy orientation related to the Bank's work.  We give our economists plenty of time and opportunity to conduct independent research, and expect them to publish their research in the major academic journals and to engage with the economics profession outside the Bank.  As they progress in research capability, we require economists to apply the skills and techniques they use in research to policy issues.  We expect that, as their academic careers develop, there will be a natural convergence between their research interests and the Bank's policy agenda. This usually happens as a matter of course because the Bank has a rich agenda of policy issues to work on and the economists at the Bank often have unique access to data and information that would not be available elsewhere.  The convergence works in both directions: research informs the policy work and policy work generates research questions. The end result is that our economists have the ability to be both highly respected in their disciplines from a research perspective, and also to make a significant contribution to policy development and implementation.  There is an excellent value proposition both for the Bank and the economists that work here, as indicated by the publication record of our economists and their contribution to policy initiatives.\n\nLet me give you some more concrete examples of what our economists have worked on or are currently working on.  I will focus on three broad buckets: prudential policy and financial stability; monetary and macroeconomic policy; and microeconomic and regional economic policy.\n\nPrudential policy and financial stability New York Fed economists, inside and outside our Research Group, provided substantial assistance to the design and development of the numerous emergency lender of last resort facilities implemented during the financial crisis.  This was done in conjunction with the Board of Governors, but the contributions from the New York Fed were critical because of our unique vantage point with respect to operational implementation, financial markets, and financial market infrastructures.\n\nIn a different vein, New York Fed economists assisted in designing, developing, and implementing supervisory stress testing, including the annual Comprehensive and Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) supervisory stress tests.  The New York Fed's economists perspectives and measurements on how downturns affect bank portfolio values was crucial to the design of these tests.  A critical aspect of CCAR was the development of independent detailed models for the key bank business lines to act as an independent check on the risk assessments by the banks. Of course, this effort also drew on work at the Board of Governors and the rest of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs well, our economists have played a role in developing international and domestic regulatory policy with respect to bank capital and liquidity standards.  For instance, measurement of capital losses over time, and various run-off rates of different types of liabilities by our economists informed this work.  Also, our economists' work on broker-dealer liquidity informed the design of the liquidity coverage ratio.\n\nFinally, our economists pay special attention to the emerging area of financial stability monitoring.  This takes place in a number of realms, including participation in the work of the Basel Committees, such as the Committee on Global Financial Stability (CGFS) of the BIS, that I currently chair, and the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS), which I once chaired, the numerous workgroups and committees of the Financial Stability Board, and ongoing contributions to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  With respect to the FSOC, for example, New York and Chicago Fed economists have played a key role in editing the FSOC annual reports.\n\nA few other examples of our economists' involvement in prudential and regulator policy include:\n\nMonetary policy and macroeconomic policy Economists provide invaluable input to the New York Fed President, who serves as Vice-Chairman of the FOMC, and to the Markets Group, which is responsible for the operational aspects of monetary policy implementation.\n\nThis work has many aspects, including:\n\nMicroeconomic and regional policy New York Fed economists also have important opportunities supporting microeconomic and regional policy.  These include the survey of consumer expectations, which will launch this month, and the consumer credit panel, which, using raw data supplied by Equifax, allows us to develop insights into consumer indebtedness at the micro-level.  These panels give us and the public unique insights into household beliefs and behavior.  One example is the work highlighting the growing aggregate student loan debt balance and repayment burden.\n\nAn important responsibility for each of the Reserve Banks is coverage of economic development in its region. A significant aspect of this work at the New York Fed involves our regional press briefings, business surveys, and white papers.  One notable example has been the New York Fed economists' work in developing a white paper that highlighted some key choices that Puerto Rican policymakers might make to eliminate structural constraints that have impinged on the Island's economic performance.\n\nI'm very pleased by the contributions of our economists in the Bank, whether they sit in the Research Group or elsewhere in the Bank.  I think we have helped to contribute to the considerable progress made on a number of fronts, including making the financial system more resilient and robust and helping make monetary policy more effective, even at the zero lower bound.\n\nBut there is much more work to do.  In particular, I think we have just scratched the surface in understanding how developments in one area, such as capital and liquidity requirements for large, complex financial institutions, affect other areas, such as effective monetary policy implementation. We still don't have well developed macro-models that incorporate a realistic financial sector.  We don't understand fully how large-scale asset purchase programs work to ease financial market conditions—is it the effect of the purchases on the portfolios of private investors, or alternatively is the major channel one of signaling?\n\nThere are many other riddles that remain to be solved.  How does one design an effective reference rate that is informative, verifiable and not vulnerable to manipulation?  If you manage to come up with one, how do you migrate the trillions of dollars of existing contracts to the new standard?  The U.S. unemployment rate has declined more sharply than one might expect given the economy's growth rate over the past few years.  Is this permanent or will it reverse if the economy continues to grow and the pressure on labor market resources increases in the coming years?   How does one end “too big to fail” for large global firms operating across different jurisdictions?  The list goes on and on.  There is plenty to work on and think about.\n\nFinally, let me take up one other question that Stan has posed: Do I think you need to be an economist to be the President at the New York Fed?  I don't think so.  If you look at the past five Presidents—Volcker, Corrigan, McDonough, Geithner, and myself, some have been economists, some haven't.  Yet I think all my predecessors have been very effective.\n\nI think there are other attributes that are more important than being an economist: 1) An analytical orientation; 2) the ability to synthesize a broad range of material so as to understand the interactions of markets, financial institutions, and regulatory and macroeconomic policy; 3) open-mindedness and pragmatism—the world is complicated and ever changing; and 4) the ability to lead—that means identifying the key issues and motivating people to do their best work in order to develop new insights and approaches.\n\nHaving an economics background probably helps, especially on the analytics side, but, in my view, is by no means necessary and certainly not sufficient.  One point on which I am certain is that regardless of the background of the President, having a very strong research group is essential.\n\nThanks for your kind attention.",

    "text": "To get right to the punch line, I favor a more flexible approach that incorporates a broader set of factors into the monetary policy decision-making process.  The world is complex and ever-changing.  There are many factors that can affect the economic outlook and the attainment of the Federal Reserve’s mandated objectives and, thereby, the appropriate stance of monetary policy. At the same time, I do not favor total discretion in which the monetary policy strategy is determined in an ad hoc fashion as we go along.  For monetary policy to be most effective, market participants, households and businesses need to be able to anticipate how the Federal Reserve is likely to respond to evolving conditions.  That is because the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy depends not only on what policymakers decide to do today, but also on what the public anticipates that the FOMC is likely to do in the future as the economic outlook changes and evolves. Our experience at the zero lower bound in recent years underscores how important expectations are in influencing the effectiveness of monetary policy.  Policymakers thus need to act in a systematic and consistent manner so that expectations are formed accurately and economic behavior can respond consistently with those expectations.  In my view, this consideration rules out a totally discretionary monetary policy. Before I critique the use of prescriptive rules in monetary policy-making, I’d like to make it clear at the start that the Taylor Rule (by which I mean the formulation based on John’s 1993 and 1999 papers) has a number of positive attributes that make it a useful reference for policymakers.  First, it has two parameters—the long-term inflation objective and the level of potential output—that map directly to the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives.  Second, the Rule has the desirable feature that when economic shocks push the economy away from the central bank’s objectives, the Taylor Rule prescribes a policy response that can help push the economy back toward the central bank’s goals.  Third, a number of studies have shown that Taylor Rules are robust in the sense that they generally perform quite well across a range of different assumptions about how the economy is structured and operates. Despite these attractive features, I don’t believe that any prescriptive rule, including the Taylor Rule, can take the place of a monetary policy framework that incorporates the FOMC’s collective assessment of the large number of factors that impact the economic outlook. As I see it, the Taylor Rule has several significant shortcomings that can be detrimental to the attainment of the Federal Reserve’s mandated objectives.  These shortcomings are not just theoretical; they have been very relevant to monetary policy in recent years.  First, the Taylor Rule is not forward-looking.  Its policy prescription is based on the current size of the output gap and the deviation of current inflation from the Fed’s objective, not on how these variables are likely to evolve in the future.  So, in a rapidly changing environment, the Taylor Rule and other similar prescriptive rules will wind up being “behind the curve.”  For example, in the fall of 2008, Taylor Rule prescriptions were well above the level of rates that was appropriate given the sharp and persistent deterioration in the economic outlook and the sharp tightening in financial conditions that occurred during that period. Of course, many economists at that time recognized that such prescriptions would have been inappropriate and suggested various ad hoc modifications to the prescriptions—in fact, John himself suggested that modifications to his rule were appropriate at that time. 2 Nonetheless, there was no consensus about the “right” modification to the rules at that time, in part, because the circumstances were unprecedented and the outlook so uncertain.  If the FOMC had been required to justify to Congress deviations from a reference rule at that time, I believe that this would have slowed down how we responded to the crisis and would have resulted in a monetary policy that was not sufficiently accommodative.  The consequence could have been a longer financial crisis and a deeper recession. Second, the Taylor Rule, as typically used, assumes that a 2 percent real short-term interest rate is consistent with a neutral monetary policy.  However, a large literature concludes that the equilibrium real short-term rate is very unlikely to be constant, with its value affected by many factors, including the pace of technological change, fiscal policy and the evolution of financial conditions. 3 Sometimes it can be much higher than 2 percent.  Presumably, this was the case during the late 1990s as rapid technological change lifted productivity growth. Sometimes it can be well below 2 percent.  For example, when credit availability dried up during the financial crisis in late 2008, this drove down the equilibrium real rate far below 2 percent. More recently, the slow growth rate of the economy and the low rate of inflation are evidence that the equilibrium real short-term rate today is well below the 2 percent rate assumed in the Taylor Rule.  If 2 percent really was consistent with a neutral monetary policy, then the very low real rates of recent years—buttressed by our large-scale asset purchases—should have been extraordinarily accommodative.  As a result, we should have grown much faster than the 2½ percent pace evident over the past couple of years and seen an inflation rate much higher than what we experienced.  This conclusion is supported by a number of more formal models.  For example, the Laubach-Williams model currently estimates that the equilibrium real short-term rate is around zero percent. 4 Third, the Taylor Rule ―and more broadly, any prescriptive rule for the systematic quantitative adjustment of the policy rate to changes in intermediate policy inputs such as real GDP or inflation―is incomplete because it does not fully account for factors that are crucial to how monetary policy impulses are transmitted to the real economy.  Monetary policy affects economic activity through its impact on financial conditions—including the level of equity prices, bond yields, the foreign exchange value of the dollar and credit conditions.  If the relationship between the federal funds rate and other indicators of financial conditions were stable, then one could just focus on the level of short-term rates. 5 But, because financial conditions vary considerably relative to short-term rates, as we have seen in the financial crisis and its aftermath, one needs to consider developments in financial conditions more broadly in setting monetary policy. In fact, at times, when short-term rates have been pinned at the zero lower bound, the Federal Reserve has taken actions that eased financial conditions without changing short-term interest rates.  Such actions have included forward guidance that the FOMC was likely to keep short-term rates low for a long time and large-scale asset purchases that led to lower bond term premia. Now, as I said at the start, just because I don’t want to follow a rule mechanically does not mean that I favor the polar opposite—that is, a fully discretionary monetary policy in which market participants, households and businesses cannot anticipate how monetary policy is likely to evolve as economic and financial market conditions and the economic outlook change.  If households and businesses do not have a good notion of how the Federal Reserve will respond to changing economic and financial market conditions, then this would loosen the linkage between short-term rates and financial conditions.  This would also likely lead to greater uncertainty about the outlook and higher risk premia, and it would make it more difficult for policymakers to attain their objectives. Instead, what I favor is a careful elucidation of those factors that influence the economic outlook and how monetary policy is likely to respond to changes in the outlook.  This includes fiscal policy, productivity growth, the international outlook and financial conditions, as well as how much employment and inflation deviate from the Fed’s objectives.  By conducting policy in a transparent way and communicating what is important in determining the central bank’s reaction function, I think policymakers can strike the best balance between a monetary policy that fully incorporates the complexity of the world as it is, while, at the same time, retaining considerable clarity about how the FOMC is likely to respond to changing circumstances.  A formal policy rule such as the Taylor Rule misses this balance by going too far in one direction. What is important for attaining the Federal Reserve’s mandated objectives is not that monetary policy is described in terms of a formal prescriptive rule, but rather that the FOMC’s intentions and strategy are well understood by the public.  This argues for clear communication through the FOMC meeting statements and minutes, the FOMC’s statement concerning its longer-term goals and monetary policy strategy, the Chair’s FOMC press conferences and testimonies before Congress, and speeches by the Chair and other FOMC participants.  But it also is important that the strategy be the “right” reaction function.  This means a policy approach that responds appropriately to important factors beyond the two parameters of the Taylor Rule—the output gap estimate and the rate of inflation. Thank you for your kind attention. 1 Jonathan McCarthy, Paolo Pesenti, Argia Sbordone and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks. 2 For example, John suggested in February 2008 to lower the standard Taylor Rule prescription by 50 basis points to take into account the increase in the LIBOR-OIS spread at that time. See Monetary Policy and the State of the Economy , Testimony before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, February 26, 2008. 3 See James D. Hamilton, Ethan S. Harris, Jan Hatzius, and Kenneth D. West (2015), The Equilibrium Real Funds Rate: Past, Present and Future , working paper for U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, August. 4 See Thomas Laubach and John C. Williams “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest”, Review of Economics and Statistics, November 2003, Vol 85, No. 4, pp 1063-1070.  Updated estimates available from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. 5 An analogy can be made to the applicability of a Friedman k-percent monetary aggregate rule. Just as a k-percent rule requires a stable relationship between a monetary aggregate and nominal GDP (i.e., stable money velocity), a Taylor Rule needs a stable relationship between the policy rate and financial conditions.\n\nAt the same time, I do not favor total discretion in which the monetary policy strategy is determined in an ad hoc fashion as we go along.  For monetary policy to be most effective, market participants, households and businesses need to be able to anticipate how the Federal Reserve is likely to respond to evolving conditions.

This would also likely lead to greater uncertainty about the outlook and higher risk premia, and it would make it more difficult for policymakers to attain their objectives.\n\nInstead, what I favor is a careful elucidation of those factors that influence the economic outlook and how monetary policy is likely to respond to changes in the outlook.  This includes fiscal policy, productivity growth, the international outlook and financial conditions, as well as how much employment and inflation deviate from the Fed’s objectives.  By conducting policy in a transparent way and communicating what is important in determining the central bank’s reaction function, I think policymakers can strike the best balance between a monetary policy that fully incorporates the complexity of the world as it is, while, at the same time, retaining considerable clarity about how the FOMC is likely to respond to changing circumstances.  A formal policy rule such as the Taylor Rule misses this balance by going too far in one direction.\n\nWhat is important for attaining the Federal Reserve’s mandated objectives is not that monetary policy is described in terms of a formal prescriptive rule, but rather that the FOMC’s intentions and strategy are well understood by the public.  This argues for clear communication through the FOMC meeting statements and minutes, the FOMC’s statement concerning its longer-term goals and monetary policy strategy, the Chair’s FOMC press conferences and testimonies before Congress, and speeches by the Chair and other FOMC participants.  But it also is important that the strategy be the “right” reaction function.  This means a policy approach that responds appropriately to important factors beyond the two parameters of the Taylor Rule—the output gap estimate and the rate of inflation.\n\nThank you for your kind attention.\n\n1 Jonathan McCarthy, Paolo Pesenti, Argia Sbordone and Joseph Tracy assisted in preparing these remarks.\n\n2 For example, John suggested in February 2008 to lower the standard Taylor Rule prescription by 50 basis points to take into account the increase in the LIBOR-OIS spread at that time. See Monetary Policy and the State of the Economy , Testimony before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, February 26, 2008.\n\n3 See James D. Hamilton, Ethan S. Harris, Jan Hatzius, and Kenneth D. West (2015), The Equilibrium Real Funds Rate: Past, Present and Future , working paper for U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, August.\n\n4 See Thomas Laubach and John C. Williams “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest”, Review of Economics and Statistics, November 2003, Vol 85, No. 4, pp 1063-1070.  Updated estimates available from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\n\n5 An analogy can be made to the applicability of a Friedman k-percent monetary aggregate rule. Just as a k-percent rule requires a stable relationship between a monetary aggregate and nominal GDP (i.e., stable money velocity), a Taylor Rule needs a stable relationship between the policy rate and financial conditions.",

    "text": "It is my pleasure  to welcome you to today’s conference.  Over the past decade, the New York Fed  has been working together with the European Commission and the Centre for  Economic Policy Research in sponsoring a number of conferences on  interdependencies and policy challenges on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.  Today, as in the past, we have a great program with many distinguished speakers  from academia, and the private and public sectors.  In particular, I would  highlight the keynote speech following lunch by Pierre Moscovici, European  Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs.\n\nAs the two largest economies in the world, the United States and the European Union have a shared stake in the vitality of  the global economy.  Without growth in both our regions, the global  economy will not prosper and we will not be able to provide the conditions to  enable our citizens to fulfill their aspirations.  Both the United States and  Europe suffered large social and economic costs from the financial crisis and  the deep recession that followed.  We continue to take steps to minimize the risks  that we will ever find ourselves in that situation again.  In many respects, the  United States and Europe face similar challenges and have similar goals.\n\nToday I want to focus on some of the  challenges.\n\nOn the regulatory side, there is  considerable good news.  In particular, substantial progress has been made  in strengthening the global banking system. Capital and liquidity standards for  internationally active banks have been raised significantly.  This should  reduce the risk of failure for these banks. Also, the financial system is being  made more resilient and robust.  For  example, the global set of principles for financial market infrastructures has  been updated and strengthened.\n\nMoreover, some steps have been taken to better  deal with the failure of systemically important financial firms on a  cross-border basis.  Key attributes for resolution regimes have been promulgated  by the Financial Stability Board.  Efforts are underway to improve how we  can work together in a coordinated way on a global basis.\n\nBut more needs to be done.  The  impediments to an orderly cross-border resolution still need to be fully  identified and dismantled.  This is necessary to solve the so-called  “too big to fail” problem. Also, cross-border regulatory cooperation needs to be  further enhanced.  This includes greater exchange of confidential  supervisory information so that national regulators can be fully informed about  the conditions of the banks that operate within their borders.  It also requires  efforts to ensure a level playing field across jurisdictions so that the focus  is on promoting safety and soundness rather than on trying to protect, favor,  or shield national champions.\n\nOn the macroeconomic side, the news for the  United States is mostly favorable. Labor market conditions have significantly  improved over the past few years and unemployment is now around 5 percent.  The  household sector is much less leveraged, the housing sector is recovering, the  banking system is much healthier, and the corporate sector is highly profitable,  even as business fixed investment spending remains quite weak.  Although  inflation has fallen short of our objective, I am confident that inflation will  return to our 2 percent objective over the next few years as the labor market  tightens further and the transitory factors that have held inflation down  dissipate.  After years at the effective lower bound for short-term interest  rates, economic conditions have finally warranted the start of U.S. monetary policy  normalization.  But these monetary policy adjustments are likely to be gradual  and cautious, as we continue to face significant uncertainties and the  headwinds to growth from the financial crisis have not fully abated.\n\nFor Europe, the economic outlook has started  to improve.  The European Union is experiencing a cyclical recovery and the  unemployment rate has been steadily declining over the past two years.  The end  of fiscal tightening appears to be a key factor in this recovery.  Risks of low  inflation, however, remain a concern for the European Central Bank and have motivated their  aggressive use of unconventional monetary policy instruments.\n\nToday’s conference touches on a range of interesting  questions concerning both regions:\n\nI would like to thank the participants for  addressing these and other questions during today’s three panels, and I look  forward to insightful discussion over the course of the day.\n\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce the  European Union Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency David  O’Sullivan.   The ambassador is extraordinarily well-versed to speak on the  issues of interdependence and the policy challenges we face.   Welcome, Ambassador O’ Sullivan.",

    "text": "In a recent speech 1 I talked about a number of the challenges facing the economy as we seek to secure the recovery and build for the future. Today I will focus on one of these: the problems in the U.S. housing market. In focusing today on housing, I would emphasize that this is only one factor behind the frustratingly slow economic recovery. Nevertheless, it is an important one that deserves our attention. As always, what I have to say today reflects my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe New York Fed is deeply committed to contributing to efforts to resolve the housing crisis that still afflicts our nation. Our economists monitor the housing market and analyze its impact on the national economy. My outreach staff work with community groups and housing practitioners to support local programs that aid distressed homeowners. Our lawyers perform pro-bono work for homeowners facing foreclosure and advise on legal reforms, while our researchers and market analysts have developed proposals to mitigate current problems and improve the future structure of housing finance.\n\nIn my presentation today, I will explain why a more robust housing market matters for the wider economy. I will also highlight those factors specific to the housing market that create a risk that it will linger in an extremely weak state for longer than is necessary and remain vulnerable to further weakness.\n\nI will make the case for further housing-related policy interventions that would help stabilize home prices, improve the housing outlook and generate an earlier recovery in housing activity. I believe such actions would support growth and make monetary policy more effective in promoting the dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by Congress—maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability.\n\nThe Housing Bust Given the excesses of the housing boom that took place in the early to middle part of the last decade, a substantial downward adjustment in housing was unavoidable. Since peaking in the second quarter of 2006, home prices have fallen by about 30 percent, 2 returning to levels that last prevailed in mid-2003. In the states of Arizona, California, Florida and Nevada, where home prices rose much more than the national average, prices have declined by roughly 40 percent. Over the past year, house prices have declined by another 4 percent, though they remained roughly flat, when one excludes distress sales.\n\nHome construction collapsed with new single family starts falling from a peak rate of 1.75 million homes per year to a low of 360,000 in early 2009. After a very slight pick-up, they have been bumping along at about a 425,000 annual rate for over a year.\n\nAlthough the number of mortgages becoming delinquent is off its peak, it remains very elevated and increased in the third quarter of 2011. 3 According to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, at the end of that quarter there were roughly 1.5 million first lien mortgages 90 or more days past due, and 2 million first lien mortgages in some stage of foreclosure.\n\nOver time, without an improvement in housing and the labor market, more loans will become seriously delinquent. Moreover, absent more aggressive efforts to find economically efficient alternatives to foreclosure — loans already seriously delinquent and in foreclosure will become real estate owned by the lender, or REO. My staff estimate that the flow of properties into lender REO in 2012 and 2013 could be as high as 1.8 million per year, up from around 1.1 million in 2011 and around 600,000 in 2010.\n\nThe overhang of properties in the foreclosure/REO pipeline continues to exert downward pressure on house prices and housing activity. Recent surveys by MacroMarkets and by Fannie Mae indicate that households expect negligible gains in home prices over the next few years, with many expecting that prices will continue to decline.\n\nMacroeconomic Consequences The ongoing weakness in housing has made it more difficult to achieve a vigorous economic recovery. Housing has inhibited economic activity through a number of channels.\n\nFirst, the strong rebound in residential investment that typically powers economic recoveries following deep recessions has been absent. For example, nine quarters following the ends of the mid-1970s and early 1980s recessions, residential investment had climbed by 65 percent and 55 percent, respectively, above the level at the corresponding troughs. In contrast, during this cycle, there has been no rebound. In the third quarter of 2011, residential investment was still somewhat below the level in the second quarter of 2009.\n\nSecond, by eroding household wealth, the decline in housing prices has contributed to greater weakness in consumption. For most American households the family home is by far the largest tangible asset, a buffer against misfortune, and often a significant savings vehicle to fund retirement. 4\n\nSince home values peaked in 2006, homeowners have lost more than half their home equity—about $7.3 trillion—and expectations of future gains have also declined. At present roughly 11 million households are in negative equity with the aggregate amount of negative equity estimated to be roughly $700 billion. 5\n\nThird, the weakness in home prices has reduced credit availability. Because the home is the primary source of collateral for most households, financial institutions are less willing to lend when house prices have declined substantially and could fall further. In addition, problems in the foreclosure process and obstacles to efficient modification of loans in securitizations, which I'll describe in a moment, make a house of a given value less attractive as collateral to secure a loan. As a result, as home prices have fallen, financial institutions have tightened lending standards. This has reduced the amount of credit available for households, including for small business formation.\n\nFourth, the big drop in house prices has made it more difficult for borrowers to refinance. This has undercut to a degree the ability of monetary policy to support demand.\n\nTraditionally, refinancing activity has been an important channel through which lower interest rates support spending and employment. Refinancing frees up borrower income. Because those who refinance tend to have a higher marginal propensity to consume from income than the investors receiving the mortgage payments, such refinancing activity increases overall demand. However, the fall in home equity combined with a pro-cyclical tightening of refinancing standards and fees means that many borrowers who would like to refinance cannot do so. Problems in Housing By many measures—including affordability ratios and price-to-rent ratios—home prices have fallen back to or below their pre-boom levels. Indeed, housing no longer appears overvalued. In many former boom localities, the price of existing homes has fallen below the cost of building a new home. 6 Also, after several years of depressed construction the national stock of housing no longer looks excessive relative to the nation's population.\n\nNevertheless, housing currently remains in excess supply, in part, because household formation rates remain depressed.\n\nNormally, when there is excess supply, markets self-correct fairly efficiently. Prices fall until they reach a level at which supply and demand are balanced. Unfortunately, the housing market has a number of specific features that complicate this adjustment process and mean it could undershoot — and remain weaker for longer than is necessary.\n\nHousing is a very long-lived asset. Once new building ceases in stressed markets, further reductions in demand cannot be matched by further supply reductions. 7 This means that the market clearing price for housing is highly sensitive to those factors that influence demand.\n\nMoreover, there is a feedback loop from prices to demand, with weaker prices leading to weaker demand. If house prices are anticipated to increase, then the expected capital gain helps to offset the financing cost of owning a home. However, if households believe that house prices could decline further, the expected capital loss adds to the financing cost of owning a home and prospective buyers will be reluctant to buy even if mortgage rates are low.\n\nThat said, it should also be recognized that the factors that affect demand and home prices are not immutable. They depend, in part, on policy choices. Consider, for example, the fact that most home purchases are financed with long-term mortgage credit. This means that the demand for housing is highly sensitive to the availability and cost of that credit.\n\nOutcomes in housing are also affected by the legal and operational infrastructure of the mortgage market. This apparatus has been wholly inadequate for dealing with a systemic shock to housing and employment, and is amplifying bad outcomes. A flawed resolution regime—very different from the more efficient regime for resolving excess debt in private commercial property—exacerbates the risks of under-shooting.\n\nConflicts of interest are embedded in mortgage securitization structures and between first and second lien-holders. There are challenges to how the industry records and transfers interests in these mortgages. For mortgages that are part of securitizations, the legal obstacles to loan modification that preserve value are substantial. Meanwhile, mortgage servicers lack the systems, processes, governance, resources and incentives to deal effectively with a large volume of delinquent borrowers—who often suffer poor customer treatment at a time of personal distress. 8\n\nThe result is inefficiently low levels of mortgage modification, too few \"short sales\" 9 by mutual agreement between distressed borrowers and lenders, and too much reliance on the foreclosure process. This process also has many legal impediments and has become even more inefficient as the volume of loans in the pipeline increases. One consequence has been lengthening delays in completing foreclosures—including unavoidable foreclosures. These delays have increased the economic damage caused by foreclosure and reduced recovery rates.\n\nThe damage caused by inefficient foreclosures is worth emphasizing. It is not just the direct loss of value in terms of deterioration of homes that are ultimately foreclosed. In addition, as I have personally witnessed in my outreach visits across the New York Fed's District, foreclosures impose significant costs on families, surrounding neighborhoods and communities. Unmaintained homes facing foreclosure drag down the value of nearby homes. Also, property taxes on non-foreclosed homes often go up due to a declining tax base and this puts additional downward pressure on housing prices.\n\nForeclosures also undercut housing demand. Households that go through foreclosure need to repair their credit records and to accumulate new downpayments. For several years they are no longer available as potential home buyers and this also contributes to softer demand and weaker housing prices.\n\nFurther declines in home prices also could be reinforcing because they would likely make the already daunting foreclosure/REO pipeline even larger. Currently, households in negative equity or \"underwater\" on their loans owe $65,000 on average more on their mortgages than the value of their homes. Since the recession, most defaults have been by necessity — that is, they have been prompted by a job loss, health problems or divorce coupled with the household being in negative equity. No doubt, however, there is some degree or duration of negative equity that may cause households to conclude that a default is inevitable and should be taken sooner rather than later. If this point were reached, defaults by choice could significantly swell the flow of homes into the foreclosure pipeline.\n\nThe Case for Housing Intervention All these factors imply that there are many potential equilibrium outcomes in terms of housing demand and home prices—some considerably more desirable than others. Negative price expectations and flawed financing and administrative mechanisms, if left unaddressed, can contribute to ongoing weakness in housing demand and make it harder to generate a robust economic recovery.\n\nPersistent weakness in housing is particularly problematic because it acts as a drag on spending and job creation in an environment in which such weakness can not be easily offset by other policy adjustments. Housing policy should seek to break adverse feedback loops, promote more economically efficient outcomes in housing and support growth.\n\nIn recent speeches, 10 I have called for a \"comprehensive approach\" to stabilize the national real estate market and lay the foundations for recovery. I believe this should include measures to improve access to mortgage credit, reduce obstacles to refinancing, lessen the flow of homes into foreclosure through bridge financing and accelerated principal reduction, and to facilitate the absorption of REO back into use as owner- or renter- housing.\n\nMany of these policies simply seek to solve or bypass the legal and incentive problems in the market today and mimic efficient private actions that might be taken if mortgage loans were all held in portfolio and accounting rules did not discourage net present value maximization.\n\nOthers seek to solve coordination problems and take account of the externalities or spillovers to generate outcomes that are superior from the broadest perspective of the nation as a whole.\n\nEarlier this week Chairman Bernanke sent members of Congress a thoughtful analysis of housing policy 11 by staff at the Board of Governors in Washington that evaluates a number of these same issues. What I would like to do today is to elaborate on some specific proposals we have developed in New York, in order to try to persuade you that there are workable solutions to our housing problems at costs that I deem very reasonable relative to the economically inefficient path we are on. Of course, I am open to other promising alternatives that would address the same issues.\n\nI note also that a truly comprehensive approach would also include long-term reform —including reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—to put housing finance on a more stable footing and to equip the market to deal more effectively with any future systemic shocks.\n\nBut I will not discuss these issues in-depth today.\n\nAccess to Mortgage Credit Restoring demand for housing requires new mortgage debt to be offered to creditworthy borrowers on reasonable terms. This is important because residential mortgage lending terms tightened significantly during the crisis, and have not eased subsequently. 12\n\nIndeed, over 50 percent of all new loans—and 70 percent of new prime conforming loans—go to borrowers with FICO scores of 760 or above, compared with about 30 percent before the crisis. Borrowers with credit scores of 720 or less now make up less than 30 percent of new originations, although they represent 52 percent of the population with credit scores.\n\nSteps should be taken to improve households' access to credit. Currently, lenders are discouraged from making new prime conforming loans due to excessively stringent put-back rules on these mortgages. Such rules give Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac broad scope to force the originator to repurchase at par loans that go delinquent if there are any errors in the mortgage loan paperwork—even if the error has no direct link to the delinquency.\n\nIt is essential that lenders are accountable for the representations they make and are appropriately penalized for any misrepresentations. However, doing this via a blanket repurchase regime leads to bad outcomes at a time when there is an unusually high risk of job loss leading to delinquency. It would be better to establish alternative ways to penalize lenders for misrepresentation that were not in practice so closely tied to the risk of job loss. 13\n\nThe current repurchase regime exposes lenders originating prime conforming loans to significant credit risk and encourages them to focus only on the lowest-risk customers.\n\nLenders are applying tougher restrictions than the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac formally require in order to limit the risk that they will have to take back such loans when they become delinquent.\n\nFor mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a better balance between incentives for sound underwriting and credit availability could be achieved by inserting a materiality test in the rep and warranty agreement.\n\nIn the future, it would be worth exploring whether a better regime in general would be to have representations and warranties with a finite duration, but supplemented by a rigorous quality control check of the underwiting based on a random sample of the mortgages as they are being securitized. 14\n\nToday's tough underwriting standards and high risk-based premiums for conforming loan borrowers should also be reviewed. I do not want to see a return to the lax standards and underpricing of credit risk of the boom period. But the guarantee fees for new purchase mortgages should be based on the expected losses on these mortgages—not the realized losses on loans of earlier vintages.\n\nThere is also a strong case for tackling the downward bias on appraisals, which are voiding many transactions between willing buyers and willing sellers. Incentives for individual appraisers favor conservatism today—just as they favored over-optimism during the boom.\n\nThis problem is aggravated by the difficulty in establishing benchmark prices in markets with few transactions and a high share of distress sales. The industry could establish appraisal standards that avoid such procylical outcomes.\n\nMortgage Refinancing Increasing refinancing would support the housing market by promoting aggregate demand and employment. Refinancing creates additional cash flow for borrowers to absorb any adverse income shocks and this reduces the likelihood of default, distress sales and foreclosures.\n\nHowever, there are significant obstacles to refinancing in current circumstances. Declines in home equity have been aggravated by tighter standards, high refinancing fees, burdensome administrative processes, and legal risks to the lenders refinancing the loan.\n\nBecause the taxpayer, via Fannie and Freddie, is already exposed to the risk of conforming loans defaulting, it makes no sense to make it expensive or difficult for borrowers with these loans to refinance. After all, refinancing reduces the credit risk to which taxpayers are exposed. It is also inefficient to fully re-underwrite applications for such refinancings. For example, appraisals could be greatly simplified and made less expensive by using automated valuation models.\n\nThe Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, was set up to facilitate refinancing of high loan-to-value prime conforming mortgages. The announced goal of the HARP was to refinance 3 million to 4 million mortgages. However, shortcomings with the original program mean that less than a million HARP refinancings have taken place.\n\nLegal risks discouraged lenders from participating more fully in HARP to date. Notably, if a lender refinanced a loan made by another company, it was liable for the underwriting associated with the original loan. The profit from refinancing was unattractive relative to the risk of being forced to repurchase the loan. Given this, lenders had little incentive to compete to refinance loans and this led to higher mortgage rates and less refinancing.\n\nMany of these issues have been addressed by recent revisions to HARP and related decisions by Fannie Mae, but more could and should be done. Remaining legal issues could be alleviated by harmonizing standards between Fannie and Freddie.\n\nI would like to see refinancing made broadly available on streamlined terms and with moderate fees to all prime conforming borrowers who are current on their payments. This could substantially increase the number of refinancings.\n\nBridge Financing To stabilize the housing market, we also need to weaken the link between unemployment and new foreclosures. The primary reason for distress sales and mortgage defaults today is the loss of a job. Even if it were possible, it would be inefficient for homeowners with mortgages to self-insure against a job loss.\n\nSome support for unemployed homeowners has been provided in some states under the Hardest Hit program. I favor a broad program to provide bridge financing for all qualified borrowers with demonstrated ability to service their debts who become unemployed involuntarily—though categorically not those who quit or are terminated with cause. In economic terms, this is a form of collective insurance. 15\n\nMy staff estimates that there are 4 million to 5 million \"at risk\" homeowners who can afford their mortgage, but who would struggle to make their payments in the event that the primary earner in the household became unemployed.\n\nWith the current weak labor markets, they estimate around 600,000 of these at-risk households will experience an involuntary job loss that lasts longer than a month over the next year. The average annual amount that would be required to keep the mortgage current for these households while unemployed and receiving unemployment insurance is around $21,000. This would be a loan not a grant. 16\n\nThis implies an annual bridge lending program of $15 billion per year during the current stress period. This seems expensive, but this is not the cost of such a program, just the cash outlay in the early years. In the future, loan repayments would help to offset the program cost.\n\nMoreover, when one factors in the reduced negative externalities achieved by limiting distress sales, the expected program cost would be even lower.\n\nOf course, any bridge financing loans would need to be properly secured in order to protect taxpayers interests. In situations in which the value of the loan already exceeded the value of the home, it might be appropriate to require lenders to write down the excess debt as a condition for the borrower obtaining a bridge loan. This would ensure that the bridging funds did not \"bail out\" the lender. Writing down excess debt would likely be in the lender's rational self-interest given the borrower's situation, since a distress sale or foreclosure at current market prices would generally yield larger losses.\n\nEarned Principal Reduction Investment firms that purchase delinquent mortgages routinely reduce principal in order to maximize value on these loans. It would make sense for Fannie and Freddie to do this as well in order to minimize loss of value on the delinquent loans they guarantee.\n\nHowever, I am uncomfortable with the notion that \"underwater\" borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth should have to go delinquent before they have a chance of securing a reduction in their mortgage debt. I believe we should also develop a program for earned principal reduction for borrowers who are underwater but keep on making their mortgage payments. Such a program would strengthen the incentives for mortgage holders who are underwater to continue to stay current on their loans, and reduce the likely number of defaults and REO sales.\n\nNegative equity is one of the most significant predictors of mortgage default across all types of mortgage products, including when you control for credit scores and level of income documentation. While recent underwater borrowers have not been defaulting at a rapid pace, they are also not prepaying, implying that underwater mortgages remain \"at risk\" for a prolonged period of time to any adverse shock to the borrower.\n\nIt is admittedly challenging to predict how underwater borrowers will ultimately perform and this performance will be sensitive to the path of home prices. Nonetheless, analysis by my staff that looks at likely borrower behavior over an extended time horizon suggests that without a significant turnaround in home prices and employment, a substantial proportion of those loans that are deeply underwater will ultimately default — absent an earned principal reduction program.\n\nOne option developed by my staff is for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to give underwater borrowers on loans that they have guaranteed the right to pay off the loan at below par in the future under certain circumstances, including that the borrowers have continued to make timely payments. For instance, the borrower could be given an open-ended option to pay off the loan at an LTV of 125 percent, and the right to pay off the loan at an LTV of 95 percent after three years of timely payments.\n\nThe borrower would be protected from further declines in home prices, but in return would give up a portion of any upside from future capital gains on the home via a shared appreciation agreement. Note that under this arrangement some of the reduction in the loan amount would be paid by the borrower as the outstanding balance was amortized by continued monthly payments.\n\nREO Portfolio Even with aggressive policies to minimize the flow of loans into foreclosure, my staff estimates that large volumes of properties would still flow into lenders' REO over the next few years. This growing overhang could continue to depress prices.\n\nThus, along with more incentives to promote short sales, steps should be taken to facilitate the timely and orderly absorption of these properties back into the market including as renter-occupied housing. An interagency group including the Federal Reserve is working on issues relating to REO-to-rental conversions. Appropriate policies would simultaneously lessen downward pressure on home prices and upward pressure on rents.\n\nAmong other steps, investors could be encouraged to purchase REO to be made available as rental housing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could increase the number of loans offered to individual investors, provided the investor puts up an adequate amount of equity for each mortgage. And REO properties in a given locality could be bundled for sale.\n\nThe government might consider a package of tax incentives for purchases of REO that are used as rental properties. Such incentives might include a reduction of the current 27½ year depreciation period and/or a reduction of capital gains tax liability if the property is held for a minimum period, such as five years.\n\nOne idea developed by my staff—let's call it \"homes for heros\"—would be to create a new tax credit or other home purchase subsidy specifically for veterans of our foreign wars that would enable these veterans to purchase such properties at a discount. There are over 2½ million Gulf War II veterans alone, many of whom served multiple tours of duty overseas, and a significant proportion of them might otherwise not be able to purchase homes today.\n\nOur nation owes them a great debt, and such a policy would provide a boost to housing demand quickly.\n\nMoral Hazard Some argue that any interventions to improve the real estate market would lead to moral hazard—that is these intervention would reward bad behaviors. I think these concerns are overstated. First, the programs that have been proposed can be designed with the proper incentives to limit moral hazard and to encourage desireable behavior.\n\nSecond, in contrast to the earlier phase of housing crisis when mostly subprime borrowers came under stress, many of the borrowers running into trouble with their mortgages today took out conforming loans subject to standard downpayment requirements, had respectable FICO scores and borrowed a moderate amount to finance an average house. The problem was that these purchases occurred near the peak in the market and now many of the buyers have suffered an adverse life shock such as unemployment or illness. This isn't a moral hazard issue, this is just the bad luck associated with the timing of the purchase and an exceptionally weak jobs market. Punishing such misfortune accomplishes little.\n\nThe Taxpayer Interest I believe that the proposals I put forward are strongly in the public interest. I also believe that they would be good for taxpayers. Consider, for instance, the proposal for earned principal reduction. While this would certainly involve outlays, these would be offset by reduced defaults. Whether there is a net cost or not depends on the reduction in the default rate that would come with principal reduction and how this reduction would affect the performance of the overall housing market and the economy.\n\nBased on recent data on borrower behavior, 17 my staff calculates that the taxpayer (through the effect on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) would be better off with earned principal reduction under a base case of roughly flat house prices and persistent weakness in the jobs market. Under a scenario of modest house price increases, the combination of fewer defaults and shared appreciation also produces a net benefit.\n\nThis result occurs before taking into account the positive externalities of nudging house prices onto a stronger path, which would reduce the magnitude of losses on loans that do default. On an expected value basis, such a program appears still more compelling, since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently exposed to the downside risk of further declines in home prices.\n\nOf course, just focusing on the impact on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is much too narrow even from a taxpayer perspective. If you believe as I do that improving the outlook for housing would materially strengthen the over economy, one must also include the fiscal benefits generated by stronger economic growth.\n\nHousing Policy and Monetary Policy In closing, the housing policy agenda I describe would address one factor that has impeded the economic recovery. Implementing such policies would improve the economic outlook and make monetary accommodation more effective.\n\nHowever, because the outlook for unemployment is unacceptably high relative to our dual mandate and the outlook for inflation is moderate, I believe it is also appropriate to continue to evaluate whether we could provide additional accommodation in a manner that produces more benefits than costs, regardless of whether action in housing is undertaken or not.\n\nMonetary policy and housing policy are much more complements than substitutes.\n\nAs I hope I have convinced you today, while the Fed has will do all it can to achieve our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment in the context of price stability, we have to recognize that there is more to economic policy than just monetary policy. Low interest rates help housing, but cannot resolve the problems in that sector that are pressing on wider economic activity. With additional housing policy interventions, we could achieve a better set of economic outcomes than with just monetary policy alone.\n\nThank you for your kind attention. I would be happy to take a few questions.\n\n___________________________________________________ 1 William C.

Source of data is CoreLogic.\n\n6 In Las Vegas, for instance, the ratio of house prices to replacement costs is now 0.7, having peaked at about 2.0 during the boom.\n\n7 The supply curve is fixed and vertical at the post-bubble stock of housing so the entire adjustment to changes in demand takes place via prices rather than quantities.\n\n8 A number of these issues were documented by an interagency task force that included the Federal Reserve and are being addressed through consent orders requiring supervised institutions to remedy deficiencies.\n\n9 When the amount of debt secured by a property exceeds its likely net sales price, a \"short sale\" can be a less costly alternative to foreclosure. The short sale agreement between the homeowner and lender often grants the lender final approval of the sales price and may release the homeowner from any deficiency.\n\n10 \"The National and Regional Economic Outlook,\" October 24, 2011, and \"Securing the Recovery\" November 17, 2011.\n\n11 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2012.

The program was called the Homeowners's Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program, or HEMAP. Since its inception, over 80 percent of the loans made under the program have been fully repaid and the borrowers able to remain in their homes. A new program could be funded by the federal government or individual states.\n\n16 In addition, the repayment terms for the bridge loan once the owner becomes reemployed should be contingent on the owner's reemployment earnings.\n\n17 Lender Processing Services data.",
