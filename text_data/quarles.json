    "text": "For release on delivery\n2:00 p.m. EDT\nJuly 9, 2019\nStress Testing: A Decade of Continuity and Change\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Stress Testing: A Discussion and Review,” a research conference sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBoston, Massachusetts\nJuly 9, 2019\n\nThank you Eric, and thank you to everyone at the Boston Fed and throughout the\nsystem who have contributed to this conference. This gathering comes a few weeks after\nthe announcement of this year’s stress test results, so let me begin by recounting the\nhighlights of those results. They show that our financial system remains resilient and that\ncapital planning by banks continues to improve. The largest and most complex banks\nwere tested against a severe hypothetical recession and retained strong capital levels, well\nabove their minimum requirements. They demonstrated the ability to withstand a severe\nand lasting economic downturn and still be able to lend to households and businesses.\nAdditionally, most firms are now meeting the high expectations we have set to make sure\ncapital planning takes into account their specific risks and vulnerabilities. This is an\nimprovement from last year. Overall, these results are good news that confirm our\nfinancial system is significantly stronger than before the crisis.\nNow let me turn to the purpose of this conference, which is to sharpen our\nunderstanding of the experience gained from stress testing and apply these lessons to\nthink about the future. And let me begin by acknowledging that—notwithstanding our\nopenness to learning from the collective experience of all of us in this room—the future\nof stress testing will, in a number of important ways, necessarily resemble the past. For\nexample, we’re still going to have them. Over the course of the last 18 months, I have\nheard overwhelmingly—from academics, from think tanks of every stripe, from banks of\nevery size, from regulatory colleagues both domestic and foreign—that stress tests should\ncontinue to be a key element of the Federal Reserve’s supervision of systemically\nimportant banks and a key aspect of the Fed’s efforts to promote financial stability.\nStress tests should be regular, rigorous, and dynamic. And the banks’ performance on\n\n- 2 -\nthese tests will continue to be the most risk sensitive and consequential assessment of the\naffected banks’ capital requirements.\nTransparency around the stress testing process and results was a fundamental\nprinciple of the first stress test and every one that has followed, and it will remain a\nprimary goal. Stress tests, as ever, will provide the public with essential information to\nassess the health of banks and the overall financial system. To be credible, stress tests\nwill also continue to provide significant information about how the Fed does its work, so\nthe public can understand the rigor and independence of our assessment process and how\nwe come to our judgment of the firms we test.\nFidelity to these principles, embraced in the depths of the crisis by the first stress\ntest a decade ago, does not mean that stress testing should never change or that it hasn’t\nchanged over the years. We have learned from our experiences with the early tests and\nadded useful features and adjustments. These include a counterparty default scenario, as\nwell as a number of policy statements that more explicitly convey the principles we find\nimportant in a sensible stress testing program.\nStress testing has evolved, and must continue to evolve, to take on what we as\nsupervisors learn from our work and what we can learn from others. Each year, we have\nrefined both the substance and the process of the stress tests, guided by our own\nexperience and by critiques and suggestions from others. This feedback comes from a\nvariety sources, including conferences such as this one, and I am confident that the\npresentations today will provide insights that result in improvements in our stress tests.\nIf stress tests are to continue to be relevant and effective, I strongly believe that\nthey must continue to change: they must respond to changes in the economy, the\n\n- 3 -\nfinancial system, and the risk-management capabilities of firms. Evolutionary change\nhas been a consistent principle of stress testing since the beginning, embraced by my\npredecessors at the Board of Governors and our supervisory staff and reflected in each\ncycle of tests. Without such adjustments, regulators, banks, and the broader public\ncannot get a clear and dynamic view of the capital positions of the largest banks.\nStress tests each year have upheld the original principle of transparency around\nthe capital adequacy of our largest banks. Stress tests results should allow investors,\ncounterparties, analysts and markets to make more informed judgments about the\ncondition of banks. Along with other regulatory measures, this transparency increases\nmarket discipline and it subjects the Federal Reserve to greater outside scrutiny and\nanalysis. Accountability is important not only for the usual reasons that apply in a\ndemocracy but also, in this case, because stress tests can only be effective when the\npublic has confidence in the Fed’s evaluation of the capital adequacy of banks. In effect,\nstress tests are also a test of the Fed’s supervision of large banks.\nIn these remarks, I will first sketch out how changes in regulation, risk\nmanagement, the economy, and overall financial stability have prompted alterations to\nstress tests over the past decade. Much of that change has enhanced transparency, which\nis a founding principle for stress tests. I will then suggest some ways in which the\neffectiveness of stress testing can be further enhanced with greater transparency.\nTen years ago, in May of 2009, the Fed and the Treasury Department released the\nfirst stress test results under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP). At\nthat moment, the U.S. economy was in free fall. The United States had lost an astonishing\nthree million jobs in the previous four months. One significant reason for these losses\n\n- 4 -\nwas that many businesses were severely constrained in their access to funding and found\nit impossible to predict when that access might improve. The goal of the first test was\nurgent and simple: to restore confidence in the 19 large banks that then accounted for\ntwo-thirds of the assets in the banking system. In fact, simply announcing in March that\nthere would be tests helped stabilize bank finances. That improvement continued after\nthe results in May outlined the quite feasible steps for raising additional capital that the\nbanks would need to take, and did take, to be able to continue lending if adverse\nconditions continued. Challenging conditions did continue, but the stress tests and other\nactions taken in the first half of 2009 marked a turning point. The recovery from the\nGreat Recession began in July, as the financial system came back to life, and then\nsteadily strengthened.\nThe principles that made that first test so effective were independence and\ntransparency. For the first time, an independent authority, the Federal Reserve, would\nseek to independently assess risks.1 Just as important, the details of that assessment\nwould be shared with the public, an extent of transparency that until then wasn’t\ncharacteristic of bank supervision but would become the hallmark of the regulatory\nframework erected in response to the crisis. The first tests relied heavily on banks’\ninternal risk models, but they still represented a huge step in independence in providing\nthe public with an assessment of the health and resiliency of large banks. Transparency\nfacilitated both market discipline and accountability. The information provided to the\npublic under the SCAP stress test reinforced the entire enterprise of estimating the capital\n1On May 7, 2009, the results of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program were announced by the\nFederal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20090507a.htm\n\n- 5 -\nshortfall faced by major banks. It held the banks accountable for information on their\ncapital adequacy and required them to fill the capital hole.\nThe next big step for stress testing came with its integration with the Federal\nReserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), beginning in 2011.\nOne big change from the initial SCAP test was that stress tests were no longer a one-time\nemergency measure intended to restore confidence in major financial institutions.\nInstead, they became a recurring, ongoing process intended to maintain confidence in\nmajor institutions. Second, stress tests were no longer a discretionary exercise by\nsupervisors—under Dodd-Frank, they became the law of the land. And third, when they\nwere integrated into CCAR, stress tests became part of a comprehensive—it’s the first C\nin CCAR—framework for capital planning that more closely connected capital regulation\nto risk management of banks and overall supervision.\nThese were changes, but with the effect of reinforcing the founding principles of\nthe SCAP test. Transparency was enhanced when stress tests became mandatory,\nrecurring events and the public could depend on continuing to have access to information\nabout banks’ capital adequacy. Also, the independence of those judgments was enhanced\nwhen Congress made them a statutory responsibility for the Fed and when they were\nintegrated into our CCAR framework.\nFurther changes to stress testing have likewise reinforced the original goals.\nStress testing scenarios have become richer and more challenging, providing more\ninformation about how banks would deal with a range of adverse developments and, for\nexample, exploring the effects of more differentiated risks that are not tied to the business\ncycle. Large trading banks now face an instantaneous shock to their trading assets, and\n\n- 6 -\nmany participants in the stress tests now must address how they would respond to the\nfailure of their largest counterparty.\nOur stress tests demonstrate that banks have now built enough capital to withstand\na severe recession. The capital-building phase of the post-crisis era is now complete, but\nas part of CCAR, stress testing continues to contribute to the significant and ongoing\nimprovement since 2009 in risk management by banks. The original reason for the\nqualitative objection aspect of stress testing was to provide incentives for banks to\naddress the risk-management shortcomings that the Federal Reserve had observed during\nthe financial crisis. For example, many firms supervised by the Federal Reserve had\nsubstantial deficiencies in their ability to measure, monitor, and manage their risks.\nThese shortcomings made it difficult for banks to accurately report their risk exposures to\nthe Board, and consequently, threatened to undermine the credibility of the stress tests,\nwhich were, and remain, dependent on data from the banks.\nSince the beginning of CCAR in 2011, large banks have significantly improved\ntheir risk-management and capital-planning processes. The qualitative assessment\nconducted as part of the 2018 and 2019 CCAR cycles found that most firms either meet\nor are very close to meeting the Federal Reserve’s supervisory expectations for capital\nplanning. Large banks have improved the methods they use to identify their unique risks,\nnow use sound practices for identifying and addressing model weaknesses, and have\nstrong processes in place to evaluate their capital positions on a forward-looking basis.\nWhile we continue to perform a qualitative assessment and ensure that progress is\nretained, the improvements led the Federal Reserve to conclude that for most banks this\nassessment can be incorporated into our regular supervisory practices. The evolution of\n\n- 7 -\nour qualitative assessment reflects the experience of the past 10 years of stress testing,\nand in particular, the great improvement in risk management by large banks and the\ncumulative effect of the Fed’s improved supervision of large institutions. As I said\nearlier, for stress testing to remain effective, it must respond to changes in the economy,\nthe financial system, and risk-management capabilities.\nThe changes to CCAR have occurred in the context of a similarly dramatic\nimprovement in the strength and resilience of the financial system. The firms have more\nthan doubled their capital since the first round of stress tests in 2009. Since that time, the\ncommon equity of the largest 18 firms has increased by more than $650 billion.\nLet me now turn to the most recent changes to CCAR and stress testing and put\nthem in the context of the history I have just related. Congress revisited large bank\nsupervision last year in S. 2155, yet the legislation it passed reaffirmed the important role\nof stress testing. This shouldn’t be surprising, because the experience of stress testing\nover the last 10 years has demonstrated that it is a highly useful element of large bank\nsupervision and the promotion of financial stability.\nSomething else that shouldn’t be surprising is that this experience has revealed\nthat periodic stress testing has turned out to be a less useful supervisory tool to evaluate\nthe risks of smaller and less complex financial institutions. Congress made use of this\nexperience by raising the threshold for stress testing to $100 billion in assets and\nproviding more flexibility for the Fed to tailor stress testing for all firms. This step has,\nonce again, advanced the principles demonstrated in the first stress test and ever since. It\nhas increased transparency because incorporating and disclosing what we have learned\nabout the varying effectiveness of stress testing at different types of institutions is making\n\n- 8 -\nstress testing more effective. The accountability of the Fed is enhanced when we are seen\ntaking on board what we have learned through successive cycles of stress tests, and this\nstrengthens the independence and credibility of our judgments. For those of us who\nbelieve stress testing should remain central to supervision and promoting financial\nstability, it is vital that an adjustment such as this takes place as appropriate.\nWith that in mind, let me review recent changes and proposed changes to the\nFederal Reserve’s stress testing. These changes are designed to make CCAR more\ntransparent and simple and to feature less unnecessary volatility.\nThe first principle is transparency. We have taken a number of recent steps to\nenhance the transparency around our models and the stress testing process more\ngenerally. Earlier this year, the Board published enhanced disclosures on two of the key\nmodels that we use in stress testing. In addition, the Board published estimated loss rates\nfor groups of loans with distinct characteristics, to show how supervisory models treat\nspecific assets under stress. We will publish disclosures about two additional models in\n2020 and each year thereafter until we have provided transparency about all our stress\ntest models. At the same time, we published a new policy statement on our approach to\nsupervisory stress testing. Among other things, the statement emphasizes the importance\nof independence and stability to the credibility of our stress tests.\nWe are currently considering options to provide additional transparency regarding\nscenarios and scenario design and I expect that the Board will seek comment on the\nadvisability of, and possible approaches to, gathering the public's input on scenarios and\nsalient risks facing the banking system each year. Such a proposal may also provide\n\n- 9 -\nadditional details about the scenario design features that underpins each year's scenarios,\nand a range of other enhancements.\nSome argue that the greater transparency and disclosure promoted by recent\nchanges and proposed changes to stress testing amounts to providing banks with the\nanswers to the tests.2 This both overstates the extent of disclosure involved and\nmisunderstands what we are trying to accomplish in stress testing—goals that haven’t\nchanged since the spring of 2009.\nIf the goal were only to conduct a test that was difficult to pass—like the\nqualifying exams for some of the more esoteric and restrictive high-IQ societies—then\ntrying to explain principles, scenario design, and how models work would be\ninappropriate. If the measure of success for the Fed in administering a stress test was\nsimply how many banks failed, then greater transparency would indeed be a mistake. But\nthat is not the purpose of stress testing, and it never has been.\nThe vitally important goal is to improve and sustain good risk management and\ncapital planning at the individual institutions we supervise and to promote the stability of\nthe financial system. Like a teacher, we don’t want banks to fail, we want them to learn.\nIn this case, we want them to learn good risk management in the context of forward-\nlooking capital planning. This will provide the public with more information about the\ncapital planning of major banks, and about how the Federal Reserve views good capital\nplanning and risk management, bolstering our credibility.\n2 Mark J. Flannery, Simon H. Kwan, and Mahendrarajah Nimalendran, “Market\nevidence on the opaqueness of banking firms’ assets,” Journal of Financial Economics\n71, no.3 (2004): 419–60,\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X03001855.\n\n- 10 -\nThe second principle reflected in recent changes to stress testing is simplicity.\nOne important proposal—what we are calling the stress capital buffer—would simplify\nthe Fed’s large bank capital rule by integrating the stress testing process with our\ntraditional regulatory capital rules. Our regulatory capital rule includes both minimum\ncapital requirements and a buffer that sits on top of those minimum requirements. The\nbuffer serves as an early warning to a firm and to supervisors, and it requires the firm to\nreduce its capital distributions as the firm approaches the minimum requirements.\nIntegrating these two standards is a natural evolution of CCAR away from its origins\nduring the crisis, when such tailoring was impractical and policy makers had not yet\nconsidered the approach of a regulatory capital buffer on top of a regulatory capital\nminimum. The stress capital buffer would result in a more transparent and simplified\nsystem of regulatory capital requirements because a firm will be held to a single,\nintegrated capital regime.\nThe stress capital buffer would not reduce the stringency of the regulatory capital\nframework for large banks, but it would effect a substantial simplification of that\nframework. By my math, the number of different capital requirements applicable to large\nbanks would fall from 18 to eight and the number of different total loss absorbing\ncapacity requirements for large banks would fall from 24 to 14. I expect that we will\nmove forward with a revised stress capital buffer proposal in the near future, reflecting\nmany of the comments received on our original proposal.\nThe third principle addressed by the recent changes is volatility. When I think\nabout volatility in stress testing, I want to distinguish what I consider to be useful\nvariation in the tests, in the form of exploration of salient risks, from what I consider to\n\n- 11 -\nbe less useful variation, in the form of unexpected swings in capital requirements that\ndon’t have any particular relationship to changing risks at individual firms. In addition,\none source of volatility in the tests comes from the fact that banks are forced to do their\ncapital planning before they get the results of our tests. I will address each of these\nconcerns in turn.\nIn distinguishing useful from less useful volatility, one option to address the year-\nover-year volatility of the tests would be to average the results of the tests from the\nprevious year or years. This would not affect the overall stringency of the tests but,\nmathematically, would mean that no single year could have an outsized influence on the\namount of capital that a bank is required to maintain. The potential downsides to this\napproach include the reduced risk sensitivity that a bank may experience to a particular\ntest and potential technical challenges associated with changes to a bank’s balance sheet\nand earnings. Bearing in mind these potential challenges, I believe more thinking and\ndiscussion of this issue would be fruitful.\nWith respect to the second concern, as I have said before, I believe it more\nrational and logical for firms to be able to plan for their capital needs with the benefit of\nthe results of our tests. Given the huge strides that the banks have made in their capital\nplanning and in meeting our expectations, I view the risk of banks backsliding in this\nregard to be minimal because it would be evident in the next test. Our capital-planning\nexpectations will not decline, and we will continue to use the supervisory process to\nenforce these expectations. It is my hope that greater transparency can play a role in\nother parts of our supervisory process—for example, by allowing other aspects of bank\nsupervision to benefit from public input. Greater transparency for supervision is in\n\n- 12 -\nkeeping with one of the biggest improvements to the regulatory framework and to stress\ntesting since the financial crisis. I believe the changes and proposed changes to stress\ntesting that I have discussed today reinforce the founding principles of the first test,\nadministered in the challenging and uncertain spring of 2009, and reflect what we have\nlearned each year over the decade since then. That process of learning and refining\nshould and must continue in order to keep stress tests as relevant and effective as they\nhave been in helping to reduce the chances of another severe crisis.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:05 a.m. EST\nNovember 9, 2018\nA New Chapter in Stress Testing\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Brookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 9, 2018\n\nThank you to Brookings for inviting me to speak today. It is an honor and\npleasure to talk to you about the next chapter in stress testing, particularly before this\nextremely distinguished audience of Brookings scholars that includes former Chairs, Vice\nChairs, and senior leaders of the Federal Reserve who did the hard foundational work of\ndeveloping and implementing this new approach to the assessment of bank resiliency. In\nthese circumstances, my discussing changes to our stress testing regime could sound\nuncomfortably close to the serene arrogance of Alfonso X of Castile, who famously said\nthat “Had I been present at the creation, I would have given some useful hints for the\nbetter ordering of the universe.” My thoughts today, however, are not a call to rewrite\nGenesis, but rather a recognition that our stress testing regime--like the banking and\nfinancial system that it evaluates--will and should evolve as we continue to learn from\nexperience in the management of this tool. In the best traditions of the Federal Reserve,\nthis evolution should be grounded in rigorous analysis of the facts and a commitment to\ncontinual improvement of our methods.\nIn my remarks today, I will begin with what has been successful about the stress\ntests and why those elements should remain. I will then spend some time discussing\nsome of the changes we have proposed to our stress testing program, and how we are\nnow thinking about moving forward with those changes. After that, I will discuss the\ntension between, on the one hand, providing additional information to the firms, while,\non the other hand, ensuring that the tests remain effective. And last, I will close with\nsome thoughts on the “qualitative” element of our stress testing program.\nThe adjustments I will discuss are intended to increase both the transparency and\nthe efficiency of the stress testing regime. Enhanced transparency goes to the very core\nof democratic accountability and the rights of all U.S. citizens--including the\nmanagement and shareholders of the institutions that are subject to the stress tests--to\nunderstand the requirements to which they are subject. It also helps ensure the continued\ncredibility of our regime.\nBackground\nLet me begin with a short discussion of the core elements of our stress testing\nprogram. As you know, one of the most visible aspects of our stress testing program is\n\n- 2 -\nthat the firms and the public receive an independent view of the capital adequacy of the\nlargest banks. The results are based on our own models and provide a consistent\nyardstick to measure resiliency across the banking system.\nBut the stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve is only one part of our stress\ntesting regime. Just as important, we require each firm to run its own stress test, using its\nown models and a stressful scenario that reflects the firm’s assessment of its idiosyncratic\nrisks and key vulnerabilities. Underpinning a firm’s stress test is the firm’s ability to\nidentify and measure risks under normal and stressful conditions and the strength of the\nfirm’s internal processes, and we use the supervisory process to ensure that the firms’\nstress testing practices employ sound methodologies.\nThe combination of the Federal Reserve’s common yardstick, the firm’s own\nstress tests, and supervisory oversight over the firms’ practices has resulted in a\nmeaningful increase in the post-stress resiliency of large financial institutions. All of\nthese core components will remain in place.\nFurther, the changes I’ll speak about today are not intended to alter materially the\noverall level of capital in the system or the stringency of the regime. A healthy U.S.\neconomy relies on a strong, well-capitalized banking system that can weather stressful\nevents and continue lending to households and businesses. The U.S. banking\norganizations subject to the 2018 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)--\nthe Fed’s evaluation of capital adequacy for large holding companies--have increased the\ndollar amount of their common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital from around $500 billion in\n2009 to more than $1.2 trillion as of the second quarter of this year, and have more than\ndoubled CET1 risk-based capital ratios from approximately 5 percent to over 12 percent\nover the same period.\nWhile the regime has been successful overall, I believe it is prudent to review all\nour practices to ensure that they are as efficient and transparent as possible and that they\nremain appropriate in light of changes in the industry that have been achieved. For\ninstance, as firms become more resilient, they may no longer need to build capital to\nsupport their current level of risk taking, but rather move into the mode of retaining the\ncapital they have already built. Firms have also significantly improved their risk\n\n- 3 -\nmanagement, providing room to adjust our approach to assessing capital planning\npractices. Finally, as we make changes to our regime, the issue of volatility in the stress\ntest results becomes more pronounced. As I’ll discuss, we are considering how to\nbalance the need to preserve the dynamism in stress testing with the need to ensure that\nfirms have sufficient notice regarding the capital requirements to which they are held.\nStress Capital Buffer\nMany of you are familiar with the Federal Reserve’s proposal to integrate the\nstress test with the regulatory capital rule--known as the stress capital buffer (SCB).1 I\nbelieve the SCB proposal represents an important milestone as we enter the next chapter\nof our stress testing regime. For those who are not familiar with the SCB, let me provide\na little background about how our capital rule currently works, and how it would be\nmodified by the SCB.\nAs devoted readers of our capital rules may know, our regulatory capital rule\nincludes both minimum capital requirements and a buffer that sits on top of those\nminimum requirements. The buffer serves as an early warning to a firm and to\nsupervisors, and it requires the firm to reduce its capital distributions as the firm\napproaches the minimum requirements. Under the current capital rule, all firms are\nsubject to a fixed buffer requirement of 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets--the largest\nfirms are also subject to a global systemically important bank surcharge and potential\ncountercyclical capital buffer.\nFor large firms, the SCB would replace the fixed 2.5 percent risk-based buffer\nwith a firm-specific buffer the size of which would be based on the firm’s stress test\nresults. In this way, we are integrating the automatic restrictions on capital distributions\nin the current capital rule with the output of the most dynamic tool we have for assessing\nrisk--the stress test--to create a more robust and dynamic regulatory capital regime. The\nSCB would also result in a more transparent and simplified system of regulatory capital\nrequirements, because a firm will be held to a single, integrated capital regime.\n1 Amendments to the Regulatory Capital, Capital Plan, and Stress Test Rules, 83 Fed. Reg. 18,160 (April\n25, 2018), www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-04-25/pdf/2018-08006.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nWhen we made our SCB proposal last April, we had aimed to make the SCB final\nfor the 2019 stress test cycle. However, the comments we received have been extensive\nand thoughtful, and have raised issues that require a carefully considered response.\nWhile I don’t believe these issues will prevent us from ultimately implementing the SCB,\nthey have flagged certain elements of the regime that could benefit from further\nrefinement. Accordingly, I expect we will adopt a final rule in the near future that will\nsettle the basic framework of the SCB, but re-propose certain elements. To enable this\nprocess to run its course, I expect that the first SCB would not go into effect before 2020.\nFor 2019, I expect CCAR will remain in place for firms with over $250 billion in assets\nor that are otherwise complex; however, we will consider whether we can move forward\nwith any aspects of the SCB proposal for CCAR 2019, such as assumptions related to\nbalance sheet growth. I will also ask the Board to exempt firms with less than $250\nbillion in assets from the CCAR quantitative assessment and supervisory stress testing in\n2019 in light of the every-other-year cycle contemplated in the tailoring proposal that the\nBoard approved two weeks ago.2\nReturning to the SCB proposal, I would like to give you a sense of the comments\nwe received and our approach to addressing those concerns. The issue foremost on my\nmind is the volatility of the stress test results. One concern frequently expressed is that\nthe results of the supervisory stress test can lead to capital requirements that change\nsignificantly from year to year, which limits a firm’s ability to manage its capital\neffectively. Some amount of volatility is necessary to preserve the dynamism of the\nstress test--by nature, the stress test will differ year-over-year based on macroeconomic\nconditions and contemporary understanding of salient risks in the economy. In addition,\nthe stress test results are sensitive to changes in a firm’s balance sheet, which means that\na firm’s capital requirements will evolve as the firm’s activities and exposure evolve.\nHowever, I do think there is an important balance to be struck between preserving this\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board invites public comment\non framework that would more closely match regulations for large banking organizations with their risk\nprofiles,” news release, October 31, 2018,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20181031a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\ndynamism and ensuring that firms have sufficient notice regarding the capital\nrequirements to which they are held.\nIn the first years after the financial crisis, as the banking system was dramatically\nramping up the total amount of capital in the system, this volatility was less of a\nmanagement problem: until we reached reasonably full capitalization, each year every\nbank needed to increase its capital. If one year that increment was a little higher or a\nlittle lower than the previous year, that was simply a modest difference of velocity, not\ndirection. At the current juncture, however, both our system as a whole and each of the\nlargest banks in that system are fully meeting their capital requirements. In these\ncircumstances, having a highly variable capital requirement presents a significant\nmanagement challenge.\nWe are considering ways of preserving the dynamism of stress testing while\nreducing its volatility, and plan to seek comment on a proposal in this area in the not-too-\ndistant future. In addition, we are also exploring ways of improving our approach to\nmeasuring risks in the trading book. Firms’ trading books are dynamic and complex, as\nfirms hold both long and short positions. Many have noted that a single market shock\ndoes not adequately capture risks in firms’ trading book, and we agree with those\ncomments. We are exploring ways to incorporate multiple market shocks in our stress\ntest without adding volatility to the results and without increasing the compliance burden.\nWe are also considering adjusting another element of the SCB proposal in order\nto provide more notice to firms. Currently, and under the SCB proposal, a firm must\ndecide whether to increase or decrease its planned dividends and share repurchases for\nthe upcoming year without knowledge of a key constraint: the results of the stress test. In\nother words, we require a firm to give us a formal plan for dividends and stock\nrepurchases without knowing what its effective capital requirement is. If it guesses\nwrong, it could be publicly shamed for failing the stress test (if its dividends are too high\nrelative to capital), or penalized in the markets for inadequate distribution of income (if\nits dividends are too low relative to capital). Now, while this might at first blush appear\nto be pointless and obdurate cruelty, the reasoning behind the practice was initially\nperfectly sensible: it reflected the view that firms should think rigorously about their\n\n- 6 -\ncapital uses and needs in developing their capital distribution plans, rather than rely\nprimarily on the results of the supervisory stress test to guide those plans.\nNow that we all have several years’ experience with this system, however, firms\nhave told us that they would be able to engage in more thoughtful capital planning if they\nhad knowledge of that year’s stress test results before finalizing their distribution plans\nfor the upcoming year. I am sympathetic to their concerns, and will ask the Board to\nadjust the operation of the rule so that firms know their SCB before they decide on their\nplanned distributions for the coming year. This adjustment in sequence will also help\nfirms manage volatility in the SCB. We expect firms to continue to maintain robust\nstress testing practices and use those results to inform their capital distribution plans,\nand we will continue to use the supervisory process to reinforce this expectation.\nThe comments also highlighted an issue with how the capital buffers operate\ntoday, which is amplified by the inherent volatility of the SCB. As I noted earlier, a firm\noperating in its capital buffer is required to reduce its capital distributions so that it can\nbuild capital over time. By design, the buffer was intended to apply increasingly\nstringent limitations as the firm’s capital ratios decline. But, in our current world in\nwhich a healthy and profitable banking system is seeking to maintain its capital levels\nrather than continue to increase them, a bank will appropriately and safely tend to\ndistribute much or all of its income in any given year. In that case, the operation of the\nbuffer would not result in a proportional restriction of income as the firm’s capital eases,\nbut could be a sudden cessation of all dividends if the firm dips into the buffer by even a\nsmall amount, even if the changes in its capital levels are quite minor. We are\nconsidering adjustments that would make the rules more consistent with the graduated\nintent. We plan to work with the other banking agencies to consider how best to effect\nthis change.\nThere are two additional elements of the SCB proposal that I believe would\nbenefit from modification. First, the SCB proposal would have included four quarters of\ndividends in a firm’s SCB, in recognition of the fact that firms experience market\npressure to hold dividends constant, even under stress. In my view, there may be ways of\nencouraging greater reliance on less sticky repurchases while providing more flexibility\n\n- 7 -\nin the regime, and we are exploring alternatives. Last, the SCB proposal would have\nincluded a post-stress leverage requirement. As the Federal Reserve has long maintained,\nleverage requirements are intended to serve as a backstop to the risk-based capital\nrequirements. By definition, they are not intended to be risk-sensitive. Thus, I am\nconcerned that explicitly assigning a leverage buffer requirement to a firm on the basis of\nrisk-sensitive post-stress estimates runs afoul of the intellectual underpinnings of the\nleverage ratio, and I would advocate removing this element of the stress capital buffer\nregime. Of course, leverage ratios, including the enhanced supplementary leverage\nrequirements, would remain a critical part of our regulatory capital regime, and we will\nmaintain the supervisory expectation that firms have sufficient capital to meet all\nminimum regulatory requirements.\nTogether, the adjustments we are contemplating to the SCB offer promise in\nimproving the efficiency, coherence, and transparency of the regulatory capital regime\nwhile maintaining the overall level of capital in the system and the core principles of the\nregime that have proven successful. That being said, we welcome a continued dialogue\nwith the public as we implement these changes, and through that implementation, we will\nensure that we maintain the incentives for effective stress testing practices that exist\ntoday.\nTransparency\nTransparency of the stress test and its inputs and outputs is key to the credibility\nof the stress test, and there are several initiatives underway to provide additional\ntransparency regarding the supervisory stress test models and scenario design process.\nWe believe that the adjustments under development strike the right balance of advancing\ntransparency, while maintaining incentives for firms to think critically about their own\nrisks.\nI expect that soon you will see the Federal Reserve issue a policy statement\ndescribing governing principles around the supervisory stress testing process. As a part\nof that statement, I would expect a commitment to disclose additional detail about\nsupervisory stress test models and results and to publish portfolios of hypothetical loans\nand associated loss rates. I expect that we will begin providing some of this additional\n\n- 8 -\ndetail starting in early 2019, and that these changes will allow firms to benchmark the\nresults of their own models against those of the supervisory models.\nHowever, our commitment to transparency does not end there. We are currently\nconsidering options to provide additional transparency regarding scenarios and scenario\ndesign and I expect that the Board will seek comment on the advisability of, and possible\napproaches to, gathering the public’s input on scenarios and salient risks facing the\nbanking system each year. Such a proposal may also provide additional details about the\nscenario design features that underpins each year’s scenarios, and a range of other\nenhancements. Additional transparency regarding the stress test scenarios serves\nmultiple purposes: it both provides additional due process to affected participants, and\nprovides additional sources of insight--including from academics and thought leaders like\nmany of you in this room--that could be used to inform a given year’s scenario.\nIncreased transparency could also enable us to be more nimble in our scenario design to\nthe extent we uncover through external input new salient risks that we have not\npreviously considered.\nAs we develop proposals, a key consideration is to ensure that we maintain\nincentives for firms to conduct their own stress tests rigorously and thoughtfully. Firms\nhave indicated that additional disclosure about models would not affect their own stress\ntests. We expect them to make good on that representation, as the Federal Reserve’s\nstress test is not, and cannot be, a full picture of a firm’s resiliency in light of its\nidiosyncratic risks.\nFor example, there is some risk that firms will use knowledge from additional\ntransparency about the stress test to engage in transactions that are solely designed to\nreduce losses in the test, but that do not truly reduce risk in their portfolios. As\nsupervisors, however, this is something that we can guard against through the regular\nexamination process. We will closely monitor changes in firms’ portfolios and take\nappropriate actions to ensure firms are holding sufficient capital, and have sufficient\ncontrols and governance, in light of the risk characteristics of their activities.\n\n- 9 -\nQualitative Objection\nBefore I close, I would like to say a few words about the role of the qualitative\nobjection in our new chapter of stress testing. As originally conceived, CCAR had both a\nquantitative component--based on the supervisory stress test--and a qualitative\ncomponent--based on the Federal Reserve’s assessment of a firm’s stress testing\npractices. In 2017, the Federal Reserve eliminated the qualitative objection as part of\nCCAR for large and noncomplex firms, in part because of improvements in risk\nmanagement at these firms.3 By incorporating supervisory stress testing into the\nregulatory capital regime and introducing an automatic penalty if a firm falls below its\nSCB-derived capital requirement, the SCB proposal will eliminate the quantitative\nobjection from CCAR. The natural next question is: has the CCAR qualitative objection\nfor the largest firms also run its course?\nIn my view, the time has come to normalize the CCAR qualitative assessment by\nremoving the public objection tool, and continuing to evaluate firms’ stress testing\npractices through normal supervision. In such an environment, firms would remain\nsubject to the same supervisory expectations, and examiners would continue to conduct\nrigorous horizontal and firm-specific assessments of a firm’s capital positions and capital\nplanning, tailored to the risk profile of the firm. While much of the examination work\nwould center on a firm’s capital plan submissions, examination work would continue on a\nyear-round basis, taking into account the firm’s management of other financial risks. The\nevaluation of the firm’s capital position and capital planning would culminate in a rating\nof the firm’s capital position and planning. Firms with deficient practices would receive\nsupervisory findings through the examination process, and would be at risk of a ratings\ndowngrade or enforcement action if those deficiencies were sufficiently material.\nConclusion\nAs we begin the next chapter in stress testing, my objective is to ensure the\ncontinued credibility of the program by increasing its transparency, simplicity, and\nstability while maintaining the strength of the supervisory and internal stress testing\nelements that are central to the program today. These adjustments will be coupled with\n3 The capital planning evaluation remains as part of the normal supervisory process for these firms.\n\n- 10 -\nour continued commitment to strong supervision and our expectation that financial\ninstitutions ensure they are managing their risks and holding sufficient capital to continue\noperations through times of stress.",

Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nto the\nCouncil for Economic Education\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 6, 2019\n\nThank you, Nan, for that kind introduction, and thank you to President Mester of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Cleveland for inviting me to speak this evening. I am honored to be\nhere and to support the mission that you and the Council for Economic Education have worked\nso hard to advance--that every student in America gets a strong, early start on their financial\neducation.\nThat mission is critical in its own right, but it also reflects the deeply held value of\nparticipation--of giving young people the chance to shape not just their own futures, but also the\nfutures of their communities and their country. Because so much of the language of finance is\ncouched in terms of metrics and rationality, we often forget that finance is something we never\ndo alone. It is, by definition, a collaboration, which helps us work together to achieve common\ngoals.\nThe Federal Reserve is no exception. Tonight, I want to briefly discuss the role that\nparticipation plays in the Federal Reserve’s work and outline one effort to solicit broad\nparticipation--an upcoming conference on stress tests, intended to make those tests more open,\ntransparent, and effective.\nPublic institutions exist under a grant of trust from the people they serve, to pursue a\nspecific policy goal. When the public holds an institution accountable for that grant, the\ninstitution becomes stronger. The Federal Reserve System we know today emerged through\ndecades of legislation, public consultation, and debate--from the original Federal Reserve Act,\nwhich created the Federal Reserve System, to the Banking Act of 1935,1 which established the\nmodern Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), to the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord of\n1 Pub.L. No. 305 (1935).\n\n- 2 -\n1951, which ensured the separation of monetary and fiscal policy.2 These changes made our\neconomy and our country stronger, because they improved the Federal Reserve’s ability to\naccomplish the mission Congress assigned it.\nThroughout this evolution, a key principle has been that accountability allows the Federal\nReserve to be independent--that we are subject to challenge, to counterargument, and to the\nemergence of new evidence and ideas. For our work to remain legitimate, the public must be able\nto see, understand, and engage with our efforts; to reaffirm their support when we have earned it;\nand to offer informed guidance on when to change course.\nAccountability is only one reason the Federal Reserve relies on public outreach and\nparticipation. We also rely on participation for our effectiveness, because the best ideas in\nfinance and economics can, and often do, come from a wide variety of sources. Agencies like the\nFederal Reserve are a collection of expertise--informed by experience and positioned to turn a\nbroad range of information into policy. But we are not, and cannot be, a monopoly on insight or\nwisdom.\nThe Federal Reserve recognizes these limits, and the need to invite new ideas, through a\nvariety of initiatives. We seek out a qualified, diverse workforce, and foster an inclusive\nworkplace.3 We meet frequently with a range of advisory councils, drawing on expertise in\nbanking, modeling, and consumer and community finance.4 We have increased transparency\naround our policy process and issued new reports on financial stability and banking supervision\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Treasury and Federal Reserve Statements,” Federal Reserve\nBulletin 37 (March 1951): 237, https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/62/item/21195/toc/70773.\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan 2016–19\n(Washington: Board of Governors, December 2016), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2016-diversity-\ninclusion-plan.htm.\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Advisory Councils” (January 25, 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/advisorydefault.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nand regulation, with new details about our work.5 And across the Federal Reserve System, our\nstaff publishes a wide range of economic and policy research and plays an active role in\nacademic discourse.\nMonetary policy itself shows the value of participation and transparency. U.S. monetary\npolicy is the sole responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Yet some of the most important\ninnovations in the field have come from outside the Reserve System. Since 1935, we have\ndecided monetary policy by committee, a structure that has served us well because it is designed\nto capture different views of a wide and varied national economy. And over the past several\ndecades, the FOMC has greatly increased its own transparency--from postmeeting\nannouncements, to announcing an objective for inflation, to a published survey of economic\nprojections, to postmeeting press conferences (which will now take place after every FOMC\nmeeting).6 As many of you know, over the course of 2019, we will be reviewing our monetary\npolicy strategy, tools, and communication practices, and we will hold a research conference on\nthe subject with outside speakers, as well as “Fed Listens” events at a number of Reserve Banks,\nto hear from a broad range of constituencies. But these improvements are more than a simple\nmatter of disclosure. They are an invitation to participate, and a way to provide the public with\nthe means and opportunity to inform our work.\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (Washington: Board of Governors,\nNovember 2018), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-201811.pdf; Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Supervision and Regulation Report (Washington: Board\nof Governors, November 2018), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2018-november-supervision-and-\nregulation-report-preface.htm.\n6 The FOMC’s “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” first issued in January 2012 and\nreaffirmed each January, specifies that the Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by\nthe annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run\nwith the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate and that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running\npersistently above or below this objective.\n\n- 4 -\nThis year, we are taking similar steps to improve a cornerstone of our post-crisis rules.\nSupervisory stress tests offer an independent and valuable lens on the health of the banking\nsystem. They offer us a forward-looking measurement of bank capital, a view of common and\nsystemic risks across the banking sector, and a broader understanding of the health of the\nfinancial system. The results are valuable for markets, analysts, and ultimately, the participating\nfirms.\nTen years have passed since the Federal Reserve conducted its first supervisory stress\ntests. That initial experiment helped stabilize financial markets and shore up our banking system\nat a critical and uncertain time. Our challenge now is to preserve the strength of the test, while\nimproving its efficiency, transparency, and integration into the post-crisis regulatory framework.\nTo that end, the stress tests have not remained static. Just in the past several days, the\nBoard acted to suspend stress tests this year for lower-risk firms--generally, those with total\nassets between $100 billion and $250 billion.7 That move follows the passage of the Economic\nGrowth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.8 The extended cycle provides\nadministrative burden relief for these institutions and recognizes the different risks that they\ntypically pose--especially compared to the largest and most complex firms, whose failure poses\nthe greatest risk to the real economy. Even with this change, the stress tests remain a core part of\nour supervision of these firms. Our experience with this “interim” year will inform the move to a\n7 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board releases scenarios for 2019\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and Dodd-Frank Act stress test exercises,” news release,\nFebruary 5, 2018, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190205b.htm.\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, “Interagency Statement Regarding the Impact of the Economic Growth, Regulatory\nRelief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA),” news release, July 6, 2018,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20180706a1.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\npermanently longer testing cycle--a change that would, of course, be subject to a full notice and\ncomment process.9\nImprovements like these are necessary to ensure our supervisory framework evolves from\nits post-crisis origins to an effective steady state. The question of how best to consolidate the\ngains from the first 10 years of stress testing deserves the attention and effort of the country’s\nbest minds. We should welcome changes and novel ideas, even when they explore stress testing\nin a new and unfamiliar light.\nIn July, as a forum for such ideas, we will host a public conference focused on the\ntransparency and effectiveness of stress testing. Called Stress Testing: A Discussion and Review,\nthe event will convene panel discussions, drawing on a mix of presenters with industry,\nacademic, and regulatory backgrounds. It will involve written papers, which will be compiled\nand published to spur further research. We expect the insights from the conference to inform the\nevolution of our stress-testing framework--and we hope to continue the conversation well after\nthe conference ends.\nThis input is as essential to our work as any public outreach we do. Stress testing\nprovides insight into a dynamic financial system, and our stress-testing process must be dynamic\nas well. More broadly, the core of the Federal Reserve’s independence is a broad consensus\n9 Changes proposed as part of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act have been\nproposed but not finalized. Similarly, changes as part of the proposed “stress capital buffer” have been proposed but\nnot finalized.

Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nInstitute of International Bankers Annual Washington Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 5, 2018\n\n- 2 -\nThank you very much to the Institute of International Bankers for inviting me to speak\nhere today. Among my first areas of focus when I was a very young lawyer starting out in my\ncareer well over 30 years ago was providing advice to foreign banks and financial firms\noperating in the United States, and I learned then just how integral, essential, and welcome a part\nyour firms play in our domestic financial sector. Non-U.S. firms serve as an important source of\ncredit to U.S. households and businesses and contribute materially to the strength and liquidity of\nU.S. financial markets, so it is critical--not just as a matter of fairness but as a matter of our\ndomestic interest--that we as regulators ensure that they operate in a fair and open financial\nservices sector. I view that as an important part of my job.\nSo today I want to share my perspective on the appropriate regulatory environment for\nforeign banks operating in the United States, as well as some thoughts on specific elements of\nthat regime. Before doing that though, we should take stock of the pre-crisis history of foreign\nfirms operating in the United States.\nFirst, the financial crisis revealed that in times of stress, international banking firms with\nlarge and complex local operations can contribute to instability in those local markets and can\nrequire extraordinary support from local authorities. Second, a number of foreign financial\ninstitutions expanded the size and complexity of their U.S. operations at a rousing pace and scale\nprior to the crisis, and we did not adjust our local regulatory and supervisory approaches to\naddress the increased risk associated with this expansion. As a result, the difficulties faced by\nthe U.S. operations of non-U.S. banks during the crisis mirrored that of their similarly sized\ndomestic counterparts, underscoring a need for increased resiliency of both domestic firms and\nthe U.S. operations of foreign banks.\n\n- 3 -\nTo bolster that resiliency, the environment for foreign banks operating in the United\nStates underwent a number of changes. While there are important differences, those changes for\nforeign firms broadly parallel many of the changes instituted for domestic firms. My Federal\nReserve colleagues and I have termed these the core post-crisis regulatory reforms: capital,\nliquidity, stress testing, and resolution planning.1 Of course, the obvious and most prominent\ndifference for foreign firms--as attendees of this conference certainly know--was the introduction\nof the intermediate holding company (IHC) structure, to which the post-crisis regulatory reforms\napply.\nIn my estimation, these reforms have gone a long way toward meeting our goal of a more\nresilient financial system. That said, we are now at a point--with ten years of experience in\nsetting up and living with the body of post-crisis regulation--where it is both relevant and timely\nto examine the post-crisis reforms and identify what is working well and what can be improved.\nIf none of the regulatory measures implemented up to now were capable of improvement, this\nwould be the first project of this scale and complexity conducted that had been done exactly right\nthe first pass through. If there was still work to be done after Hammurabi, there is probably still\nsome work to be done now after Dodd and Frank. In particular, as I have said elsewhere, we\nshould be looking to see where we can achieve our regulatory objectives in ways that maintain\nour measures’ effectiveness, but improve their efficiency, transparency, and simplicity. As part\nof that effort, we will consider additional tailoring and flexibility of our regulations in light of\n1 See Randal K. Quarles, “Early Observations on Improving the Effectiveness of Post-Crisis Regulation,” (speech at\nthe American Bar Association Banking Law Committee Annual Meeting, Washington, January 19, 2018),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/quarles20180119a.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\ntheir impact on foreign banking organizations (FBOs) based on lessons learned over the past\nseveral years.\nTo illustrate how I am thinking about these issues, I want to focus in my remarks today\non two specific regulatory examples. These are, of course, not an exhaustive list of work to be\ndone in the regulation of FBOs, but they tend to be near the top of the feedback list from both the\nindustry and supervisors. First, I will discuss the application of enhanced prudential standards to\nFBOs, including our flexibility in implementing certain aspects of these standards. I will also\noffer some initial thoughts on opportunities for further tailoring that regime for FBOs. Second is\nthe Volcker rule. I will provide some of my initial thinking on how we might be able to improve\nthe Volcker rule, both generally and in its application to FBOs in particular.\nEnhanced Prudential Standards\nIn implementing enhanced prudential standards for foreign banks with a large U.S.\npresence, we sought to ensure that firms hold sufficient local capital and liquidity--and have a\nrisk management infrastructure--that is commensurate with the risks in their U.S. operations.2\nAnd in general, that approach is meeting many of the broad goals the Federal Reserve set out to\nachieve. Today, foreign banks with large U.S. operations are less fragmented, maintain local\ncapital and liquidity buffers that align to the size and riskiness of their U.S. footprint, and operate\non equal footing with their domestic counterparts.\n2 The U.S. intermediate holding company structure provided for consistent application of capital, liquidity, and\nother prudential requirements and consistent supervision across the U.S. subsidiary operations of an FBO. See 12\nUSC 5365; Enhanced Prudential Standards for Bank Holding Companies and Foreign Banking Organizations, 79\nFed. Reg. 17,240 (March 27, 2014).\n\n- 5 -\nOur current approach aligns with other jurisdictions that host a large and complex foreign\nbank presence. For example, the European subsidiaries of U.S. banking firms have long been\nsubject to Basel-based standards imposed by the European Union and the United Kingdom as\nhost regulators. In addition, European regulators are contemplating a holding company structure\nfor the local operations of foreign banks to reduce fragmentation and ensure effective local\nsupervision, similar in many ways to Federal Reserve rules.\nIn adopting the enhanced prudential standards, however, the Board has acknowledged\nboth the uniqueness of FBOs--as the U.S. operations are a small part of a larger firm--and the\ndiversity of foreign bank operations in the United States. The Board contemplated from the\noutset that circumstances may require application of the rule’s requirements to be adjusted in\nlight of an individual firm’s structure or risk profile. The Board has exercised this authority in\nthe past, and I want to stress that we will continue to provide flexibility where appropriate to\naccommodate these differences.\nFor instance, in implementing enhanced risk management standards, we have focused on\noutcomes--a strong control environment for foreign bank operations in the United States--while\nproviding some flexibility in how those outcomes are achieved. We have allowed the global risk\ncommittee to serve as the risk committee for the U.S. operations rather than require the creation\nof a standalone committee. Further, for foreign banks with large U.S. branches but no IHC, the\nBoard has acknowledged the challenges associated with the location of the risk committee. The\nBoard has accordingly allowed risk committees at U.S. holding companies as well as managerial\ncommittees located in the United States, provided that the global board provided appropriate\n\n- 6 -\noversight.3 We are committed to continuing this outcomes-focused approach and to refining it\nwhere needed.\nFurther, we recognize that effective stress testing regimes can take many different forms,\nspecifically when interpreting the home-country stress testing requirements of the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Board has acknowledged, for example,\nthat a foreign bank’s internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) may meet the\nminimum standards, provided that the firm’s ICAAP is on a consolidated basis and reviewed by\nthe home country regulator.\nIn addition, while we believe that the IHC requirement serves a valuable role in ensuring\nconsistency of regulation across U.S. operations of an FBO, the Board has reserved authority to\napprove multiple IHCs if circumstances warrant based on the FBO’s activities, scope of\noperations, structure, home country regulatory framework, or similar considerations. For\nexample, the Board’s enhanced prudential standards rule contemplates allowing multiple IHCs in\ncases where home country legal requirements inhibit the combination of certain bank and\nnonbank operations.\nIn practice, and in several instances, the Board has permitted a foreign bank to maintain\ncertain U.S. subsidiaries outside of its IHC, so long as the foreign bank did not have practical\ncontrol over that subsidiary.4 In addition, the Board recently approved an application by a\nforeign bank for a second IHC. Part of our rationale for approving the dual IHC structure was\n3 See 12 CFR 252.155(a)(3) (requiring an FBO with U.S. branches and agencies and combined U.S. assets of\n$50 billion or more to maintain its risk committee as a committee of the board of directors of its U.S. intermediate\nholding company (as applicable) or as a committee or the global board of directors (or equivalent thereof)); see also\nGeneral Counsel opinion letters to Cooperatieve Rabobank U.A. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc., each\ndated October 19, 2016, related to the risk committee requirement.\n4 For instance, if the subsidiary was wholly owned by a joint venture between the foreign bank and the third party.\n\n- 7 -\nthe enhancement of recovery and resolution options of the global firm. In granting the\nexception, the Board applied enhanced prudential standards to the two IHCs in the same manner\nthat would apply to a single IHC, to maintain a level playing field and align incentives for the\nsafe and sound operation of both IHCs. This approach allows us more flexibility in addressing\nfirm-specific structure needs, while maintaining the goals of the enhanced prudential standards\nmore generally. We will continue to consider future applications based on the merits of the case.\nFinally, to the extent that foreign banks have decided to reduce the scope of their U.S.\noperations to reduce the application of some of the enhanced prudential standards, the Board has\naccommodated requests for extended transition periods, so as to avoid unnecessary investments\nin infrastructure that ultimately would not be required by regulation.\nWe are committed to tailoring our regulatory and supervisory regimes to align with the\nrisk posed by financial institutions to the U.S. financial system. We are also continuing to\nevaluate whether our rules are sensitive to changes in the risk profile of banking organizations.\nWe want our rules both to increase in stringency as firms’ risks grow and, just as important, to\ndecrease in stringency when firms have actively reduced their risk profiles.\nThe Volcker Rule\nLet me turn now to the Volcker rule. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I believe the\nregulation implementing the Volcker rule is an example of a complex regulation that is not\nworking well.\nThe fundamental premise of the Volcker rule is simple: banks with access to the federal\nsafety net--Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance and the Federal Reserve discount\nwindow--should not engage in risky, speculative trading for their own account. Whatever one’s\n\n- 8 -\nview of this basic premise, it is the law of the land. Taking that premise as a given, we have to\nask how to improve the framework of the implementing regulation to make it more workable and\nless burdensome in practice from both a compliance and supervisory perspective.\nI think we all can agree that the implementing regulation is exceedingly complex. As one\nexample of specifics, among many, the statute and implementing regulation’s approach to\ndefining “market making-related activities” rests on a number of complex requirements that are\ndifficult or impossible to verify objectively in real time. As a result, banks spend far too much\ntime and energy contemplating whether particular transactions or positions are consistent with\nthe Volcker rule.\nSome of you may quite sensibly be asking, “If the deficiencies of the regulation are so\napparent, how did we get here?” Despite the best of intentions in crafting the regulations, no one\nseems to be happy with the complex rule we wound up with. This has a very positive\nconsequence: I have heard nothing but support from all of my regulatory colleagues for the\nproposition that the regulation is overly complex and would benefit from streamlining and\nsimplifying to improve its workability in practice.\nWe are actively working with our fellow regulators in seeking ways to further tailor and\nto reduce burden, particularly for firms that do not have large trading operations and do not\nengage in the sorts of activities that may give rise to proprietary trading. We also appreciate the\nbroad extraterritorial impact of the rule in its current form for foreign banks’ operations outside\nof the United States. To that end, we have, with the full cooperation of all five Volcker\nregulatory agencies, picked back up the process that was begun last fall to engage in a\nrulemaking process subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and develop a proposal for\npublic comment that would make material changes to the Volcker rule regulations. In that\n\n- 9 -\nprocess we will take account of our own experience with the regulations since implementation,\nand we also want to take account of the views of market participants and other interested parties\nwith views on the Volcker rule, including what is working and what is not. We expect this\nprocess will proceed with dispatch.\nWe must also work within the confines of the statute. For example, a number of my\ncurrent and former Federal Reserve Board colleagues have expressed support for Congress\nproviding an exemption from the Volcker rule for community banks, which is something I also\nsupport. 5 Short of a statutory exemption, we can only do our best to mitigate burden on\ncommunity banks that generally do not engage in the types of activities the Volcker rule was\nintended to cover.6 Statutory changes likely would make our work of streamlining more\nstraightforward and complete, but we have a fair bit that we can accomplish even absent such\nchanges.\nWhat are some of the improvements that we are thinking about that would be possible\nwithin the regulation itself? As an initial matter, it should be clearer and more transparent what\nis subject to the Volcker rule’s implementing regulation and what is not. The definition of key\nterms like “proprietary trading” and “covered fund” should be as simple and clear as possible. It\n5 See, e.g., Jerome H. Powell, “Regulation and Supervision of Community Banks,” (speech at the Annual\nCommunity Bankers Conference, New York, NY, May 14, 2015),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20150514a.htm. (“I believe community banks should not face\nsignificant burdens from complying with these requirements, so I support raising the asset threshold for both the\nVolcker rule and incentive compensation rules, perhaps to $10 billion. In the event where the actions of a\ncommunity bank might raise concerns in either of these areas, that could be addressed through our normal\nexamination process.”); see also Daniel K. Tarullo, “Departing Thoughts,” (speech at The Woodrow Wilson School,\nPrinceton University, Princeton, NJ, April 4, 2017),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20170404a.htm. (“The third problem, also in the statute, is that\nthe Volcker rule applies to a much broader group of banks than is necessary to achieve its purpose. As I have said\nbefore, the concerns underlying the Volcker rule are simply not an issue at community banks.”)\n6 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, “The Volcker Rule: Community Bank Applicability,” news release. December 10,\n2013, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20131210a4.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nshould not be a guessing game or require hours of legal analysis of complex banking and\nsecurities regulations to determine if a particular entity is a covered fund. It should not happen--\nalthough it has happened--that our supervised firms come to us and ask questions about whether\na particular derivative trade is subject to the rule, and we cannot give them our own answer or a\nconsistent answer across the five responsible agencies. Supervisors need to be able to provide\nclear and transparent guidance on what is covered by the Volcker rule and what is not. This\nwould benefit not only the firms, but the supervisors at the agencies as well.\nAgain, a good example is the exemption for market making-related activities, which is\none of the key exemptions from the prohibition on proprietary trading. The rule contains a\ngaggle of complex regulatory requirements, but the statute contains merely one--that the market\nmaking-related activities are designed not to exceed the reasonably expected near-term demands\nof clients, customers, or counterparties, otherwise known as RENT’D.7 We are considering\ndifferent ways to use a clearer test for RENT’D. We want banks to be able to engage in market\nmaking and provide liquidity to financial markets with less fasting and prayer about their\ncompliance with the Volcker rule.\nAs I noted earlier, we also understand that the Volcker rule has had an extraterritorial\nimpact on FBOs. With respect to foreign banks, there are at least a few places where we would\nlike to revisit the application of the final rule based on concerns raised by market participants and\nothers over the past four years of implementation.\nIn particular, there are certain foreign funds--funds that are organized outside the United\nStates by foreign banks in foreign jurisdictions and offered solely to foreign investors--that are\n7 See 12 U.S.C. 1851(d)(1)(B); 12 CFR 248.4(b).\n\n- 11 -\nsubject to the Volcker rule due to Bank Holding Company Act control principles. Last summer,\nthe banking agencies, in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, issued guidance that effectively stayed enforcement\nof the Volcker rule to these foreign funds in light of the technical and complex issues they raise.8\nI expect we would continue this period of stay while we continue to consider these important\nissues.\nThe statute also contains exemptions for FBOs to allow foreign banks to continue trading\nand engaging in covered fund activities solely outside the United States. The regulation again\nhas a complex series of requirements that a foreign bank must meet to make use of these\nexemptions. We have heard from a number of foreign banks that complying with these\nrequirements is unworkable in practice, and we are considering ways to address this\nimpracticality. One possibility that has been suggested by market participants is a simple\napproach that focuses on the risk of the booking location. Of course, we would have to consider\nwhether this is possible in light of the language of the statute and principles of competitive\nequity, but the suggestion is illustrative of the possibility of a more workable approach.\nAs a final but no less important matter, we are considering broad revisions to the Volcker\nrule compliance regime. We would like Volcker rule compliance to be similar to compliance in\nother areas of our supervisory regime. As I noted earlier, we appreciate the broad extraterritorial\nimpact of the rule in its current form on foreign banks’ operations outside of the United States.\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, “Statement regarding Treatment of Certain Foreign Funds under the Rules\nImplementing Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act,” July 21, 2017\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20170721a1.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\nAccordingly, we will be looking for ways to reduce the compliance burden of the Volcker rule\nfor foreign banks with limited U.S. operations and small U.S. trading books.\nConclusion\nAs I have described previously, the Federal Reserve is actively reviewing post-crisis\nfinancial reforms in an effort to better understand which reforms are working well and which\nones can be improved to reduce regulatory burden and improve the efficiency, transparency, and\nsimplicity of the regulatory framework without compromising a safe and sound financial system.\nIn that effort, we recognize the importance of foreign banks to the U.S. economy and have a\nstrong interest in ensuring our regulations are appropriately tailored to their U.S. footprint and\nrisks to U.S. financial stability. Our goal is to maintain a regulatory framework that helps to\nensure a strong and stable banking system in an efficient manner that does not result in\nexcessively burdensome costs to the banking industry or the economy as a whole.\nThe areas I have discussed today are important components of the exercise of improving\nour regulations as they apply to FBOs, and are part of a larger overall agenda to critically\nevaluate and improve our regulations to promote financial stability while fostering the conditions\nfor solid economic activity. Some of these exercises will require more effort and time than\nothers, but each one of them is a high priority for us at the Federal Reserve. I look forward to\nhearing your views as we make progress toward these improvements.",

Quarles\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe American Enterprise Institute\nWashington, D.C.\nDecember 2, 2021\n\nWhen I joined the Board of Governors as Vice Chair for Supervision in the fall of\n2017, the Federal Reserve was in the latter stages of a decade-long effort to build a new\nfinancial regulatory framework, responding to the financial crisis of 2008. Yet, although\nthe mortar was not yet dry on that construction project—based on the blueprint created by\nCongress, central banks, and supervisors around the world—there was already broad\nrecognition across the political spectrum that the framework could be improved upon,\nbased on the experience of how it had worked over the decade of its implementation.\nThat was the judgement of the authors of the post-crisis blueprint, former Senator Chris\nDodd and former Congressman Barney Frank.1 It was also the recommendation of one\nof my predecessors at the Fed, Dan Tarullo—a principal architect of this framework—\nwho, in his final speech as a Fed governor, proposed several significant changes.2\nI came to the Fed in order to take on that task of making the system better: more\nsimple, more efficient, more transparent. Congress also took up this effort in the broadly\nbipartisan Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, and we\nadjusted our regulatory framework to better align our requirements with the risk posed by\nfirms to the financial system. We maintained and, in fact, raised regulatory standards for\nthe most systemically important firms and simplified regulatory requirements for smaller\nfirms without diminishing the resilience of the system as a whole.\nIn the midst of our work to improve our framework, we faced the unique\nexperience of the COVID event, which tested that resilience. This real-life stress test\n1 Chris Dodd and Barney Frank, interview by David Brancaccio, Marketplace, September 12, 2018,\nhttps://features.marketplace.org/politicsofcrisis/#transcript.\n2 Daniel K.

In the longer term, the Fed will at some point need to grapple with\nthe implications of some of the novel emergency lending facilities we established during\nthe onset of the COVID event. I supported these facilities in light of the specific\nchallenges the country faced that grueling spring, but I believe it is possible to draw some\nlessons from the experience and set out some principles for the Fed’s emergency lending\nto prevent this precedent – or some vision of what it represents—from exceeding\nreasonable bounds in the future. Finally, in my capacity as the outgoing Chairman of the\nFinancial Stability Board (FSB), I have some reflections on the upcoming agenda for the\nFSB.\nFurther Refinements to the Supervisory and Regulatory Framework\nAs I have noted previously, the post-crisis regulatory framework is strong, as\nevidenced by how well it fared against a severe real-life stress test—the COVID event.4\n3 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors or members of the Federal Reserve staff.\n4 Randal K. Quarles, “Jet Flight, Mail Bags, and Banking Regulation” (speech at the Prudential Regulation\nConference, Salt Lake City, UT, June 3, 2021),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20210603a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nBanks entered the COVID event with high levels of capital and liquidity, and served as a\nsource of strength to the economy in a time of need.5 Some have argued that the time of\nCOVID was not a true test of the system, because of the unprecedented level of fiscal and\nother support provided to the real economy during that time, from which the financial\nsector indirectly benefited. Such an argument ignores, however, that the Federal Reserve\ndid not take such support for granted during the throes of the crisis itself, and as a result\nwe ran multiple stress tests throughout the COVID event, with three separate and distinct\nscenarios, along with a “sensitivity analysis,” which itself included three additional\nhypothetical recessions.6 Each of these stress tests assumed no additional fiscal or other\nmeasures to support the economy, and demonstrated that, even without such support, the\nbanking industry would have fared very well. In my view the resilience of banks during\nthe COVID event, coupled with the results of our stress tests, demonstrate that the overall\nlevel of capital in the banking system is more than ample.\nIn addition to the demonstrated hardiness of our regulatory framework, I believe\nour supervisory framework is also stronger now than it was four years ago. In January\n2020, I spoke about the importance of transparency, accountability, and fairness in bank\n5 While the passage of time blurs all memories, it is worth recalling that during the early days of the\nCOVID event, we did not know how bad the inevitable recession would be, or how long it would last. As I\nhave said before, the fact that the Treasury market—the lifeblood of our financial system—malfunctioned\nunderscores the peril at the time. The banking system’s ability to function as a source of strength during\nthat period of tremendous uncertainty is certainly a testament to its resilience.\n6 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board releases results of annual\nbank stress tests,” news release, June 24, 2021,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210624a.htm. See also “Federal Reserve\nBoard releases second round of bank stress test results,” news release, December 18, 2020,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20201218b.htm and “Federal Reserve\nBoard releases results of stress tests for 2020 and additional sensitivity analyses conducted in light of the\ncoronavirus event,” news release, June 25, 2020,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200625c.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nsupervision.7 Every agency of the federal government has a legal, constitutional, and, I\nbelieve, moral responsibility to be accountable to the public we serve, and one of the\nprincipal ways we do this is through transparency. The banking agencies (including the\nFed) have for decades not been transparent in the way that we have conducted\nsupervision—yet, especially since 2008, we had been accomplishing more and more of\nour work through this opaque mechanism with limited accountability. In that light, I am\nquite proud of the improvements we have made in increasing the transparency and public\naccountability for our activities overseeing banks.\nThe Fed fostered the public conversation on transparency in supervision when we\norganized a conference on supervision and actively participated in the discussion with\nacademics and other members of the public. An important part of monetary policy\ntransparency is the semiannual process where the Fed reports on its activities to Congress\nand the Chair submits to questions from both houses of Congress. I am pleased to say\nthat there is now a similar twice-yearly process in which the Fed produces a public,\nwritten report on supervision and regulation and then submits to questions from\nlawmakers. Our Supervision and Regulation Report—instituted early in my term—\nregularly provides the public with insights about our supervisory process, including\naggregate supervisory ratings trends and supervisory priorities for our different\nportfolios—information that was previously hard to find, and sometimes not public at all.\n7 Randal K. Quarles, “Spontaneity and Order: Transparency, Accountability, and Fairness in Bank\nSupervision” (speech at the American Bar Association Banking Law Committee Meeting 2020,\nWashington, DC, January 17, 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20200117a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nI believe one concrete and successful change to supervision was to our stress\ntesting process, where we have greatly increased transparency, and thus accountability.8\nTransparency does not mean giving answers to tests in advance—an inapt analogy given\nthe structure of these tests—but is more akin to ensuring that students have been given\nthe textbook. It means balancing rigor and fairness, and ensuring that the Fed’s\nintentions are understood well enough to advance our goal—and our goal is not to\ndevelop the most recondite test, but rather for banks to improve their resilience to\nextraordinary stress in the financial system. The evidence that we succeeded is how well\nbanks weathered the extraordinary stress that arrived in the spring of 2020, consistent\nwith the results of our stress tests.\nTransparency, accountability, and the public legitimacy it confers have\nempowered the Fed to meet the great challenges that our economy and financial system\nhave faced in recent years. If the Federal Reserve is to continue to play that vital role,\nthen it must also continue to extend transparency to all of its important responsibilities.\nAs I look ahead to the future of regulation and supervision at the Federal Reserve, I\nbelieve that the Fed will be more effective in overseeing banks, and more effective in\npromoting the stability of the financial system, if it maintains its commitment to be open\nand transparent in how it conducts its work.\nIn the same spirit, while our regulatory and supervisory framework is strong, there\nare further refinements that could be made to improve the framework. A number of them\nwere on my agenda when the COVID event shifted the Fed’s focus to deal with the\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board finalizes set of changes\nthat will increase the transparency of its stress testing program for nation’s largest and most complex\nbanks,” news release, February 5, 2019,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20190205a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nemergency. I am proud of what we accomplished in my time here, but there is certainly\nmore to be done.\nLeverage Ratio Fundamentalism\nOne of the principal matters that the Fed will have to take up in the very near term\nis the calibration of our leverage capital standards. Our capital framework includes two\ntypes of requirements: risk-based and leverage capital requirements. Risk-based\nrequirements are risk-sensitive and change depending on the riskiness of an asset.\nLeverage capital requirements set a minimum floor for required capital by disregarding\nrisk-sensitivity measures. Our capital framework includes two leverage requirements,\nwith increasingly strict requirements for the largest institutions.9\nWhile a leverage ratio is an important backstop, it can result in perverse\nincentives if it becomes the primary constraint on a bank’s investment decisions.\nBecause a leverage ratio is not sensitive to risk, a firm that is “bound” by such a ratio has\nan incentive to avoid adding safe assets to its portfolio. During times of stress in the\nfinancial system, when it is most important for banks to be able to continue serving\nbusinesses and households, or intermediating transactions, a binding leverage\nconstraint—or even one that threatens to become binding—may discourage banks from\nengaging in safe activities, such as those involving U.S. Treasury securities.10\n9 The first is a 4 percent ratio that applies to all banking organizations and is based on the ratio of tier 1\ncapital to average total consolidated assets. In addition, the largest banking organizations are subject to a 3\npercent supplementary leverage ratio requirement, based on a ratio of tier 1 capital to on-balance-sheet\nassets and certain off-balance-sheet assets. This supplementary requirement is stricter for U.S. global\nsystemically important banks (U.S. G-SIBs). U.S. G-SIBs must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of\n3 percent plus an additional buffer of 2 percent to avoid limitations on capital distributions. Their\ndepository institution subsidiaries must maintain a 6 percent supplementary leverage ratio to be deemed\n“well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework of each federal banking agency.\n10 As I mentioned previously, one of the primary strains in the financial markets during the onset of the\nCOVID event was in the Treasury market, where a wide range of investors sought to sell Treasuries to raise\n\n- 7 -\nThat is not to say that a leverage requirement should never be the constraining\nrequirement for a firm. In times of stress, a leverage ratio can serve as a transparent\nmeasure of capital when our risk weights may be called into question. In addition, it\nguards against behavior by a supervised institution to game those risk weights. Finally, a\nleverage ratio leans against the inherent tendency of bank leverage to increase in an\neconomic boom and fall during a recession.\nWhat we are seeing today, however, is that supervised firms are increasingly\nbeing constrained by the supplementary leverage ratio not for any of these valid reasons,\nbut simply because of a rise in the level of safe assets in the U.S. financial system. The\nsupplementary leverage ratio was originally calibrated for a financial system with a far\nlower level of central bank reserves and a much smaller Treasury market.11 The current\nenvironment is, of course, much different. Treasury issuance is at an all-time high and\nthe banking system is awash with central bank reserves. To provide some context to the\ndegree of this trend, for the largest banks, the amount of reserves they hold is $1.35\ntrillion and the amount of Treasury securities is $1.38 trillion, each roughly double the\namount they held when our supplementary leverage ratio rule was finalized. Even at\nthese lower levels of safe assets, some on the Board worried that the SLR might be too\ntightly calibrated—but they took comfort from the staff’s projection that reserves in the\nsystem were likely to fall, creating more elbow room within the envelope created by the\ncash. Those selling pressures appear to have overwhelmed dealers’ capacity or willingness to absorb and\nintermediate Treasury securities. Randal K. Quarles, “What Happened? What Have We Learned From It?\nLessons from COVID-19 Stress on the Financial System,” (speech at the Institute of International Finance,\nWashington, DC, October 15, 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20201015a.htm.\n11 See “Agencies adopt enhanced supplementary leverage ratio final rule and issue supplementary leverage\nratio notice of proposed rulemaking,” news release, April 8, 2014,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20140408a.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nSLR. Indeed, when we finalized our leverage requirements for the largest banks, staff\nprojected the amount of reserves in the system would decline to $25 billion by year end\n2021.12 The current total of approximately $4.16 trillion in reserves is about 165 times\nthat amount.\nDuring the onset of the COVID event, regulators took emergency action to\nexclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the\nsupplementary leverage ratio to provide banks with additional flexibility to act as\nfinancial intermediaries in that period of financial stress.13 That exclusion expired as\nscheduled on March 31, 2021. I supported that expiration, with the commitment that the\nFed develop a longer-term solution to the perverse implications of the current calibration\nof the SLR.\nWith respect to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) that applies to\nU.S. global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), the best way to address this problem\nis the approach endorsed by the Basel Committee: recalibrating the fixed 2-percent eSLR\nbuffer requirement to equal 50 percent of the applicable G-SIB capital surcharge, with\ncorresponding recalibration at the bank level.14 This is an approach previously proposed\n12 Federal Reserve Board, Report to the FOMC on Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy, Book B at\n49, fn.5 (March 13, 2014),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20140319tealbookb20140313.pdf.\n13 See “Regulators temporarily change the supplementary leverage ratio to increase banking organizations’\nability to support credit to households and businesses in light of the coronavirus response,” news release,\nMay 15, 2020, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200515a.htm. See also\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board announces temporary change\nto its supplementary leverage ratio rule to ease strains in the Treasury market resulting from the\ncoronavirus and increase banking organizations’ ability to provide credit to households and businesses,”\nnews release, April 1, 2020,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200401a.htm.\n14 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Leverage ratio requirements for global systemically\nimportant banks (Basel: Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, January 2022),\nhttps://www.bis.org/basel_framework/chapter/LEV/40.htm?inforce=20220101&published=20191215&exp\nort=pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nby the Board and the OCC.15 This is preferable to other options, such as excluding\ncentral bank reserves or U.S. Treasury securities, or both, from the ratio’s denominator.\nExcluding only central bank reserves would exacerbate a structural preference for\nreserves over Treasuries in bank portfolios, which could have perverse consequences for\nthe operation of the Treasury market (as we saw in September of 2019). Trying to reduce\nthis preference by excluding both reserves and Treasuries could result in a significant\nlowering of capital levels and exacerbate the incentive for the banking system to prefer\nfunding the government to funding private enterprise. If we were to attempt to offset the\nlowering of capital levels by increasing the leverage capital requirement on non-excluded\nassets, this disincentive to fund private enterprise would only grow stronger. But\nwhatever the form of the adjustment, this issue needs to be addressed to ensure that our\ncapital framework does not lead to increased risk taking and reduced safe-asset\nintermediation. As it stands, we are driving deposits out of the highly regulated banking\nsystem and requiring that cash be held in other, less stable parts of the financial sector,\nsuch as money market funds. If we enter another crisis with this issue unaddressed, the\nleverage ratio fundamentalists will have much to answer for.\nBasel III Reforms\nInternational cooperation regarding our prudential requirements is critical to\npromote global resilience in the banking sector, and I have been strongly committed since\nmy arrival at the Board to implementing the final phase of the Basel III capital reforms\nhere in the United States. I had hoped that the US would have led the world in setting out\n15 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Rule proposed to tailor ‘enhanced supplementary\nleverage ratio’ requirements,” news release, April 11, 2018,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20180411a.htm.\n\n- 10 -\na concrete proposal to implement the Basel III endgame by the end of last year, but the\nintervention of COVID set back that timetable, and although we are working hard with\nthe other banking agencies to iron out the last issues, our proposal will have to come after\nmy departure. A major issue that we are grappling with is how to implement these\nreforms, which reduce the role of bank internal models on bank capital requirements,\nwhile maintaining the overall level of aggregate capital requirements. As I noted earlier,\nthe experience of the COVID event has made clear that capital requirements in the United\nStates are ample—yet, other things being equal, implementing the remaining elements of\nBasel III could result in a material increase in capital levels, perhaps up to 20 percent for\nour largest holding companies. Endlessly increasing capital levels is not costless. In the\nreal world, as opposed to the world from which certain pundits and kibitzers make their\noccasional visits to our planet, excessively high capital levels constrain the ability of the\nbanking system to provide credit to the real economy, and we pay the cost in jobs and\nliving standards. What policymakers will need to do as they implement the Basel III\nreforms is determine whether adjustments to other parts of the capital framework are\nnecessary to ensure that we do not unduly increase the level of required capital in the\nsystem.\nThe most logical place to make such an adjustment would be the G-SIB\nsurcharge. In the US, we have calibrated the G-SIB surcharge at twice the internationally\nagreed level, and we did so expressly noting that we would revisit the surcharge\ncalibration periodically to reflect current conditions. We have not followed through on\nour commitment to revisit the surcharge calibration, and once these last elements of the\nBasel framework are implemented, there will be little justification for a super-calibrated\n\n- 11 -\nG-SIB surcharge. But many people have an emotional attachment to the G-SIB\nsurcharge, and if that emotion should overwhelm the logic of the case, there are other less\ntalismanic candidates for re-calibration in the existing capital framework that could\nachieve the same purpose of keeping aggregate capital roughly constant while completing\nBasel III.\nVolatility in our Stress Tests\nOur stress testing framework is a cornerstone of our prudential framework, and I\nam proud of how well it performed during the COVID event, helping to ease stress in the\nfinancial system by demonstrating the capital adequacy of banks. The stress testing\nframework is used to set capital requirements for large firms, and the volatility of these\nrequirements from year to year indicates that we still do not have those requirements\nquite right. As I have said previously, excessive volatility in a firm’s capital\nrequirements limits the firm’s ability to manage its capital effectively.16 While some\nmeasure of volatility is expected and desirable in a dynamic stress test, we must guard\nagainst excess volatility when it has no particular relationship to changing risks at firms.\nIt is difficult to justify large year-over-year swings in capital requirements for individual\nbanking firms that are simply artifacts of the stress testing process rather than reflecting a\ngenuine change in a firm’s business.\nI have wrestled for some time with the question of how best to address excessive\nvolatility. In the end, I think the simplest and most effective approach would be to\n16 Randal K. Quarles, “A New Chapter in Stress Testing,” (speech at the Brookings Institution,\nWashington, DC, November 9, 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20181109a.htm. See also Randal K. Quarles,\n“Stress Testing: A Decade of Continuity and Change,” (speech at the Brookings Institution, Washington,\nDC, July 9, 2019), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20190709a.htm.\n\n- 12 -\naverage the results of the current year’s stress test with the corresponding stress test\nresults from the previous two years. This would not affect the overall stringency of the\ntests but would mean that firms that hold the risk profile of their balance sheets relatively\nconstant would not see a large spike or plummet in their required capital from year-to-\nyear based on changes in the Fed’s scenario choices.\nCross-Border Resolution and Market Fragmentation\nIn May 2018, I spoke about the vital importance of cross-border banking to global\nfinancial stability and prosperity.17 The Fed’s work internationally on pre-positioning,\nring-fencing, and market fragmentation is still vital, and we should continue efforts to\nfind the right balance between flexibility for the parent bank and certainty for host\ncountry authorities. Striking that balance properly is essential in order to encourage the\ninternational cooperation that is so critical during times of global financial stress.\nAs I noted previously, while a home regulator will by nature prefer flexibility in\nresolution, the host regulator will prefer certainty that local resources will be available in\nstressful conditions. The host regulator, however, must recognize that flexibility in a\nsingle point of entry resolution may further the success of the resolution of the entire\ngroup, which will ultimately benefit the host regulator. Domestically, the United States\nneeds to do its part in its role as a host regulator by making sure that our U.S. pre-\npositioning requirements for foreign banks with significant U.S. operations are\nappropriately calibrated. U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign-owned G-SIBs\nare required to issue a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments to their foreign\n17 Randal K. Quarles, “Trust Everyone—But Brand Your Cattle: Finding the Right Balance in Cross-\nBorder Resolution” (speech at Harvard Law School, Cambridge, MA, May 16, 2018),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20180516a.htm.\n\n- 13 -\nparents. These requirements with respect to what is known as internal total loss\nabsorbing capacity include a separate minimum unsecured long-term debt requirement.\nOur internal total loss-absorbing requirements for these firms are currently at the\ntop end of the scale set forth by the FSB and willingness by the United States to consider\nadjusting that calibration to a lower level within the FSB-agreed range may prompt other\njurisdictions to do the same. Such a global recalibration, which would do nothing to\ndiminish the loss absorbency requirements that apply at a consolidated group level, could\nbetter the prospects of successful resolution both for foreign G-SIBs operating in the\nUnited States and for U.S. G-SIBs operating abroad in a future period of financial stress.\nWe also should consider further simplification of our regulatory framework by\nstreamlining our currently separate and somewhat redundant total loss-absorbing capacity\nand long-term debt requirements. It is important that we do not create conditions that\nwill make any resolution more difficult in the future.\nSupervision\nI have already noted that transparency and accountability—and the legitimacy\nthey confer—have helped the Fed to meet the great challenges of recent years. As I look\nahead to the future of supervision at the Federal Reserve, I believe that if the Fed\nmaintains its commitment to openness and transparency in how it conducts supervision, it\nwill be more effective in overseeing banks and promoting the stability of the financial\nsystem. Being open and transparent does not mean relaxing supervisory standards.\nGreater transparency makes supervision more effective by ensuring that our expectations\nare well understood. And by more clearly explaining and justifying those expectations,\n\n- 14 -\nwe enhance the legitimacy of our standards and build respect for the rules, which is\ncritical to promoting and producing compliance in any legal regime.\nWe need to do more here, and while we have made many of the improvements to\ntransparency I discussed in my January 2020 speech, there is still unfinished work.18 The\ngreatest focus should be on improving our supervisory communications process. We can\ndo so in a few ways. First, we should restore the “supervisory observation” category for\nless urgent items of concern, which could increase the quality of feedback provided to a\nfirm as it would allow an examiner to give notice about a supervisory concern even if that\nconcern has not risen to the level of a matter requiring attention, or MRA. We should be\nvigilant that future MRAs are limited to violations of law, violations of regulation, and\nmaterial safety and soundness issues to improve the fairness of our supervisory process\ngiven the weight MRAs carry with respect to a bank’s supervisory rating. We have\ncommitted to this practice, but in the absence of a supervisory observations category it\nremains too common that we issue MRAs for supervisory concerns that do not truly rise\n18 Since January 2020, the Federal Reserve has taken a number of measures to improve its supervisory\nframework. The Federal Reserve defined the financial institutions subject to the LISCC framework. See\nSR 20-30: Financial Institutions Subject to the LISCC Supervisory Program at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr2030.htm. The Federal Reserve also adopted a\nfinal rule, codifying an interagency statement, which affirmed the principle that supervisory guidance does\nnot have the force and effect of law or regulation. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\n“Federal Reserve Board adopts final rule outlining and confirming the use of supervisory guidance for\nregulated institutions,” news release, March 31, 2021,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210331a.htm. In addition, we have\nreleased, in searchable form, scores of historical private legal interpretations of our significant rules. See\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/legalinterpretations/legalinterpretations.htm. The Federal\nReserve also finalized a rule that clarified revisions to the definition of confidential supervisory information\n(CSI), which allows banks to share CSI with a broader range of parties and thereby better resolve\nsupervisory concerns. See “Federal Reserve Board finalizes a rule that implements technical clarifying\nupdates to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) procedures and changes to rules for the disclosure of CSI,”\nnews release, July 24, 2020,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200724a.htm. Finally, we adjusted the\nscope of our capital planning guidance, SR Letters 15-18 and 15-19, to align with our tailoring framework.\n\n- 15 -\nto that level. We need a framework that allows us to communicate all our concerns,\nwhile recognizing that “when everything’s urgent, nothing is.”\nFinally, we should implement a routine practice of independent review of\nimportant supervisory communications and guidance documents. We want to make sure\nour supervisory communications focus on violations of law and material safety and\nsoundness issues. Together, these approaches will greatly improve our supervisory\ncommunication and enhance our supervisory process.\nDigital Assets\nFinally, before turning to some longer-term issues, I would like to discuss digital\nassets, which the banking agencies have all said will be an area of significant focus in the\ncoming year.19 The Federal Reserve, and our fellow regulators, should welcome\nresponsible innovation, and we should create a regulatory environment that not only\nallows for such innovation, but encourages it.\nDigital assets, such as stablecoins, are just such an area of welcome innovation. It\nis clear that there is a strong demand for these assets among bank customers, and well-\nregulated banks should be allowed to engage in activities regarding these assets. We do\nhave some legitimate concerns that must be addressed by any provider of these assets:\nthe structure of the asset must be stable (no fractional reserve; no liquidity mismatch;\nlimited currency volatility), the consumer must be protected (clear legal claims on asset\npools), and criminal activity must be deterred (transparency to law enforcement). But\nonce these concerns are addressed—and many of the companies active in this area are\n19 See “Interagency Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Policy Sprint Initiative and Next Steps,” news release,\nNovember 23, 2021, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20211123a1.pdf.\n\n- 16 -\neager and able to address them—we should let the ingenious and inventive private sector\nmove rapidly.\nI am concerned, however, that regulators are contemplating steps that could\nhamper these innovations unnecessarily. For example, the President’s Working Group on\nFinancial Markets recently issued its report on stablecoins and, while the report sensibly\ndiscusses the risks associated with stablecoins, it contemplates approaches that I don’t\nbelieve are warranted, such as limiting wallet providers’ affiliation with commercial\nentities.20 It is one thing to say that a stablecoin issuer itself must be a regulated bank—I\nthink that is probably overkill, as there are perfectly effective ways for nonbanks to meet\nour legitimate regulatory concerns, but there is at least a clear relation between the\nexisting framework of bank regulation and the specific measures that stablecoin issuers\nmust address to operate safely. It is, however, quite another thing to contemplate that\nwallet providers may need to be completely separated from commercial firms. It is not at\nall clear what regulatory interest would be furthered by such a limitation, which is much\nmore restrictive than we require for nondigital assets.\nWhile digital asset-related activities may be novel, regulators need not treat these\nactivities differently simply because of the nature of the technology. We must focus with\ncare on the unique risks posed by these activities and avoid unnecessarily impeding their\npromise. For that reason, I am hopeful that regulators will show reasoned constraint in\nthe regulation of digital assets.\n20 President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, Report on Stablecoins (Washington: U.S. Treasury, November\n2021), https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf.\n\n- 17 -\nLessons Learned from the Emergency Lending Facilities\nTo this point, I have been addressing issues that the Fed will have to deal with in\nthe near term. Let me now turn to a longer-term challenge: the implications of our\nemergency actions in the recent crisis. The COVID event caused an unprecedented—\nindeed, unimagined—shutdown of economic activity in the United States and much of\nthe world. The Federal Reserve responded to the COVID event with the same vigor it\nshowed when the Great Financial Crisis threatened a worldwide Depression, employing\nour ample emergency power under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to stabilize\nthe economy and financial system. In this case, we reactivated forms of the lending\nfacilities employed during the Great Financial Crisis, and then went farther to create new\nlending facilities to support households, businesses, and state and local government\nentities that, it was feared, would be frozen out of credit markets. In all, the Federal\nReserve created 13 lending facilities with the statutorily required approval of the\nSecretary of the Treasury. I supported these actions, and still do, as the right response\nwhen faced with the specific challenges we faced in the spring of 2020.\nBut I did at the time, and still do, have concerns about the possible precedents that\nhave been created by the novel facilities that we created. It starts with a distinction\nbetween liquidity facilities21 designed to bolster market functioning by providing short-\nterm loans to financial firms when such credit is suddenly not available, and what I would\n21 I view the liquidity facilities as the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), the Primary Dealer\nCredit Facility (PDCF), the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF), the Term Asset-\nBacked Securities Loan Facility (TALF), and the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF).\nBut there is room for adjustment of this typology: certain features of both the TALF and PPPLF programs\nmight indicate that they should fall in the credit facility category.\n\n- 18 -\ncall credit facilities22, which support the extension of long-term credit to the real\neconomy—households, businesses, and governments.\nThe two different types of facilities have materially different characteristics. The\nliquidity facilities are largely “wholesale”23; the term of the funding they offer is\ngenerally quite short; operating them calls on expertise that Fed staff either have or that is\nquite similar to existing expertise; the risk of loss is minimal, given the nature of the\nfacilities; and withdrawing from them is relatively straightforward, either selling the\nassets or letting them mature, which happens quickly given the short term and penalty\nrate of the funding.\nThe credit facilities, by contrast, are largely “retail”24; the end-users of the credit\nsupport are households, businesses, and governments that attract significant political\ninterest, meaning pressure for continued expansion of credit will be great; the credit\nfacilities involve longer-term lending; operating the credit facilities requires expertise that\nthe Fed does not have and that is not highly analogous to existing Fed expertise; the\npotential for troubled loans (and thus potential loss) is material, which will also require\nexpertise and administrative attention that the Fed is ill suited to provide; the penalty rate\nneeded for 13(3) lending can reduce the effectiveness of the facilities (and encounter\n22 I view the credit facilities as the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF), the Secondary\nMarket Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF), the Main Street Lending Program (Main Street), and the\nMunicipal Liquidity Facility (MLF). Again, some might argue that TALF and PPPLF also belong here.\n23 By “wholesale,” I mean that the liquidity facilities are aimed at improving the operation of wholesale\nfinancial markets, rather than providing longer term funds for households and businesses in the real\neconomy. They are thus generally quite removed from politically appealing groups of beneficiaries.\n24 By “retail,” I mean that the credit facilities provide longer-term credit either directly to nonfinancial\nactors, or to financial firms for the sole purpose of on-lending to defined classes of nonfinancial actors, all\nin support of the real economy rather than the operation of financial markets.\n\n- 19 -\nsignificant political opposition), given the purpose of the credit support and the nature of\nthe beneficiaries; and withdrawing from the facilities will involve telling specific\nbeneficiaries that their funding will not be extended (another politically fraught event).\nEqually important, from outside the technocratic halls of the Fed there will\nemerge, from many directions, persistent political pressure to pursue, through the\nostensibly monetary mechanism of central bank emergency lending, fiscal policy\nobjectives that ought—as a matter of fundamental economics and fundamental\ngovernance—to be decided upon by elected representatives operating within the\nbudgetary constraints of the appropriations process. As a prospective shortcut around\nthose constraints, extended provision of credit to broad sections of the economy through\nthe mechanism of 13(3) without either a required appropriation or effective limit could\neasily prove an impossible lure for future Congresses to resist, under the guise of one\n“emergency” or another: having established the precedent that the Fed can lend to\nbusinesses and municipalities for the COVID event, there will inevitably be those whose\nplans are grand and whose patience with democratic accountability low who will begin to\nask why the Fed can’t fund repairs of the country’s aging infrastructure, or finance the\nbuilding of a border wall, or purchase trillions of dollars of green energy bonds, or\nunderwrite the colonization of Mars. An entity that can do that without any need for\nCongressional appropriations, would have the vastest political consequence and political\ncontrol of it would be a great prize. It would encourage dangerous fiscal irresponsibility,\nand the attendant pressures would turn us from a technocratic, nonpolitical institution\nwith a crucial but focused mandate and great autonomy in the pursuit of that mandate,\n\n- 20 -\ninto the most politically entangled organization in the country—and the damage to our\ncore monetary policy and financial regulatory mission would be great.\nFortunately, there were no major problems with the COVID credit facilities.\nWhile political pressure related to the credit facilities waxed and waned, the economy\nrecovered quickly enough that the facilities could be wound down within several months\nwith relatively little opera. However, these good outcomes had more to do with good\nluck than good structure. While the economy and financial system were under intense\nstress for several months in spring of 2020, the reopening of the economy and rapid\nrecovery that began in May of that year was a major reason that material losses, political\npressures, and operational problems were avoided. To cite one example, the crisis in the\nmunicipal bond market, which seemed possible that spring, never materialized.25\nWe cannot undo the precedent we have established (nor should we—if we face a\nsimilar challenge in the future, the Fed should respond forcefully), but in breaching the\nlong unbreachable firewall of offering direct lending to non-financial businesses, both\nlarge and small—as well as a wide range of state and municipal governments—we face a\nfundamental problem: the extension of funds to these borrowers, and management of\nthese loans, inherently involve the allocation of credit, which is both a fiscal and a\npolitical action that is being made primarily by an unelected body.\n25 While it was feared that plunging tax revenue would cause widespread fiscal problems for state and local\ngovernments that could freeze municipal bond markets, tax revenue did not fall significantly because\nemployment losses were concentrated in low wage jobs, incomes were supported by generous\nunemployment compensation payments, the decline in consumption was concentrated in services which\nhave lower sales tax burdens, and property taxes continued to rise in the booming housing market. While\nthe creation of the MLF helped settle markets and obviate the need for the emergency facility, and aid to\nstates and localities from Congress was significant, it is hard to know how much intervention would have\nbeen needed, and how this episode would have played out, if states and localities had faced big financial\nproblems.\n\n- 21 -\nFor all these reasons, I believe we should establish a clear understanding that,\nshould the Fed ever again use its 13(3) authority to establish credit facilities similar to\nthose of the COVID event, Congress will without delay create a structure to transfer the\nongoing funding and governance of the credit facilities into a non-Fed vehicle that will\nfund, manage, and eventually wind down the extraordinary credit support.26\nSection 13(3) creates a standing power of the Fed to act rapidly and forcefully to\naddress a crisis. 13(3) allows the nature of that response to be flexible depending on the\nnature of the crisis. Financial market dysfunction can be addressed through 13(3)\nliquidity facilities that fit comfortably within the Fed’s operations and expertise, and in\nmany cases might not require any use of Treasury equity or other Congressionally\nappropriated funds.\nBut if the shock is one—like the COVID event—that requires real economy credit\nsupport to address its root causes, the Fed can use 13(3) to provide the same rapid and\nforceful response (with appropriate Treasury equity for credit protection), but we should\nestablish the expectation that this credit support will be moved into a separate, non-Fed\nstructure as quickly as Congress can manage. In the same way that the 13(3) facilities\ndeveloped in 2008 served as templates in 2020, greatly increasing the speed of our\nresponse, the template outlined here that we create for the future here should ideally\nbecome the default expectation of Congress, markets, and the public should the Fed ever\nagain be called upon to provide credit facilities under section 13(3).\nThere are many precedents for such an approach. During the Great Depression,\nfor example, Congress created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) to provide\n26 I should stress that these measures would be necessary only for credit facilities. The Fed’s liquidity\nfacilities can be created and managed by the Fed without the need for such measures.\n\n- 22 -\nemergency credit to the real economy, expressly steering clear of the problems that would\nnaturally have been associated with using the Federal Reserve for such a purpose.27 The\nRFC had a limited life, separately appropriated capitalization, and separate borrowing\nauthority in order to fund direct lending to borrowers. More recently, during the 1990s\nfinancial and economic crisis in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, after initial stabilizing\nresponses from their central banks, these countries established new governmental\nagencies outside their central banks to manage the broader, continuing support programs.\nMeasures such as these have a number of advantages:\n1. A separate entity can be expressly stated to be an emergency vehicle with a\nlimited life. It can be legally required to extend credit for a short, specified period\nand then be wound down.\n2. Providing credit support through a separate vehicle establishes a clear division\nbetween fiscal measures and monetary policy.\n3. Lending through a separate organization allows more flexibility on the interest\nrate and other terms of government-sponsored credit support. While we were\nlucky in the COVID event, one could easily have imagined the economic crisis\ndeepening to the point where achieving the purposes of widespread credit support\nwould have called for lending at a market or even subsidized rate, rather than the\npenalty rate required for central bank lending. Doing so is a decision that should\nbe made by Congress, rather than the Fed.\n4. The separate incorporation and funding of a separate vehicle would give\ntransparency and clear boundaries to the degree of government financial support\nbeing provided to the economy.\n5. Placing the inherently political decisions around the allocation of credit in a\nseparately governed entity will keep the Fed from being fundamentally\ntransformed by efforts to politicize the credit-granting mechanism.\n6. Finally, having a separate entity will facilitate hiring the necessary people with\nthe necessary expertise, which will likely be quite different from the expertise\nusually found in either the Treasury or the Federal Reserve.\n27 Parinitha Sastry, “The Political Origins of Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act,” FRBNY Economic\nPolicy Review (New York: Federal Reserve Board of New York, September 2018),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/2018/epr_2018_political-origins_sastry.pdf.\n\n- 23 -\na. In particular, the types of personnel and expertise required to work out\ntroubled loans made with government credit support are very different\nfrom the personnel and expertise widely available in either the Fed or the\nTreasury.\nThis would not be a U-turn from our decisive response to the COVID event, but\nrather simply the logical next step. In addition to providing clarity for the public as to\nwhat to expect in future crises, adopting this model going forward could reduce concerns\na future Fed might have that a forceful response could entangle it in difficult political\nproblems. This could help give a future Fed the freedom to determine what it believes is\ntruly the right technocratic response to a particular future shock. Adoption of such a\nframework would also reduce the attraction of the Fed as a general purpose funder of\ncredit-intensive political projects—we would have established that the piper will not only\nalways have to be paid, but paid promptly. This framework also gives an appropriate role\nto 13(3), consistent with the clear authority granted to us, but also consistent with what\nwe have learned about the entanglement of central banks with fiscal policy and politics in\nthe years since 13(3)'s enactment. We would not be ignoring the credit support authority\n13(3) gives us, rather we would be anchoring it in its appropriate emergency context.\nThe Future of the Financial Stability Board\nAs we continue to grapple with a future framework for emergency lending, the\nUnited States is not alone. Around the world, financial authorities are reflecting on the\nlessons from the COVID event while exchanging experiences and views at the FSB,\nwhich I have chaired for the past three years. My FSB term ended just yesterday, but\nthere remains much to be done at the FSB.\n\n- 24 -\nOne of the most important tasks is addressing vulnerabilities related to non-bank\nfinancial intermediation, or NBFI.\nThis has been a critical focus of my chairmanship and is reflected in the FSB’s\nambitious multiyear workplan to enhance NBFI resilience. One set of initiatives under\nthe workplan focuses on specific risk factors that appear to have propagated stress,\nincluding liquidity strains during the COVID event. The FSB has made considerable\nprogress in the NBFI space in a short amount of time. As a first major deliverable under\nthe NBFI work program, the FSB recently published policy proposals to address\nstructural vulnerabilities in money market mutual funds (MMFs).\nAlthough we’ve made good progress, we cannot lose momentum. It is critical\nthat jurisdictions make meaningful progress in MMF reforms, building on the FSB’s\npolicy proposals. FSB members have clearly noted the importance of this task by\ncommitting to reviewing the progress made by members in two- and five-years’ time.\nThe FSB and international standard-setting bodies must also advance policy work on\nspecific risk areas, such as open-ended funds and margining practices, that appear to have\ncontributed to stress during the COVID event. We also need to develop a shared\nunderstanding of how vulnerabilities in the NBFI sector may cause spillover effects or\nimpact broader market functioning in the future. To achieve this aim, the FSB will\ncontinue to examine the structure and drivers of liquidity in government and corporate\nbond markets during stress and develop a broad, systemic risk perspective on NBFI as\nwell as policies to address such risks.\nAs chair of the FSB, I have had the opportunity to work with brilliant and\ndedicated colleagues around the world. Under pressure from the severe tests of the\n\n- 25 -\nCOVID event, together we delivered—true to our mandate—through cooperation,\nanalytical rigor, and broad engagement. I depart the Financial Stability Board knowing it\nis well-prepared to complete the tasks at hand and face the challenges of the future.\nConclusion\nI am told that Dan Tarullo’s final speech as a Fed Governor was 26 pages long,\nand this one is only 25—consistent with my relentless quest to improve the Fed’s\nefficiency and simplicity. Yet even at this Mahabharatan length, I have only hit the\nhighlights of what my successor will need to address. Fortunately, he (or she) will\nbenefit from the same principal advantages I have had over the last four years: the\nintellectual horsepower, analytical rigor, and disciplined expertise of the Federal\nReserve’s staff. These are powerful advantages indeed, even with so complex and\nsustained an agenda. I wish her (or him) well.",

Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nStanford Institute for Economic Policy Research\nStanford University\nStanford, California\nDecember 5, 2018\n\nIt’s a pleasure to be here at Stanford, an honor to be invited to speak by SIEPR and the\nBill Lane Center--two institutions for which I have long had fondness and respect--and a great\nluxury to have the chance to talk for an hour with a group of people who share my love for a part\nof the world we call the West. Most of my day job enmeshes me, of necessity, in either broad\nsystemic questions of global financial stability or the impossibly arcane minutiae of our\nconvoluted and labyrinthine financial regulatory system. Both of those are perfectly worthy\noccupations but inescapably require a relentlessly global outlook. Yet my first intellectual\npassion as a very young man was for the history and life of a specific part of the world--the\nWestern United States, as place and idea. Your own presence here in the audience suggests that\nmany of you have been moved at some point in your life, as I have been, by the words of\nWallace Stegner:\nIf there is such a thing as being conditioned by climate and geography, and I think there\nis, it is the West that has conditioned me. It has the forms and lights and colors that I\nrespond to in nature and in art. If there is a western speech, I speak it; if there is a\nwestern character or personality, I am some variant of it; if there is a western culture in\nthe small-c, anthropological sense, I have not escaped it.1\nSo, that is why I say it is a pleasure and an honor but most especially a luxury for me to\nspeak to an audience that shares my concern for and love of the West on the topic of how the\npreoccupations of my day job--banking and finance--affect this particular part of the world. We\nall know that throughout the history of the West, banking and finance have played an important\nrole as vital infrastructure for the economy. That remains true today, although it is often\noverlooked in the traditional litany of issues critical to the West. A strong banking industry is\nnecessary for households and businesses to engage in the spending, saving, and investment that\nconstitute economic activity, and one of the purposes of financial regulation is to ensure that\n1 Wallace Stegner, “The American West as Living Space,” University of Michigan Press, 1988.\n\n- 2 -\nbanks continue to be able to serve this purpose. So it is my plan today to talk about the economy\nof the West and link the recent and future performance of the western economy to the central and\nsupportive role banks play as vital infrastructure in their communities.\nDefining the West\nLet’s start by defining our terms. What do we mean by the West? Before this audience, I\napproach this question with respect and a little caution, because I know that in a broad sense, it is\nwhat the Center for the American West has been addressing since its founding. That aside, it\nmakes sense to use a definition, as the center often does, that includes parts of states in the\nmiddle of the country whose economies, heavily dependent on natural resources, ranching, and\nfarming, more closely resemble Montana and New Mexico than they do states on the Eastern\nseaboard.\nNevertheless, for the purposes of these remarks, I am going to use a less expansive\ndefinition comprising the 13 westernmost states. I do so partly because this is a common\ndefinition of the West, and because it is the one used by the U.S. Census Bureau in dividing the\ncountry into four regions and this has helped me gather data for this speech more readily. (Figure\n1)\nThe first thing to mention that distinguishes the West from the rest of the country is\napparent on this map--land area. The West is large and would appear even larger of course, if it\nweren’t necessary to shrink the vastness of Alaska to fit on one page. Even using my more\nmodest definition, the West still represents half of the land area of the United States. This is\nimportant in this context because of one theme I will be exploring today, which is the economy\nof the rural West and the banking services available there.\n\n- 3 -\nAs this map should make plain, when we talk about rural America, to a significant extent\nwe are talking about the rural West. Another way to put it is that while the West is half of the\nUnited States geographically, it is only a quarter of its population.2 Eight of the 13 states in our\ndefinition of the West are among the dozen in the nation with the lowest population density.3\nEven after subtracting the large share of unpopulated government-owned land in the West, the\noverwhelming majority of the West is rural.\nYet it is also true that, as most of you know, the West is the most urban region of the\ncountry. Five of the 15 largest metro areas in the United States are located in the West, and 90\npercent of the entire region’s population lives in cities, compared to 81 percent of the country as\na whole. 4,5 Nevada and Utah are among the least densely populated states, but 90 percent or\nmore of their residents live in cities. Like the rest of the country, the West is urbanizing. I will\nreturn to the differences between urban and rural areas, but first, let’s look at the economy of the\nWest.\nThe Economy of the West: From Boom to Boom\nThe West accounts for 25 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, almost exactly the\nshare of the U.S. population in the West. This isn’t entirely a coincidence, because population\nrelates to labor supply, which is one determinant of economic output. I mention this because it is\n2 Source: Federal Reserve Board staff calculations were done using data from the following website: “List of states\nand territories of the United States by population,” Wikipedia, last modified November 18, 2018,\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population.\n3 Source: “List of states and territories of the United States by population density,” Wikipedia, last modified October\n12, 2018,\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population_density.\n4 Source: “List of metropolitan statistical areas,” Wikipedia, last modified November 29, 2018,\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_statistical_areas.\n5 Source: “Urbanization in the United States,” Wikipedia, last modified November 10, 2018,\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization_in_the_United_States.\n\n- 4 -\nalso true that the change in population over time has a bearing on the economic health of\ncommunities and regions, and is part of the story for economic growth in the western United\nStates.\nIn recent years, that story has been a very positive one. The U.S. economy is strong, and\nthe western economy is especially strong. While we don’t have state or regional numbers for\nthis year, from 2015 through 2017, GDP, after adjusting for inflation, grew two to nearly three\ntimes as fast in the West as in the rest of the United States. Since the Great Recession ended in\n2010, real GDP has grown twice as fast in the West as in the Northeast, about 50 percent faster\nthan in the Midwest, and a third faster than in the South.6\nBut there is another distinction to the western economy, one that many in this audience\nknow well, that brings these high-flying results down to earth. While the good times are\ntypically very good in the West, the bad times are usually pretty bad, and that was certainly true\nduring the Great Recession. From 2008 through 2010, the western economy contracted four\ntimes as much as the average for all of the United States. The same is true for per capita\npersonal income, which contracted more sharply in the West than elsewhere, as job losses in the\nwestern region during the recession were worse than elsewhere.\nTaking a longer perspective, however, even with the booms and the busts that have\ncharacterized the West for upwards of 200 years, the West is still the fastest growing region of\nthe United States. Since 2000, real GDP has grown twice as fast in the West as in the Northeast\nand Midwest, and about 30 percent faster than in the South. Since 1988, the numbers are\nroughly the same. Per capita personal income grew faster in the West during good years,\n6 Statistics presented in this paragraph and the next two paragraphs are derived from the following website:\n“Comparative Economic Indicators: Year vs. Year Analysis of Growth and Change,” Regional Economic Analysis\nProject, https://united-states.reaproject.org/analysis/comparative-indicators/year_vs_year/.\n\n- 5 -\noutweighing the sharper losses during the recession and since 2000 has grown about 20 percent\nfaster in the West than in the rest of the country.\nThis picture of the West leading the nation in economic growth is also reflected in\npopulation, a key factor in that growth. From 2010 to 2017, the population of the West increased\n7.4 percent, compared to 5.3 percent for the nation.7 One might guess that this strong growth is\nprimarily in cities, and in fact reflects the drain of population from smaller towns that is reported\nto be happening all over the United States. But in fact, population gains in the West are quite\nwell balanced between cities and towns, and smaller towns are doing better in the West than\nelsewhere in holding and even increasing their populations.\nIn the cities of the West, those communities of 50,000 or more, the population grew 7.8\npercent from 2010 to 2017, eclipsed by the 10 percent growth in southern cities but well above\nthe 2 percent to 3 percent increase in the cities of the Northeast and Midwest.8 At the same time,\nthe West led the other regions of the United States in growth for towns and cities from 10,000 to\n50,000 in size, and likewise for towns between 5,000 and 10,000.\nNow let’s look at small towns, those with 5,000 or fewer residents. It is this cohort of\ntowns and their people that to my mind is really the essence of rural America. There is a\nwidespread impression that small towns all over America are shrinking and that population is\nshifting to larger towns and cities, and that is the story we can see in much of the regional data.\nFrom 2010 to 2017, the average small town shrank by 2 percent in the Northeast, by 1.4 percent\nin the Midwest, and only grew 1.3 percent in the South, while larger towns and cities grew\nsubstantially faster there and elsewhere.\n7 Source: https://www.census.gov/popclock/data_tables.php?component=growth\n8 Statistics presented in this paragraph and the next two paragraphs are derived from the following website: “The\nWest and South Lead the Way,” United States Census Bureau, last modified October 1, 2018,\nhttps://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2018/comm/subcounty-estimates.html.\n\n- 6 -\nWhat about the West, where urbanization is happening more quickly than anywhere else?\nIn fact, the average western small town grew 7.8 percent in those seven years, which is roughly\nthe same healthy pace of growth registered in western towns and cities from the smallest to the\nlargest.\nWith a nod to Mark Twain, the message here is that reports of the death of small towns,\nat least in the West, have been greatly exaggerated. I don’t mean to minimize the challenges\nsmall towns face, because they are considerable, or suggest that western small towns are immune\nto them, because they certainly are not. But the more positive message I come away with here is\nthat a rising tide of prosperity in the West seems to be lifting communities large and small, and\nthat the many instances of small towns in decline that we all hear about are counterbalanced by\nother small towns growing healthily. Another lesson is that population growth and the attendant\neconomic growth in the West is not zero sum, and that small towns can still grow healthily while\nthe metropolises of the West continue to attract people, partly from outside the region. I will\nreturn to the issue of how the economies of the urban and rural West differ, but the backdrop is\nthat population data are promising for both.\nBanking in the West\nNow that I have outlined how the economy of the West relates to that of the rest of the\nUnited States, let me do the same for banking in the West. There is a lot to this topic, but my\nfocus is banking as it is experienced at the retail level by households and small- and medium-\nsized businesses. Again, I use the Census Bureau’s list of 13 states to define the West, and for a\nsimpler comparison, and in honor of Frank Church, I will refer to the other 37 states as “eastern”\neven though they cover several regions. Some of you are old enough to remember Frank\nChurch, the U.S. Senator from Idaho--a Stanford grad and hero of mine when I was a teenager.\n\n- 7 -\nWhen he ran for president in 1976 and had some success in the primaries, he was challenged by\nthe press that said his victories were limited to the West, and he replied “What do you mean I\ncan’t win an eastern state? I won Nebraska!”\nOne dimension to how households and most businesses experience banking is the number\nof banks competing for their services, and one difference between the West and the East is that\nthe West has fewer banks, even if we count them on a per capita basis.9 In addition, banks in the\nWest tend to be larger. One reason for the disparity in the average number and size of banks is\nthat historically, a larger share of western states allowed statewide branching or had relatively\nlimited branching restrictions, leading to the development of fewer and larger banks.10\nIn metropolitan areas of the West, the average number of banks was 23 in 2017,\ncompared to 27 in eastern metro areas. In rural counties of the West, customers had access to an\naverage of 4.6 banks in 2017, compared to 5.4 banks in the East. In both urban and rural areas,\nin both the East and the West, the average number of banks increased in the years leading up to\nthe financial crisis but has been declining since then. While there is certainly more to say about\nbanking services in cities, I want to focus on rural areas for the moment. Over the last 20 years,\nrural westerners have consistently had access to something like 20 percent fewer banks than rural\neasterners, which amounts to about one less bank per rural county. That may not sound like\nmuch, but that one less bank, on average, can make a big difference to the households and small\nbusinesses inhabiting those rural counties.\n9 The source for statistics presented in this paragraph and the next three paragraphs is Federal Reserve Board staff\ncalculations using bank Reports of Condition and Income filed with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination\nCouncil, Thrift Financial Reports filed with the Office of Thrift Supervision, and Summary of Deposits filed with\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n10 Even though state banking restrictions were eliminated in most states decades ago, the differences in the number\nof banks across states have persisted.\n\n- 8 -\nIn any community, access to credit is essential for economic growth. In any community,\nbut especially in rural communities, small businesses are key drivers of growth. Small\nbusinesses heavily rely on banks for funding, and community banks, those with less than $10\nbillion in assets, account for a disproportionate share of bank lending to small businesses.\nBut across the country, the number of community banks has fallen by half over the past\n20 years, mostly due to consolidation. This fall has been slightly larger in the West than the\nEast, but the reason I highlight this trend is that I believe it has significant consequences for rural\ncommunities in the West. The reason returns me to that map I showed earlier. The West is vast,\nand many rural communities in the West must deal with the challenges of isolation from larger\ntowns and cities that few communities in the East face. Rural westerners have access to far\nfewer banks overall than rural easterners, but that understates the disparity when some western\ncounties are the size of Maryland or Massachusetts and many are more than a hundred miles\nacross, so that access to a limited number of banks can be difficult or out of reach.\nTo provide some perspective on this challenge, let me share what westerners in one small\ntown have to say about their access to banking services. This account is culled from a series of\npublic meetings that the Federal Reserve is convening in communities all around the country, in\nsupport of our responsibilities overseeing community banks and promoting community\ndevelopment.\nNot quite a month ago, we held one such session in my home state of Utah, in the town of\nGreen River, population 940, located on the eastern side of the state. It is just off an isolated\nstretch of interstate, and its economy depends on those passersby and tourism related to outdoor\nrecreation. In 2014, Green River lost its only bank, and around that time, banks closed in several\nnearby communities. As a result, most residents of Green River who need banking services must\n\n- 9 -\ndrive the 52 miles to Moab, Utah. This loss has had a profound effect on households and\nbusinesses, essentially turning back the clock in Green River by decades, as far as its access to\nthe banking system. Business owners say their work days have been curtailed by the need to\ndrive two or three times a week to Moab to obtain change and make deposits. Businesses have\nbecome banks for many residents, agreeing to cash their checks. Because of this new service to\nresidents, and the long distance to a real bank, retail businesses say they are carrying much larger\namounts of cash, which has heightened security concerns and prompted some merchants to\ninvest in new safes. Security is also a concern for residents who no longer have access to safety\ndeposit boxes for valuables and important papers.\nFaster and more efficient electronic payments hold some promise to bridge these gaps,\neventually, and the Federal Reserve is working hard on this and making significant progress.\nBut one thing that technology cannot do is replace the knowledge and perspective of a local\nbanker who is part of the community. Relationship-based lending that is the hallmark of\ncommunity banking can stem losses during downturns, since community banks may be able to\nwork with borrowers to avoid losses. Research has shown that small business lending at smaller\nbanks declined less severely than at large banks during the last recession.\nCommunity banks face considerable competition. One of the reasons that community\nbanks continue to succeed in many places is their understanding of their customers’ needs and\nopportunities to invest in families and businesses. The loss of this relationship, for a community,\nmeans that needs will go unmet, and opportunities will be lost.\nIn some communities, of course, this may be unavoidable, if a town has lost a major\nemployer and has no new industry or plan to replace the jobs lost. But let me remind you of the\nvery encouraging data I cited on the growth of small towns in the West. Overall, rural\n\n- 10 -\ncommunities are growing at a healthy pace, and growing communities need banks. It is my hope\nthat the opportunity for the future that this population growth suggests will support the local\nbanks that communities need to thrive.\nA significant part of the Federal Reserve’s recent regulatory focus has been aimed at\nstreamlining regulations and reducing the regulatory burden on smaller and regional banks.\nThe Fed, along with the other banking agencies, recently proposed a community bank\nleverage ratio that is designed to simplify significantly the standards banks must abide by for\nholding capital.11 As a result, qualifying community banks will only need to calculate and meet\na single measure of capital adequacy, rather than multiple measures. We have also proposed a\nreduction in the burden of reporting requirements for community banks, and expect soon to\npropose an exemption for community banks to the Volcker rule.12 For a subset of the smallest\nbanks--those with less than $5 billion in total assets--we have also lengthened the amount of time\nbetween supervisory examinations and expanded eligibility of small bank holding companies\nthat qualify for an exemption to the Federal Reserve’s capital rules, a policy that was designed to\npromote local ownership of small banks and to help maintain banks in rural areas.13\nMost recently, the Federal Reserve spearheaded a proposal to tailor regulation that\napplies to firms that are larger than community banks, but the potential failure of which generally\n11 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Agencies propose community bank leverage ratio for\nqualifying community banking organizations,” news releases, November 21, 2018.\n12 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Agencies issue proposal to streamline regulatory\nreporting for qualifying small institutions,” news release, November 7, 2018.\n13 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Agencies issue interim final rules expanding\nexamination cycle for qualifying small banks and U.S. branches of foreign banks,” news release, August 23, 2018\nand Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board issues interim final rule expanding\nthe applicability of the Board’s small bank holding company policy statement,” news release, August 28, 2018. Of\ncourse, while the holding companies of community banks may be eligible for an exemption from capital rules, the\nsubsidiary banks are still subject to capital requirements.\n\n- 11 -\ndoes not pose risks to the financial system.14 These are firms with between $100 billion and\n$250 billion in total assets. Those changes are designed to reduce unnecessary regulatory\nburdens on specific institutions without any loss of resiliency for the financial system.\nBy these steps, I believe the Federal Reserve is helping community banks remain\ncompetitive and play the central role they have long played as vital infrastructure for rural\ncommunities. The future of community banks in these communities is one reason that I’m\noptimistic about the economic prospects of small towns in the West, which continue to grow\neven as the region and the nation overall becomes more urban. That’s a good thing, because\nsmall towns, and especially their values, have long helped define the West, and I hope will\ncontinue to do so.\n14 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board invites public comment on\nframework that would more closely match regulations for large banking organizations with their risk profiles,” news\nrelease, October 31, 2018.\n\nBanks as Vital Infrastructure\nFor Rural Communities of the West\nRandall K.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:45 p.m. EDT\nMay 30, 2019\nMonetary Policy and Financial Stability\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Developments in Empirical Macroeconomics,” a research conference sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 30, 2019\n\nThank you for the opportunity to take part in today’s “Developments in Empirical\nMacroeconomics” conference. I would like to use my time here to talk about a topic of\ninterest to many central bankers and macroeconomists: the interaction of monetary\npolicy and financial stability. As you well know, monetary policy has powerful effects\non financial markets, the financial system, and the broader economy. Conversely,\nfinancial instability, by impairing the provision of credit and other financial services, can\ndepress economic growth, cause job losses, and push inflation too low. Accordingly,\nfinancial stability, through its effects on the Federal Reserve’s dual-mandate goals of\nmaximum employment and stable prices, must be a consideration in the setting of\nmonetary policy.\nAgainst this backdrop, a natural—yet quite complex—question is whether\nmonetary policy should be used to promote financial stability. This question is hotly\ndebated in a large and growing academic literature, and any serious answer has to be\nsubject to considerable nuance. At the same time, my sense is that the balance is clearly\ntilted toward the conclusion that macroprudential policies—through-the-cycle resilience,\nstress tests, and the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB)—may be better targeted to\npromoting financial stability than monetary policy.1\nBefore I wade into the lessons from past research and experience, I would like to\nhighlight that this question is not just academic. As you know, the economy, monetary\npolicy, and financial stability are intertwined. For example, the past three recessions\nwere preceded by some combination of elevated asset prices, rapid increases in\nborrowing by businesses and households, and excessive risk-taking in the financial\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nsector. These financial vulnerabilities have amplified adverse shocks to the overall\neconomy time and again. Such concerns have resurfaced among some observers, as the\ncurrent long expansion has brought business borrowing to new heights. My own\nassessment is that even though business debt is elevated, at least by some measures,\noverall financial stability risks are not, as the financial sector has substantial loss-\nabsorbing capacity and is not overly reliant on unstable short-term funding. Yet, even if\nthe risk of financial system disruption does not seem high, it well remain true that if the\neconomy weakens, some businesses may default on this debt, potentially leading to a\ncontraction in investment, a slow-down in hiring, and possibly to an unusual tightening in\nfinancial conditions. These concerns highlight how cyclical factors influencing monetary\npolicy borrowers may overlap with financial stability considerations.\nHow Monetary Policy Can Influence Financial Stability\nLet me begin by laying out how monetary policy can influence financial stability.\nMonetary policy, operating primarily through adjustments in the level of short-term\ninterest rates, has powerful effects on the entire financial system. A more\naccommodative monetary policy lowers interest rates across the maturity spectrum. The\ntextbook result is that mortgage rates and corporate borrowing rates, among others,\ndecline; equity prices rise; and the dollar exchange rate depreciates. In other words,\nfinancial conditions broadly ease, spurring households to buy more and businesses to\ninvest and hire, thereby supporting economic growth and price stability.2\nMonetary policy, however, if too accommodative, may lead to a buildup of\nfinancial vulnerabilities. These incentives arrive through a number of channels. For\n2 For reviews of the various monetary policy transmission channels to the real economy, see Bernanke and\nGertler (1995) and Boivin, Kiley, and Mishkin (2010).\n\n- 3 -\ninstance, low interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing, and so may prompt businesses\nand households to overborrow. Low rates may lead to a speculative bubble by\ncompressing risk premiums for assets—such as equity, corporate bonds, and housing—\nand potentially leading investors to extrapolate price gains into the future in a bout of\nirrational exuberance. Low rates may also squeeze the profitability of financial\nintermediaries through narrow interest margins and other factors. In turn, these\nintermediaries as well as investors that had promised fixed nominal rates of return—such\nas insurance companies and pension funds—may “reach for yield,” or take on more credit\nor duration risk in their portfolios in order to maintain high returns. Taken to extremes,\nthis story often does not end well. Periods of excessive leverage, rapid credit growth, or\nbuoyant credit market sentiment increase the risk to economic growth.3\nThese dynamics point to the possibility that accommodative monetary policy,\nwhile necessary to support activity during the early stages of an economic expansion,\nmay also increase vulnerabilities in the financial system, especially if maintained for too\nlong. These vulnerabilities weaken the financial system’s ability to absorb negative\nshocks, and so when a shock arrives, losses mount, the financial system weakens, lending\nslows, and economic activity slows by more than it would have otherwise, potentially\nleading to an economic downturn or a more severe recession.\nShould Financial Vulnerabilities Affect the Stance of Monetary Policy?\nThese observations lead to the important question of whether and how financial\nvulnerabilities should affect the setting of monetary policy. One simple framework for\nevaluating the tradeoffs associated with actively setting monetary policy to lean against\n3 See, among others, Schularick and Taylor (2012); López-Salido, Stein, and Zakrajsek (2017); Mian, Sufi,\nand Verner (2017); Adrian, Boyarchenko, Giannone (2019); and Kiley (2018).\n\n- 4 -\nthe buildup of financial vulnerabilities is to examine the costs and benefits of such a\npolicy in terms of unemployment and inflation. In this approach, the costs of tightening\nmonetary policy in response to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities are lower\nemployment and potentially below target inflation in the near term. The benefits are\npossibly reducing the risk of a future financial crisis, an event likely associated with a\nmuch larger fall in employment and inflation.\nOne view is that monetary policy curbs household and business borrowing only\nmodestly but can boost the unemployment rate notably. And so using monetary policy to\ndamp borrowing does more harm than good. According to this view, using monetary\npolicy to lean against financial vulnerabilities does not generate significant net benefits\nand may be counterproductive—increasing unemployment and decreasing inflation\nbelow a desired level with little reduction in risks to financial stability.4\nAt the same time, some research has identified circumstances under which the\nbenefits of using monetary policy to lean against financial vulnerabilities could outweigh\nthe costs. 5 A key consideration is the estimated amount of economic activity lost in a\nfinancial crisis—and some research suggests such losses may be quite large, which raises\nthe benefits of leaning against imbalances. Similarly, monetary policy may affect a broad\nrange of financial imbalances—excessively high house or equity prices and leverage\nwithin the financial sector—and the full set of these effects could shift the risk of\nfinancial instability sufficiently, at least under some circumstances, to make leaning\nagainst financial vulnerabilities with monetary policy desirable. The broader point is that\n4 See, for instance, Svensson (2014, 2017).\n5 See, for example, Ajello, Laubach, López-Salido, and Nakata (2018); Guorio, Sim, and Kashyap (2018);\nand Adrian and Liang (2018).\n\n- 5 -\nwe do not fully understand the cost–benefit tradeoff and whether monetary policy\nadjustments for financial stability reasons may be appropriate at some times.\nWhither Macroprudential Policy?\nOf course, there is one additional and critical factor to consider when weighing\nadjustments to the stance of monetary policy for financial stability reasons: the\navailability and efficacy of other instruments to promote financial stability. After all, the\npursuit of multiple goals—full employment, price stability, and financial stability, for\nexample—likely requires multiple tools. This is just common sense. Economists have a\nname for this common-sense notion: the Tinbergen principle.\nEffective supervisory, regulatory, and macroprudential policy tools appear to be\nwell placed to address financial vulnerabilities. In particular, these tools may be used to\nincrease the resilience of the financial sector against a broad range of adverse shocks and,\nperhaps, lean against the buildup of specific financial vulnerabilities. At the Federal\nReserve, we have emphasized a set of structural, or through-the-cycle, regulatory and\nsupervisory policies as our primary macroprudential tools to promote financial stability.\nThese measures include strong capital and liquidity requirements for banks, especially the\nlargest and most systemic institutions. In addition, our supervisory stress tests evaluate\nthe ability of large banks to weather severe economic stress and the failure of their largest\ncounterparty as well as examining the risk-management practices of the firms. Moreover,\nthe stress-test scenarios are designed to generally be more severe during buoyant\neconomic periods when vulnerabilities may build. Furthermore, our stress tests consider\nthe potential effects of specific risks we have identified in our financial stability\nmonitoring work. For example, the tests in recent years have included hypothetical\n\n- 6 -\nsevere strains in corporate debt markets, exploring the resilience of the participating\nbanks to the risks associated with the increase in business borrowing.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve monitors a wide range of indicators for signs of\npotential risks to financial stability that may merit a policy response, and we now publish\na summary of this monitoring in our semiannual Financial Stability Report. If\nvulnerabilities are identified as being meaningfully above normal, the Federal Reserve\ncan require large banks to increase their loss-absorbing capacity through increases in the\nCCyB.6\nDespite all of these efforts, we understand that these tools have limitations. First,\ncentral bankers’ experience with macroprudential tools, including the CCyB, is limited.\nSecond, regulation and macropudential tools can reduce economic efficiency and hamper\neconomic growth by limiting the ability of the market to allocate financial resources. For\nthis reason, the Federal Reserve has been evaluating ways in which our supervisory and\nfinancial stability goals can be achieved more efficiently, and it has been participating in\nglobal efforts to evaluate the effects of reforms under the auspices of the Financial\nStability Board. Third, macroprudential policies that are targeted to banks may create an\nincentive for financial intermediation to migrate outside of the regulated banking system.\nThe vulnerabilities may still emerge, albeit elsewhere in the financial system—perhaps in\ninstitutions or structures that are less stable and resilient than our banks. In part reflecting\n6 CCyB also builds financial-sector resilience during periods when financial vulnerabilities are high and\nthere is a risk of potential losses within the banking sector that could strain the supply of credit.\nFurthermore, the CCyB might be a more effective tool than monetary policy to mitigate financial\nvulnerabilities, as the benefits are comparable to those of using monetary policy while the costs are an\norder of magnitude smaller.\n\n- 7 -\nthese incentives, we regularly monitor financial intermediation both inside and outside of\nthe banking system.\nSummary\nTo sum up, while there is evidence that financial vulnerabilities have the potential\nto translate into macroeconomic risks, a general consensus has emerged that monetary\npolicy should be guided primarily by the outlook for unemployment and inflation and not\nby the state of financial vulnerabilities. Financial system resilience, supported by strong\nthrough-the-cycle regulatory and supervisory policies, remains a key defense against\nfinancial system and macroeconomic shocks.\nThere is a clear need for new theory and empirics to address the questions about\nmonetary policy and financial stability I have posed today. I encourage you to continue\nto contribute to these answers. By engaging the help of the wider academic community,\nconferences such as this one provide an invaluable opportunity to make progress on\nissues of great importance for economic policy.\n\n- 8 -\nReferences\nAdrian, Tobias, Nina Boyarchenko, and Domenico Giannone (2019). “Vulnerable\nGrowth,” American Economic Review, vol. 109 (April), pp. 1263–89.\nAdrian, Tobias, and Nellie Liang (2018). “Monetary Policy, Financial Conditions, and\nFinancial Stability,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 14 (January),\npp. 73–131.\nAjello, Andrea, Thomas Laubach, David López-Salido, and Taisuke Nakata (2019).\n“Financial Stability and Optimal Interest Rate Policy,” International Journal of\nCentral Banking, vol. 15 (March), pp. 279–326.\nBernanke, Ben S., and Mark Gertler (1995). “Inside the Black Box: The Credit Channel\nof Monetary Policy Transmission,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 9\n(Fall), pp. 27–48.\nBoivin, Jean, Michael T.

Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nAmerican Bar Association Banking Law Committee Annual Meeting\nThe Ritz-Carlton\nWashington, D.C.\nJanuary 19, 2018\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here with you at the American Bar Association banking law\ncommittee annual meeting.1 Thank you to Meg Tahyar, my longtime friend and colleague, for\ninviting me to speak today. These are still the early days of my tenure at the Federal\nReserve--last weekend marked my first three months as the first Vice Chairman for\nSupervision. In those three months, people have had a lot of questions for me, but the most\nfrequently asked question has been: What’s next? Today I hope to give you some insights into\nhow I am approaching the work of evaluating and improving the post-crisis regulatory regime\nand to outline some specific areas that are emerging as areas of focus early in my tenure. Some\nof those areas are closer to being ready for action, while others are topics that I believe are\nimportant and would benefit from more attention and discussion. My hope is that you will come\naway from our time together with a better sense of my preliminary thinking for charting a course\nforward on financial regulation.\nEfficiency, Transparency, and Simplicity of Regulation\nBefore I delve into specifics, let me say a few words about the principles that are guiding\nmy approach to evaluating changes to the current regime. The body of post-crisis financial\nregulation is broad in scope, complicated in detail, and extraordinarily ambitious in its\nobjectives. Core aspects of that project have resulted in critical gains to our financial system:\nhigher and better quality capital, an innovative stress testing regime, new liquidity regulation,\nand improvements in the resolvability of large firms. We undoubtedly have a stronger and more\nresilient financial system due in significant part to the gains from those core reforms. These\nachievements are consistent with the responsibility of the Federal Reserve to be a steward of a\n1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\n\n- 2 -\nsafe financial system, and with the goal of maintaining the ability of banks to lend through the\nbusiness cycle.\nThat said, the Federal Reserve and our colleagues at other agencies have now spent the\nbetter part of the past decade building out and standing up the post-crisis regulatory regime. At\nthis point, we have completed the bulk of the work of post-crisis regulation, with an important\nexception being the U.S. implementation of the recently concluded Basel III “end game”\nagreement on bank capital standards at the Basel Committee. As such, now is an eminently\nnatural and expected time to step back and assess those efforts. It is our responsibility to ensure\nthat they are working as intended and--given the breadth and complexity of this new body of\nregulation--it is inevitable that we will be able to improve them, especially with the benefit of\nexperience and hindsight.\nIn undertaking this review and assessment, in addition to ensuring that we are satisfied\nwith the effectiveness of these regulations, I believe that we have an opportunity to improve the\nefficiency, transparency, and simplicity of regulation. By efficiency I mean the degree to which\nthe net cost of regulation--whether in reduced economic growth or in increased frictions in the\nfinancial system--is outweighed by the benefits of the regulation. In other words, if we have a\nchoice between two methods of equal effectiveness in achieving a goal, we should strive to\nchoose the one that is less burdensome for both the system and regulators.\nEfficiency of regulation can be improved through a variety of means. For example, it can\nmean achieving a given regulation’s objective using fewer tools. It can mean addressing\nunintended adverse consequences to the industry and the broader public from a regulation or\neliminating perverse incentives created by a regulation. It can mean calibrating a given\nregulation more precisely to the risks in need of mitigation. It can also mean simpler\n\n- 3 -\nexamination procedures for bank supervisors, or less intrusive examinations for well managed\nfirms. In our approach to assessing post-crisis regulation, we should consider all of these ways\nof improving efficiency.\nTransparency is an objective that ought to particularly resonate with this audience. As\nlawyers, we were all trained to view transparency as a necessary precondition to the core\ndemocratic ideal of government accountability--the governed have a right to know the rules\nimposed on them by the government. In addition, as any good lawyer also recognizes, there are\nvaluable, practical benefits to transparency around rulemaking; even good ideas can improve as a\nresult of exposure to a variety of perspectives.\nFinally, simplicity of regulation is a principle that promotes public understanding of\nregulation, promotes meaningful compliance by the industry with regulation, and reduces\nunexpected negative synergies among regulations. Confusion that results from overly complex\nregulation does not advance the goal of a safe system.\nCommon Ground Areas of Improvement\nWhen I arrived at the Federal Reserve, the early stages of reflection on how to improve\nthe cost-benefit balance of post-crisis regulation had already begun, mainly in a few narrow areas\nof focus. These were areas of low-hanging fruit in which relatively broad consensus was reached\nthat efficiency enhancements were available with no material cost to the resiliency or\nresolvability of the banking system. My colleague and Chairman-nominee Jay Powell spoke\nabout five of these areas last summer when he served as the Board’s oversight governor for\nsupervision and regulation: small bank capital simplification, burden reduction in resolution\nplanning, enhancements to stress testing, leverage ratio recalibration, and Volcker rule\n\n- 4 -\nsimplification.2 I wholeheartedly support these initiatives, and I am pleased that some of them\nhave progressed even in the months since the summer.\nThe banking agencies recently proposed changes to the capital rules for smaller firms,\nconsistent with last year’s Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act report,\nwhich is a positive step toward meaningful burden relief for smaller banks.3 The Federal\nReserve, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, extended the upcoming\nresolution planning cycles for the eight most systemic domestic banking firms and for foreign\nbanks with limited U.S. operations in order to allow for more time between submissions.4 I\nbelieve we should continue to improve the resolution planning process in light of the substantial\nprogress made by firms over the past few years, including a permanent extension of submission\ncycles from annual to once every two years and reduced burden for banking firms with less\nsignificant systemic footprints. And, most recently, the Federal Reserve released a package of\nproposed enhancements to the transparency of our stress testing program, which is currently out\nfor comment.5 The progress you have seen in those areas represents constructive early steps.\nLeverage ratio recalibration also is among the Federal Reserve’s highest-priority, near-\nterm initiatives. We have made considerable progress on that front in the past few months, and I\nexpect that you will see a proposal on this topic relatively soon. Finally, the relevant agencies\nhave begun work on a proposal to streamline the Volcker rule. This project is a quite\n2 Jerome H.

As such, it will\nnaturally take a bit of work for the agencies to congeal around a thoughtful Volcker rule 2.0\nproposal for public review. Volcker rule reform remains a priority in the Federal Reserve’s\nregulatory efforts.\nEmerging Areas for Review\nWith that update on the familiar, I will turn to my own impressions of what is next for\npost-crisis regulation. In my early days as the Vice Chairman for Supervision, I asked our staff\nto conduct a comprehensive review of the regulations in the core areas of reform that I outlined\nearlier--capital, stress testing, liquidity, and resolution. The objective is to consider the effect of\nthose regulatory frameworks on resiliency and resolvability of the financial system, on credit\navailability and economic growth, and more broadly to evaluate their costs and benefits. This is\na comprehensive and serious process, and work is still underway. I should note, however, that I\nhave already formed views on a few areas that warrant more focus, and that I will be working\nwith my colleagues on the Board to constructively consider.\nI will start with the issue of tailoring supervision and regulation to the size, systemic\nfootprint, risk profile, and business model of banking firms. The Federal Reserve has devoted\nconsiderable energy in its post-crisis regulatory work to incorporate the tailoring concept in its\nregulation and supervision across the spectrum of small, medium, and large firms. A recent\nexample of this approach is our late 2017 proposal to simplify capital requirements for small-\nand medium-sized banking firms. In my view, there is further work for the Federal Reserve and\nthe other banking agencies to do on the tailoring front.\nI would emphasize that tailoring is not an objective limited in scope to a subset of the\nsmallest firms. As my colleagues and I have said before, the character of our regulation should\n\n- 6 -\nmatch the character of the risk at the institution. Accordingly, we should also be looking at\nadditional opportunities for more tailoring for larger, non-Global Systemically Important Banks,\nor non-G-SIBs. In this regard, I support congressional efforts regarding tailoring, whether by\nraising the current $50 billion statutory threshold for application of enhanced prudential\nstandards or by articulating a so-called factors-based threshold. Irrespective of where the\nlegislative efforts land, I believe we at the Federal Reserve have the responsibility to ensure that\nwe do further tailoring for the institutions that remain subject to our rules to ensure that\nregulation matches the risk of the firm.\nTake for example large non-G-SIBs whose failure would not individually pose a risk to\nU.S. financial stability. Even without financial stability implications, the distress or failure of\nthese firms still could harm the U.S. economy by, for example, significantly disrupting the flow\nof credit to households and businesses. In my view, this tranche of the U.S. banking system\nought to be subject to regulations that are generally stricter than those that apply to small banking\nfirms, but that are also meaningfully less strict than those that apply to the G-SIBs. The Board\nhas effected this sort of G-SIB versus non-G-SIB tailoring among large banks in many areas of\nthe regulatory framework. Most notably, each of the risk-based capital requirements, leverage\nrequirements, stress testing requirements, and total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements\nis calibrated substantially more strictly for G-SIBs than for large non-G-SIBs. However, in some\nkey regulations, there is no distinction between the requirements for large non-G-SIBs and G-\nSIBs.\nLiquidity regulation, for example, does not have a G-SIB versus non-G-SIB gradation. In\nparticular, the full liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement and internal stress testing\nrequirements of enhanced prudential standards apply to large, non-G-SIB banks in the same way\n\n- 7 -\nthat they apply to G-SIB banks. I believe it is time to take concrete steps toward calibrating\nliquidity requirements differently for large, non-G-SIBs than for G-SIBs. And I see prospects for\nfurther liquidity tailoring in that the content and frequency of LCR reporting are the same for the\nrange of firms currently subject to the modified LCR as they are for the large non-G-SIBs that\nare subject to the full LCR. We should also explore opportunities to apply additional tailoring\nfor these firms in other areas, such as single counterparty credit limits and resolution planning\nrequirements.\nAnother area that I think we should revisit are the “advanced approaches” thresholds that\nidentify internationally active banks. These thresholds are significant not only for identifying\nwhich banking firms are subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital requirements, but\nalso for identifying which firms are subject to various other Basel Committee standards, such as\nthe supplementary leverage ratio, the countercyclical capital buffer, and the LCR. The metrics\nused to identify internationally active firms--$250 billion in total assets or $10 billion in on-\nbalance-sheet foreign exposures--were formulated well over a decade ago, were the result of a\ndefensible but not ineluctable analysis, and have not been refined since then. We should explore\nways to bring these criteria into better alignment with our objectives.\nA third area in which I will be working with my Board colleagues is a meaningful\nsimplification of our framework of loss absorbency requirements. There are different ways to\ncount the number of loss absorbency constraints that our large banking firms face--which is\nperhaps in itself an indication of a surfeit of complexity if we can’t be perfectly sure of how to\ncount them--but the number I come up with is 24 total requirements in the framework. While I\ndo not know precisely the socially optimal number of loss absorbency requirements for large\nbanking firms, I am reasonably certain that 24 is too many. Candidates for simplification\n\n- 8 -\ninclude: elimination of the advanced approaches risk-based capital requirements; one or more\nratios in stress testing; and some simplification of our TLAC rule. I am not the first Federal\nReserve governor to mention some of these possibilities, and we should put them back on the\ntable in the context of a more holistic discussion of streamlining these requirements. Let me be\nclear, however, that while I am advocating a simplification of large bank loss absorbency\nrequirements, I am not advocating an enervation of the regulatory capital regime applicable to\nlarge banking firms.\nAlthough not a post-crisis regulation, the Board’s complex and occasionally opaque\nframework for making determinations of control under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHC\nAct) is another area that is ripe for re-examination through the lenses of efficiency, transparency,\nand simplicity. As you know, a determination of control under the BHC Act is significant\nbecause even remote entities in a controlled group can be subject to the BHC Act’s restrictions\non activities and a host of other regulatory requirements. Under the Board’s control framework--\nbuilt up piecemeal over many decades--the practical determinants of when one company is\ndeemed to control another are now quite a bit more ornate than the basic standards set forth in\nthe statute and in some cases cannot be discovered except through supplication to someone who\nhas spent a long apprenticeship in the art of Fed interpretation. The process can be burdensome\nand time-consuming both for the requester and Federal Reserve staff. We are taking a serious\nlook at rationalizing and recalibrating this framework.\nFinally, as I mentioned earlier, an enhanced stress testing transparency package was\nreleased for public comment last month. I personally believe that our stress testing disclosures\ncan go further. I appreciate the risks to the financial system of the industry converging on the\nFederal Reserve’s stress testing model too completely, so I am hesitant to support complete\n\n- 9 -\ndisclosure of our models for that reason. However, I believe that the disclosure we have\nprovided does not go far enough to provide visibility into the supervisory models that often\ndeliver a firm’s binding capital constraint. It is important in any proposal to receive comments,\nand I can say that I and my colleagues on the Board will be paying particularly close attention to\nyour comments on how we might improve this current proposal.\nConcluding Remarks\nTo conclude, I hope that these remarks give you a sense of our approach to analyzing and\nimproving post-crisis regulation. As I mentioned earlier, the areas of core reform--capital,\nliquidity, stress testing, and resolution--have produced a stronger and more resilient system and\nshould be preserved. We have made great progress, but there is further work to do. Some clear\nimprovements are in the offing in the relatively near future. Other areas will benefit from longer\nterm discussion. I look forward to engaging with you and the public more broadly as I help to\nchart a course for the important work ahead.",

Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Community Banking in the 21st Century”\nSixth Annual Community Banking Research and Policy Conference, sponsored by\nthe Federal Reserve System, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors,\nand the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nOctober 4, 2018\n\nGood morning. I want to thank the conference organizers for inviting me to speak\nto you today.1 It is an honor and a pleasure to be part of this unique annual event that\nbrings together bankers, bank supervisors, and researchers to discuss the latest\ncommunity banking research, recent trends in community banking practices, and policy\nissues that are on the minds of conference attendees.\nI want to start, first, by conveying my own perspective on the importance of\ncommunity banks. Community banks have a long history of providing essential financial\nservices to households, small businesses, and small farms in communities across the\nUnited States. Their ability to effectively provide these services speaks to the strength of\nthe community banking business model--that is, establishing and maintaining local\nrelationships, and offering customers a face-to-face interaction with a local banker.\nAnd it is something I have observed firsthand, especially for community banks in\nrural communities. Growing up in rural Colorado and Utah, I saw the importance of\ncommunity bankers having local knowledge and being personally invested in the same\ncommunities that they serve. That local knowledge, and the relationship-based lending\nthat is the hallmark of community banking, can stem losses during downturns, as\ncommunity banks may be able to work with borrowers to avoid losses. Indeed, research\nhas shown that small business lending at small banks declined less severely than at large\nbanks during the last recession.2 At the same time, I have seen the challenges that many\n1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System.\n2 While small banks reduced small business lending by roughly 13 percent between 2009 and 2011, large\nbanks reduced lending by nearly 30 percent. See Rebel A. Cole (2012), How Did the Financial Crisis\nAffect Small Business Lending in the United States? report developed under contract with the U.S. Small\nBusiness Administration, Office of Advocacy (Washington: SBA, November), available at\nhttps://www.sba.gov/advocacy/how-did-financial-crisis-affect-small-business-lending-united-states.\n\n- 2 -\ncommunity banks face. I want to be careful not to overstate those challenges--to\nparaphrase Mark Twain, the reports of your demise are greatly exaggerated--and I believe\nthat the community bank model has many advantages and will continue to play an\nintegral role in our financial system.\nThese sorts of dynamics are one reason that community banks are an important\ntopic for research. As you probably know, this is the sixth annual community banking\nconference cosponsored by the Federal Reserve and the Conference of State Bank\nSupervisors (CSBS), and it is the first conference for which the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation is joining as a cosponsor. The organizers of the inaugural\nconference decided that, rather than holding a traditional academic-style conference, they\nwould invite bankers and bank supervisors to hear what the researchers had to say and to\nshare their real-world experience with the researchers. The hope was that these\ninteractions would prove beneficial to all three groups. The positive feedback that we\nhave received from conference attendees over the past five years strongly supports the\nwisdom of the organizers’ decision.\nOver time, the conference has evolved, with some new features introduced each\nyear. The Case Study Competition, which is sponsored by the CSBS, introduces\nundergraduates to community banking and some of the challenges that community\nbankers face. The Emerging Scholars Program was also added to the conference a few\nyears ago. This program is intended to support Ph.D. students who are considering or\nworking on a dissertation on a banking-related topic and encourage them to develop a\nresearch agenda that focuses on community banking issues. I would like to congratulate\n\n- 3 -\nthis year’s winning case study team, Eastern Kentucky University, and emerging\nscholars, Jiayi Xu, Cao Fang, and Flora Ma.\nNot All Community Banks Are the Same\nTurning to the topic of today’s speech, it occurs to me that we often speak of\ncommunity banks as though they are all pretty much the same. But, in reality, there is\nconsiderable heterogeneity within the group of firms that are commonly considered to be\ncommunity banks.3 One important dimension of diversity is size, which can range\nanywhere from less than $100 million in assets to around $10 billion in assets. As noted\nby Chairman Powell when he spoke at this conference two years ago, looking at\ncommunity banks as a monolithic group masks some important differences between the\nsmallest and largest community banking organizations.4 For example, essentially all of\nthe decline in the number of community banking organizations over the past two decades\nhas taken place among those with assets less than $100 million. And these smallest\nbanking organizations have consistently had a lower average rate of return on assets than\ntheir larger peers.\n3 For the purpose of my remarks today, “community bank” means a bank or thrift with less than $10 billion\nin assets (in constant 2005 dollars). I exclude from this definition any bank or thrift that has less than\n$10 billion in assets but is part of a larger organization with more than $10 billion in total banking assets.\n“Urban community bank” is one that derives more than half of its deposits from offices located in one or\nmore metropolitan statistical areas, and “rural community bank” derives at least half of its deposits from\nnonmetro areas. Using the more nuanced Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) definition of a\ncommunity bank, which takes into account both size and activities, would have very little effect on the\ntrends that I will be discussing. The FDIC definition can be found in Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (2012), “Defining the Community Bank,” in FDIC Community Banking Study (Washington:\nFDIC, December), https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/cbi/report/CBSI-1.pdf.\n4 See Jerome H. Powell (2016), “Trends in Community Bank Performance over the Past 20 Years,” speech\ndelivered at “Community Banking in the 21st Century,” Fourth Annual Community Banking Research and\nPolicy Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank\nSupervisors, St. Louis, Mo., September 29,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20160929a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nAnother significant aspect of diversity among community banks is the type of\nmarket served--urban versus rural. These two types of areas differ in many respects,\nincluding the age distribution of the population, the share of the population with a college\ndegree, homeownership rates, poverty rates, and the share of the population with internet\naccess.5 And while the national population has been growing over the past 20 to\n30 years, many rural areas have experienced population declines, and the share of the\npopulation living in rural areas has been falling.6 Furthermore, since 2008, most job\ngrowth in the United States has occurred in urban areas.7\nGiven these differing circumstances, it is not surprising that community banks\noperating in rural and urban areas tend to face different challenges. For example, the\nnumber of competitors faced by a banking organization tends to be larger in urban\nbanking markets than in rural markets, while hiring and retaining high-quality employees\ncan be more difficult in rural areas. And some observers have expressed concern about\nthe implications of bank consolidation over the past two or three decades for access to\nbanking services in rural areas while also wondering about the future viability of rural\ncommunity banks.\n5 See U.S. Census Bureau (2016), “New Census Data Show Differences between Urban and Rural\nPopulations,” press release, December 8, https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-\n210.html.\n6 See Kim Parker, Juliana Menasce Horowitz, Anna Brown, Richard Fry, D’Vera Cohn, and Ruth Igielnik\n(2018), “Demographic and Economic Trends in Urban, Suburban and Rural Communities,” in What Unites\nand Divides Urban, Suburban and Rural Communities (Washington: Pew Research Center, May),\nhttp://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/05/22/demographic-and-economic-trends-in-urban-suburban-and-\nrural-communities; or John M.

The decline has been roughly similar for urban and rural community banks,\nleaving the share of community banks that operate primarily in rural markets quite stable\nat just over 50 percent. While urban community banks are quite a bit larger than rural\ncommunity banks on average, over the last 20 years, rural community banks have\nconsistently earned higher rates of return on assets and rates of return on equity than their\nurban peers despite a more challenging economic environment.\nWhile the data present a compelling high-level picture, they do not tell the whole\nstory. For example, averages across a large number of markets do not tell us what is\ngoing on in any individual market. In addition, much of the data that I am presenting\ntoday is aggregated to the county level, which obscures community-level dynamics:\nSome communities within a county may have lost banks or bank branches, while others\nmay have gained. In the rural Mountain West, where I grew up, a single county can be\nphysically larger than some Eastern states. And the demographics of the communities--\nfor example, high- or low-income--that have lost or gained are also not visible, but\nimportant. Federal Reserve staff are engaged in efforts to further our understanding of\nthe effects of losses of banks or bank branches on the people who live and work in the\naffected communities.\nNational Trends in Urban versus Rural Community Banks over the Past 20 Years\nThe number of banks in the United States fell by almost half over the past\n20 years--from about 10,700 in 1997 to about 5,600 in 2017. About 97 percent of the\ndecrease was accounted for by community banks. Looking at the trend in the number of\n\n- 6 -\nurban and rural community banks (figure 1), we see that the number of banks in both of\nthese categories has been falling over time. The rate of decline was steeper for rural\nbanks than for urban banks before the financial crisis but has reversed in the post-crisis\nperiod. This reversal may be due to the fact that, as we will see momentarily, urban\ncommunity banks suffered more severe losses in the immediate post-crisis period than\ndid rural community banks. And the share of community banks that operate primarily in\nrural markets has increased slightly, from 53 percent to 54 percent.\nWhile there are more rural community banks than urban community banks, the\nlatter consistently account for a larger volume of deposits, loans, and offices than the\nformer. This difference is due, in part, to the average size of an urban community bank,\nin terms of total assets, being about two and a half to three and a half times that of the\naverage rural community bank (figure 2). As community banks have increased in asset\nsize, they have also grown their branch networks. The average number of branches for\nan urban bank is about 1.7 to 2 times that of a rural bank (figure 3).\nLooking next at the total amount of deposits held by all urban community banks\nand all rural community banks, we can see that both have been trending upward over time\n(figure 4). Growth in total loans outstanding was strong for both urban and rural\ncommunity banks between 1997 and 2008 (figure 5). Declines in lending between 2008\nand 2011 were more severe for urban community banks than rural ones. Coming out of\nthe recent recessions, rural community banks have seen quite modest loan growth since\n2011, while the pace of growth in urban community bank lending has been strong since\n2013. This divergence in recent growth rates may be due to the fact that the recovery\n\n- 7 -\nfrom the recent recession has been much more robust in urban areas than in rural areas of\nthe country.\nWhen it comes to performance measures, rural community banks consistently\noutperform urban community banks with regard to return on assets (figure 6) and return\non equity (figure 7). This difference was particularly pronounced during the financial\ncrisis, when profitability fell much more sharply at urban community banks than at rural\ncommunity banks. Looking at charge-off rates (figure 8), we see that they have been\nquite similar for the two types of community banks over most of the past 20 years, except\nfor the period from 2008 to 2013, when rural community banks had lower charge-off\nrates than urban community banks.\nThis data suggest that, despite facing a more challenging economic environment,\nrural community banks appear to be holding their own relative to urban community\nbanks.\nMarket-Level Trends for All Banks and Community Banks\nNow I would like to shift my focus from the banks themselves to the communities\nthey serve by exploring whether access to banking services--provided by community or\nlarger banks--has been declining in urban or rural areas of the country. As of 2017, the\naverage urban market was home to 18 community banks and just over 8 large banks,\nwhich represents a change from 21 community banks and 6 large banks in 1997\n(figure 9). The average number of community banks per rural market has been\nremarkably stable over the past 20 years at right around 4, while the average number of\nlarge banks per rural market has increased from just under 1 to 1.4 (figure 10). These\n\n- 8 -\nstatistics indicate that, perhaps surprisingly, the average number of banks in rural markets\nhas actually increased in the past 20 years.\nIf we look at the number of bank branches rather than the number of competitors,\nwe see a significant increase in the number of branches in the average urban market, with\nthe entire increase coming from branches of large banks (figure 11). Over the same\nperiod, there was essentially no change in the number of branches in rural markets, with a\nslight shift upward in the share of branches accounted for by large banks (figure 12). Of\ncourse, there is substantial variation in the experiences of individual markets, as some\nlocal rural and urban markets gained and others lost bank branches.\nAs the share of branches in the average banking market operated by community\nbanks has declined, so, too, has the share of deposits held at community banks. This shift\nin deposit shares away from community banks, similar to the shift in branch shares, has\nbeen substantial in urban markets but only marginal in rural markets (figure 13).\nCommunity banks held almost half of all deposits at urban bank branches in 1997, but\njust over one-third in 2017. In rural markets, community banks collectively had a deposit\nmarket share of 80 percent in 1997, declining moderately to 77 percent in 2017.\nDespite the decline in the overall share of deposits held by community banks in\nurban and rural markets over the past 20 years, the average individual community bank\noperating in each type of market has seen almost no change in its deposit market share\n(figure 14). In other words, the decline in the share of market deposits held in aggregate\nby community banks is due to fewer community banks. The fact that the average\nindividual community bank has maintained or increased its deposit market share since\n\n- 9 -\n2008 suggests that community banks have been able to compete quite successfully with\nlarger banks in both urban and rural markets during and since the recent recession.\nHead Offices\nAs I have mentioned, the average numbers of banks and bank branches have\nincreased or remained constant in rural markets in recent years despite a wave of mergers\nthat has greatly reduced the number of U.S. banking organizations. Industry\nconsolidation has led to fewer banks but maintained most of the branches of the acquired\nbanks. In addition, most mergers and acquisitions have involved expansion into new\nmarkets by the acquiring bank rather than acquisitions of local competitors, which has\nallowed local communities to continue to enjoy a variety of potential providers of\nbanking services despite the industry consolidation.8\nOne unavoidable aspect of consolidation is a loss in the number of bank\nheadquarters offices. The number of bank headquarters located in urban markets has\nfallen by half over the past 20 years, while the number in rural markets has fallen by\n45 percent.9 Consolidation has led to a doubling in the number of banking markets--\nalmost all of which are rural--in which no banks are headquartered (figure 16). We hear\nanecdotally that banks are more attuned to the needs of the communities in which they\nare headquartered, so the significance of this loss could have an effect on the local\nmarkets.\n8 One way that economists measure the structure of a market is by measures of market concentration. Not\nsurprisingly, rural markets are, on average, much more concentrated than urban markets. However,\naverage concentration levels have been declining in rural markets while increasing slightly in urban\nmarkets over the past two decades.\n9 The average urban market has more headquarters offices than the average rural market (figure 15). There\nare just over 8 banks headquartered in the average urban market (down from just over 14 in 1997),\ncompared with an average of 1.3 banks headquartered in the average rural market (down from 2.4 in 1997).\n\n- 10 -\nQualitative Evidence at a More Micro Level\nAs I previewed at the beginning of my remarks, data and averages often do not\ntell the whole story. At the end of the day, we care about bank branch locations because\nwe care about the people and communities that they are serving or, in some cases, not\nserving adequately. So even if the data tell us that most rural markets are well served, we\nneed to focus our attention on those markets that may not be as well served and how that\nis affecting the people who bank, or cannot bank, there. That is why the Federal Reserve\nSystem’s Community Development function has undertaken a national series of listening\nsessions to assess the real effects of bank closures on rural communities. Reserve Bank\nstaff members are conducting the sessions around the country to gather information from\nconsumers and small business owners in rural communities that have been directly\naffected by bank closures.\nTo identify where to conduct these sessions, we used data to identify rural towns\nthat have experienced bank branch closures; in some cases, these towns lost the only\nbank in town and now have no remaining banks. Then we convened local residents and\nsmall business owners to ask them about what the loss of a bank meant to them and their\ncommunity.\nFor some residents, the closure has not been much of a problem. Most, if not all,\nof the listening session participants in Clark, South Dakota, noted that they do most of\ntheir routine banking online. Some in Clark even noted that they did not think ATMs\n(automated teller machines) were necessary, as most of the retail businesses in town offer\ncash back with debit card purchases. Nonetheless, residents of Clark spoke positively\nabout the importance of the personal touch a local bank can provide. Residents liked\n\n- 11 -\nfamiliar faces at the teller window and loan officers who understand the local economy\nwhen making small business loan decisions.\nHowever, online banking is not necessarily an opportunity for everyone. Indeed,\neven for community banks themselves, technology may be perceived as a threat or an\nopportunity, depending for example on whether the necessary infrastructure is available.\nIn Nicholas County, Kentucky, which is located in Appalachia, many residents do not\nhave access to high-speed internet; this lack of access has led most residents to travel\noutside of the county to conduct their banking needs. This situation is certainly not\noptimal for anyone, but it presents a particular challenge to the elderly, those without a\ncar, and busy small business owners who do not have time to travel 25 miles each way to\nmake change and deposit checks. In Centre County, Pennsylvania, we heard that the\ntransportation challenge is particularly acute for the Amish--10 miles is a long way to\ntravel by horse and buggy.\nThe loss of a bank branch also has a ripple effect on a community as a whole. In\nthe village of Brushton, New York, which lost its only bank branch in 2014, small\nbusiness owners commented that when residents must leave the village to access banking\nservices, they are more likely to shop, eat, and pay for services in other towns, which\ncreates additional hardship for the small businesses of Brushton. Additionally, as the\nability of community members to access cash has decreased, credit card use has\nincreased. Small business owners in Brushton say that this growth in credit card usage\nhas significantly increased the cost of doing business.\nLastly, one theme that we heard loud and clear across the country was that the\nloss of a local bank meant the loss of an important civic institution. Banks do not just\n\n- 12 -\ncash checks and make loans--they also place ads in small town newspapers, donate to\nlocal nonprofits, and sponsor local Little League teams. As towns lose banks and\nbankers, they also lose important local leaders.\nWe will continue to conduct these listening sessions across the country\nthroughout the fall. In fact, one of these listening sessions will take place next week just\ntwo hours down the road in Reynolds County, Missouri. We look forward to sharing the\ncollective results of our efforts in a report that should be published in early 2019.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, the numbers of urban and rural community banks have been declining\nover the past 20 years, but community banks continue to play an important role in both\ntypes of markets. Urban and rural community banks face different challenges, but, on\naverage, both seem to be faring well in the post-crisis period. And the average rural\nbanking market has not seen any decline in the number of banks or bank branches over\nrecent years. For the local areas where the availability of banking services has declined,\nwe are in the process of assessing the effects of this decline on the people who live and\nwork in those communities. I look forward to continuing to engage in this area and\nmonitor the developments in this most vital part of the banking ecosystem.\n\n12,000\n10,000\n8,000\n6,000\n4,000\n2,000\n1997 1999 2001 2003

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:30 p.m. EST\nFebruary 22, 2019\nThe Future of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2019 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by\nthe Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 22, 2019\n\nWhen I was asked to participate on this panel in the middle of last year, the\nprevailing metaphor regarding Federal Reserve balance sheet policy was “as boring as\nwatching paint dry.” Well, times have changed, and I commend the conference\norganizers for their foresight. Today I would like to discuss some of the recent decisions\nthat the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has made regarding the balance sheet\nand lay out a rough framework for some further issues that are on the horizon.1\nIn January, after much discussion, including in previous meetings, the FOMC\nannounced its intent to continue operating in a framework of ample reserves.2 In this\nregime, active management of the reserve supply is not needed. The Federal Reserve\ncontrols the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates primarily\nthrough the use of administered rates, including the rate paid on reserve balances and the\noffered rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements. This regime is sometimes\nreferred to as a floor system, because the administered rates place a floor under the rate at\nwhich banks and others will lend in the federal funds market. In adopting this\nframework, the Committee stated its intention to continue operating as it has for the past\ndecade.\nThe announcement was an important step in our normalization process. And we\nare now set up to make further decisions on the eventual size and composition of our\nbalance sheet. Before providing more context on those decisions, let me first provide a\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 For more information, see the Committee’s Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and\nBalance Sheet Normalization, which is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nlittle more detail around our decision to remain in the current framework of ample\nreserves.\nThe most important factor in the decision was that the current system has worked\nvery well. It has supported the achievement of our dual-mandate objectives of maximum\nemployment and price stability. And it has shown itself to be flexible and well suited to\nmaintaining interest rate control through various changes in money markets, bank\nregulation, and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Since the FOMC began lifting\ninterest rates in December 2015, money market rates have generally moved closely with\nthe federal funds rate, which in turn has followed changes in administered rates.\nNow that the decision on the operating framework has been made, a natural next\nstep is to contemplate the appropriate size of the Fed’s balance sheet and reserves and the\nprocess for getting there. In line with the requirements of operating with ample reserves-\n-and boosted by the growth in nonreserve liabilities--the Fed will maintain a larger\nbalance sheet and reserve supply relative to the pre-crisis period, with the goal of\nremaining on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve. I would note that reserves\nhave already declined appreciably from their peak, falling by $1.2 trillion to a current\nlevel of around $1.6 trillion. At the same time, we have seen a substantial increase in our\nnonreserve liabilities, such as currency in circulation and the Treasury General Account\nbalance. In our statement on Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, we outlined an\nintention to hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy\nefficiently and effectively.3 As the balance sheet continues to shrink, we are now in the\nprocess of determining that necessary size.\n3 The Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans were adopted on September 16, 2014, and\ncan be found on the Board’s website at\n\n- 3 -\nUltimately, the size of the balance sheet will be determined by a number of\nfactors, including demand for nonreserve liabilities, such as currency (which has been\nrising), and, importantly, the quantity of reserves necessary to remain reliably on the flat\nportion of the reserve demand curve. Survey results suggest that banks have greatly\nincreased their demand for reserves in the post-crisis period. Responses to the September\n2018 Senior Financial Officer Survey report that banks would be comfortable with a level\nof reserves in the system in the neighborhood of $800 billion, taking into consideration\nthe level of interest rates at the time.4 In part, this increased demand reflects a response\nto regulatory changes introduced after the crisis. These changes include, importantly, the\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which has improved banks’ liquidity resilience by\nrequiring firms to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover potential outflows\nduring times of stress. Reserves, along with Treasury securities, are favored under the\nLCR, and, consequently, firms currently meet a sizable fraction of their LCR\nrequirements by holding reserves.\nNotwithstanding survey results, the level of reserve demand remains quite\nuncertain. It is possible that, over time, the preferences of banks will shift, or that\ndemand will prove more price elastic than banks are currently expecting. As I have\ndiscussed previously, bank holdings of reserves to meet LCR requirements could shift\ntoward Treasury securities, as aggregate reserves decline, without much upward pressure\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_policynormalization.pdf. The FOMC\nadopted addenda to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans on March 18, 2015\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20150318.pdf), and on\nJune 13, 2017\n(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf).\n4 The survey is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sfos/files/senior-\nfinancial-officer-survey-201809.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\non the federal funds rate.5 That said, even if uncertain, it is probably safe to say that\nreserve demand is much higher than before the crisis.\nAs we work to calibrate ample reserves, there are some tradeoffs that are worth\nnoting. For example, we could operate with a level of reserve balances at the lower end\nof what might be considered ample. In that case, there would likely be occasions when\nunexpected declines in the supply of reserves or increases in the demand for reserves\nwould require an open market operation to offset temporary upward pressures on the\nfederal funds rate. Alternatively, we could operate with an average supply of reserves\nlarge enough to keep the federal funds rate determined along the flat portion of the\nreserve demand curve even with an unexpected shift in the supply of or demand for\nreserves. This approach would be operationally convenient but would also leave the size\nof the balance sheet and reserves larger than necessary most of the time. In my view, it\nmight be appropriate for us to operate somewhere in between these two extremes, with a\nsizable quantity of reserves large enough to buffer against most shocks to reserve supply.\nOn those few days when that buffer is likely to be exhausted, we could conduct open\nmarket operations to temporarily boost the supply of reserves.\nWith so much uncertainty over the level and slope of the reserve demand curve, a\ndegree of caution is warranted. As outlined in the minutes of the January FOMC\nmeeting, the Committee has discussed ending the reduction in the Fed’s aggregate asset\nholdings sometime in the latter half of this year, with still-ample reserves in the system.6\n5 See Randal K. Quarles (2018), “Liquidity Regulation and the Size of the Fed’s Balance Sheet,” speech\ndelivered at “Currencies, Capital, and Central Bank Balances: A Policy Conference,” a Hoover Institution\nMonetary Policy Conference, Stanford University, Stanford, Calif., May 4,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20180504a.htm.\n6 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, January 29-30, 2019,” press release, February 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190220a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nAt that point, one option discussed, without any decision being made at this point, is to\nhold the level of total assets roughly fixed for a time. Even as the total size of the balance\nsheet remains fixed, the composition of the liabilities would gradually change, in part as\ndemand for currency grows in line with the economy. Over time, the gradual increase in\nnonreserve liabilities would displace reserves as the overall balance sheet remains fixed.\nThis plan would substantially reduce the pace of the decline in reserves, allowing us to\ngradually approach our assessment of the appropriate amount of reserves for the efficient\nand effective implementation of monetary policy. Of course, in the longer run, once we\nreach our preferred level of reserves, the balance sheet would have to resume growth to\nmatch a continued increase in demand for nonreserve liabilities.\nI would like to wrap up with a brief discussion of some of the other decision\npoints we will encounter as we continue the process of normalizing our balance sheet. In\nparticular, what does the Committee judge to be normal in regard to the type and duration\nof assets that we will hold? On composition, in line with our previously announced\nnormalization principles, I favor a return to a balance sheet with all Treasury securities,\nallowing our mortgage-backed securities (MBS) holdings to run to zero. In those\nprinciples, we also state that while we do not expect sales of MBS as part of the\nnormalization process, later we would be open to limited sales to reduce or eliminate\nresidual holdings of MBS. In regard to duration, moving to shorten the duration of our\nholdings could increase the Fed’s ability to affect long-term interest rates if the need\narose. However, it might be preferable to have the composition of our Treasury holdings\nroughly match the maturity composition of outstanding Treasury securities, minimizing\nany market distortions that could arise from our holdings. Over the course of our\n\n- 6 -\nupcoming meetings, I look forward to what promises to be an interesting discussion on\nthese issues with my colleagues.\nFinally, in assessing our balance sheet policy, it is important to point out that the\nFed remains entirely focused on meeting its statutory dual-mandate objectives of\nmaximum employment and price stability. The normalization of the balance sheet is not\na competing goal. If ever it appears that our plans for the balance sheet are running\ncounter to the achievement of our dual-mandate objectives, we would quickly reassess\nour approach to the balance sheet.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:30 p.m. EST\nNovember 30, 2017\nThoughts on Prudent Innovation in the Payment System\nRemarks by\nRandal Quarles\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2017 Financial Stability and Fintech Conference\nsponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, the Office of Financial Research,\nand the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 30, 2017\n\nIt is a pleasure to be with you today to talk about financial stability and fintech. Being in\nthe Treasury’s beautifully restored Cash Room calls to mind the themes of both history and\nfinance. History, because the room was constructed just after the Civil War. Finance, because it\nwas designed to be the Treasury’s bank and was originally used to conduct daily banking and\npayment transactions with other banks and the general public. Of course the functionality of this\nroom has changed over the decades as the financial system landscape has evolved, and today we\nare holding a conference here to discuss financial innovation.\nBefore I begin, I will note that my colleague, Jay Powell, was supposed to be your\nspeaker today. However, as you can likely surmise, he had to attend to other matters and asked\nme to speak in his place. So to carry through the theme of today’s topic, one might call Jay the\ninnovator on payments issues at the Federal Reserve, as he has spoken extensively on the subject\nfor many years. And one might think of me as tech support on these issues for the day.\nNew technologies have brought tremendous, positive change to our lives, raising\nproductivity and living standards and contributing to economic growth. In the past few years,\ninnovation has profoundly transformed industries such as retail shopping, the media, and even\ntransportation by providing greater speed, convenience, and competition. Not surprisingly, both\nthe banking industry and technology firms have also been seeking innovations in financial\nservices that mirror and complement changes that have been made in other industries.\nInnovation is coming to finance with changes to consumer lending, financial advice, and retail\npayments, to name a few. The Federal Reserve, itself, is engaged in a multiyear effort to address\nchallenges and opportunities in the current payment system.\nDuring my experience in the realm of private equity, I had a chance to interact with many\nnew firms in these areas. The pace of innovation was often dizzying. In my new role as Vice\n\n- 2 -\nChairman for Supervision at the Federal Reserve, I see innovation as something that can and\nshould be fostered, but of course I must also scrutinize these innovations from a different\nperspective. That is to say, it is appropriate not only to evaluate the potential of innovations to\nimprove on existing services, but also to judge their ramifications for the safety and soundness of\nthe institutions we supervise and for financial stability--the topic of this conference. Although\nmany of these technologies are still nascent, it is important to have an eye on the potential\nfinancial stability implications both in the short- and long-run. Payment systems need to be\nresilient during adversity. Without that resilience, we could face a sudden loss of public\nconfidence and the seizing up of systems and critical activities.\nWith the Cash Room’s perspective on history and daily financial operations in mind, I\nwould like to concentrate my remarks on the U.S. payment system, which is a critical foundation\non which financial transactions and the conduct of business take place. New technologies are\nbeing proposed that could alter the design of our payment system. Today, I will talk about the\nnecessary trust and confidence that the system requires, the tension between the need for\nfinancial stability and the need to innovate, and the challenges that digital currencies, in\nparticular, present relative to the current system. These considerations highlight the need for a\nprudent approach to innovation in payment systems.\nPayment Systems, Networks, and Trust\nPayment systems are both financial networks and technical networks. In simple terms,\nthere is an asset that functions as money that can be transferred by households and businesses to\nbuy goods and services, which, along with their financial institutions, make up the bulk of the\nfinancial network. Today, the predominant forms of money used in payment systems are Federal\nReserve notes and reserve balances as well as transaction balances at depository institutions.\n\n- 3 -\nPayment systems also require a technical network to hold and transfer money. In earlier\ntimes, the network was less technical in nature and almost exclusively designed for the logistical\nstorage and transfer of physical forms of money. Today, the main payments networks use\ncentralized technology to process and safeguard the public’s electronic funds transfers.\nRegulated banking institutions provide deposit money to the public and are a main source of trust\nfor these systems. Transfers of balances on the books of these institutions are at the center of the\npublic’s transactions, with the Federal Reserve Banks playing a central, supporting role in\ninterbank clearing and settlement for the most critical systems.\nA great amount of resources and effort goes into the networks that make the overall\npayment system safe, efficient, and resilient. It is fair to say that the general public places a great\ndeal of trust in the components of the overall system to safeguard their money and operate as\nplanned every day, and that trust is necessary for the system to work. From the perspective of\nfinancial stability, if the safety and integrity of the institutions and assets at the heart of a system\nerode or the transfer operations are not dependable, then the necessary trust and confidence that\nthe system requires to work may quickly cease to function as needed.\nPayment System Innovation\nWith a steady diet of news about the effect of electronic networks, personal devices,\napps, and more on U.S. industries, many question the effect of these technologies on the payment\nsystem. I think we should recognize that there can be a tension between the need for financial\nstability in the overall payment system and the need to innovate to keep up with the demands of\nmodern technology and lifestyles. However, we should also recognize that this tension is not\nnecessarily troubling. By definition innovation means doing something new, which usually\ninvolves taking risk in furtherance of some gain. But at the same time, we should be vigilant in\n\n- 4 -\nbalancing the benefits of innovation with the safe and reliable operation of systems and critical\nactivities.\nFrom an analytical perspective, payment systems typically increase in value as more\npeople use a system and the more attractive it becomes to others. In addition, there is an inverse\nrelationship between the volume of users of a system and the cost of production--more users\nlower the cost of production. Until recently, these features may have hindered innovation by\npresenting high barriers to entry and may have also fostered greater concentration into a few key\nentities that could become systemically important.1 Of course, technology may be able to reduce\nthe effect of at least some of these hurdles by, for example, attracting high numbers of users\nquickly or reducing the costs of production. However, the effect of reducing technological\nbarriers for financial stability is not clearly positive or negative. For example, on the one hand,\nnew market participants attracted by lower barriers to entry may introduce new and unknown\nrisks in the payment system. On the other hand, new market participants may relieve the\nconcentration of activity in a limited number of players.\nThus, the potential tension between innovation and stability can be more difficult to\nmanage in the case of payment systems as compared to other industries that are less affected by\nthese hurdles. One sensible approach to risk management would emphasize “starting small” and\ntaking small risks. But unless a payment system grows a fairly large network of users in a\nreasonable time, it is unlikely to achieve the scope and scale it needs to be successful.\nConversely, if a system attempts to start on a large scale and is successful, there will surely be\nquestions about resilience in adversity, particularly if cutting-edge technologies and methods are\nused to handle people’s money. The essential problem is how to achieve scale and manage\n1 See Financial Stability Board, Financial Stability Implications from FinTech: Supervisory and Regulatory Issues\nthat Merit Authorities’ Attention, June 27, 2017, www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/R270617.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nfinancial and technical risk at the same time. Not surprisingly, because striking the right balance\ntakes time, genuine innovation in payment systems over history has often been measured in\ndecades, not years.\nPrivate Digital Currencies\nAs part of the new technology associated with fintech, we are now seeing the emergence\nof privately developed digital currencies using new decentralized technologies. Fundamental to\nthese digital currencies is the establishment of a new asset, the unit of the digital currency--for\nexample, a bitcoin--and a new record-keeping and transfer mechanism that enables users to store\nand trade those units--for example, a blockchain--often without reliance on traditional financial\ninstitutions.\nI believe the financial industry is increasingly recognizing that we should separate the\nconcept of digital currencies from the innovative new technologies that they have employed to\ntransfer assets. Those technologies, such as distributed ledgers, may offer useful new ways to\nstore, transfer, and protect data and traditional financial assets. The industry is now moving\ncautiously from pilot projects in many of these areas to the use of these new technologies in\nlimited production settings. This cautious approach to using new technology appears to reflect\nthe weight of responsibility the financial industry bears for protecting both their customers and\ntheir reputations. Continued monitoring of developments is in order, and time will tell how these\nnew technologies--and others--can contribute to a safe and secure payment system and broader\nfinancial system. The Federal Reserve has been actively monitoring these developments and will\ncontinue to do so.2\n2 See David Mills, Kathy Wang, Brendan Malone, Anjana Ravi, Jeff Marquardt, Clinton Chen, Anton Badev,\nTimothy Brezinski, Linda Fahy, Kimberley Liao, Vanessa Kargenian, Max Ellithorpe, Wendy Ng, and Maria Baird,\n“Distributed Ledger Technology in Payments, Clearing, and Settlement,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series\n\n- 6 -\nBut when we examine the assets at the center of digital currency systems, I think we\nshould begin to think clearly about the long-term properties we seek for large-scale payment\nnetworks and systems used by the general public. Today, the vast majority of our payments by\nvolume and value are processed by regulated financial institutions. In the U.S. payment system,\ndigital currencies are a niche product that sometimes garners large headlines. But from the\nstandpoint of analysis, the “currency” or asset at the center of some of these systems is not\nbacked by other secure assets, has no intrinsic value, is not the liability of a regulated banking\ninstitution, and in leading cases, is not the liability of any institution at all. Indeed, how to treat\nand define this new asset is complicated.3\nWhile these digital currencies may not pose major concerns at their current levels of use,\nmore serious financial stability issues may result if they achieve wide-scale usage. Risk\nmanagement can act as a mitigant, but if the central asset in a payment system cannot be\npredictably redeemed for the U.S. dollar at a stable exchange rate in times of adversity, the\nresulting price risk and potential liquidity and credit risk pose a large challenge for the system.\nDuring times of crisis, the demand for liquidity can increase significantly, including the demand\nfor the central asset used in settling payments. Even private-sector banks and certainly non-\nbanks can have a hard time meeting large-scale demands for extra liquidity at the very time when\n2016-095 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2016),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016095pap.pdf.\n3 For example, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission published a statement on digital currencies making\nclear that many fall into the category of commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act\n(www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7231-15). The Securities and Exchange Commission has published\nguidance on the treatment of digital currencies under the Securities Exchange Act (www.sec.gov/news/press-\nrelease/2017-131). The Internal Revenue Service has published guidance on the tax treatment of digital currencies\n(www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf). And the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has published guidance\non the treatment of digital currencies under the Bank Secrecy Act (www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-\nregulations/guidance/application-fincens-regulations-persons-administering).\n\n- 7 -\ntheir balance sheets may be in question. Moreover, this inability to meet the demand for extra\nliquidity can have spillover effects to other areas of the financial system.\nEarlier in our history, the United States frequently witnessed bank runs that severely\ndisrupted financial and economic activity, an example of what can happen when people lose faith\nin a payment system. In response, Congress ultimately introduced both a central bank and\ndeposit insurance programs to help regulate fluctuations in the supply of liquidity in order to\nkeep prices stable. Without the backing of a central bank asset and institutional support, it is not\nclear how a private digital currency at the center of a large-scale payment system would behave,\nor whether the payment system would be able to function, in times of stress.\nCentral-Bank-Issued Digital Currency\nGiven that privately developed digital currencies may raise important financial stability\nissues tied to the value of the asset, some have argued that central banks should begin to issue\ntheir own digital currency as a 21st century analogue to paper currency. I would urge caution,\nparticularly for countries like the United States with highly developed banking systems and\nongoing robust demand for physical cash.\nAs a practical matter, I believe that consideration of a central-bank-issued digital\ncurrency to the general public would require extensive reviews and consultations about legal\nissues, as well as a long list of risk issues, including the potential deployment of unproven\ntechnology, money laundering, cybersecurity, and privacy to name a few. I am particularly\nconcerned that a central-bank-issued digital currency that’s held widely around the globe could\nbe the subject of serious cyberattacks and could be widely used in money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing. The effect of all this would significantly divert our focus from work to improve or\nestablish new private-sector retail payment systems based on existing institutions. The prospect\n\n- 8 -\nof a government-sponsored digital currency might even derail private-sector plans to enhance the\npayment services provided to their customers, thereby significantly disrupting the financial\nnetworks that exist today in ways that could create instability. For example, if payment activity\nradically shifted from using deposits at financial institutions to using central-bank-issued digital\ncurrency, deposits could significantly shrink and potentially disrupt financial institutions’ ability\nto make loans that spur economic activity.\nThat said, research into digital currency issues, including highly liquid and secure\nlimited-purpose digital currencies for use as a settlement asset for wholesale payment systems,\nshould continue. As technologies are developed and refined, old issues are resolved and new\nissues arise. Other countries may have different environments and experiences. We should\nalways be open to learning and understanding from the experiences of others.\nPrudent Innovation\nFor the United States, the alternative to privately issued digital currency is not\nnecessarily a publicly issued digital currency. Instead, the near-term alternative is to build on the\ntrusted foundations of the existing payment system and work to improve private-sector payment\nservices. Importantly, this means looking to the banking system, which holds the bulk of the\ntransaction deposits in this country, to improve services. This began a number of years ago with\ninternet banking. Today, many banks offer around-the-clock internet-based access to accounts as\nwell as mobile banking and payment capabilities. Many banks typically allow real-time or near\nreal-time transfers of funds among their own customer base. What does not yet exist in the\nUnited States is the sort of ubiquitous, real-time payment system that would allow banks and\ntheir customers to make transfers and settlements of funds across the banking system instantly,\nconveniently, and securely all the time.\n\n- 9 -\nAs my colleague at the Board, Jay Powell, recently discussed at a conference in New\nYork, the Federal Reserve has been working with the banking industry and a wide range of other\npayment system stakeholders to better understand the consequences of this state of affairs and\nsupport efforts to expand the available options through our payment system improvement\ninitiative.4 For example, based on recommendations from the industry, the Federal Reserve is\ncurrently studying potential improvements in its settlement services--a traditional core function\nof a central bank--that could address the future needs of a ubiquitous real-time retail payments\nenvironment.\nBuilding on our existing banking system also makes sense from a financial stability\nperspective. Federally insured and supervised institutions are the core of our current payment\nsystem and largely address the potential financial stability problem of relying on payment\nsystems with unbacked and unregulated digital currencies at their heart. But leveraging our\nexisting banking system does not suggest that there is no room for new or emerging institutions\nand technologies. Indeed, there are a number of promising avenues that would allow the\ninnovations that appear to be of the greatest interest to households and business--attributes like\ninstant payment capabilities and around-the-clock operations--to be offered using a variety of\nexisting and new technologies without requiring significant tradeoffs in safety and resiliency.\nSummary\nTo conclude, our financial stability requires that the payment system be reliable and\ndependable so that the public can trust it. As a result, there can be a tension between innovation\nand the need for financial stability in the overall payment system. Innovation must therefore\n4 See Jerome H. Powell, “Financial Innovation: A World in Transition” (speech delivered at the 41st Annual Central\nBanking Seminar, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, October 18, 2017),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20171018a.htm.\n\n- 10 -\naccount for the effects that it has on both the financial and technology networks that make up our\npayment system.\nThe innovation that is beginning to flow from the development of digital currencies--and\nother technologies--will likely have a long-run effect on the technical networks and the business\nprocesses used in the payment system and the wider financial system. Privately developed\ndigital currencies as currently configured would raise concerns about the effect on financial\nstability if they take on more prominence in the payments and overall financial system. Central\nbank digital currencies are also not immune to a large range of risks and could even adversely\naffect financial stability. As such, central banks should tread cautiously as they contemplate\nissuing them. But this does not mean that we should avoid further innovation. Working\ncooperatively, private-sector participants and central banks can incorporate innovation that may\nbe able to strike the right balance of improving the technical networks without adversely\ngenerating financial stability concerns. I am optimistic that the Federal Reserve’s work with the\npayments industry will facilitate a future with a safe and more efficient payment system.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8:30 a.m. EDT (2:30 p.m. local time)\nOctober 3, 2019\nThe Financial Stability Board at 10 Years—Looking Back and Looking Ahead\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nChair\nFinancial Stability Board\nat\nEuropean Banking Federation’s\nEuropean Banking Summit\nBrussels, Belgium\nOctober 3, 2019\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. The European Banking\nFederation is often referred to as the voice of Europe’s banks, and I am here in the hopes\nthat you are the ears of those institutions as well.\nThis year, 2019, is the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Financial Stability\nBoard (FSB), which means it has also been 10 years since some of the darker days of the\nglobal financial crisis. The FSB was not born on a sunny day; it was born of necessity,\nwith storm clouds still looming.\nAn anniversary—particularly a 10th anniversary—is a good opportunity for\nreflection. Not far from here, in Antwerp, the artist Peter Paul Rubens painted the\n“Temple of Janus.” Janus was a Roman god who could look both backward and forward\nin time, and when Rubens painted the work, citizens of Antwerp were at a turning point\nand were wondering what the future held for them. Today, I would like to take on the\nrole of Janus. I would like to look back on the experiences of the past 10 years, what the\nFSB has accomplished, and also offer some perspective on just how it contributed to the\nconstruction of the post-crisis global financial architecture. As you would expect, I\nbelieve the FSB has and will continue to play an important role in our global financial\nsystem. I will discuss why that is. I would then like to look ahead to the new challenges\nfacing the global regulatory community, such as innovations in financial technology,\nshifts in financial globalization and integration, and increasing nonbank financial\nintermediation.\nTen years ago, after the events of the fall of 2008, the G20 nations recognized that\nthe response to the crisis had to be urgent, it had to be credible, and it had to be global.\nThe regulatory community knew it must work to regain the confidence of financial\n\n- 2 -\ninstitutions, market participants, and the broader public. They knew that then-existing\narrangements for international cooperation were not up to that task.\nThe Financial Stability Forum (FSF), the predecessor of the FSB, had been\nfounded by the G7 countries in 1999 after a series of financial crises in the latter part of\nthe 1990s. The group was intended to enhance cooperation among various national and\ninternational supervisory bodies and multilateral financial institutions in order to promote\nstability in the international financial system. Membership was relatively narrow, with\nonly 12 countries and few emerging markets represented.\nWhile the group discussed matters related to financial stability, the areas it was\nasked to study were relatively narrow, and combined with its limited membership, it had\nrelatively little scope to promote regulatory reform. The looseness of this arrangement\nrepresented the prevailing view in advanced nations at the time that national regulators\nand finance ministries were capable of monitoring and dealing with risks to global\nfinancial stability. On the one hand, these nations had long recognized that effective\ncapital regulation of banks with a global footprint was only possible with coordination on\nminimal capital standards—the Basel Committee process. But there was no such\nconsensus about financial stability, perhaps rooted in a belief, rarely expressed but\nwidespread, that a severe global financial crisis was highly unlikely, and that traditional\nprudential supervision would be enough to prevent it. Major banks in Europe, Japan, and\nthe United States had been affected by debt crises in developing countries in the 1980s\nand 1990s, but these crises had never seriously threatened advanced economies.\nIn the fall of 2008, G20 leaders recognized that the severity of the emerging\nglobal financial crisis required a response that was beyond the capabilities of the FSF.\n\n- 3 -\nLike that Long Island police chief in the movie “Jaws,” ministers and leaders saw what\nwas racing toward them and decided that they were going to need a bigger boat.\nSpecifically, they recognized there was a major deficiency in the FSF that prevented it\nfrom being very effective in establishing international financial regulatory standards. The\nFSF was narrow—geographically, in the number of governments, and substantively, in\nthe range of ministries, central banks, and important regulatory agencies that were not\nmembers. Some of the world’s largest economies and financial markets were not\nrepresented, in particular emerging markets like China, India, Brazil, Mexico, and South\nAfrica. As of 2009, only 58 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) was\nrepresented, compared to 83 percent of GDP under the FSB today. The issue of\nrepresentation was crucial, because the financial crisis required a fully global response.\nAs a result, in April of 2009 at the G20 summit in London, the heads of state and\ngovernment called for an organization “with a stronger institutional basis and enhanced\ncapacity” that would allow them to achieve “much greater consistency and systematic\ncooperation between countries…that a global financial system requires.” Behind those\nsimple words was a sea change in the willingness of advanced nations to tackle\nsignificant coordination on financial regulation. The crisis that had been raging at that\npoint for over a year made the need for such a commitment inescapable.\nWith the creation of the FSB, the G20 designed a new regulatory organization\nwith global reach dedicated to advancing and coordinating a newly embraced priority for\nthe global economy—far-reaching reform of financial regulation and supervision. The\nFSB membership spans central banks, ministries of finance, supervisors of financial\ninstitutions, international financial organizations, and market regulators. It has a broad\n\n- 4 -\nmandate centered on financial stability and coordination of responses for those most\nchallenging issues that cut across the traditional mandates of other global standard-setting\nbodies. In addition, one of the FSB’s chief responsibilities is scanning the horizon for\nfinancial vulnerabilities, making it an inherently forward-looking body.\nThe exigency of the crisis helped overcome longstanding deficiencies in the\nstructure of the FSF, rooted in differences between the members or ambivalence about\ninternational standard setting itself, related to financial stability. The crisis helped bridge\ndifferences and reach consensus, so that quick initial progress was made on matters that\nrequired urgent action. In addition to those actions, the members also recognized that\nwork must begin immediately to develop new regulatory standards for capital and\nliquidity, derivatives reform, and issues stemming from the nonbanking sector which\nwould require some time for data gathering and extensive public consultation. Creation\nof the FSB was one of a number of steps taken at the international level in the spring of\n2009 that over the subsequent months helped restore confidence in the banking system\nand begin the process of recovery.\nSince the FSB was born with the global economy and financial markets still in\nturmoil, immediate attention was needed in a number of core areas: over-the-counter\n(OTC) derivatives, prudential bank standards, resolution, and nonbank finance. Much of\nthe FSB’s first 10 years has been focused on these issues, and a great deal has been\naccomplished, resulting in a significantly strengthened and more resilient global financial\nsystem. So let me quickly review our work in these areas.\nOver-the-Counter Derivatives\n\n- 5 -\nThe elements of the FSB’s agenda for OTC derivatives fall into four categories:\n1) central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, where appropriate, 2) exchange or\nelectronic platform trading of standardized OTC derivatives, 3) reporting to trade\nrepositories, and 4) higher capital and margin requirements for non-centrally cleared\nderivatives. The most recent report on implementation progress finds that in the\njurisdictions with the largest OTC derivatives markets, there is almost complete\nimplementation of the necessary reforms. That means that today, OTC derivatives\nmarkets, which are crucial for the functioning of our financial system, are simpler, more\ntransparent, and generally more resilient.\nPrudential Bank Standards\nThe FSB has endorsed the work of the Basel Committee that is aimed at enhanced\nprudential standards for internationally active banking organizations, a process known as\nBasel III. The main elements of Basel III are: a stronger risk-based capital adequacy\nframework; a leverage ratio requirement; a capital surcharge for global systemically\nimportant banks; a liquidity coverage ratio liquidity requirement; a net stable funding\nratio liquidity requirement; and a large exposures framework.\nAll 24 member jurisdictions of the FSB have the core elements of Basel III risk-\nbased capital and liquidity measures in place. However, there has been uneven progress\non some of the other elements. Some jurisdictions have not yet fully implemented the\nlarge exposures framework, the leverage ratio, and the net stable funding ratio. And most\njurisdictions are just starting to implement the Basel III “end game” reforms agreed in\nDecember 2017. We have some work left to do but I am confident that it will be\n\n- 6 -\ncompleted, and the FSB will continue to push all of its members for full completion of\nthese important measures.\nResolution\nOne of the most important issues the world faced during the financial crisis was\nthe “too-big-to-fail” dilemma. The large and unpopular bailouts that were deployed to\nhelp stem the crisis made it clear that an alternative was needed to deal with “too big to\nfail.”\nIn response, the FSB established the “Key Attributes for Effective Resolution,”\nwhich identify the responsibilities, instruments, and powers that national resolution\nregimes should follow if they have to resolve a failing systemically important financial\ninstitution or SIFI. The FSB’s resolution work also included a new total loss absorbing\ncapacity requirement to help ensure that authorities are able to conduct a bail-in\nrecapitalization of a failed SIFI. Too big to fail was a defining issue of the crisis, and\nrecognizing the importance of the work that has been done to end it, this year the FSB\nkicked off an evaluation of the effects of the reforms that have been put in place around\nthe world to deal with the issue. By next year, I hope we will be able to discuss the\nresults of that work.\nNonbank Financial Intermediation\nDuring the crisis, “shadow banking” became the term for any type of financial\nactivity that occurred outside banks that resembled what banks did and that often wasn’t\ncompletely understood. Within the FSB, we refer to those activities as nonbank financial\nintermediation, or NBFI. Regardless of its name, a lot of blame for the problems that\narose in the global financial crisis centered on risks that emerged from some activities in\n\n- 7 -\nparts of this sector, and one of the FSB’s first jobs was to try to look into these activities\nto better understand their growing role in financial markets.\nAmong the important steps we took was a global monitoring exercise that results\nin an annual report on the size of NBFI in the global economy. That work actually goes\nbeyond the membership of the FSB, since a number of important international financial\ncenters also report information to us. With all of that information, we are able to track\nthe overall size of nonbank financial intermediation, which in 2017 grew to $184 trillion,\nrepresenting nearly half of financial activity in 21 countries plus the euro area. More\nimportant, we are now able to more carefully categorize activities in the nonbank sector\nin order to analyze potential vulnerabilities.\nIn addition to monitoring, we have made a number of other recommendations and\nare working with fellow global standard setters to implement them. For example, we are\nworking with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors on capital standards\nfor global insurers, and we are working with the International Organization of Securities\nCommissions (IOSCO) on liquidity and leverage in the funds industry. The funds sector\ncontinues to evolve, so we will focus particular attention here as we move forward.\nStatus of Post-Crisis Reform\nThe result of 10 years of policy development by the FSB and implementation at\nthe national level has been a stronger, more resilient global financial system. Large\nbanks are better capitalized, less levered, and more liquid. Too-big-to-fail reforms are\nwell-advanced, particularly with the formation of effective resolution regimes for banks.\nOTC derivatives markets are simpler and more transparent. Nonbank financial\nintermediation risks are better understood, and steps are being taken to reduce and\n\n- 8 -\ncontain them. While shocks to the system, especially from unanticipated directions, can\nnever be ruled out, these reforms go a long way to reducing the likelihood and severity of\nfuture crises.\nConsequently, the FSB has started to pivot from policy development to evaluating\nthe effectiveness of the reforms it has advocated. I just mentioned that this year the FSB\nbegan a two-year evaluation of its too-big-to-fail reform package. We are also\ncompleting an evaluation of the effects that reforms have had on infrastructure finance\nand lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises. Going forward, these evaluations\nwill be critical for assessing where more work needs to be done.\nCasting my gaze backward, there is much to be proud of in the last decade,\nsuccess that is reflected in the strength and stability of the global financial system. So\nnow I would like to leave the past behind and turn to the future. But while Janus was the\ngod of beginnings, he was also the god of endings, and as such was able to look both\nbackwards and forwards at the same time.\nAssessing financial vulnerabilities is a critical part of the FSB mandate, and that is\ninherently a forward-looking job. The global financial system is constantly evolving,\ninfluenced in part by past experience, and by regulation. As I look ahead, I think we\nmust consider whether the ways in which we responded to the financial crisis may not be\nthe most appropriate ones to address the challenges and ongoing changes in the financial\nsystem that we currently face.\nThis year the FSB has embarked on an important project to review and update its\nfinancial stability surveillance framework. While much of the attention of the FSB in its\nearly years was on post-crisis reforms, members also spent time thinking about new\n\n- 9 -\nvulnerabilities to the system. As we reach our 10th anniversary, it is a good time to\nreview the ways we monitor the ever-changing financial system. The aim of this review\nis to ensure that we have a framework that is comprehensive, consistent over time, and\neffective at identifying relevant vulnerabilities. If we are not at the cutting edge in our\nability to assess the state of the financial system, we do a disservice to the public we\nserve, which relies on a smoothly functioning financial system. In addition, we are\nlooking at how we communicate our understanding of the state of the financial system to\nthe G20 and to the world. We want to be more open about our assessment, but great care\nhas to be taken to avoid a situation where revelations about emerging concerns lead to\nacceleration of those concerns and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nAs I look forward and ponder the forces that are shaping the evolution of the\nglobal financial system, the FSB is currently grappling with two issues—financial\ninnovation and market fragmentation—that have the potential to profoundly affect\nfinancial stability, so let me start there.\nOwing to our forward-looking orientation, the FSB has been actively engaged in\nmonitoring financial innovation for some time. Starting a little over five years ago, there\nwas an explosion of financial innovation that had a technological component, which we\nnow call fintech. This encompasses peer-to-peer lending, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin,\nand the use of new techniques like artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2017,\nthe FSB issued a report on the implications of fintech for financial stability. The report\nwas careful to note the potential benefits of many of these innovations, including the\npossibility of greater financial inclusion and increased speed of financial transactions.\nHowever, the report also drew attention to several supervisory and regulatory issues,\n\n- 10 -\nincluding three priorities where international collaboration is critical: managing\noperational risk from third-party service providers, mitigating cyber risks, and monitoring\nmacrofinancial risks that could emerge as fintech activities increase.1\nMore recently, one particular area of fintech has received a lot of attention—\nstablecoins. These are a type of crypto-asset that attempts to address the volatility of\nsome crypto-assets by tying their value to conventional assets, such as the value of the\nU.S. dollar or a basket of currencies. While it hasn’t been created yet, it is Facebook’s\nproposal for a new stablecoin that significantly increased the public’s attention to\nstablecoins. At the FSB, we undertake regular monitoring of the financial stability\nimplications of crypto-assets, and we have had discussions about the regulatory and\nsupervisory approaches to crypto-assets and potential gaps in regulation. The\nintroduction of stablecoins, however, brings a potentially new scale and scope that the\nfinancial regulatory community must carefully consider. Although there is a small risk to\nfinancial stability today, there is no doubt the potential scale of stablecoins and other\ncrypto-assets yet to emerge may pose regulatory challenges. At present, the G7 is\nfinishing a preliminary assessment of stablecoins, and the G20 has asked the FSB to lead\nthe work going forward, which we are actively undertaking. This is an issue that can\npotentially affect every country in the world. We have already begun work to identify\nwhich regulations exist that apply to stablecoins in our jurisdictions, and once that\nassessment is complete, we will report to the G20 on any appropriate actions that need to\nbe taken to ensure that financial stability is not negatively affected by their introduction.\n1 Consumer protection is a major concern in relation to fintech and cyber risk, but it is outside the FSB’s\nmandate and is being handled by member governments.\n\n- 11 -\nThe FSB is grappling with other challenges beyond fintech. As time has passed\nsince the financial crisis, there is concern about fragmentation of financial markets—a\nsense that globalization of financial markets may be slowing and differences in the\nregulatory requirements at the national level may be on the rise. Some forms of market\nfragmentation may have financial stability benefits, such as reasonable loss absorbency\nrequirements imposed on subsidiaries of global banks, but market fragmentation may also\nbring about unintended negative consequences, such as increased opportunities for\nregulatory arbitrage and cumulatively higher regulatory burdens for firms.\nOver the past year, at the request of the G20, the FSB has been examining the\ndifferent forms in which market fragmentation is manifest. Following up on that, we\nrecently held a workshop where FSB members met with representatives from the private\nsector and from academia to discuss the internal allocation of capital and liquidity by\nglobal financial institutions.2 We are also following up in other areas, such as working\nwith IOSCO on issues related to deference and examining improved ways for regulatory\nand supervisory information sharing. Market fragmentation is an issue that will never\ndisappear, and we will remain vigilant to ensure that it does not pose a threat to financial\nstability.\nAt the outset today, I said I was going to take the mantle of Janus, who could look\nbackward and forward in time.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:15 p.m. EDT (10:15 a.m. PDT)\nOctober 5, 2021\nGoodbye to All That: The End of LIBOR\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Structured Finance Association Conference\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nOctober 5, 2021\n\nNow that business travel has started to pick back up as we emerge from the\nCOVID event, a prosaic but insistent problem has reappeared: what to read on a long\nplane flight. Like most of you, I try to get some work done—but, also like most of you,\nout of an amalgam of security concerns and indolence, I often don’t succeed. Something\nmust improve the hours, but Kant is a little heavy, P.G. Wodehouse a little light, and T.S.\nEliot looks like you’re just showing off. So, over the last few weeks, I’ve been re-\nreading Joan Didion while making my way from point A to point B: Slouching Toward\nBethlehem, The White Album, and Where I Was From. As it turns out, Joan Didion is a\nparticularly apt author to be reading on the way to this conference—not because the\nconference is being held in Las Vegas, although her four-page summation of this “most\nextreme and allegorical of American settlements” is a classic. But rather, because a\nnearly constant theme of her writing is change: how hard it is to recognize that things\nhave changed; how hard it is to come to terms with it once recognized; how insistent\npeople can be that surely, they will be OK.\nAnd given that introduction, I’m sure you have now guessed what I intend to talk\nto you about today: LIBOR, the benchmark formerly known as the London Interbank\nOffered Rate. LIBOR was the principal benchmark used to set interest rates for a vast\nnumber of commercial loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives, and other products. For\na number of years—certainly at least since July of 2017, and really for several years\nbefore—it has been clear that LIBOR would end, but some believed it was not clear\nexactly when LIBOR would end. And, as a result, many market participants have\ncontinued to use LIBOR as if that end date would surely be in some indefinitely distant\nfuture, as if LIBOR would remain available forever.\n\nEarlier this year, however, things changed, and changed significantly. Two things\nhappened which together make clear that LIBOR will no longer be available for any new\ncontracts after the end of this year, just 86 days from now. First, the United Kingdom’s\nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, and ICE Benchmark\nAdministration (IBA), which administers LIBOR, announced definitive end dates for\nLIBOR.1 No U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will be available after June 30, 2023.2\nSo, now there was a definitive and immovable date fixed for the end of LIBOR.\nHowever, the second thing that happened made clear that long before that end date in\n2023, LIBOR would not be available for any new contracts after the end of this year.\nFollowing the FCA and IBA announcements about the end of LIBOR, the Federal\nReserve and other regulators published guidance making clear that we will focus closely\non whether supervised institutions stop new use of LIBOR by the end of this year—86\ndays from now.\nIf LIBOR will not be available for new contracts, what is the point of IBA\ncontinuing to provide USD LIBOR quotes until mid-2023? Those LIBOR quotes will\nallow many existing contracts to mature according to their terms, thus greatly reducing\nthe costs and risks of this transition. Otherwise, many banks would have had to re-\nnegotiate hundreds of thousands of loan contracts before December 31, an almost\nimpossible task. But the whole process only works if no new LIBOR contracts are\nwritten while the legacy contracts are allowed to mature. So, those new LIBOR contracts\nwill not be made. Change is difficult, but it is inescapable.\n1 See https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/announcements-end-libor and\nhttps://ir.theice.com/press/news-details/2021/ICE-Benchmark-Administration-Publishes-Feedback-\nStatement-for-the-Consultation-on-Its-Intention-to-Cease-the-Publication-of-LIBOR-Settings/default.aspx.\n2 One-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors will end as of December 30, 2021. IBA will cease\npublishing all remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR rates after June 30, 2023.\n\nWhat is LIBOR, and Why is it Going Away?\nLIBOR was intended to be a measure of the average interest rate at which large\nbanks can borrow in wholesale funding markets for different periods of time, ranging\nfrom overnight to one month, three months, and beyond. LIBOR is an unsecured rate,\nwhich means that it measures interest rates for borrowings that are made without\ncollateral and therefore include some credit risk.\nAt first blush, it may seem peculiar that a borrowing rate for banks in London has\nbeen used so widely. Why, for example, are more than $1 trillion of residential\nmortgages in the United States tied to LIBOR? The answer is that, over time, LIBOR’s\npervasiveness became self-reinforcing. Lenders, borrowers, and debt issuers relied on\nLIBOR because, first, everyone else used LIBOR, and second, they could hedge their\nLIBOR exposures in liquid derivatives markets. Today, USD LIBOR is used in more\nthan $200 trillion of financial contracts worldwide.\nFederal Reserve officials have described LIBOR’s flaws on numerous occasions.3\nThe principal problem with LIBOR is that it was not what it purported to be. It claimed\nto be a measure of the cost of bank funding in the London money markets, but over time\nit became more of an arbitrary and sometimes self-interested announcement of what\nbanks simply wished to charge for funds. That might not have become such a debacle\nhad it been clear to everyone what the ground rules were, but the ground rules for LIBOR\nwere anything but clear.\nAs a result of subsequent changes to the process, LIBOR panel banks now\nprovide evidence of actual transactions where possible. A fundamental problem,\n3 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20190410a.htm,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20140904a.htm, and\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/vanderweide20210415a.htm.\n\nhowever, is that LIBOR has been unable to separate itself from its perception as a\nmeasure of bank funding costs, yet the market on which LIBOR is based—the unsecured,\nshort-term bank funding market—dwindled after the 2008 financial crisis. This means\nthat, for many LIBOR term rates, banks must estimate their likely cost of such funding\nrather than report the actual cost.\nMany LIBOR panel banks are uncomfortable estimating their funding costs in\nproducing a benchmark perceived by many to measure actual funding costs. As a result,\nthe great majority of the panel banks have determined that they will not continue\nparticipating in the process. This is why the FCA and IBA have announced definitive\nend dates for LIBOR.\nI should note here that regulators have warned about LIBOR-related risks for\nmany years. Beginning in 2013, the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council and the\ninternational Financial Stability Board, which I currently chair, expressed concern that\nthe decline in unsecured short-term funding by banks could pose serious structural risks\nfor unsecured benchmarks such as LIBOR.4 To mitigate these risks and promote a\nsmooth transition away from LIBOR, the Federal Reserve convened the Alternative\nReference Rates Committee (ARRC) in November 2014.5 As I will describe further in a\nmoment, the ARRC has worked to facilitate the transition from LIBOR to its\nrecommended alternative, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).\n4 See Financial Stability Oversight Council, 2013 Annual Report (Washington: Department of the Treasury,\n2013), https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-2013-Annual-Report.pdf. See also Financial\nStability Board, Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks (Basel, Switzerland: Financial Stability Board,\nJuly 2014), https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_140722.pdf.\n5 The ARRC’s voting members are private sector firms, but the Federal Reserve and other official sector\nentities serve as ex-officio members of the ARRC.\n\nSupervisory Efforts\nIn November 2020, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (OCC), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) sent a letter to the\nbanking organizations we regulate noting that, after 2021, the use of LIBOR in new\ntransactions would pose safety and soundness risks.6 Accordingly, we encouraged\nsupervised institutions to stop new use of LIBOR as soon as is practicable and, in any\nevent, by the end of this year. The letter also noted that new contracts entered into before\nDecember 31, 2021, should either use a reference rate other than LIBOR or have robust\nfallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate after LIBOR’s\ndiscontinuation.\nRecently, a number of institutions have asked what would qualify as “new” use of\nLIBOR after 2021. We are working with other agencies to provide additional guidance\nabout this issue. In my view, however, “new” use of LIBOR would include any\nagreement that creates additional LIBOR exposure for a supervised institution or extends\nthe term of an existing LIBOR contract.\nEarlier this year, the Federal Reserve issued another supervisory letter that\nprovided guidance concerning supervised institutions’ LIBOR transition plans.7 As the\nend of LIBOR approaches, Federal Reserve examiners have intensified their focus on\nsupervised institutions’ transition planning. In general, institutions of all sizes have\nacknowledged year-end as the stop date for new LIBOR contracts and are operationally\nprepared to offer alternative rates. However, based on data from the second quarter of\n6 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20201130a.htm.\n7 See SR 21-7, “Assessing Supervised Institutions’ Plans to Transition Away from the Use of the LIBOR,”\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2107.htm. Earlier this year, I gave a speech that\ndescribed this supervisory letter in detail. See also\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20210322a.htm.\n\n2021, we estimate that large firms used alternative rates for less than 1 percent of floating\nrate corporate loans and 8 percent of derivatives. To be ready for year-end, lenders will\nhave to pick up the pace, and our examiners expect to see supervised institutions\naccelerate their use of alternative rates.\nTransitioning to Alternative Rates\nA handful of firms have said that they may want more time to evaluate potential\nalternative rates. There is no more time, and banks will not find LIBOR available to use\nafter year-end no matter how unhappy they may be with their options to replace it. I\nwould note that the ARRC has been publishing tools to facilitate the use of SOFR for\nalmost four years.8 SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight,\ncollateralized by Treasury securities. It rests on one of the deepest and most liquid\nmarkets in the world. It is calculated transparently by the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, engendering market confidence. And it can be used for all types of transactions.\nNotably, the ARRC recently recommended SOFR term rates, which will facilitate the\ntransition from LIBOR to SOFR for market participants who wish to use a forward-\nlooking rate.9 Given the availability of SOFR, including term SOFR, there will be no\nreason for a bank to use LIBOR after 2021 while trying to find a rate it likes better.\nThis is especially true for capital markets products. As I described recently in\nremarks to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, it is critical that capital markets and\nderivatives markets transition to SOFR. Market participants have expressed nearly\nuniversal agreement that this is the right replacement rate for such products.10 The\n8 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR in April 2018.\n9 See\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Microsites/arrc/files/2021/ARRC_Press_Release_Term_SOFR.p\ndf.\n10 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/files/quarles-libor-presentation-20210611.pdf.\n\nARRC did not recommend any other rate for capital markets or derivatives, and market\nparticipants should not expect such rates to be widely available.\nLoans, however, are different from derivatives and capital markets products, and\nraise different issues. With respect to loans, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC issued\na letter last year explaining that we have not endorsed a specific replacement rate.11 We\nhave not changed that guidance. A bank may use SOFR for its loans, but it may also use\nany reference rate for its loans that the bank determines to be appropriate for its funding\nmodel and customer needs. But a bank will not find LIBOR available after year-end,\neven if it doesn’t want to use SOFR for loans and hasn’t chosen a different alternative\nreference rate. Reviewing banks’ cessation of LIBOR use after year-end will be one of\nthe highest priorities of the Fed’s bank supervisors in the coming months. If market\nparticipants do use a rate other than SOFR, they should ensure that they understand how\ntheir chosen reference rate is constructed, that they are aware of any fragilities associated\nwith that rate, and—most importantly—that they use strong fallback provisions.\nTo conclude, I emphasize that market participants should be ready to stop using\nLIBOR by the end of 2021.12 One-week and two-month USD LIBOR will end in only 12\nweeks. The remaining USD LIBOR tenors will end in mid-2023, but the LIBOR quotes\navailable from January 2022 until June 2023 will only be appropriate for legacy\ncontracts. Use of these quotes for new contracts would create safety and soundness risks\nfor counterparties and the financial system. We will supervise firms accordingly.\n11 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2025.htm.\n12 The Federal Reserve recognizes that market participants cannot fix some legacy LIBOR contracts. In\nparticular, there are approximately $10 trillion of so-called “tough” legacy contracts that mature after\nLIBOR ends, but lack workable fallback language to address the end of LIBOR. The Federal Reserve\nwelcomes efforts in Congress to craft federal legislation that would provide a workable fallback for these\ncontracts.\n\nMarket participants should act now to accelerate their transition away from\nLIBOR. The reign of LIBOR will end imminently, and it will not come back. To return\nto where we started, the year of magical thinking is over.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:00 a.m. EDT (9:00 a.m. MDT)\nJune 27, 2018\nAmerica’s Vital Interest in Global Efforts to Promote Financial Stability\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nUtah Bankers Association 110th Annual Convention\nSun Valley Inn\nSun Valley, Idaho.\nJune 27, 2018\n\nGood afternoon. It is a particular honor for me be here to address the Utah Bankers\nAssociation, which is like coming home in two ways: First, to Sun Valley, which is our\nfamily’s deeply rooted second home--my wife’s great grandfather established the first\nsawmill in the Wood River Valley near Hailey almost 150 years ago--and second, to\nUtah, the place that, like all of you, I dearly love and where I have always lived, despite a\ncareer that seems determined to keep taking me elsewhere.\nOne of those elsewheres is Washington, and as a Utahan who has spent most of\nhis career in the private sector advising and investing in the banking industry, I think I\nhave a pretty good idea of how things look, from your vantage point, when someone from\nWashington shows up to give a speech.\nSince the financial crisis, bankers have had to adjust to challenging and evolving\neconomic conditions and to many new regulations. At times, smaller and regional banks\nhave been left wondering how actions in Washington focused on systemic vulnerabilities\nand the largest institutions were relevant to how they fund their businesses and in turn\nfinance the aspirations of families, farmers, ranchers, and other entrepreneurs.\nI’ll start today by trying to address those questions and provide a brief update on\nsteps the Congress and the Federal Reserve are taking related to financial regulation. A\ndecade after the crisis, implementation of the major post-crisis reforms is largely\ncomplete, and we have entered a new phase that is aimed at reviewing and improving\nregulations to ensure that they are achieving their aims in the most effective and efficient\nmanner. I will explain more about that approach, and, relevant to your businesses, efforts\nto tailor regulation so it is appropriate for the size and business model of different\ninstitutions. I will also briefly describe pending regulatory changes passed last month by\n\n- 2 -\nCongress, which I believe will further tailor regulations for banks, with particular benefit\nto community and regional banks.\nBut I want to devote much of my time today to a broader message about the\nconnection between these improvements in post-crisis regulation and the fundamental\npurpose of those regulations: to do what must be done to protect our economy from\nanother severe financial crisis. Banks of all sizes have a shared interest in ensuring that\nregulation is efficient and appropriately tailored to promote a strong, fair, and competitive\nmarket for financial services. Likewise, banks have a shared interest in ensuring that\nregulation overall promotes a strong and stable financial system that keeps credit flowing\nto households and businesses in the communities you serve.\nAmong the truths revealed by the financial crisis, one of the most important was\nthe recognition that the vulnerabilities that had developed in the financial system were\nglobal in nature and that the problems our institutions and markets faced in the United\nStates were inextricably connected to conditions and decisions outside our borders.\nOther governments likewise found that problems in the United States spilled over to their\nfinancial systems and economies. To cite just one example, it is well known now that the\nrapid growth of securitization of residential mortgages in the United States was a\nprominent factor driving up home lending and driving down lending standards. I think it\nis not as well known that a large share of those securities were being created, traded, and\nheld by entities outside the United States.\nSome of the most important steps taken since the crisis to make our financial\nsystem more resilient have involved collecting information, identifying and monitoring\n\n- 3 -\nstresses in the global financial system, and establishing and raising international\nstandards.\nAs I have noted, the improvements the Federal Reserve is making to financial\nregulation here in America, including tailoring, will help level the playing field for banks\nand help ensure you are able to continue to compete and serve your customers. The\nbenefits of this for Utah banks are clear. But banks in Utah and elsewhere also benefit\nfrom a strong and stable global financial system, and as history has demonstrated, this in\nturn depends on strong international standards that help level the playing field. A strong\nand stable financial system depends also on transparency that helps both the private\nsector and regulators detect and deter vulnerabilities that could harm the U.S. economy.\nSo I’d also like to talk to you today about one of the important international\nbodies created since the crisis to promote global financial stability, the Financial Stability\nBoard (FSB) and tell you why I believe America’s active participation in the FSB is\nimportant to our nation, and even, as remote as it might seem, relevant to your\nbusinesses.\nBut let me begin with a topic of more immediate interest and offer a brief\noverview of legislation and regulatory action by the Federal Reserve that I know is\nimportant to you and your institutions. First, a little context: like our economy, the\ncondition of the U.S. banking industry is strong. First quarter profits for all banks hit a\nnew record of $56 billion. Banks are well capitalized and positioned to increase lending\nto finance investment in a strengthening economy. Community banks are also doing\nwell. According to Federal Reserve data on more than 5,000 community-based holding\ncompanies, community banks reported net income of $20.6 billion during 2017, up\n\n- 4 -\n4 percent from the year before. Like larger banks more recently, this result was the\nproduct of particularly strong loan activity, with recent year-over-year loan growth of\n7.7 percent, which was substantially above the increase last year in the banking industry\nas a whole.\nTurning to recent regulatory developments, the big news, of course, is the\nEconomic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act sponsored by Senator\nCrapo, passed by Congress at the end of May and signed by the President. Before I get to\nthat, let me briefly mention some things the Federal Reserve and other agencies have\ndone--in some cases presaging steps taken in the new legislation--to reduce the regulatory\nburden on community and regional banks.\nOne supervisory improvement is a Federal Reserve program called Bank Exams\nTailored to Risk, or the BETR program. It uses financial metrics to differentiate the level\nof risk between banks before examinations and assist examiners in tailoring examination\nprocedures to minimize the regulatory burden for firms that engage in low-risk activities,\nwhile subjecting higher-risk activities to more testing and review. Another initiative has\nbeen to shift a significant amount of the Federal Reserve’s examination activity offsite.\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve, along with other agencies, took action to\nsimplify the reporting responsibilities of smaller banks with a new streamlined Call\nReport form in 2017. Based on feedback from community banks, we and other regulators\nalso increased the threshold for requiring an appraisal on commercial real estate loans\nfrom $250,000 to $500,000. Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve is developing a revised\napproach to determining “control” under the Bank Holding Company Act that could help\nbanks raise capital and facilitate nonbank investments.\n\n- 5 -\nI will now discuss the new law, which preserves the most important post-crisis\nreforms for the largest firms while directing the Federal Reserve and other agencies to\nmake numerous changes that should reduce the regulatory burden for community and\nregional banks. On the Volcker rule, the legislation calls for exempting the vast majority\nof banks with $10 billion or less in assets from reporting requirements, which the Federal\nReserve supported, due to the lack of trading activity that community banks engage in.\nThis overtook efforts by the Fed and other regulatory agencies to refine the Volcker rule,\nbut the bottom line is that this broad exemption is law and in the process of being\nimplemented.\nAnother change in the new legislation raises the asset threshold for bank holding\ncompanies eligible for the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from\n$1 billion to $3 billion. The law also exempts bank holding companies with $50 billion\nto $100 billion in assets from enhanced prudential standards and exempts banks with less\nthan $100 billion in assets from future stress testing. The lifting of this threshold\nimportantly allows the Federal Reserve to tailor its rules for these firms moving forward\nwhile retaining the ability to protect the safety and soundness of the system.\nI mentioned steps related to Call Report streamlining, and the legislation\naddresses this topic also, allowing reduced Call Report requirements for certain banks\nwith less than $5 billion in assets. For banks that are well managed and well-capitalized,\nthe asset threshold was raised for a longer, 18-month examination cycle from $1 billion\nto $3 billion. The legislation would also exempt from an appraisal requirement rural\nproperties for loans of less than $400,000, under certain circumstances.\n\n- 6 -\nA common theme in the legislation and the Fed’s steps to improve our regulation\nand supervision is tailoring. As the Fed continues to evaluate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of regulations, I expect tailoring will be a guiding principle.\nLet me now address international efforts to promote financial stability,\nspecifically those centered in the Financial Stability Board.\nIn the run-up to the crisis, as I’m sure you all know, decades of relative stability in\nthe United States had left both the financial industry and government agencies\ncomplacent about potential threats. And even though financial crises had occurred during\nthat time in some advanced economies, it is fair to say that the United States and other\nnations did not place a high probability on a crisis that could be global in nature. As a\nresult, international coordination and collaboration on financial stability was limited, and\nthere was a shortage of detailed and standardized information about financial conditions\nand vulnerabilities in different countries.\nAs the crisis descended and the global nature of the problems became clear, the\nUnited States and other major economies, working through the Group of Twenty nations,\ncreated the Financial Stability Board to coordinate their efforts to stabilize the global\nfinancial system, reform international financial regulation, and share information.1 The\nFSB includes central banks, finance ministries and regulators from 24 nations, the\nEuropean Union, and also international organizations such as the International Monetary\nFund and important global financial standard-setting bodies. Unlike other global\norganizations, the FSB includes multiple agencies from each government in recognition\nof the fact that financial stability is a responsibility shared across many parts of any\n1 The FSB was created in April 2009 and was the successor of a less-formal group known as the Financial\nStability Forum. See www.fsb.org/about/.\n\n- 7 -\ngovernment. From the United States, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury Department,\nand the Securities and Exchange Commission are members.\nSome of you may reasonably be wondering, at this point of the speech, how we\ngot from rural appraisals in Utah to the Financial Stability Board in Switzerland. How\nare the conditions in 2008 and 2009 that led to creation of the FSB relevant to community\nbanking? Let us remind ourselves how that global financial crisis and ensuing recession\nlooked to communities in Utah and the bankers who serve them.\nCommunity banks, as we all know, engaged in little of the risky activity that was\nthe basis of the crisis. But few community banks, I think, were unaffected by the\ncompetitive forces that were unleashed in the years leading up to 2008. When short-term\nwholesale funding froze up, and securitizing loans became impossible, and Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac effectively failed, community banks were affected. And when your\ncustomers were hit hard by the crisis, community banks were affected too. In two years,\nfrom 2007 to 2009, the unemployment rate in Utah more than tripled. As it usually does,\nUtah weathered the Great Recession better than most places, but it was still the toughest\neconomic times our state has faced in many decades, and of course, this profoundly\naffected banks and their customers.\nWhile that was occurring, the Federal Reserve and governments in other countries\naffected by the crisis were tackling several challenges in trying to strengthen financial\nregulation and oversight. One fundamental problem was information, specifically the\nlack of information about risks and vulnerabilities both within and across jurisdictions.\nThe Federal Reserve and other U.S. agencies had some tools to help assess prudential\nrisks for U.S.-based firms when the crisis hit. Information sharing about systemic\n\n- 8 -\nfinancial vulnerabilities was more limited, particularly for conditions outside the United\nStates. For one, we did not understand the importance of some financial vulnerabilities\nor had only limited information on them, such as interconnectedness across financial\nfirms, and therefore we were unable to share information. We also failed to appreciate\nthe ways in which the shadow banking system that had grown up outside the institutions\nwe oversaw had become interconnected with those institutions. The existing global\nforums for discussion of these issues were considered less important or were focused on\njust one financial sector, and membership was often limited to a handful of industrial\ncountries. We now understand the importance of taking a global view on financial\nvulnerabilities, and we are learning from each other about how to fill the gaps in\nunderstanding and data that exist.\nAn additional challenge that the United States faced, in responding to the crisis\nand establishing more effective oversight and higher standards was the inability to\nenforce such rules in a global financial system without common, more uniform standards.\nIf some of the activities threatening financial stability occurred outside the United States\nand in jurisdictions with lower standards, raising standards in the United States would be\nboth ineffective in fully stabilizing the financial system, and could put U.S. firms at a\ncompetitive disadvantage, which would be only an added disincentive to embrace\neffective standards.\nEvery nation, of course, seeking to make its financial system more resilient faced\nthese same challenges and disincentives, an example of the problem of collective action\nthat points nations toward international cooperation.\n\n- 9 -\nIf the FSB had been in place before the crisis and working on identifying and\nassessing vulnerabilities to financial stability, that may have allowed us to take action at\nan earlier stage, frame our response with more information, and possibly mitigate some\nof the devastating consequences. I can attest to the FSB’s improvement over the pre-\ncrisis discussions that took place internationally because during the first Bush\nAdministration I was a delegate to the informal and more limited group that preceded the\nFSB.\nAn important part of the FSB’s work is to endorse minimum standards in different\nareas; for example, identifying the key attributes of effective resolution planning for\nsystemically important firms. In addition, the FSB is in the early stages of some critical\nwork that examines the effects that reforms and standards are having. Are they doing\nwhat we intended them to do? Have there been unintended consequences? Can we make\nthe reforms more efficient; that is can we achieve the same effects while lowering the\nburden on institutions and supervisors?\nOnce again, you might be wondering why something like resolution regime-\nplanning should matter to community bankers. You might be hoping that I get back to\nthe good news I delivered earlier, about steps being taken in Washington to tailor\nregulation and reduce the regulatory burden on community banks. But, of course, these\nare two sides of the same coin. Appropriately reducing the regulatory burden for\ncommunity banks is possible when we can get an accurate picture of the risks and\nvulnerabilities in the broader financial system, which Utah’s banks are part of and depend\non. Tailoring does not mean abandoning our responsibility to promote a stable financial\nsystem, but embracing it, assisted by FSB efforts to ensure that reforms are having the\n\n- 10 -\nintended effects and supported by the global standards that the FSB and other\ninternational standard-setting bodies are able to establish and promote.\nIn closing, I want to address an issue relevant to any international organization,\nwhich is sovereignty. More specifically, we sometimes hear concerns that international\nbodies such as the FSB threaten our sovereignty by imposing rules on the United States,\nwhich would be a concern.\nLet me be clear: the FSB has no enforcement powers, no legal authority to\ncommand its members to do anything, and not even authority, as in some international\norganizations, to induce action based on contractual obligations. The FSB does not\nimpose obligations, it addresses problems--problems that are of great importance to the\nUnited States and which, because of the global nature of the financial system, we cannot\naddress alone. The United States and other governments created the FSB and participate\nin it because it is in our national interests to do so, and that is really the basis of its\neffectiveness. The United States is not weaker or less independent by participating in the\nFSB or other standard-setting bodies. On the contrary, when rightly structured our\nparticipation in these groups makes our financial system significantly stronger by\nensuring that the U.S. perspective is part of the discussions and reflected in standards\nagreed to. Our consumers and businesses are more secure and prosperous because the\nFSB helps make sure that all countries are doing their share in promoting financial\nstability and not gaining an unfair advantage.\nLike some other effective organizations, a source of the FSB’s power is that it\nfunctions by consensus. That can make reaching decisions more difficult, but it also\nyields decisions that can be truly effective solutions because all participants feel a stake\n\n- 11 -\nin them. It is useful when the credibility and commitment of the decisions are especially\nimportant, such as when my Fed colleagues and I set monetary policy. At the FSB,\nrelying on consensus helps 68 agencies and other members from two dozen countries\nwith different perspectives and agendas come together around our shared interest in a\nstable global financial system. International negotiations and standard-setting is not the\nbest approach to all problems, but in my past experience as a Treasury Department\nofficial, it is often the best way to tackle problems that are global in scope.\nBy actively participating in the FSB and engaging with its members at a high\nlevel, the United States is supporting high international standards that are equal to those\nin the United States. Our standards will be most effective when other major economies\nembrace them in a consistent manner. The goal is to limit the risks of another financial\ncrisis and do what we can to promote prosperity and a bright future for the people you\nserve so faithfully in the great state of Utah.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:15 a.m. EST (2:15 p.m. local time)\nFebruary 22, 2018\nThe U.S. Economy after the Global Financial Crisis\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chairman\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“10 Years after the Global Financial Crisis:\nHow Has the World Economy Changed and Where Will It Go?”\n26th International Financial Symposium\nsponsored by the Institute for International Monetary Affairs\nTokyo, Japan\nFebruary 22, 2018\n\nI am very happy to be participating in this symposium on taking stock of the\nglobal economy a decade after the Global Financial Crisis, and I thank Hiroshi Watanabe\nfor the invitation.1 I have been asked to provide an overview of the U.S. economy since\nthe advent of the crisis in no longer than 10 minutes, so I could either talk very quickly or\nfocus my comments on more recent developments, perhaps throwing in a bit of historical\ncontext when appropriate.\nTo cut to the bottom line, the U.S. economy appears to be performing very well\nand, certainly, is in the best shape that it has been in since the crisis and, by many\nmetrics, since well before the crisis. Recent volatility in equity markets is a reminder that\nasset prices can move rapidly and unexpectedly. However, it is my assessment that the\nunderlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy are sound and much improved relative to\nearlier in the decade.\nOne easy and important place to see that improvement is in the labor market.\nAfter peaking at 10 percent in October 2009, the unemployment rate fell rather steadily to\n4.1 percent in January--the lowest level, outside of a period from 1999 to 2000, since the\n1960s. Job gains in recent months have continued at a pace that would be pushing the\nunemployment rate even lower if the labor participation rate had not stabilized in recent\nyears, a welcome development and a sign that the strength of the labor market is pulling\nin or retaining workers who might otherwise be on the sidelines. Broader measures of\nlabor market slack--for example, those that include individuals who are out of the labor\nforce but say they want a job as well as those working with a part-time job but who\nwould like to work full time--have largely returned to pre-crisis levels.\n1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nWhile the labor market has shown steady improvement over the past decade, the\npost-crisis performance of gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been more\ndisappointing, averaging just 2 percent per year over the past seven years. However,\nbeginning with the second quarter of last year, growth has shown some momentum. Over\nthe past three quarters of 2017, real GDP increased at an average rate of almost 3 percent.\nWhile headline growth stepped back a bit in the fourth quarter, largely on account of\nincreased drag from higher imports and lower inventories, underlying final private\ndomestic demand--which is a better indicator of economic momentum--grew at its fastest\npace in more than three years.\nRecent survey data reveal a growing sense of economic optimism. Consumer\nconfidence has returned to pre-crisis levels. Business optimism is also apparent in survey\ndata as well as in the strength of investment. In 2017, investment in capital equipment\nincreased at the fastest pace since 2011, accelerating through the year to a double-digit\nrate in the second half. It might be early, but it is possible that the investment drought\nthat has afflicted the U.S. economy for the past five years may finally be breaking.\nThe tax and fiscal packages passed in recent months could help sustain the\neconomy’s momentum in part by increasing demand, and also possibly by boosting the\npotential capacity of the economy by encouraging investment and supporting labor force\nparticipation.\nWhile the recent performance of the economy has been solid relative to much of\nthe pre-crisis period, one area that continues to lag is productivity growth, a condition\nthat has been common across the advanced economies. Beginning in 2011, the annual\ngrowth rate of labor productivity has averaged only 3/4 percent, compared with an\n\n- 3 -\naverage 2-1/4 percent pace in the two decades leading up to the financial crisis. Why\nproductivity growth has been so weak defies easy explanation. The weak pace of\nbusiness investment is likely part of the story. In addition, some have argued that there\nhas been a decline in business dynamism following the crisis; others do not link the\nslowdown to the crisis but rather to an exogenous slowdown in the rate of technological\nprogress; and still others believe that productivity growth has not really slowed much at\nall and, instead, is just not being measured correctly in the official statistics. Regardless,\ngiven the importance of productivity growth for the long-run potential of the economy\nand living standards, it is vitally important that policymakers pursue policies aimed at\nboosting the growth rate of productivity.\nAnother aspect of the economy that has attracted a lot of attention is the apparent\nlow level of inflation despite the tightness in labor markets. The 12-month increase in\nheadline PCE prices was 1.7 percent in December, a touch below the Fed’s 2 percent\nobjective. After assessing the recent data, my take is that the current shortfall in inflation\nfrom target as most likely due to transitory factors that will fade through 2018, pushing\ninflation back up to target. Suffice to say, a deviation from our target of a few tenths of\n1 percentage point, especially one I expect to fade, does not cause me great concern.\nAgainst this economic backdrop, with a strong labor market and likely only\ntemporary softness in inflation, I view it as appropriate that monetary policy should\ncontinue to be gradually normalized. An important component of this normalization was\ninitiated in October, when we started to gradually scale back our reinvestment of\nproceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency\nsecurities.\n\n- 4 -\nWith the balance sheet normalization plan set to remain on autopilot, barring a\nmaterial deterioration in the economic outlook, the federal funds rate remains our primary\ntool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. At our January meeting, the Federal\nOpen Market Committee decided to maintain its target range for the federal funds rate\nbetween 1-1/4 percent and 1-1/2 percent.2 In this range, monetary policy remains\naccommodative. I anticipate further gradual increases in the policy rate will be\nappropriate to both sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2\npercent objective. Of course, it should go without saying that I will keep a close eye on\neconomic indicators--and their implications for the outlook for inflation and real\nactivity--and adjust my views on appropriate monetary policy accordingly.\nI would like to wrap up with a word on the financial sector. The Federal Reserve\nand our colleagues at other agencies have now spent the better part of the past decade\nbuilding out and standing up the post-crisis regulatory regime. At this point, we have\ncompleted the bulk of the work of post-crisis regulation. As such, now is an eminently\nnatural and expected time to step back and assess those efforts. It is our responsibility to\nensure that they are working as intended, and--given the breadth and complexity of this\nnew body of regulation--it is inevitable that we will be able to improve them, especially\nwith the benefit of experience and hindsight.\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, January 31,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180131a.htm.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n3:00 p.m. EDT (12:00 p.m. PDT)\nOctober 14, 2020\nRemarks at the Hoover Institution\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Hoover Institution\nStanford, California\n(via webcast)\nOctober 14, 2020\n\nI want to thank John Taylor and the Hoover Institution for inviting me to speak today. I\nwill start with some brief remarks about the current economic situation and monetary policy and\nthen turn to the actions that the Federal Reserve has taken this year to help ensure that the\nbanking system remains a source of strength during the recovery from the COVID event, the\nterm I use for the complex set of responses in both the private and public sectors to the outbreak\nof COVID-19. I will close with some thoughts on nonbank financial institutions and\ninternational coordination.\nAlthough the COVID event put the U.S. economy in a deep hole, the recovery since the\neconomy began reopening in May has been stronger than almost any forecaster predicted back in\nthe spring. Spurred in part by record fiscal stimulus, both business and household spending\nappear to have bounced back significantly through the third quarter, and we have regained about\nhalf of the jobs lost in March and April.\nI attribute a good portion of that strength to the inherent dynamism and flexibility of the\nAmerican economy. Although the COVID event continues to stress businesses, many businesses\nadjusted their operations to remain open, and applications for new businesses surged over the\nsummer. Meanwhile, better treatments and more-targeted containment measures focused on\nprotecting the most vulnerable have resulted in falling rates of hospitalization and mortality.\nTherefore, I am optimistic that the recovery from the COVID event will continue to be robust.\nOf course, while we’re doing better than expected, we still have a ways to go. The labor\nmarket remains deeply depressed, and employment is far short of the Federal Reserve’s\nmaximum employment goal. We are also keenly aware that the harm from higher\nunemployment has fallen even more than usual on those low-income households least able to\nbear it. Some businesses, particularly those in high-contact and personal-service industries,\n\n- 2 -\nlargely have been left out of the recovery. Inflation is well below our 2 percent longer-run goal,\nand some measures of inflation expectations have ticked down.\nTherefore, at the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, I voted\nin favor of the new and clearer forward guidance for monetary policy because it will provide\nadditional support for the recovery.1 Indeed, interest-rate and credit-sensitive sectors—business\nspending, home sales, auto sales, and other “big-ticket” items—have helped fuel that recovery.\nThis spending was supported by our timely and forceful moves to cut the federal funds rate to its\neffective lower bound, restore market functioning, and provide emergency support to households\nand businesses through 13(3) emergency lending facilities.\nWhich leads me to the banking industry. For monetary policy to fully support Main\nStreet, we need a well-capitalized, stable banking system that is lending to creditworthy\nhouseholds and businesses. Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the Federal Reserve has\nfocused on building the resiliency of banks so that they would be a source of strength during the\nnext downturn. Thus far, that plan has borne a great deal of fruit.\nAs the crisis intensified in early March, banks stepped into the breach and met the\nmassive demands for cash from businesses that drew on their preexisting credit lines. Banks also\nfunded the bulk of the more than $500 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.\nAccording to our weekly bank credit data, commercial and industrial loans increased $715\nbillion between the week of February 26th and their peak on May 13th.2 For millions of\nstruggling households, banks have agreed to forbear interest and principal payments on their\nloans. In addition, through September, banks absorbed more than $1.2 trillion of central bank\n1 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release,\nSeptember 16, 2020, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200916a.htm.\n2 “Assets and Liabilities of Commercial Banks in the United States - H.8,” last modified October 9, 2020,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/.\n\n- 3 -\nreserves and received about $2.5 trillion of core deposits from investors who sought the safe\nhaven of the U.S. dollar and insured bank accounts.\nAs supervisors, we recognized that these actions strained the balance-sheet capacity of\nbanks and so have taken a number of steps to allow them to continue to support their customers\nduring this unprecedented time. A number of those steps—such as encouraging banks to work\nwith their customers until the emergency subsides—are consistent with what we do whenever\nthere is a natural disaster that disrupts normal commerce. But the COVID event has affected the\nentire country at the same time, requiring a broad set of extraordinary actions. For instance, we\nhave temporarily exempted reserves and Treasury securities from the Supplementary Leverage\nRatio so that banks do not become constrained by growing Treasury issuance and central bank\nreserves and can support businesses and households.3 More broadly, we have reintroduced and\nadded numerous funding facilities through our 13(3) authority to support the continued flow of\ncredit in the economy.4\nThroughout all this, U.S. banks have remained financially healthy. Second-quarter data\nshowed that most banks were profitable, aggregate capital ratios increased, and banks continued\nto maintain ample levels of liquidity. In addition, banks added substantially to their loan loss\nreserves over the first half of 2020, providing additional resilience. This week, some of the\nlargest institutions have begun to report that their profitability held up again in the third quarter,\npartly because their robust provisions for loan losses earlier this year limited the need for\nadditional provisions this quarter.\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces Temporary Change to Its\nSupplementary Leverage Ratio Rule to Ease Strains in the Treasury Market Resulting from the Coronavirus and\nIncrease Banking Organizations’ Ability to Provide Credit to Households and Businesses,” press release, April 1,\n2020, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200401a.htm.\n4 “Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, last modified, April\n30, 2020, https://www.federalreserve.gov/funding-credit-liquidity-and-loan-facilities.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nGoing forward, we will want to be sure that banks remain a source of strength and\nsupport for the economy. Even with the economic recovery being stronger and faster than\nexpected, there are certainly reasons to be vigilant. Interest rates are likely to remain very low\nfor quite some time, putting downward pressure on banks’ net interest margins and their\nprofitability more generally. The high level of corporate debt and elevated valuations in\ncommercial real estate going into this crisis, combined with prolonged uncertainties and changes\nin the way we shop and work, could lead to higher-than-expected losses on loans to some of\nthese businesses. Consumer lending and residential mortgages seem to be holding up well so far,\nwhich may reflect the relatively high quality of household credit going into the COVID event.\nHowever, the performance of these loans also needs to be watched closely in light of the\nforbearance policymakers have encouraged and the possibility of a reduction in fiscal support for\nhouseholds.\nFor the past decade, robust stress testing has been at the core of our strategy for ensuring\nthat our largest banks have sufficient capital to meet the credit needs of their customers while\nweathering an extreme downturn. In making decisions about our stress tests this year, I have\nbeen guided by three principles: First, we want to make sure that our supervisory and regulatory\nactions do not exacerbate the fallout from what was the most extreme deterioration in economic\nconditions on record. Second, we want to jealously guard the credibility of our stress tests,\nwhich restored confidence in banks during the GFC and have helped maintain that confidence\nsince. Third, we want to establish the precedent that our response to a crisis would remain as\ndeliberate, data driven, and bank specific as could be done prudently.\nTherefore, once it was apparent that our initial stress test scenarios for 2020—which were\nreleased before the pandemic—had been overtaken by events, we conducted a suite of additional\n\n- 5 -\nanalyses to assess the sensitivity of this year’s results.5 This comprehensive analysis included\nconsideration of banks’ vulnerabilities under three additional downside scenarios that were very\nsevere even given how gloomy the picture looked this spring. The staff also incorporated a\nnumber of conservative assumptions about the balance sheet changes that we saw at the end of\nthe first quarter.\nThis analysis found that the banking system would experience substantial losses under\nthose highly adverse conditions but remain well capitalized in the aggregate. However,\nindividual bank outcomes across the three scenarios varied significantly. The variation in those\noutcomes highlighted the considerable uncertainty in the economic outlook at the time and how\nthat would translate to banking conditions in coming quarters.\nAccordingly, we required banks to resubmit their capital plans and took several actions to\npreserve capital in the interim. For the third quarter, the Board required large banks to suspend\nall stock repurchases, capped their dividends, and placed a second limit based on individual\nbanks earnings. The limitation of share repurchases, which accounted for 70 percent of all\ncapital distributions at large banks in recent years, by itself led to a meaningful preservation of\ncapital among large banks. The dividend restrictions guarded against capital depletion in the\nevent that some banks experienced unexpectedly large losses, while still allowing firms that\ncould support them to pay out dividends. Late last month, the Board extended the distribution\nlimitations onto the fourth quarter amid the continued uncertainty. The Federal Reserve is\ncurrently conducting another round of stress tests, using two new severe downside scenarios\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Assessment of Bank Capital during the Recent Coronavirus\nEvent (Washington: Board of Governors, June 2020), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2020-\nsensitivity-analysis-20200625.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\npublished last month, and will release bank-specific results from both scenarios before the end of\nthe year.6\nTaken together, these actions will preserve capital in the system during this highly\nuncertain time. As I noted, I also hope that the process we followed to arrive at these decisions\nwill affirm that our actions, even in a crisis, will be dictated by the most comprehensive analysis\nwe can do in a timely manner and will be as tailored to individual institutions’ condition as is\nfeasible given the circumstances.\nWhile banks so far have been resilient to the shock from the COVID event, the same\ncannot be said for important parts of the system of nonbank financial intermediation (NBFI).\nStarting in March, Federal Reserve facilities were needed to contain pressures in some prime\nmoney market funds, as well as, to a lesser extent, in certain long-term mutual funds that invest\nin corporate debt. Other types of NBFI also struggled during that period, including nonbank\nmortgage servicers and real estate investment trusts, the latter of which received support from the\nBoard’s decision to, for the first time, purchase agency commercial mortgage–backed securities.7\nThe vulnerabilities of NBFI are also at the top of the mind of international regulators.\nThe Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) annual report on NBFI indicates that the NBFI sector is\nnow almost 50 percent of total financial intermediation, and many NBFIs rely on the banking\nsystem for credit and backstop liquidity.8 Thus, late last year, I formed a high-level steering\ngroup of central bankers, market regulators, and international organizations to oversee the FSB\n6 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervisory Scenarios for the Resubmission of Capital Plans\nin the Fourth Quarter of 2020 (Washington: Board of Governors, September 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-september-supervisory-scenarios.htm.\n7 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement,” press release,\nMarch 23, 2020, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200323a.htm.\n8 Financial Stability Board. “FSB Publishes Annual Report on Nonbank Financial Intermediation,” press release,\nJanuary 19, 2020, https://www.fsb.org/2020/01/global-monitoring-report-on-non-bank-financial-intermediation-\n2019/.\n\n- 7 -\nwork on nonbank finance and to help coordinate work across the range of global standard setting\nbodies that oversee the financial sector. The group is currently completing a holistic review of\nthe COVID event to better understand the role that vulnerabilities stemming from the NBFI\nsector played in those events. In the wake of the COVID event, we have made good progress in\narriving at a shared diagnosis of the market turmoil that happened during the onset of the event\nin March.\nOur discussions have surfaced a number of issues associated with particular types of\nmarket participants and mechanisms that may have caused liquidity imbalances and propagated\nstress. They include: vulnerabilities in money market funds (as I discussed earlier); dealers’\ncapacity and willingness to intermediate; market structure in the core government bond markets\nand, potentially, the role of leveraged investors; and fragilities in US dollar cross-border funding.\nWe are looking at the role that each of these factors may have played, but we are not yet\nprepared to say “J’accuse” to any one of them. This is because our work has also reinforced the\npoint that one needs to examine the system as a whole and take into account the various linkages\nwithin nonbank financial intermediation and between nonbanks and banks.\nWe will provide to the G20 Summit next month our holistic review of the turmoil and a\nconcrete set of proposals for follow-up work on NBFI. This will provide a basis for a work plan\nfor 2021, focused on better understanding this critical sector, vulnerabilities related to it, and\nhow we might take a more macroprudential approach to supervising and regulating at least some\nparts of this sector.\nThanks again to the Hoover Institution for having me, and I look forward to the\ndiscussion that follows.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n3:15 p.m. EST\nFebruary 26, 2018\nAn Assessment of the U.S. Economy\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Promoting Sustained Growth: Policy Tensions and Risks”\n34th Annual NABE Economic Policy Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nFebruary 26, 2018\n\nThank you for the opportunity to take part in this important and influential\nconference.1 I would like to discuss my view of current economic conditions in the\nUnited States, provide an assessment of the sustainability of the current momentum in the\neconomy, and then conclude with a look at some of the potential implications that would\nfollow from a sustained upturn in economic growth. To preview my conclusions, I am\nfairly optimistic about the current state of the economy. Along many dimensions, it has\nbeen quite some time since the economic environment has looked as favorable as it does\nnow. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth through the final three quarters of 2017\naveraged almost 3 percent, a considerable step-up over the 2 percent average annual pace\nrecorded over the previous eight years. The sustainability of the recent upturn in growth\nwill depend importantly on whether some of the factors that have been holding back\ngrowth for the past decade diminish, including weak investment and productivity. In\nsome cases, I believe the data look encouraging--for example, the recent strength of\ninvestment--but in others, less so, particularly the continued softness of productivity\ngrowth. On balance, I am cautious, but I am also optimistic enough to believe that the\nfactors that have been holding back growth need not be permanent and could turn, even\nfairly rapidly.\nWhat would be the likely consequences if growth were to shift up on a sustained\nbasis? Here I think it will be important to consider and observe the form that higher\ngrowth takes. In particular, it matters whether growth is embodied in a sustained increase\nin the productive capacity of the economy or, instead, is primarily the product of a boost\nto aggregate demand. The split between the two will likely have important implications\n1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nfor inflation and thus for how the stance of monetary policy will respond to higher\ngrowth. The Federal Reserve will, as always, seek to achieve its dual mandate of\nmaximum employment and stable prices.\nThe Economy Appears to Be in a Good Spot\nI will start with an assessment of current economic conditions. In my view, the\neconomy appears to be in a good spot right now. This favorable position is particularly\nevident in the labor market. After peaking at 10 percent in October 2009, the\nunemployment rate has declined to 4.1 percent, its lowest level since the 1960s outside of\na brief period from 1999 to 2000. With the unemployment rate below most estimates of\nits natural rate, wages appear to have accelerated a little of late after a period of relatively\nmuted increases, and I expect a further modest step-up in the pace of wage gains.\nAnother welcome development has been a break in recent years in the two-decade-long\ntrend decline in the labor force participation rate.\nThe robust job market has likely spilled over to other aspects of the economy.\nConsumer confidence has returned to pre-crisis levels, which, together with solid income\ngains and rising household wealth, has supported strong growth in consumption\nexpenditures. Likewise, surveys reveal increased business optimism, also evident in an\nacceleration in investment spending. Real expenditures on capital equipment increased at\na double-digit pace in the second half of last year, providing early hope that the\ninvestment drought that has weighed on growth in recent years might finally be breaking.\nThe recent upturn in growth has not been confined to the United States. In its\nlatest projection, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts global growth to run\nclose to 4 percent in 2018, the fastest pace since the immediate post-crisis rebound in\n\n- 3 -\n2010 and 2011.2 Even more notable is that the IMF has revised up global growth in its\nrecent projections. These upgrades follow a prolonged period of depressingly regular\nserial downgrades in the IMF’s outlook as the post-crisis recovery dragged on longer than\nmany commentators and forecasters had anticipated. Stronger foreign growth has in turn\nsupported U.S. growth, with exports in 2017 growing at the fastest pace in four years.\nInflation has run at a low and relatively stable rate throughout the crisis and the\nrecovery. Recently, the low level of inflation has attracted considerable attention, as it\ncontinues to run on the soft side notwithstanding the apparent tightness of the labor\nmarket. Headline PCE (personal consumption expenditures) prices increased 1.7 percent\nin the 12 months ending in December, a few tenths of 1 percentage point below the\nFederal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.\nThat inflation has remained low even as activity has picked up and the labor market has\ntightened has led a number of commentators to question the relevance of the Phillips\ncurve analytical framework that ties inflation to the strength of the economy.\nIn my view, it is premature to write off the Phillips curve. Indeed, I think it is\nlikely that tightness in labor markets will eventually show up in wages and prices. I tend\nto agree with the view that the recent softness of inflation mostly reflects idiosyncratic\nand transitory factors, and I expect inflation to move back to 2 percent over the next year\nor so. Overall, I would characterize the recent weakness of inflation as something that\nshould be expected to fade rather than as an enduring mystery that necessitates a change\nin our framework for assessing inflation.\n2 The IMF’s most recent forecast was released in January and is available on its website at\nhttps://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2018/01/11/world-economic-outlook-update-january-\n2018.\n\n- 4 -\nTo review, all in all, the state of the economy is good. The question now is how\npersistent this step-up in growth will prove to be. In the FOMC’s most recent Summary\nof Economic Projections, released in December, growth was expected to remain fairly\nsolid in 2018 before moving down toward a longer-run rate of 1-3/4 percent.3 I do not\nview this forecast as particularly optimistic, but it is as reasonable as any other if one\nconjectures that the factors that have held back growth in recent years will remain in\neffect. But now that the economy is coming off several quarters of relatively robust\ngrowth, I would like to examine the appropriate level of confidence in this conjecture\nand, in particular, identify what we might look for if, in actuality, some of the factors that\nhave held back growth over the past decade begin to dissipate. Before doing so, let me\nfirst quickly review some of the most frequently cited explanations for the slow pace of\ngrowth in the post-crisis period.\nWhy Has Growth Been So Slow through Much of the Post-crisis Period?\nWhy has growth been so slow over much of the past decade? I will break down\nthe explanations into two broad categories: those related to the lingering after-effects of\nthe crisis--for example, increased uncertainty and precaution--and those that are more\nstructural and less clearly linked to the crisis, such as demographics and low productivity\ngrowth.\nIt is certainly true--as pointed out most notably by Reinhart and Rogoff in 2009--\nthat recoveries from severe financial crises can be very prolonged and painful.4 In the\n3 The most recent Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the December 2017\nFOMC meeting, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20171213ep.htm.\n4 Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) document the lasting effect that downturns related to a financial crisis can\nhave on economic growth.\n\n- 5 -\naftermath of the most recent crisis, an increase in consumer caution, along with a\ntightening of credit conditions, helped boost saving, leading to a necessary deleveraging\nof households, but at the expense of consumption growth. As I mentioned earlier,\ninvestment has also been noticeably weak in recent years, likely reflecting increased\nrestraint on the part of businesses unsure of the outlook for demand and their profits.\nAnother factor holding back U.S. growth has been repeated shocks to the global\neconomy, sometimes amplified by vulnerabilities growing out of the crisis. The effects\nof a number of these shocks have spilled over to the United States, including those\nstemming from the euro-area debt crisis as well as occasional concerns about the strength\nand durability of emerging market growth, especially in China. These foreign\ndevelopments contributed to a 15 percent appreciation of the broad dollar since mid-\n2014, which, along with weak foreign economic activity, weighed on U.S. export growth.\nConcern over the strength of foreign demand also contributed to a steep decline in the\nprice of oil at around the same time. Historically, lower oil prices have been a positive\nfor U.S. growth, but the tremendous rise in domestic shale oil production over the past\ndecade has created a powerful counterweight that has offset some of the benefit of lower\nprices. In the immediate aftermath of the decline in oil prices, investment in the energy\nsector fell off precipitously, pushing down aggregate investment as well.\nRegarding structural explanations for slow growth, demographics are likely\nplaying a role. In a development that predates the crisis, relatively flat labor input, as\nmeasured by hours worked, has weighed on growth. In part, the sluggishness of labor\ninput just reflects long-term demographic trends as baby boomers age and retire.5\n5 See Aaronson and others (2014).\n\n- 6 -\nPerhaps most important in explaining the growth slowdown has been the\nlackluster increase of productivity in recent years. Labor productivity has averaged an\nannual growth rate of only 3/4 percent since 2011, far below the 2-1/4 percent pace\nprevalent over the two decades leading into the financial crisis. Why has productivity\ngrowth been so anemic? A number of theories have been raised, but there does not\nappear to be a clear answer--and certainly not a consensus answer.\nOne school of thought is that productivity growth has not slowed down much at\nall; rather, new technologies and products have made economic output harder to\nmeasure.6 It is not difficult to think of technological developments that have had a deep\nand pervasive effect on our daily lives (smartphone apps, for example) but perhaps in a\nmanner that is difficult to describe in the existing vocabulary of economic statistics.\nHowever, the counter to this argument is that troubles in measuring “newness” are not\nespecially new. Measuring the effect of new technologies has always been difficult, and\nthere is little evidence to suggest that it has become more difficult. 7\nOthers argue a somewhat pessimistic view that the slowdown reflects a paucity of\nnew inventions--or at least new inventions that lead to more rapid productivity growth.8\nIn a break with the easy dichotomy I offered earlier, others tie the slowdown in\nproductivity growth more tightly to developments related to the aftermath of the financial\ncrisis. Slow investment growth--which, as already mentioned, had prevailed until\nrecently--damps the contribution of new capital to worker productivity. It could also be\n6 See Hatzius and others (2016) for an overview of some issues that new technologies and products may be\nintroducing into the measurement of GDP and productivity.\n7 See Syverson (2017) and Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016).\n8 Gordon (2016) argues that recent technological advances have been relatively minor compared with the\nlarge advances that drove rapid increases in productivity in the past.\n\n- 7 -\nthat new investment is a necessary step for the spread of new technologies, especially if\ntechnology is embodied in capital equipment. Spending on research and development, an\nimportant input for technological advances, has been fairly subdued following the crisis.\nAlso, the aftermath of the crisis has been associated with a decrease in business\ndynamism--for example, the rate at which new start-up firms are being created has\ndeclined.9\nHave We Reached a Turning Point?\nHaving laid out the standard explanations for the slow pace of growth, I will now\nspeculate on what a shift to a higher growth path might look like and what I think we may\nwant to watch for.\nOne factor that has certainly turned is fiscal policy. After subtracting from\ngrowth over much of the period from 2011 onward, the impetus from fiscal policy has\nturned distinctly positive with the passage of recent tax and budget legislation.10 Fiscal\npolicy is likely to impart considerable momentum to growth over the next couple of years\nnot only by increasing demand, but also by boosting, to some degree, the potential\ncapacity of the economy.\nOf course, while stimulative in the near run, deficit spending--and the associated\nlarge and growing federal government debt--can have negative effects on the economy\nover the longer term, in part by claiming a larger share of the nation’s savings, driving up\nlong-term interest rates, and crowding out productive private investment. These effects\nwill require attention and difficult decisions at some point.\n9 See Decker and others (2016).\n10 For a historical measure of the fiscal policy’s contribution to GDP growth, see the Hutchins Center Fiscal\nImpact Measure, available on the Brookings Institution website at\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/interactives/hutchins-center-fiscal-impact-measure.\n\n- 8 -\nHow about the other factors that have been holding back growth? Looking at the\ndata, I see encouraging signs that some drags may be lessening--for example, the recent\npickup in investment--but less promising indicators elsewhere, especially productivity\ngrowth. In the end, I think it is too early to call a turning point, but it is a possibility that\nbears consideration and one that I will be watching for closely. Here are some of things I\nwill be following:\nLabor force participation. Given long-standing demographic trends, it would\nseem a heavy lift to expect labor force growth to contribute much to a pickup in GDP\ngrowth. However, it is encouraging that the downward movement in labor force\nparticipation has recently been on hiatus, a development that could possibly be prolonged\nby the recent tax legislation--which could, for example, give some workers an incentive\nto remain in or enter the workforce.\nCapital investment. As I mentioned, the recent data on investment have been\nencouraging, with a noticeable pickup in capital equipment spending. As businesses\nbecome more confident in the sustainability of the upturn, investment could be further\nboosted. While the tax act is multifaceted and complex, lower corporate tax rates and\nother incentives will also likely boost investment and increase the capital stock.\nProductivity. Though the quarterly numbers are volatile and should be treated\ncautiously, the nearly 1 percent decline in labor productivity recorded in the fourth\nquarter of 2017 would imply that a productivity turnaround is not yet upon us. Moreover,\nfor 2017 as a whole, productivity increased only 3/4 percent, about the same as the\naverage annual pace since 2011. That said, with no consensus on what has caused the\nproductivity slowdown, a turnaround could come suddenly.\n\n- 9 -\nThere are those who argue a more optimistic take on the prospects for technology\ndevelopments to boost productivity growth.11 For example, a number of new\ntechnologies, including artificial intelligence and genetic sequencing, appear on the cusp\nof breaking out, with widespread effects on economic activity.12\nAlso, it might be true that productivity growth will be nudged higher by the pace\nof economic activity. Tight labor markets might induce firms to invest more in robotics\nand other labor-saving technology.\nExternal developments. With global growth picking up steam, the external\nenvironment is more favorable for U.S. growth than it has been in quite some time. In\n2017, for example, the contribution of real exports to growth picked up markedly\nfollowing two years in which exports provided no support to growth at all.\nWhat Are the Consequences of Higher Growth?\nAgain, I think it is too soon to call a turning point in the long-run growth\nprospects of the economy, notwithstanding some encouraging signs that I have\nhighlighted. All the same, I think it is worthwhile to acknowledge that there are some\nupside risks to the forecast and to think through what the consequences of those risks\nmaterializing might be.\nOne consequence might be that a sustained increase in growth could be associated\nwith an increase in the natural rate of interest, a concept that has developed a prominent\nposition in the lexicon of central banking in recent years. One conception of the natural\nrate of interest is the rate of interest necessary to sustain stable prices and full\n11 See Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) and Baily, Manyika, and Gupta (2013).\n12 Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson (2017) argue that lags in the adoption of new technology could explain\nthe paradox between apparent advances in technology and continued weak productivity growth. They are\nreferring specifically to artificial intelligence, but the argument could also hold for other fields.\n\n- 10 -\nemployment. In the eyes of many commentators, that inflation has remained so low\nthrough the post-crisis period even as interest rates have fallen to levels that historically\nwould have been very stimulative to the economy suggests that the natural rate has fallen.\nWhy might the natural rate have fallen? There are a number of compelling\nnarratives, including low productivity growth, demographic trends, increased uncertainty,\nand a higher demand for precautionary saving. If these narratives sound familiar, it is\nbecause they are more or less the same set of explanations put forward as reasons for the\nslow pace of growth in recent years. Thus, a lessening of any of these factors, such as a\nsustained increase in the pace of productivity growth, would likely push up the natural\nrate of interest as well as GDP growth.\nWhat are the consequences of a higher natural rate of interest? As the natural rate\nmoves up, any given level of the policy rate would be more accommodative, so the policy\nrate would also have to move up to continue the gradual removal of policy\naccommodation. It is important to point out that this higher policy path would be\nmotivated by sustained stronger growth and improved economic conditions, not a greater\ndesire to slow the economy.\nCould there be a benefit from a higher natural rate of interest? In addition to its\nvalue in signaling that the economy is doing better, a higher rate could facilitate the\nconduct of monetary policy. A lower natural rate of interest can complicate the operation\nof conventional monetary policy. Since it is difficult to cut nominal interest rates below\nzero, conventional monetary policy is more likely to be constrained at low levels of the\nnatural interest rate. The higher the natural interest rate, the more space central banks\n\n- 11 -\nhave to cut policy rates in response to an economic downturn, easing the conduct of\nconventional policy.\nConclusion\nSo where does this discussion leave us? My assessment of the current state of the\neconomy is optimistic. I also think there is a real possibility that some of the factors that\nhave been holding back growth in recent years could shift, moving the economy onto a\nhigher growth trajectory. That said, I currently see this shift more as a clear possibility\nthan an unarguable reality. Importantly, we have not yet seen any sustained pickup in\nproductivity growth. However, given that conditions could shift, it is fair to ask what a\nhigher growth path might mean. As I discussed, it could mean a higher natural interest\nrate, which would increase the amount of accommodation provided at a given level of the\nFederal Reserve’s policy interest rate. But what would it imply about the appropriate\nstance of policy?\nIt goes without saying, but always bears repeating, that at the Federal Reserve we\nare very focused on meeting our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and\nprice stability. In assessing the effect of higher growth on monetary policy, I will be\ncarefully watching how that growth aligns with our dual mandate.\nIt might seem reasonable to assume that faster growth would lead to firmer\ninflation. However, I think a lot remains to be seen. For one, the degree to which growth\nspurs inflation is likely to be determined by the underlying factors that are prompting the\nincrease in growth. A demand-led increase can be expected to have a greater positive\neffect on prices than a step-up in the pace of potential growth. Growth led by an increase\n\n- 12 -\nin the economy’s productive capacity, either through increased labor force participation\nor higher productivity growth, is likely to impart less upward pressure on prices.\nI will be carefully watching indicators of economic activity and inflation and\nassessing the degree to which activity appears to be pushing up against the constraints of\nthe economy, as opposed to being a reflection of the expansion of those constraints and\nthe growth of the potential output of the economy.\nAt our January meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain its target range for the\nfederal funds rate between 1-1/4 and 1-1/2 percent.13 In this range, monetary policy\nremains accommodative. With my current economic outlook, I anticipate that further\ngradual increases in the policy rate will be appropriate to both sustain a healthy labor\nmarket and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent objective. Of course, as I mentioned,\nI will keep a close eye on economic indicators--and their implications for the outlook for\ninflation and real activity--and adjust my views on the appropriate monetary policy\naccordingly.\n13 See Board of Governors (2018).\n\n- 13 -\nReferences\nAaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher\nSmith, and William Wascher (2014). “Labor Force Participation: Recent\nDevelopments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,\nFall, pp. 197-255, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/07/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf.\nBaily, Martin Neil, James Manyika, and Shalabh Gupta (2013). “U.S. Productivity\nGrowth: An Optimistic Perspective,” International Productivity Monitor, no. 25\n(Spring), pp. 3-12.\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018). “Federal Reserve Issues\nFOMC Statement,” press release, January 31,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180131a.ht\nm.\nBrynjolfsson, Erik, and Andrew McAfee (2014).

Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nFinancial Services Roundtable\n2018 Spring Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nFebruary 26, 2018\n\nThank you very much for having me here at the Financial Services Roundtable’s spring\nmeeting. I am pleased to speak with you all about our financial regulatory system: both the\nbroad principles that have been directing my approach to evaluating the regulatory system, as\nwell as cybersecurity, which is a topic of great import to financial system participants and their\nregulators.\nEfficiency, Transparency, and Simplicity of Regulation\nAs I have said before, we have an opportunity to improve the efficiency, transparency,\nand simplicity of regulation. We have spent the past decade building out and standing up the\npost-crisis regulatory regime, and as a result we have made critical gains. The financial system\nis undoubtedly stronger and safer. We have robust capital and liquidity levels, an effective stress\ntesting regime, and improved resolvability of our largest firms.\nBut at the same time, it is our responsibility to ensure that those rules are effective. And\nif we identify rules that are not working as intended, we should make the necessary changes.\nWith the benefit of hindsight and with the bulk of our work behind us, now is a natural and\nexpected time to evaluate the effectiveness of that regime.\nOur efforts toward implementing those principles are underway. Federal Reserve Board\nstaff members continue the review that I have previously outlined. The goal is to consider the\neffect of past regulatory initiatives on the resiliency of our financial system, on credit availability\nand economic growth, and more broadly, their costs and benefits. I am confident that that review\nwill reveal some clear ways that we can improve the core post-crisis reforms.\nCybersecurity\nLet me now turn from regulation to supervision, and more specifically, to the topic of\ncybersecurity, which continues to be a high priority for the Federal Reserve. The Federal\n\n- 2 -\nReserve is committed to strategies that will result in measureable enhancements to the cyber\nresiliency of the financial sector. Given the dynamic and highly sophisticated nature of cyber\nrisks, collaboration between the public sector and private sector toward identifying and\nmanaging these risks is imperative. While we know that successful cyber attacks are often\nconnected to poor basic information technology hygiene, and firms must continue to devote\nresources to these basics, we also know that attackers always work to be a step ahead, and we\nneed to prepare for cyber events.\nMany of you provide services that are critical to maintaining the functionality of the\nfinancial system. Those critical services should be highly resilient. But at the same time, some\nof the solutions in place to improve the resiliency of those critical services may actually\ncontribute to a cyber event. One example would be the replication of bad data across data\ncenters. As the Federal Reserve thinks about its financial stability mandate, this concern will be\na particular focus. Solutions will not come easily, but I am confident that with strong public and\nprivate efforts, solutions will emerge.\nThe Federal Reserve also focuses on the sharing of threat information and collaborates\nwith a number of partners toward protective mechanisms. We work with other domestic\nagencies as well as international authorities, and we have partnerships between the public and\nprivate sectors to introduce and participate in programs that combat the increasingly frequent and\nsophisticated cyber threats.\nSpecifically, we collaborate with government and industry partners to plan and execute\ncybersecurity tabletop exercises focused on identifying areas where sector resilience and\ninformation sharing can be enhanced. We also participate in community and industry outreach\nforums and actively share threat intelligence with sector partners including the Financial Services\n\n- 3 -\nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC). And we encourage financial institutions to\nwork collectively through arrangements such as FS-ISAC so that threat information can be\nshared promptly and effectively.\nCollaboration among many stakeholders on cybersecurity is critical to progress. The\nFederal Reserve has been working with, and will continue to work with, other financial\nregulatory agencies on harmonizing cyber risk-management standards and regulatory\nexpectations across the financial services sector.\nSpecifically, we are focused on aligning our expectations with existing best practices,\nsuch as the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Cybersecurity Framework, and\nidentifying opportunities to further coordinate cyber risk supervisory activities for firms subject\nto the authority of multiple regulators. We support industry efforts to improve harmonization\nacross the sector, which are complementary to achieving our regulatory safety and soundness\ngoals.\nConclusion\nThe Federal Reserve continues to work toward improving both post-crisis regulation and\nour approach to cybersecurity. I hope that my intention to lay out the broad principles guiding us\nas we move forward was helpful. And while many of the areas will require additional work and\nmay not have fast results, the Federal Reserve is committed to getting it right, and I look forward\nto those efforts.",

Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2020 Virtual D.C. Summit\nInstitute of International Bankers\nWashington, D.C.\n(via webcast)\nSeptember 23, 2020\n\n- 2 -\nI want to thank the Institute of International Bankers for inviting me to discuss the\noutlook for the global and U.S. economies at what I believe is an important juncture in\nthe evolution of what I refer to as the “COVID event”: the outbreak of COVID-19 and\nthe government and social response to it.\nFirst, I will discuss the global economy before turning to our domestic economy\nand its outlook. From there, I will discuss my views on monetary policy, including the\nnew long-run monetary policy strategy recently announced by the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC). And I will wrap up with a brief discussion on financial stability and\nregulatory issues.\nInternational Economic Conditions\nLet me start with a picture of the global economy. Although challenges remain,\nespecially among some emerging market economies, significant support to households\nand businesses from central banks and fiscal authorities has contributed to a strong\nrebound in a number of advanced and some emerging Asian economies since those\ncountries began to loosen restrictions. In these economies, the reopening of factories has\nled to a resurgence of industrial production. Retail sales are rebounding and in some\ncountries are already above levels seen before the COVID event. However, international\ntrade has been slower to increase.\nThe extent of the recovery in some jurisdictions has been surprisingly robust\ncompared to many analysts’ expectations earlier this year. The momentum is feeding\ninto many private-sector forecasts that suggest prospects are good for strong economic\ngrowth in the United States and other advanced economies over the rest of this year and\n\n- 3 -\nnext. However, the hole that countries are in remains deep, and significant downside\nrisks still exist.\nPerhaps the most discussed risk has been that a “second wave” of the virus could\ntrigger a return to widespread mobility restrictions and business closures. Several\ncountries, including some portions of the United States, have seen a substantial\nresurgence of infections in recent months. This has been accompanied, however, by\nsubstantially lower hospitalization and death rates in most cases, and so far most\ncountries have been able to address the resurgence without reinstituting severe restrictive\npractices. Mobility indexes have been little changed in Europe and the United States, and\nthe declines in Asia have been modest.1 Businesses—which have adjusted operations\nand, in some cases, changed business models—seem much better adapted to remaining\nopen. I am also hopeful that better testing, tracing, and treatment regimens, as well as\nimproved understanding by the public about how to manage the risks of the disease, will\nallow firms, individuals, and governments to address public concerns about the virus\nwhile avoiding a second severe downturn or a protracted stagnation.\nStill, the economic fortunes of households and businesses around the world\nremain at risk. Incomes and employment are likely to lag below pre-COVID event levels\nfor some time, which would put stress on the finances of many families. Some people\nmay remain reluctant to return to full engagement in social and economic life, weighing\nespecially on the service sector. Even with support from monetary and fiscal policy,\nlarge numbers of businesses may close. These closures may lead to some longer-term\nscarring of the economy through lower investment, reduced capacity, and long-term\n1 Mobility indexes, which measure how much people move around outside their homes using cellphone\ngeolocation data, tend to vary with economic activity.\n\n- 4 -\nunemployment leading some to drop out of the labor force altogether. While I am\noptimistic that recovery is underway and the worst outcomes can be avoided, these\nconcerns suggest that policymakers around the world need to remain watchful and ready\nto act further.\nDomestic Economic Conditions and the Outlook\nNow let me focus on U.S. economic conditions and the outlook. The historic\ncollapse in economic activity in March and April will take time to reverse. However, the\neconomy has rebounded more strongly than almost any forecaster expected. That\nresilience reflects the economy’s underlying strength upon entering the recession and\ndemonstrates its inherent flexibility, as well as the dynamism of the American people.\nFor example, the Census Bureau reports that applications by people seeking to start new\nbusinesses have surged this summer.2\nThe median of projections for 2020 by FOMC participants in September showed\nthat both gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation had been revised up significantly\nfrom the median in the June projections.3 I expect that robust GDP growth over the rest\nof this year and in 2021 will lead to strong employment gains and move inflation closer\nto 2 percent. I would still caution that there is an unusually large amount of uncertainty\nnow about any outlook, and I see the risks to the outlook as weighted to the downside.\nHowever, given the trends I previously discussed in the way countries are adjusting to the\n2 See the “Business Formation Statistics” page on the Census Bureau’s website at\nhttps://www.census.gov/econ/bfs/index.html.\n3 The advance release of table 1 of the Summary of Economic Projections, which will be issue with the\nminutes of the September 2020 FOMC meeting, is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20200916.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nCOVID event, I am optimistic that the United States can avoid the highly adverse\noutcomes that many feared would materialize.\nTurning now to the labor market, unemployment was still at 8.4 percent in August\nand the labor force participation rate still down significantly from February. The\nextraordinary package of fiscal support in the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and\nEconomic Security Act) helped to support household incomes and to offset the effect of\nthe huge job losses in March and April. But the act’s unemployment provisions have\nexpired, and most of the businesses that received Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)\nloans report that they have exhausted those funds.4 In addition, one area where increased\nunderstanding of the disease has, in many places, not led to general changes in practice is\nin the widespread school closures this fall. Many parents with children will be forced to\nwork less, or not at all, which is going to be a hardship for them and weigh on the\neconomy. So, I agree with Chair Powell that it will take continued support to sustain a\nrobust recovery.\nAlthough still unacceptably high, an 8.4 percent unemployment rate represents a\nconsiderable improvement from 14.7 percent in April and is already much lower than\nmany thought possible this year.5 By comparison, after the onset of the Great Recession,\nit took more than two years to reduce unemployment from the peak of 10 percent to 8.4\npercent. One reason for the faster turnaround this time is that many of the initial job\n4 See Goldman Sachs (2020), “Survey: Disappointed and Frustrated, Small Business Owners Feel Left\nBehind by Congress” (New York: Goldman Sachs, September 8),\nhttps://www.goldmansachs.com/citizenship/10000-small-businesses/US/infographic-left-\nbehind/index.html.\n5 Accounting for employees who still were being paid but not working during April, the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics believes that the peak unemployment rate may have been about 5 percentage points higher than\n14.7 percent. However, this measurement issue has decreased significantly to less than 1 percent in the\nmost recent month.\n\n- 6 -\nlosses, and subsequent job gains, were due to temporary disruptions that many businesses\nhave overcome. However, some indicators point to slower improvement in the job\nmarket going forward.\nLike employment, consumer spending has been much stronger than expected,\neven though spending on travel and many other categories of in-person services remains\ndepressed. Retail sales were extremely strong from May through August, driven by\ndemand for consumer durables such as automobiles, furniture, and home improvement.\nHome sales and construction also have increased sharply since then. For instance, new\nhome sales rose in July to an annual pace of over 900,000 units, which is 16 percent\nabove the recent peak in January 2020 and the fastest pace since December 2006.6\nAll of these facts lead me to believe the momentum in household spending is\nstrong. Although consumer confidence remains lower than early this year, the resilience\nin big-ticket purchases indicates some underlying confidence among households that the\neconomy will continue to improve. The strength in the consumer and housing sectors is\nbeing supported by Fed action to lower interest rates and support credit availability for\ncreditworthy borrowers. In addition, the recent high rate of household savings likely\nrepresents a significant source of pent-up demand.\nNow let me turn to the business sector, where the picture is more mixed. As in\nthe household sector, the decline in many measures of business spending last spring\nturned out to be much less than was feared, and some indicators of business investment\nhave turned around dramatically in recent months. However, there is considerable\n6 See Census Bureau (2020), “Monthly New Residential Sales, July 2020,” Release CB20-123, August 25,\nhttps://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nuncertainty over how businesses will deal with the cumulative effects of the COVID\nevent on the economy.\nAs we all know, medium and small enterprises were, and continue to be, heavily\naffected by the COVID event. The PPP disbursed $525 billion in loans to businesses\nthrough August 8, most of which will be forgiven when businesses are found to have met\nthe requirements for keeping workers on the job at previous pay rates.7 Working with the\nTreasury Department, the Federal Reserve created several facilities that are providing\nsupport to large, mid-size, and small firms.8 These programs have improved credit\nmarket functioning through direct support to borrowers and lenders that use them and\nindirect support by creating a backstop against worsening conditions that boosts the\nwillingness of private-sector lenders to extend credit.\nDespite those efforts and the pickup in household spending, many businesses are\nstill under strain, representing an important source of downside risk. One concern is that\nmany businesses already were highly leveraged going into the crisis, and taking on more\ndebt as a bridge until commerce normalizes may not be a viable option, even with\nfavorable repayment terms. Many corporate bonds and leveraged syndicated loans were\ndowngraded between March and June, and default rates on corporate bonds rose\nsignificantly over that period as well. However, corporate defaults have slowed in the\n7 See U.S. Small Business Administration (2020), Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Report\n(Washington: SBA, August), https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2020-08/PPP_Report%20-%202020-\n08-10.pdf.\n8 Specifically, the following facilities were created: the PPP Liquidity Facility, as well as the Commercial\nPaper Funding Facility, the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, the Secondary Market Corporate\nCredit Facility, and the Main Street Lending Program.

This development, in part, highlights banks’ ability to work\nwith borrowers that have been hurt by the COVID event as laid out in supervisory\nguidance provided by the federal banking agencies.9\nAnother downside risk in the business sector is the strains to commercial real\nestate (CRE), particularly in retail and hospitality properties. CRE was a prominent\nconcern before COVID, although one that seemed quite manageable. Since then,\nvacancy rates have risen significantly and rents have fallen sharply, putting at risk the\nhigh valuations that our May Financial Stability Report flagged as a vulnerability.10\nThe sharp decrease in output and employment, as well as continued slack in the\neconomy, have put downward pressure on wages and the prices of goods and services\naffected by the COVID event. The 12-month increase in the price index for personal\nconsumption expenditures (PCE) dropped to about 0.5 percent in April. Although the\nrecovery since then has helped prices retrace some of those declines, PCE inflation was\nstill only 1 percent for the 12 months ended in July and is likely to end 2020 well below\nour 2 percent longer-run target.11\nIndicators of future inflation do not point to rapid acceleration.

The Committee will be closely watching for a further\nrecovery of inflation and signs that inflation expectations remain well anchored as we set\nmonetary policy.\nMonetary Policy, Short Term and Longer Term\nIn the near term, with both employment and inflation significantly short of the\nFOMC’s economic goals, the prescription is for a sustained aggressive use of monetary\npolicy to support the economy. In March, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate\neffectively to zero and began purchasing large quantities of Treasury and agency\nmortgage-backed securities. Over the following weeks, the Federal Reserve Board used\nour emergency authority to establish 13 lending facilities to provide support to\nhouseholds, financial firms, nonfinancial businesses, nonprofit organizations, and\nmunicipal governments. We also took steps, including extending dollar swap lines to\nother central banks, to address strains in global dollar funding markets.\nTaking a step back, beginning in 2019, the FOMC undertook a public review of\nthe conceptual framework for how we approach monetary policy. And last month, the\nFOMC updated its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which\nI will call the “consensus statement.”12\nI want to emphasize the very public and deliberative nature of this policy review\nunder the leadership of Chair Powell and Vice Chair Richard Clarida. Through a series\nof 15 public Fed Listens events, we received input from a broad spectrum of people:\n12 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Federal Open Market Committee\nAnnounces Approval of Updates to Its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,”\npress release, August 27,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200827a.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nsmall business leaders, union workers, retirees, prominent outside researchers, and\nothers.13 The FOMC also had the benefit of extensive research and analysis from Fed\nstaff and debated the issues at a series of FOMC meetings.14 This process set a new and\nvery high standard for transparency and accountability for the Fed, and we have\ncommitted to conducting such reviews roughly every five years.\nI believe the new consensus statement lays out a strategy that is suited to the\ndemands of setting monetary policy in our constantly changing economy. Let me begin\nby focusing on two key conclusions. First, over the past two decades, the prevailing level\nof interest rates in many advanced economies has declined, leaving central bankers with\nless room to cut interest rates when the economy slows. In addition, experience over the\npast few decades has shown us that the traditionally strong relationship between\nunemployment and inflation has weakened, perhaps considerably.15 We saw this\nweakening relationship in the United States, as the robust expansion before the COVID\nevent led to historic and broad-based labor market gains. Not only did the unemployment\nrate drop to long-time lows, but the wages of low- and moderate-income workers also\n13 Federal Reserve staff analysis on the Fed Listens initiative was presented and discussed at the December\n2019 FOMC meeting and is part of the Fed Listens report; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (2020), Fed Listens: Perspectives from the Public (Washington: Board of Governors, June),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/fedlistens-report-20200612.pdf.\n14 Summaries of the Committee’s discussions are available in the minutes of the associated meetings, which\ncan be found on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\nAn overview of the System staff’s work in support of the review is presented in David Altig, Jeff Fuhrer,\nMarc P. Giannoni, and Thomas Laubach (2020), “The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy\nFramework: A Roadmap,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nAugust 27), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-federal-reserves-review-of-its-\nmonetary-policy-framework-a-roadmap-20200827.htm.\n15 A comprehensive review of both of these points can be found in Chair Powell’s 2020 speech at Jackson\nHole; see Jerome H. Powell (2020), “New Economic Challenges and the Fed’s Monetary Policy Review,”\nspeech delivered at “Navigating the Decade Ahead: Implications for Monetary Policy,” an economic\npolicy symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo.,\nAugust 27, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm.\n\n- 11 -\naccelerated, and unemployment rates for historically disadvantaged groups fell to record\nlows. Yet inflation continued to run modestly below our symmetric 2 percent target, for\nalmost the entire period, and long-term interest rates remained very low by historical\nstandards.16 This recent experience in the United States, which has also played out\nelsewhere, has led to a growing consensus in the economics profession that the\nrelationship between unemployment and inflation—commonly known as the Phillips\ncurve—has flattened.\nTherefore, given the considerable benefits that we observed when unemployment\nfell to very low levels in recent years, the Committee determined that a low\nunemployment rate, unless accompanied by worrisome developments in inflation or other\nrisks that could impede the attainment of our goals, would not necessitate a policy\nresponse. We capture this change in the revised consensus statement by tying future\npolicy decisions to “shortfalls of employment from its maximum level” rather than to\n“deviations” from the maximum level as in the previous statement. The new framework\nstatement also highlights that the maximum level of employment is a broad-based and\ninclusive goal, and it reiterates that the Committee will review a wide range of\nindicators—not just the unemployment rate—in its assessments of that level. I believe\nthese changes to the way the FOMC responds to labor market conditions will result in a\nstronger economy without jeopardizing our commitment to low and stable inflation. In\nfact, I think that meeting our longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation as defined by the 12-\n16 A similar experience played out in the 1990s, as the Federal Reserve under Chairman Alan Greenspan\nsaw unemployment decline to levels well below then-prevailing views of maximum employment, without a\nsignificant increase in inflation or unmooring of inflation expectations.\n\n- 12 -\nmonth change in the overall PCE price index, which is unchanged by this revision, will\nhelp achieve the kind of labor market outcomes we have experienced in recent years.\nAnd that is a good segue into the other major change in the consensus statement\nthat I want to address today. Even before the COVID event pushed inflation down to\nvery low levels this year, PCE inflation had been running modestly below 2 percent for\nsome time, and some measures of inflation expectations had decreased to the low ends of\ntheir historical ranges. These developments certainly bear watching, especially if\ninflation were to remain lower than it had been in previous years or if inflation\nexpectations were to decrease further. A decrease in inflation expectations can lead to a\ndownward spiral in actual inflation, which would further reduce already low equilibrium\nnominal interest rates and, among other consequences, leave the FOMC with less\nflexibility to address future economic slowdowns.\nIn order to better anchor long-run inflation expectations at 2 percent, the\nconsensus statement makes a distinct change from the old approach. The Committee will\nseek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, which means that we will aim\nto achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time following periods when\ninflation has been persistently below 2 percent.\nIn the previous consensus statement, the FOMC committed to a 2 percent longer-\nrun goal for inflation that was to be “symmetric.” This wording already suggested some\ntolerance for inflation above 2 percent when it was consistent with meeting our\nemployment mandate, and I certainly never viewed 2 percent inflation as a ceiling. One\nreason to be comfortable with inflation at times running moderately above 2 percent is\nthat defining and measuring inflation are very much an inexact science. For that reason, I\n\n- 13 -\nhave always considered alternative indicators of inflation—such as the Dallas Fed\ntrimmed mean and, of course, core inflation—in my assessment of the likely longer-run\npath for the headline PCE price index. As a result, as long as inflation expectations\nremain well anchored close to 2 percent, modest deviations of any particular measure of\ninflation around 2 percent are not a first-order concern in my decision framework. In\nfact, I likely will be even more patient in reacting to small upward deviations, given the\nCommittee’s move to focus on shortfalls of employment from maximum employment\nrather than deviations.\nFor those reasons, I supported the action that the FOMC took last week at our\nSeptember meeting to update the forward guidance to be consistent with the consensus\nstatement for these extraordinary times. Although we have seen the beginnings of a\nstrong recovery, even optimistic forecasts suggest that it will take a long time to recover\nfully from this shock. Evidence suggests that our actions to date have had significant\nstimulative effects. By providing additional monetary policy accommodation through\nstronger, outcomes-based forward guidance, the Committee hopes to quicken the pace of\nthe recovery.\nImplications for Banks and Financial Stability\nNow let us consider some of the implications of the COVID event for banks and\nfor financial stability. Large U.S. banks entered this crisis in strong condition, and the\nFederal Reserve has taken a number of important steps to help bolster banks’ resilience.\nWe took the unprecedented step of prohibiting share repurchases in the third quarter for\n\n- 14 -\nlarge banks while also capping dividends.17 In addition, we required all banks to reassess\ntheir capital needs in the face of continued uncertainty and resubmit their capital plans.\nLast week, we released a baseline and two hypothetical recession scenarios that will be\nused by banks and the Fed to assess the resilience of the sector, and we will release bank-\nspecific results from our independent assessment before the end of the year.18\nNonbank financial firms, especially those engaged in liquidity transformation,\nexperienced acute strains in March. Despite the apparent success of some nonbank\nregulatory reforms in the United States, such as efforts to increase the resilience of\nmoney funds, the Board of Governors again needed to provide significant emergency\nsupport. This is why, at the Financial Stability Board, I have put together a senior group\nof market regulators and central bank governors to develop a holistic review of the March\nstresses in nonbank finance. We will deliver that review to the G20 in November,\ntogether with a work plan on potential methods to address the vulnerabilities that may\namplify stresses in funding markets.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the COVID event was an enormous economic shock in the first\nhalf of 2020, but a recovery is underway, and the world seems to be adjusting in ways\nthat allow us to address public concerns about the virus without sudden stops in economic\nactivity. A full recovery is still a good way off, however, and risks remain weighted to\nthe downside. Policymakers will need to remain vigilant.\n17 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Federal Reserve Board Releases Results\nof Stress Tests for 2020 and Additional Sensitivity Analyses Conducted in Light of the Coronavirus\nEvent,” press release, June 25,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200625c.htm.\n18 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Federal Reserve Board Releases\nHypothetical Scenarios for Second Round of Bank Stress Tests,” press release, September 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200917a.htm.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:50 a.m. EDT\nApril 10, 2019\nProgress on the Transition to Risk-Free Rates\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nand\nChair\nFinancial Stability Board\nat\nThe Financial Stability Board Roundtable on\nReforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 10, 2019\n\nI am pleased that we have this opportunity to meet with many of the institutions\nactive in helping to achieve a transition from LIBOR to the risk-free rates identified by\nworking groups in each of our jurisdictions. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has\ncoordinated the international effort to reform interest rate benchmarks at the direction of\nthe G-20. This is an important effort across the globe, but nowhere is it of more\nimportance than in the jurisdictions relying on LIBOR.\nLet’s review the reasons that we are here. By the time of the financial crisis,\nmuch of the global financial system had come to rely on LIBOR. And yet LIBOR was a\nvery poorly structured rate; contributing banks were asked to submit quotes without any\nrequirement of evidence of transactions or other facts to back them up, which made them\nsusceptible to manipulation. Thanks to subsequent reforms, contributors now provide\nthis type of evidence where possible, but LIBOR is based on an underlying market with\nso few transactions that there is relatively little direct evidence they can provide. Many\nsubmitting banks are uncomfortable with this situation, and some sought to stop their\nparticipation. As a result, the official sector has had to step in to support LIBOR by\nsecuring a voluntary agreement with the remaining banks to continue submitting through\n2021. At the same time, the official sector has convened national working groups to help\ndevelop alternative risk-free rates and navigate a very complicated transition.\nMany people have used reference rates with little thought. The experience with\nLIBOR should teach us that this has to change and that we cannot risk making this kind\nof mistake again. Banks should conduct at least as much due diligence on the reference\nrates that they use as they conduct on the creditworthiness of their borrowers. The\nnational working groups convened by many of the FSB member authorities have\n\n- 2 -\nperformed that type of diligence with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR,\nand the risk-free rates identified in other jurisdictions. That effort has been a clear and\npositive example of public-private sector cooperation. These alternative risk-free rates\nhave been created or substantially reformed to ensure that robust, transaction-based rates\nthat accurately represent well-defined underlying markets and are consistent with\ninternationally-recognized standards are available.\nI want to thank the many institutions here today, and the many more that have\nplayed equally constructive roles, for their efforts in this process. This month marks the\none-year anniversary of SOFR and is close to the one-year anniversary of the other new\nrisk-free rates. Over that year, we have seen the establishment of new futures markets,\ncleared swap markets, and debt markets based on these new rates. SOFR futures, which\ndid not exist a year ago, have seen more than $7 trillion in cumulative notional volumes.\nThis has been a crucial development for market liquidity and is helping to spur the\ngrowth of SOFR swaps and other derivative markets. And SOFR is being used in cash\nproducts, with $81 billion in SOFR-linked debt issued over the past year.\nNew markets do not arise overnight--in normal circumstances they can often take\ndecades to develop. What has been accomplished over the past year is remarkable. At\nthe same time, we have only a little over two and a half years until the point at which\nLIBOR could end, and the transition needs to continue to accelerate. The private sector\nneeds to take on this responsibility, and we expect you to do so. The Federal Reserve’s\nsupervisory teams are including the transition away from LIBOR in their monitoring\ndiscussions with large firms. The Federal Reserve will expect to see an appropriate level\nof preparedness at the banks it supervises. As the Alternative Reference Rates\n\n- 3 -\nCommittee (ARRC) continues to make progress on industry-led approaches to the\ntransition, the transition paths away from LIBOR will become clearer for banks of all\nsizes.\nWhile we expect you to take on this responsibility, we in the public sector must\nalso recognize our need to help. The FSB has supported this transition globally, and, in\nthe United States, the Financial Stability Oversight Council has supported the ARRC’s\nwork. It is important that we continue to do so, and I want to thank you all today for the\nthoughts you have shared with us on this transition and what is needed to make it\nsucceed.",

Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nChair\nFinancial Stability Board\nat\nBank for International Settlements\nSpecial Governors Meeting\nHong Kong\nFebruary 10, 2019\n\nLet me begin by thanking the Bank for International Settlements and Agustín Carstens\nfor the invitation to join you today. In considering venues for my inaugural speech as chair of\nthe Financial Stability Board (FSB), I found this particular opportunity quite fitting. It is an\nhonor to be here, in Hong Kong, with colleagues from around the world, representing central\nbanks who are committed to advancing financial stability not only in their home countries but\nalso globally.\nI would like to discuss with you tonight my view of how the work of the FSB must\nevolve, and some key principles that I think should inform that work. My predecessor, Bank of\nEngland Governor Mark Carney, guided the FSB for the last seven years along a path that was\nformidably challenging. The Global Financial Crisis had exposed fault lines in the financial\nsystem that had to be addressed immediately, comprehensively, and vigorously. The body of\npost-crisis regulation that has resulted, though it involved the energy and efforts of a\nkaleidoscopically varied host of standard setters, regulators, and central banks--including all the\ninstitutions in this room--was nonetheless accomplished under the aegis and at the instigation of\nthe FSB. It was a tour de force of orchestration, and it has unquestionably made the financial\nsystem safer and more resilient.\nToday, however, the post-crisis reform agenda has been largely completed. Basel III is\nfinal, the largest global banks have substantially more capital and liquidity, over-the-counter\nderivatives markets are safer, and steps have been taken to address the risks of too-big-to-to fail\ninstitutions. Through greater monitoring and policy measures, the FSB is addressing risks from\nnon-bank financial intermediation. And there has been remarkable progress on the difficult and\nunsung task of establishing workable resolution regimes that are consistent with the FSB’s\nclearly defined principles.\n\n- 2 -\nYes, we all have work to do to ensure full, timely, and consitent implementation of the\nagreed reforms, and, yes, we will do that work, but, it is time for the FSB to turn more of its\nenergy and attention to the future. Tonight I would like to outline a few core principles that\nshould guide this pivot forward. First, engagement: to maintain the legitimacy of our work, to\nincrease understanding of it, and to enhance its effectiveness, we must improve our outreach and\ntransparency--including to our membership, other global authorities, the public, and key\nstakeholders. Second, rigor: as we devote more attention to evaluation of new and evolving\nrisks in the financial sector, we must ensure that our assessment of vulnerabilities is based on\ncutting-edge thinking and a disciplined methodology. And third, analysis: regulation has\nevolved rapidly in the last decade, and--if we are doing our jobs right--will continue to evolve\nwith rapid developments in the financial sector. An important part of our work must be\ncontinual, critical analysis of the effects of regulaton with an eye to making useful improvements\nwhere possible.\nEngagement: Outreach and Transparency\nLet me begin with the principle of engagement, and let me lay the groundwork for this\ndiscussion by reviewing the way the FSB was established and its mandate, to see how we can\ncontinue to fulfill that mandate going forward. As we all know, the FSB was born out of the\ncrucible of the 2007-09 Global Financial Crisis--a crisis that demonstrated in the starkest\npossible way the importance of global financial stability to the well-being of families and\nbusinesses around the world. In the months following the peak of the crisis, the world was\nstruggling with financial market turmoil, and the resultant macroeconomic effects were felt by\npeople everywhere around the world. It was clear that the response to this crisis needed to be\nglobal, and the G7 and G10, without any emerging market representation, were not the right\n\n- 3 -\nbodies to organize a global response. As such, the Heads of State and Government of the G20\ncalled for the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), a relatively small and unmuscular group, to\nexpand its membership and to strengthen its institutional framework. The result was the\nFinancial Stability Board, which was designed as a mechanism for national authorities, global\nstandards-setting bodies, and international authorities to identify and address vulnerabilities in\nthe global financial system and to develop stronger regulatory and supervisory policies to create\na more resilient global financial system. This new group is more representative of the\ninterconnected global economy and financial system and can more effectively mobilize to\npromote global financial stability than anything that existed before. Whereas the FSF included\nonly 11 jurisdictions (all of which were advanced economies), the FSB includes 24 jurisdictions\nand 73 representatives, which include all the members of the G20 and of which 10 are emerging\nmarket economies.\nIn fostering global financial stability, the actions of the FSB have the potential to affect\nthe global economy and financial system in important ways. Success in promoting global\nfinancial stability should benefit everybody, through more sustainable and stronger economic\ngrowth. At the same time, financial stability policy will also affect institutions and markets\nbeyond the FSB’s membership. Recognizing the wide-reaching effects of its work, the FSB\nmust seek input from a broad range of stakeholders, each of whom brings a different perspective\nto the issues under consideration. While we are directly accountable to the G20, we are, through\nthe G20, accountable to all of the people affected by our actions. In my view, that means we\nmust engage in genuine, substantial dialogue with all of these stakeholders, to a greater and more\neffective degree than we have in the past.\n\n- 4 -\nLet me take an example that may be of particular relevance to many of you here tonight:\nour Regional Consultative Groups or RCGs. These are six groups around the globe--the\nAmericas, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States, and Asia--that bring together FSB members with about 70 additional\njurisdictions. These groups help the FSB get broader input into its policy development and\nimprove our outreach efforts. Each RCG meets once or twice a year to discuss policy\ndevelopment, regional and global financial vulnerabilities, and other current topics of particular\ninterest to the respective region. For instance, topics discussed at the last meeting in Asia\nincluded capital flow volatility, cyber resilience of financial institutions, and fintech.\nThese RCGs are great in concept, but they have struggled in practice. We have already\nbegun a study to look back at how the RCGs have operated since their creation in 2011, how\nthey interact with the FSB, and what best practices have been learned. Even while that study is\nunderway, I am committed to improving our mechanisms for reaching out to countries outside\nthe FSB for genuine learning about the effects of FSB actions. I plan to attend a number of RCG\nmeetings each year because of the importance I place on making sure these groups are truly\nuseful tools, and we will improve these vital conduits of two-way information in order to\nimprove our effectiveness and our transparency.\nWhile the RCGs may be of particular interest to some here tonight, they are just the tip of\nthe iceberg for what we have to do to improve our engagement and outreach. Because the FSB’s\nauthority is ultimately derived from the people and from the political power given to authorities\nin their countries, we have a responsibility to seek input from and to provide information about\nour deliberations and actions to the broader public. To that end, for the first time in the FSB’s\n\n- 5 -\nhistory, we will shortly publish our work program to the public to provide people with a full\npicture of the issues we are investigating over the coming year.\nFinally, there are the businesses, institutions, and market participants that are directly\naffected by the policy recommendations of the FSB. We currently engage with those entities to\ngather information as we consider recommendations to the G20. For example, we have in the\npast conducted public consultations on FSB policy recommendations--but often on a very short\ntimetable, which limits the ability for true exchange. We have now established an expectation\nthat the public consultation period will be at least 60 days. The key point is that when it comes\nto outreach to inform our work and transparency in the communication of it, we must do more,\nand more eagerly.\nThis discussion of engagement, outreach and transparency may seem like an odd place to\nbegin a “vision” speech, but I think it is foundational. The FSB must maintain its legitimacy in\norder to be effective, and to do that we have to work hard to hear from all relevant parties when\ndeliberating. What’s more, we have to do so publicly and methodically. Everyone around the\nworld should understand that we only make recommendations once we have gathered and\nconsidered all points of view. Process is important, and good process leads to good substance.\nAssessing Financial Stability\nWith that said, let me turn to the core piece of the FSB’s mission--assessing and\nmitigating vulnerabilities, especially in the nonbank sector. The FSB’s work has a natural flow.\nWe strive to identify vulnerabilities in the financial system that could threaten financial stability\nwhen a shock hits. When a vulnerability has been identified, we examine possible policy\nresponses. If a policy is recommended to the G20 and adopted, we then monitor the\n\n- 6 -\nimplementation of that recommendation globally. Finally, when enough time has passed for the\nenacted policies to have had measurable effects, we study those effects.\nFor much of the post-crisis period, our focus was on developing policy recommendations\nto address vulnerabilities made apparent by the crisis. Now, however, with nearly all of the post-\ncrisis reform agenda complete, the FSB needs to put more of our resources into identifying new\nvulnerabilities in a financial sector that continues to evolve and to studying the effects of the\nmany reforms that have been enacted. Let me start by discussing vulnerability assessment.\nThe reforms that have been implemented over the past decade have changed the financial\nsystem for the better. However, that does not mean we are immune from future financial crises.\nIt means that we have boosted the financial system’s resilience to some of the types of shocks\nand vulnerabilities that precipitated the crisis. To be sure, some of these measures, like higher\nbank capital and liquidity requirements, after effective against a wide range of shocks. However,\nwe cannot be complacent and assume that we are safe from all shocks. As a result, the FSB has\ndecided to undertake a review of its framework for assessing vulnerabilities to ensure that we are\nat the cutting edge of financial stability vulnerability assessment.\nThis work will be undertaken by our committee charged with assessing vulnerabilities\nunder the leadership of FSB Vice Chair Klaas Knot of the Dutch National Bank (De\nNederlandsche Bank). This should be a framework that starts from first principles and benefits\nfrom substantial dialogue with nonbanks as well as banks, regulators, and other relevant official\nbodies. There is a lot that we can draw on. The crisis led to an explosion of work in this area\naimed at improving the ability of authorities to identify financial vulnerabilities in order to be\nable to take appropriate action in a timely fashion. I trust that the framework will harness the\nstrength of the broad and diverse membership of the FSB, that it will be forward looking, and\n\n- 7 -\nthat it will be flexible enough to handle a financial system that will continue to evolve over time.\nThis will not be easy--developments like the emergence of crypto-assets may challenge any\nframework--but that makes the goal of a robust framework all the more important.\nEvaluating the Effects of Reform\nFinally, let me turn to the FSB’s evaluation of the effects of reforms that have been\nimplemented. In the past few years, we have reached a point where many of the reforms have\nbeen in place for long enough to have effects that we can measure and analyze. For those\nreforms, we need to ask several key questions. First, to what extent are those reforms having the\nintended effects and building a more resilient financial system? Second, have those reforms had\nany unintended, adverse effects that we can address? These first two questions are, perhaps,\napparent. We should also ask a third question, however, that is equally important: can we\nachieve a strong level of financial resilience with reforms that are more efficient, simple,\ntransparent, and tailored? If so, we owe it to everyone affected by the policies recommended by\nthe FSB to try, because there is a strong public interest in the efficiency of the financial sector,\njust as there is in its safety and soundness. If reforms are unnecessarily burdensome and we can\nachieve strong resiliency more efficiently and simply, we should be able to boost sustainable\nfinancial and economic activity, thus benefitting everyone.\nEvaluating reforms in light of these questions requires rigor--in terms of the selection of\nevaluation topics, the choice of analytical methods, the assessment of effects, and the\ndevelopment of policy conclusions. This rigor is critical for the quality and credibility of the\nevaluation work. For this reason, the FSB developed a clear Evaluation Framework, under\nwhich the evaluations are based, as much as possible, on quantitative data to measure the costs\nand benefits of reforms. Equally critical to a successful review is a truly open mindset with\n\n- 8 -\nwhich to evaluate the relevant data. One public measure of whether we are doing this review\nprocess well will be whether we recommend any improvements or revisions on the basis of it. In\nany system as complex and consequential as the body of post-crisis financial regulations, there\nwill always be aspects--and sometimes material aspects--that can be improved on the basis of\nexperience and analysis. A credible review process that is both rigorous and dispassionate will\nfind a few.\nLast year, the FSB completed the first two evaluations under its framework, of the effects\nof reform on infrastructure fin ance and the clearing of derivative contracts. We are currently\nengaged in work examining the effects of reforms on the financing of small and medium\nenterprises, which are the lifeblood of many of the world’s economies. We will consult publicly\non the findings of this evaluation in June, ahead of the G20 Summit in Osaka. And we are in the\nprocess of launching an important study on the effects of reforms aimed at ending too big to fail.\nThis evaluation is being led by Claudia Buch, vice president of the Deutsche Bundesbank.\nConclusion\nThis is an important time for the FSB. We are nearing completion of the post-crisis\nreform agenda, a major accomplishment. With that comes the opportunity to turn our focus to\nways in which we can improve the FSB and prepare it for the next phase of its existence. We\nwill work diligently to enhance our transparency and to expand our efforts to reach out to as\nmany stakeholders as possible. We will prepare for the next crisis by making sure that our\nframework to assess vulnerabilities to financial stability is state of the art and remains so going\nforward. And, we will work hard to maintain the important reforms in place, ensure they are\nworking as intended, and, where possible, improve them.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:30 p.m. EDT\nMarch 22, 2021\nKeynote Remarks\nby\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“The SOFR Symposium: The Final Year,” an event hosted by\nthe Alternative Reference Rates Committee\nNew York, New York\n(via webcast)\nMarch 22, 2021\n\nI am pleased to join this first symposium being held by the Alternative Reference\nRates Committee (ARRC) to mark the key year of the LIBOR transition.1 I have had a\nvantage point in supporting this transition in my roles both as Chair of the Financial\nStability Board (FSB), which convened the Official Sector Steering Group in 2013 to\ncoordinate global benchmark rate reform efforts at the request of the Group of Twenty,\nand as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, which convened the ARRC in 2014 under\nthe auspices of then-Governor Jay Powell. Since these groups were first formed, we have\nseen great progress in building markets and infrastructures designed to facilitate the\ntransition. This year, however, it is finally time for everyone to actively transition away\nfrom using LIBOR.\nSince 2017, when Andrew Bailey first announced that the U.K. Financial Conduct\nAuthority (FCA) had secured a voluntary agreement with the remaining panel banks\nsubmitting to LIBOR to continue their submissions through 2021, we in the official\nsector have emphasized that LIBOR would eventually end, but the market has lacked\nclarity on exactly when it would end. Because the FCA had committed to avoiding the\nuse of its powers to compel any bank to remain on the panels after the agreement ended,\nthe decision to submit for a further period or to depart was up to the banks themselves.\nAnd while the panel banks had committed to continue submissions through the end of\nthis year, they had not stated what they planned to do afterward.\nAlthough one might have expected that a statement from the regulator that a\nbenchmark would stop might cause people to think twice before using it even if the exact\nend date were uncertain, many have kept using LIBOR. It may be that the ambiguity\n1 All of my remarks today represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal\nReserve Board, the Federal Open Market Committee, or the Financial Stability Board.\n\n- 2 -\nabout a precise end date encouraged some to believe that it would not actually end. If so,\nthe recent statements from the administrator of LIBOR and FCA should erase any\nremaining doubts as to exactly when and whether LIBOR will end. To summarize,\nthanks to recent statements by the FCA and ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA, the\nadministrator of LIBOR), we now know the following:\n• IBA will no longer have the necessary panel bank submissions to continue to\npublish any nondollar LIBOR tenors or one-week or two-month U.S. dollar\n(USD) LIBOR after December 31, 2021.\n• IBA will no longer have the necessary panel bank submissions to continue\npublishing overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, or one-year USD\nLIBOR after June 30, 2023.\nAdjusting to a new reality can be difficult, so let me be clear: These statements\nare definitive. Some may speculate that the June 2023 date could be pushed back, but\nIBA has now stated that it will not have sufficient panel bank submissions after this date,\nthe FCA has officially recognized this date, and the spread adjustments under the\nInternational Swaps and Derivatives Association’s (ISDA) IBOR Fallbacks Protocol have\nbeen set accordingly.2 There is no scenario in which a panel-based USD LIBOR will\ncontinue past June 2023, and nobody should expect it to.\nSeeking to provide the same kind of clear statement about supervisory\nexpectations, U.S. regulators issued supervisory guidance in November of last year.3 In a\nletter to the banking organizations that we regulate, the Federal Reserve Board, the\n2 See https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/10/IBOR-Fallbacks-LIBOR-\nCessation_Announcement_20210305.pdf\n3 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2027.htm\n\n- 3 -\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency noted that there are safety and soundness risks associated with the continued\nuse of USD LIBOR in new transactions after 2021. Accordingly, we have encouraged\nsupervised entities to stop new use of LIBOR as soon as is practicable and, in any event,\nby the end of this year. As with the statements about LIBOR’s end, there should be\ncomplete certainty about this guidance from U.S. regulators: after 2021, we believe that\ncontinued use of LIBOR in new contracts would create safety and soundness risks, and\nwe will examine bank practices accordingly.\nIt is helpful to think about these separate announcements as essential pieces of a\nmap, which, once put together, provide a complete picture of the path from here to\nLIBOR’s end. When that larger picture comes into focus, I think you can see clearly that\nwe have laid out a sensible way forward that provides certainty while also recognizing\nthe need to address legacy contracts in a way that makes sense in the U.S. context. These\nannouncements are absolutely not meant to support new LIBOR activity or continued\nbusiness as usual. Instead, they are meant to completely end the new use of LIBOR\nwhile allowing a significant portion of legacy contracts to roll off before the key dollar\nLIBOR tenors stop publication.\nThree years ago, the ARRC estimated that there were approximately $200 trillion\nin outstanding financial contracts using USD LIBOR as a reference rate. The ARRC also\nestimated that more than 80 percent of those contracts would mature by the end of this\nyear. If market participants had stopped new use of LIBOR at that time, we would today\nhave a considerably smaller amount of legacy LIBOR contracts. Instead, despite the\nwarnings of the official sector concerning LIBOR, use of USD LIBOR has actually\n\n- 4 -\nincreased in the intervening years. As a result, the ARRC now estimates that there are\ncurrently almost $223 trillion in financial contracts based on USD LIBOR. Many of\nthose contracts have better fallback language than was once the case; the ARRC has spent\nconsiderable time in recommending more robust fallback language for new LIBOR cash\nproducts , and ISDA has now published its IBOR protocol, which has allowed market\nparticipants to incorporate more robust fallbacks into legacy derivatives. Still, given the\nsheer size of current exposures, we cannot afford to ignore the problems that an abrupt\ncessation of USD LIBOR would cause.\nThe path we have laid out—ending new use of LIBOR while providing further\ntime for existing contracts to mature—will give businesses, consumers, and all parties to\na contract more certainty that they can count on the original terms of a legacy contract\nuntil mid-2023. The ARRC’s updated estimates indicate that 67 percent of current\nLIBOR exposures will mature before mid-2023.i Although more would roll off if the end\ndate was further off, the IBA has stated clearly that it will not have sufficient panel bank\nsubmissions after June 2023 to publish LIBOR on a representative basis. June 2023\nrepresents a realistic outcome that will allow the majority of outstanding contacts to\nmature.\nOf course, we will also be left with the 33 percent of contracts that will not\nmature before mid-2023, an estimated $74 trillion in financial contracts.i Some of these\ncontracts should already have workable fallback language, but many still have no\neffective means to replace LIBOR upon its cessation. We continue to believe that\nlegislation is a necessary step to address these contracts. The ARRC has proposed\nlegislation with the state of New York, which may be appropriate given that many of the\n\n- 5 -\ncontracts that the ARRC’s proposal seeks to address are governed by New York law.\nMembers of Congress are also considering federal legislative solutions, and we support\nthese efforts as well.\nOf course, although it is vital, we cannot take any legislative solution for granted\nuntil it becomes law. The continued publication of LIBOR will help provide more time\nto make sure that we are fully ready with the necessary solutions when LIBOR stops. It\nwill also potentially allow other jurisdictions more time to craft their own legislative\nproposals. The European Union has already passed legislation that is similar to the\nARRC’s proposals. The United Kingdom is considering legislation that would grant the\nFCA powers to require IBA to produce a synthetic LIBOR, and the FCA has said that it\nwill consult on using these powers to require IBA to produce synthetic sterling LIBOR\nand Japanese yen LIBOR rates. For legacy LIBOR contracts governed by U.S. law, we\nbelieve that a U.S. legislative solution, be it in New York or at the federal level,\nrepresents the best solution. I should stress that no one should assume that there will be a\nsynthetic USD LIBOR.\nHaving talked about the end game for legacy contracts, let me return to the other\nkey component of the plan, winding down new use of dollar LIBOR. Earlier this month,\nthe Federal Reserve Board issued supervisory letter SR 21-7 instructing examiners to\nassess supervised institutions’ plans to transition away from the use of LIBOR.4 This\nguidance reinforces our supervisory statement from last November (SR 20-27), which\nhighlighted that continued use of LIBOR in new contracts would create safety and\nsoundness concerns after 2021 and highlighted the supervisory focus on firms’ ending the\n4 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2107.htm\n\n- 6 -\nissuance of new LIBOR contracts as soon as is practicable and, in any event, by\nDecember 31, 2021.\nSR 21-7 outlines factors that examiners should consider in assessing transition\nefforts and states that, if supervised firms are not making adequate progress in\ntransitioning away from LIBOR, examiners should consider issuing supervisory findings\nor taking other supervisory actions. Recognizing that smaller banks generally are less\nreliant on LIBOR, we have tailored our supervisory approach for community banks and\nfirms under $100 billion in assets.\nExaminers are looking closely to see whether firms have comprehensively\nassessed their exposure to LIBOR and, if exposures are sizable and complex, have strong\nplans in place. Firms should prepare for the LIBOR transition with respect to six key\nareas:\n1. Transition plan: The detail and scope of each firm’s transition plans should be\ncommensurate with its LIBOR exposures. Large firms should have a LIBOR\ntransition plan with defined timelines, a governance structure that clearly\ndefines roles and responsibilities, and an appropriate budget and resources to\nsupport the plan.\n2. Financial exposure and risk assessment: Each firm should accurately measure\nits financial exposures to LIBOR and report them to senior management.\nLarge firms should measure their exposures frequently—for example,\nquarterly—identifying exposures by product, counterparty, and business line\nand identifying the proportion of exposures that will run off before the\nrelevant LIBOR tenor ceases.\n\n- 7 -\n3. Operational preparedness: Each firm should identify any internal and vendor-\nprovided systems and models that use LIBOR as an input and make necessary\nadjustments to provide for their smooth operation ahead of LIBOR’s\ncessation.\n4. Legal contract preparedness: New LIBOR contracts should have robust\nfallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate, and\neach firm should develop a plan regarding the steps it will take to modify any\ncontracts that may be negatively affected by LIBOR’s cessation.\n5. Communication: Communication with customers and counterparties is\nespecially important and should be an area of keen focus during 2021.\nCommensurate with its exposures, each firm should communicate to its\ncounterparties, clients, consumers, and internal stakeholders about the LIBOR\ntransition. Each firm should ensure compliance with requirements of the\nTruth in Lending Act and other applicable laws and regulations.\n6. Oversight: Finally, each firm should provide regular updates to senior\nmanagement. Large firms should provide timely updates to the board of\ndirectors, and the board should hold senior management accountable for\neffectively implementing the firm’s plan.\nWhile we will examine against all of these points, what is most important this\nyear is that firms should end new use of LIBOR. The extension of the most-used dollar\nLIBOR tenors should allow firms to focus in the near term on using alternative rates in\nnew contracts and to deal more intensively with legacy contracts later. Market\nparticipants have had many years to prepare for the end of LIBOR, yet over the last few\n\n- 8 -\nyears they have actually increased use of LIBOR. Given the announcements of the FCA\nand the IBA, that must obviously change this year – that’s just the laws of physics -- and\nthe firms we supervise should be aware of the intense supervisory focus we are placing\non their transition, and especially on their plans to end issuance of new contracts by year-\nend.\nBefore I turn this over to Tom Wipf and Tushar Morzaria, let me thank them for\nall of the work that they have done with the ARRC and the Working Group on Sterling\nRisk-Free Rates. There is more work ahead for both groups, but these announcements\nlay out a clear framework that will help everyone understand exactly what should now to\nbe done.\ni Note: This speech was updated on April 7, 2021. The original version of this speech stated that “The\nARRC’s updated estimates indicate that 60 percent of current LIBOR exposures will mature before mid-\n2023” and was updated to 67 percent; and “Of course, we will also be left with the 40 percent of contracts\nthat will not mature before mid-2023, an estimated $90 trillion in financial contracts” was updated to 33\npercent and $74 trillion.",

Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nChair\nFinancial Stability Board\nat\nFinancial Stability Board Workshop on Pre-Positioning, Ring-Fencing, and Market\nFragmentation\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nSeptember 26, 2019\n\nRegulatory and supervisory colleagues, members of the Financial Stability\nBoard’s (FSB) Resolution Steering Group (ReSG) and Standing Committee on\nSupervisory and Regulatory Cooperation (SRC), representatives from academia, and the\nprivate sector: Thank you for being here, and for taking part in today’s workshop on pre-\npositioning, ring-fencing, and market fragmentation. I particularly want to thank Ryozo\nHimino, our new SRC chair, for his leadership in highlighting these issues; his remarks\nand efforts around market fragmentation are especially timely, as we begin the difficult\ntask of examining the post-crisis reforms. I also want to recognize and thank Sir Jon\nCunliffe, for proposing a workshop where we can explore these issues together; as he\nrecently said, quoting Ben Franklin, “we must all hang together, or most assuredly, we\nshall all hang separately.”1 Finally, I want to thank the leadership and staff of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia, for not just accommodating us, but making us feel\nwelcome in the nation’s first capital.2\nThe Philadelphia Fed is three blocks north, and another three west, from the\nbirthplace of American central banking. That birthplace is not the site of the First or\nSecond Banks of the United States, whose neoclassical headquarters are still standing and\nopen to the public.3 Instead, the first national bank sat just west of North 3rd Street and\nChestnut: the Bank of North America.4\n1 John Bartlett, Familiar Quotations (10th ed., 1919), https://www.bartleby.com/100/245.21.html.\n2 U.S. Senate, “The Nine Capitals of the United States” (citing Robert Fortenbaugh, The Nine Capitals of\nthe United States (1948), at 9),\nhttps://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_item/Nine_Capitals_of_the_United_States.htm.\n3 National Park Service, “First Bank of the United States” (October 18, 2016),\nhttps://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/places-firstbank.htm; National Park Service, “Second Bank\nof the United States” (April 12, 2017), https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/places-\nsecondbank.htm.\n4 Library of Congress, “Bank of North America, 305-307 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Philadelphia\nCounty, PA” (documentation compiled after 1933), https://www.loc.gov/item/pa1098/.\n\n- 2 -\nIts charter came from a new nation on the verge of bankruptcy.5 Six years of war\nhad drained an already-short supply of domestic specie, a necessity for international\ntrade. So little specie remained in the treasury that the “continentals,” used to finance the\nwar, had depreciated to about two cents on the dollar. The United States lacked a\ncommon, sound currency to settle its debts, and without federal authority to levy taxes, it\nlacked a ready path back to solvency. (Another Franklin quote applies: “Glass, China,\nand Reputation, are easily crack’d, and never well mended.”6)\nIn desperation, the Founding Fathers made a successful Philadelphia merchant,\nRobert Morris, their new superintendent of finance. Drawing on a plan from Alexander\nHamilton, Morris proposed a new institution, with the power to issue notes backed by\n$400,000 in private capital. When it could muster only a fraction of that in subscriptions,\nthe country turned overseas. A substantial loan in French bullion financed the new bank\nand saved the republic from collapse. America could declare independence, but she\ncould not secure it without credit from abroad.\nThat lesson was both hard earned and short-lived. Four years later, a new\nPennsylvania legislature claimed that dividends to foreign creditors were draining much-\nneeded specie from America’s shores. James Wilson, Pennsylvania’s representative to\nthe Continental Congress, wrote an impassioned legal and political defense of the bank,\nemphasizing its role in international commerce. He quoted Sir James Steuart, one of the\nworld’s first economists, calling banking “that branch of credit which best deserves the\n5 This account is derived from Edward S. Kaplan, The Bank of the United States and the American\nEconomy (1999), at 3-10, and from Janet Wilson, “The Bank of North America and Pennsylvania Politics:\n1781-1787,” 66(1) Penn. Magazine of History and Biography 3 (Jan. 1942),\nhttp://www.jstor.org/stable/20087443.\n6 Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard’s Almanack (1732), 160.\n\n- 3 -\nattention of a statesman.”7 It wasn’t enough. The charter was repealed—a pattern that\nwould repeat with two more national banks, with even more disruptive results.8\nInternational banking is a very different enterprise than two centuries ago, but it\nstill “best deserves the attention of a statesman.” Cross-border finance is an essential part\nof the international economic infrastructure. It is a conduit to direct financial resources to\ntheir most efficient use, regardless of national borders. It channels capital to places and\nprojects it could not otherwise reach, fostering innovation, international ties, and the\nexchange of ideas. At its best, it is also self-sustaining, extending the financial and\ntechnical capacity of emerging economies, and expanding their role in the global\neconomy.\nAmerica’s experience, however, reminds us that the benefits of international\nbanking are not automatic. Cross-border finance is a common good, and like any\ncommon good, sustaining it requires collective action from a range of parties.9 These\nparties are both public and private, elected and appointed—not just central banks and\nsupervisors, but finance ministries, legislatures, and commercial banking organizations.\nEach has a distinct mission and a duty to serve a distinct set of stakeholders. When those\nduties conflict, trust alone cannot sustain cooperation; only a careful configuration that\n7 James Wilson, Considerations on the Bank of North-America (1785) (quoting Sir James Steuart, An\nInquiry into the Principles of Political Oeconomy [sic]: Being an Essay on the Science of Domestic Policy\nin Free Nations, in which are particularly considered Population, Agriculture, Trade, Industry, Money,\nCoin, Interest, Circulation, Banks, Exchange, Public Credit, and Taxes,” Vol. 2 (1770), at 358).\nSupporters also produced more popular literature. In a satire in the Pennsylvania Gazette, a critic of the\nbank complains: “All honest men should support their country, by cheating their creditors: Creditors are\nthe bane of a young country: So here is confusion to them all—a tender-law forever!” Janet Wilson, supra\nnote 5, at 12 quoting Pennsylvania Gazette (September 21, 1785).\n8 Unlike its successors, the bank’s headquarters no longer stands; it was demolished sometime after 1959.\nSee Library of Congress, supra note 4.\n9 See Elinor Ostrom and Oliver E. Williamson, “Beyond Markets and States: Polycentric Governance of\nComplex Economic Systems,” Nobel Prize Lecture delivered at Aula Magna, Stockholm University,\nStockholm, Sweden (December 8, 2009), https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-\nsciences/2009/ostrom/lecture/.\n\n- 4 -\nrecognizes mutual and separate interests can do so. With such a configuration, the cross-\nborder financial system can be open, stable, and safe; without it, the system can become\nunpredictable and dangerous.\n“Ring-fencing” often serves as a catch-all for this dynamic, capturing any and all\nimpediments to the free flow of finance, however and whenever they arise. However, as\nI have noted previously, that term obscures a distinction that plays a vital role in cross-\nborder finance—between prudently placing a constrained amount of capital and liquidity\nwithin jurisdictions and legal entities before a crisis, and competitively seizing capital\nand liquidity during a crisis. This distinction determines more than just the possibility of\nan orderly cross-border resolution. Pre-positioning of resources—when properly\ncalibrated—can also provide the certainty that lets cross-border finance occur at all.\nCertainty is the critical ingredient in achieving the careful configuration of\ninterests I described. Financial institutions need some certainty about the requirements\nthey face by participating in cross-border activity. Supervisors need some certainty about\nsafety and soundness, not just of the foreign banks they host, but of their domestic banks\noperating overseas. Creditors and investors need some certainty that a foreign authority\nwon’t abrogate their contracts. Elected officials need certainty that their constituents are\nnot unfairly disadvantaged. All these parties—and the public—need some certainty that\nthe resources promised to them won’t disappear at the first sign of stress.\nCertainty fosters financial stability. It supports clear monitoring and thoughtful\nplanning, by both institutions and their regulators. It signals the clear intention of\nauthorities to cooperate, during normal times and in an emergency. It increases the odds\nthat a cross-border financial institution will keep operating through a crisis. It fosters\n\n- 5 -\nmore and deeper cross-border financial activity, by decreasing its risks and increasing its\nbenefits, both to participants and to the global economy.\nCertainty does require tradeoffs. None of us has perfect foresight. If we pursue\ncertainty to the complete exclusion of any flexibility to respond to future events, we may\nend up undermining our ultimate goal: maintaining a financial system that is resilient to\nunexpected shocks.\nHowever, this workshop begins by revisiting the consequences when certainty\ndisappears. These consequences were on full display during the financial crisis—the\ncollapse in cross-border activity, when trust broke down; the rush to secure assets and\nprioritize domestic claims; the ambiguous relationship between banks’ resources and\ntheir needs; and the long, halting return to a more integrated financial system. Today’s\npanelists will also revisit the steps that the international community took to address those\nconsequences. The workshop also examines the effect those steps have had on cross-\nborder financial intermediation and the management of global financial institutions. The\npanelists will provide their views on whether we have achieved the right balance among\ncertainty, the kinds of economic opportunity that cross-border finance promotes, and the\nflexibility to manage through a future disruption.\nThis decade-long account is the latest chapter in a much older story, whose moral\nis clear: in regulating cross-border finance, expectations matter. When capital and\nliquidity requirements are imposed only at the level of the consolidated institution, they\ncreate a good deal of flexibility, but they cannot reassure host supervisors that sufficient\nresources will truly be available in a time of need. Opaque, vague, and uncertain\nrequirements for pre-positioning and reporting, and lack of clarity on when they may be\n\n- 6 -\nimposed, make compliance difficult, costly, and potentially disruptive. Pre-positioning,\nat levels that go beyond what may be needed in a given jurisdiction in stress, can also\ncreate rigidity and limit growth opportunities. The consequence of getting the balance\nbetween these considerations wrong is a less integrated and less resilient global financial\nsystem.\nThese details are as complex as they are important, and I commend my FSB\ncolleagues, particularly the ReSG, for exploring them in the context of the too-big-to-fail\nreforms.10 The FSB’s work brings together a wide range of experts to better understand\nthe intent, implementation, and effects of our post-crisis work. As with market\nfragmentation, the broader context of this work matters immensely, including the desired\nimpact of the reforms and their anticipated and unanticipated consequences.\nWithin the Federal Reserve Board, we are considering similar questions—not\nonly what level of loss-absorbing capacity is appropriate for the material legal entities\nwithin a large, cross-border financial institution, but also what tools we and other\nsupervisors use to ensure such capacity exists.\nThe roles that supervision and regulation play in addressing these issues are\nimportant. There are clear advantages to setting liquidity and capital pre-positioning\nrequirements through regulation. Regulation ensures consistency and clarity; provides a\nconduit for improvement, through public notice and comment; and offers a clear rational\nbasis for any measures imposed. There is also a role for supervision, not just in\naddressing the particular conditions at a given firm, but in generating and sharing better\n10 Financial Stability Board, “FSB launches evaluation of too-big-to-fail reforms and invites feedback from\nstakeholders,” news release (May 23, 2019), https://www.fsb.org/2019/05/fsb-launches-evaluation-of-too-\nbig-to-fail-reforms-and-invites-feedback-from-stakeholders/.\n\n- 7 -\ninformation on how stress may manifest, not just in the firm overall, but in each\njurisdiction where it operates. More information sharing by home to host supervisors\nmay help convince host supervisors that they need fewer pre-positioned resources in their\njurisdiction.\nToday’s workshop is a worthy step forward in discussing these issues, and\ntowards preserving and expanding the benefits of cross-border finance. We are all\nultimately responsible for creating the conditions where capital can flow freely, giving\nrise to genuine opportunity and sustainable growth. We should patiently and thoughtfully\nexamine how best to create those conditions. As William Penn put it, “business can\nnever be well done, that is not well understood: Which cannot be without patience.” 11 I\nlook forward to engaging together, rigorously and openly, in the work ahead.\n11 William Penn, Some Fruits of Solitude in Reflections and Maxims (1682), 399.",

Insurers occupy a meaningful\nrole in the financial sector, meeting the financial needs of consumers and businesses with a\ndistinct business model that calls for appropriately tailored policies.\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve has a role as consolidated supervisor of some insurers,\na role we continually strive to fulfill in the most appropriate and tailored manner. The Federal\nReserve also participates as a member of “Team USA”--together with the state insurance\nsupervisors, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and the Federal\nInsurance Office (FIO)--in the international insurance standard-setting process, including the\nongoing development of an insurance capital standard (ICS) for internationally active insurance\ngroups. In my remarks today, I will touch on these topics. In the hope of providing greater\ntransparency, I will also provide some updates on the Board’s forthcoming proposal on insurance\nholding company capital requirements, often referred to as the Building Block Approach (BBA).\nThe Insurance Industry’s Importance in the Economy\nThe U.S. insurance market, the largest in the world, generated over $2 trillion of direct\nwritten premium in 2017, over 10 percent of the total U.S. gross domestic product for that year\nand the highest direct premium volume in the years following the financial crisis.1 Over a\n1 Federal Insurance Office, Department of the Treasury, Annual Report on the Insurance Industry (September 2018),\n65-70, https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fio/reports-and-notices/Documents/2018_FIO_Annual_Report.pdf; see,\nfor example, National Association of Insurance Commissioners, State Insurance Regulation: Key Facts and Market\nTrends (2018), 4, https://www.naic.org/state_report_cards/report_card_dc.pdf.

In 2017, nearly 65 percent of the insurance industry’s $6.5 trillion in\ncash and invested assets was from the life insurance industry.3 Over 70 percent of life insurers’\ninvested assets were held in bonds,4 including corporate bonds, which fuel growth in the real\neconomy. Historically, insurers have been relatively conservative, buy-and-hold investors. This\nhas served both the industry and the economy well.5\nAs we all appreciate, life insurance and annuities are in many ways a spread business,\nwith investment of premium dollars funding later payments to policyholders. In the years since\nthe financial crisis, the insurance industry has shown resilience, with capital and surplus\nincreasing at an average annual growth rate of 4.1 percent since 2007.6 With an approach to\ninvestment and financial management that focuses on the long-term, the U.S. insurance industry\ncontinues to play a valued role in the financial sector.\n2 FIO 2018 Annual Report, 65-70; see, for example, NAIC 2018 Key Facts and Market Trends, 4.\n3 National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Capital Markets Special Report, “U.S. Insurance Industry’s\nCash and Invested Assets Rise 5.1% in 2017,” (August 16, 2018), 2,\nhttps://www.naic.org/capital_markets_archive/180816.pdf.

The Dodd-Frank Act\ngave the Federal Reserve regulatory responsibilities for insurance holding companies that choose\nto own a federally insured depository institution and those designated by the Financial Stability\nOversight Council. The insurance thrift holding companies supervised by the Federal Reserve\nrepresent just under 10 percent of U.S. insurance industry assets and span a wide range of sizes,\nstructures, and business activities.7 With a core focus on ensuring the safety and soundness of\nthe supervised insurance institutions, and protecting their subsidiary depository institutions, the\nBoard aims to continue fulfilling its role as consolidated supervisor by tailoring its oversight to\nthe insurance business of the supervised firms, complementing the existing work of state\ninsurance supervisors.\nThe Federal Reserve has aimed to develop policies that are insurance-centric and\nappropriate for insurance risks. For instance, the Board’s advance notice of proposed\nrulemaking (ANPR) on insurance capital requirements set out two frameworks for capital\nstandards that are each unlike the Board’s capital rules for bank holding companies.8 The BBA,\nas set out in the ANPR, was fashioned as a framework that builds upon the regulatory capital\nrules of subsidiaries’ functional regulators--state or foreign insurance regulators for insurance\nsubsidiaries and federal banking regulators for insured depository institutions--to provide a\nconsolidated capital requirement. We appreciate the comments we have received, including\nfrom the ACLI and other interested parties, and have worked hard to reflect the perspectives of\n7 See FIO 2018 Annual Report, 66.\n8 Capital Requirements for Supervised Institutions Significantly Engaged in Insurance Activities, 81 Fed. Reg.\n38,631 (June 14, 2016), https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/14/2016-14004/capital-requirements-\nfor-supervised-institutions-significantly-engaged-in-insurance-activities.\n\n- 4 -\ncommenters in developing the framework. We expect to publish a formal proposal in the not-\ntoo-distant future, and I will provide a high-level preview here today.\nThe Board’s Approach to a Capital Standard for Insurance Holding Companies\nIt is worth sharing some further context for the Board’s development of the BBA before\npreviewing its design and key attributes. As outlined in the ANPR, the Board strove to develop a\nframework that encompassed all material risks across the entire supervised enterprise. We\nfavored an approach that is as standardized as possible, rather than relying on internal capital\nmodels of supervised firms, in order to promote transparency and facilitate comparability across\nfirms. We also aimed to strike an efficient balance between simplicity and risk sensitivity in\norder to ensure accurate reflection of risks while minimizing regulatory burden. To further limit\nregulatory burden, the Board envisioned a BBA that would rely upon existing U.S. accounting\nand capital frameworks to the greatest extent possible.\nIn designing the BBA, there were, of course, a number of ideas for how we should\nconstruct this framework. At the outset, we decided against applying the Board’s bank holding\ncompany capital rules to supervised insurance firms at the enterprise level, in light of the very\ndifferent business models of insurance and banking.\nWe considered that a capital approach akin to the European Solvency II framework\nwould not adequately incorporate U.S. accounting frameworks that, relative to other approaches,\ntend to be less prone to volatility and procyclicality. Volatility in a valuation approach that is\nused in a capital standard can especially affect long-term contracts, with the potential for\nunintended consequences on the ability of insurers to provide long-term life insurance and\nretirement planning products. Moreover, use of an approach that entails more reliance on\n\n- 5 -\ninternal models could undermine our desire for consistent, cross-firm comparisons and can lack\ntransparency to market participants and supervisors.\nAnother framework that could have informed the development of the BBA is the ICS, but\nmuch of ICS’s evolution has been in the direction of a valuation method and overall framework\nthat reflect approaches used elsewhere in the world. This may not be optimal for the United\nStates insurance market. Importantly, the BBA will appropriately reflect, rather than unduly\npenalize, long duration liabilities in the United States, facilitating the continued robustness of\nproduct availability in the U.S. that contributes to greater financial security for Americans. In\nthe U.S., an aggregation-based approach like the BBA could also strike a better balance between\nentity-level, and enterprise-wide, supervision of insurance firms.\nHaving spoken enough about what the proposed BBA is not, I should spend some time\npreviewing what it is, and I suspect there is some interest in this room about that topic.\nPreview of the Building Block Approach\nThe proposed BBA is an approach to a consolidated capital requirement that considers all\nmaterial risks within the enterprise by aggregating the capital positions of companies under an\ninsurance holding company, after making some adjustments and scaling them to a common\ncapital regime. To streamline implementation burden while reflecting all material risks, I think it\nwould make sense to use the NAIC’s insurance capital framework as the common capital regime.\nAs the name implies, the BBA constructs “building blocks”--or groupings of entities in\nthe supervised firm--that are covered under the same capital regime. These building blocks are\nthen used to calculate combined, enterprise-level capital resources and requirements. In each\nbuilding block, the BBA generally applies the capital regime for that block to the subsidiaries in\n\n- 6 -\nthat block. For instance, in a life insurance building block, subsidiaries within this block would\nbe treated in the BBA the way they would be treated under life insurance capital requirements.\nIn a depository institution building block, subsidiaries would be subject to bank\nregulatory capital requirements. The financial crisis taught us that certain activities in an\ninsurance enterprise--for instance, derivatives activity--could pose risks to the enterprise that\nmay not always be reflected through affiliates subject to capital regimes. To address regulatory\ngaps and arbitrage risks, like those made manifest in the financial crisis, the BBA generally\nwould apply bank regulatory capital requirements to nonbank/non-insurance building blocks.\nOnce the enterprise’s entities are grouped into building blocks, and capital resources and\nrequirements are computed for each building block, the enterprise’s capital position is produced\nby generally adding up the capital positions of each building block.\nIn order for the BBA’s aggregation to function appropriately, and to reflect the Board’s\nsupervisory objectives, the BBA needs to make certain adjustments to the building blocks. For\ninstance, to compare similar activities across building blocks, the BBA would apply insurance\ncapital rules consistently, without regard to permitted accounting practices granted by an\nindividual state, thus uniformly applying statutory accounting principles as set forth by the\nNAIC. Measures to avoid double-counting, including double-leverage, that could arise from\nintercompany transactions would be built into the BBA’s aggregation process. Other areas\nwhere adjustments would be made include provisions to comply with the Collins Amendment of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act9--for instance, allowing only instruments meeting the criteria under the\n9 The so-called Collins Amendment (Section 171) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires, among other things, that the\nBoard establish consolidated, minimum risk-based capital requirements that are not less than the current generally\napplicable capital requirements for insured depository institutions nor quantitatively lower than the generally\napplicable capital requirements for these institutions in effect at the time of the Dodd-Frank Act’s enactment.\nA 2014 amendment to this provision set out that, in applying these minimum capital requirements, the Board is not\nrequired to include a person regulated by a state insurance regulator or a regulated foreign subsidiary or affiliate of\nsuch person engaged in the business of insurance.\n\n- 7 -\nBoard’s bank capital rules to qualify as capital for an insurance holding company--and technical\nadjustments.\nAggregation requires a further step after adjustments are applied to each building block, a\nstep that is frequently termed “scaling.” Two building blocks under two different capital regimes\ncannot simply be added together if, as is frequently the case, each regime has a different scale for\nits ratios and thresholds. The BBA proposes to scale and equate capital positions in different\nregimes through analyzing historical defaults under those regimes.\nOnce the insurance holding company’s aggregate capital position is calculated, the BBA\nwould impose a minimum requirement that is calibrated to be consistent with the Board’s role to\nensure that the risks of the enterprise do not present undue risk to the safety and soundness of the\ndepository institution. Our goal with the BBA is to capture all material risk of each supervised\norganization, leverage existing legal-entity standards, and minimize burden.\nIn developing the BBA, we have been mindful of the role that the insurance industry\nplays through its buy-and-hold, long-term approach to investments. A capital standard can have\nincentive effects, sometimes substantial. A capital standard that uses market-based valuation can\nintroduce volatility and procyclicality, and one that is excessively volatile or procyclical can\ninfluence a firm to veer away from a long-term perspective and concentrate instead on the short\nterm. This can have undesirable consequences, including diminishing product availability.\nIn contrast, a capital standard that is stable in its valuation, conservative in its design, and\nappropriately reflective of financial soundness can influence firms to plan for the long term,\nconsistent with the nature of life insurance and retirement products, and similarly invest for the\nlong term through assets like government and municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and\ninfrastructure. Moreover, a capital standard like the BBA that largely builds on state-based\n\n- 8 -\ninsurance capital standards would tend to reinforce, rather than frustrate, the important role that\ninsurers’ investments play in our economy.\nEngagement with the NAIC\nIn developing the BBA, we also have been mindful of the potential interaction with the\nvaluable work of another Team USA member, the NAIC, to develop its Group Capital\nCalculation (GCC). We also applaud the NAIC’s efforts to address life insurers’ potential\nliquidity risks and develop a liquidity stress testing framework for large life insurers through the\nNAIC’s Macro Prudential Initiative.\nThe primary functional supervisor for insurance companies for which the Board is\nconsolidated supervisor is a state insurance regulator. It is just good policy for the authorities\nthat mutually supervise firms to coordinate efforts in order to streamline, seek harmony, and\nminimize inconsistencies.\nTo that end, in August of 2017, the Federal Reserve initiated contact with the NAIC and\nstate insurance supervisors to engage in dialogue with the aim of achieving consistency,\nwherever possible, between the two capital frameworks under development. We have met\nfrequently and engaged substantively with representatives of the NAIC and the states. Input\nfrom the NAIC and the states has helped identify areas of commonality while remaining\nrespectful of the somewhat different objectives of the relevant supervisory bodies and legal\nenvironments.\nSome differences between the Board’s BBA and the NAIC’s GCC may arise. There are\nreasons for this. The Board’s mandate includes protection of a federally insured depository\ninstitution and the attendant safety-and-soundness objectives. As to a firm’s insurance\n\n- 9 -\nsubsidiaries, the states’ focus is on policyholder protection, while the Board serves as the overall\nfirm’s consolidated safety-and-soundness supervisor.\nThe Board’s capital standard also must comport with federal law for insurance holding\ncompanies with depository institution subsidiaries, while the NAIC’s GCC interfaces primarily\nwith state laws. Moreover, because of the characteristics of the current population of insurance\nthrift holding companies, the BBA currently would only need to scale between two regimes: the\nNAIC’s insurance risk-based capital regime and federal bank capital rules. By contrast, the firms\nto which the GCC may apply can encompass operations in a number of non-U.S. jurisdictions,\ncalling for a much more extensive set of scaling parameters.\nThe NAIC has announced its plan to conduct a field test of the GCC this spring.\nLikewise, to be transparent, gather additional input, and provide a valuable test of our approach,\nthe Federal Reserve intends to conduct a quantitative impact study of the BBA as part of our\nrulemaking process. We hope supervised firms will take advantage of this opportunity to\ncontribute valuable information and feedback on our approach.\nOur dialogue with the NAIC and state insurance regulators has been productive and\nhelpful in the BBA’s development. Moreover, this engagement has been helpful for Team\nUSA’s efforts in the international insurance standard-setting arena.\nThe Federal Reserve’s Advocacy in International Insurance Standard Setting\nIt is our intent that the Federal Reserve’s development of the BBA, together with the\nNAIC’s development of the GCC, will assist with Team USA’s advocacy of an aggregation\nmethod that can be deemed comparable to the ICS.\nIn 2013, through the Federal Reserve’s role as consolidated supervisor of certain insurers,\nwe joined the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), strengthening our\n\n- 10 -\ncollaboration with the other members of Team USA that continues to this day. The standards\nproduced through the IAIS are, of course, not binding upon the United States. However, it\nremains in our national interest to engage in the international insurance standards-development\nprocess so that it produces standards that are appropriate for the U.S. market and consumers and\nfor U.S. companies operating abroad. I see this philosophy as being important not only in the\nFederal Reserve’s engagement in the IAIS, but also with the broader Financial Stability Board.\nTeam USA’s collaboration is prominently visible in our advocacy at the IAIS. In order\nfor any form of an ICS to be implementable globally, it needs to be suitable for the U.S.\ninsurance market. The current core proposal in the ICS would face implementation challenges in\nthe United States. For instance, such a framework may fail to adequately account for U.S.\naccounting frameworks, both Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the\nNAIC’s Statutory Accounting Principles, introduce excessive volatility, and involve excessive\nreliance on supervised firms’ internal models.\nAmong other things, this motivates our advocacy of an aggregation alternative, and the\nuse of an alternative valuation method that derives from U.S. GAAP, in the ICS. Furthermore,\nwe support the collection of information on an aggregation-based approach that would reside\nwithin the ICS, and actively participate, together with other jurisdictions that espouse\naggregation-based approaches, in the development of such an approach for the ICS. Among\nother things, aggregation approaches bring advantages, including sensitivity to local products\nand risks. The BBA, in adding to Team USA’s work on aggregation methods with a tangible\nexample, can assist in our collective advocacy.\nIn sum, we remain committed to discharging our domestic authority responsibly and in a\nway that recognizes the unique business of insurance companies. Additionally, we will continue\n\n- 11 -\nto advocate for international insurance standards that promote a global level playing field and\nwork well for the U.S. insurance market.

Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nHOPE Global Forums\nAnnual Meeting\nAtlanta, Georgia\nMarch 26, 2018\n\n- 1 -\nGood evening. Thank you to John Bryant and Operation HOPE for inviting me today to\nopen the HOPE Global Forums.1 I commend our hosts for bringing together such an impressive\ngroup of speakers and attendees, diverse in their perspectives, yet all of whom share the vital\ngoal of advancing economic opportunity and inclusion. It is fitting that this event is being held\non the 50th anniversary of several notable events, including the publication of Dr. Martin Luther\nKing’s last book, Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community, which urged unity in order\nto create equal opportunity, and the enactment of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which enshrined\nour nation’s commitment to equal access to housing. These milestones remind us of the progress\nwe have made to date as well as the challenges that remain, and inspire us to persist in our\nefforts.\nThe conference has a robust agenda ahead. Over the next few days, you will be\ndiscussing many issues relating to financial inclusion--such as housing, small businesses,\nworkforce participation, and other topics--to which we at the Federal Reserve share a\ncommitment, and that we view as critical to our mission. Our economy is stronger when\neveryone has a chance to contribute fully and share in our national prosperity. And I personally\nbelieve that financial inclusion helps us realize a founding notion of our country--that this is a\nplace where opportunity, innovation, and productivity are encouraged and rewarded. I’m\nparticularly pleased to see on the conference agenda a number of sessions on issues to which we,\nat the Federal Reserve, devote considerable attention: access to credit and financial inclusion for\nconsumers and small businesses. Conversations like these are enormously important to\n1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nunderstanding the challenges Americans face and why a multitude of voices and approaches are\nneeded to address them.\nIn my remarks today, I’d like to focus on the consumer protection and credit accessibility\naspects of financial inclusion, and some of the ways that the Federal Reserve promotes a fair and\ntransparent consumer financial services marketplace. In recent speeches, I have emphasized my\nview that we should aim for an effective safety and soundness regulatory approach that is as\nefficient, transparent, and simple as feasible.2 I consider these principles to apply equally to our\nconsumer protection supervision program; that is, we should also strive to promote consumer\nprotection with as much efficiency, transparency, and simplicity as possible. I believe that a\ncommitment to these principles is not only compatible with financial inclusion, but in fact helps\npromote it. Regulatory burden can make it harder for institutions to serve their customers and\ncommunities. This is especially the case for community banks and minority depository\ninstitutions (or MDIs), which play an important role in serving the needs of their local\ncommunities, including historically underserved populations. I’d also like to share some\nthoughts on an area to which I have devoted a good portion of my career: the importance of\nsmall business access to credit, which is a critical part of financial inclusion and a catalyst for\neconomic growth in local communities.\nFinancial Inclusion\nLet me start with the foundation of why financial inclusion is important. In broad terms,\nfinancial inclusion means access to affordable financial products and services that meet the needs\n2 See, e.g. Randal K. Quarles, “Early Observations on Improving the Effectiveness of Post-Crisis Regulation”\n(speech at the American Bar Association Banking Law Committee Annual Meeting, Washington, DC, January 19,\n2018), www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20180119a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nof individuals and businesses and that are delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.3 At\nthe Federal Reserve, we recognize the influence that financial inclusion has on the broader\neconomic performance of our country.4 Inclusion is essential to advancing the Federal Reserve’s\ngoal of promoting maximum employment, as well as supporting the stability of the financial\nsystem. Likewise, we support and share your goal of ensuring a fair and transparent marketplace\nfor financial products and services--including credit--that can provide a pathway toward\neconomic prosperity for all Americans.\nOverall, our economy is performing well, and unemployment is low. However, many\nhouseholds and communities continue to face financial challenges.5 Consider that more than\ntwo-thirds of white households own their homes as compared to less than half of African\nAmericans and Hispanics.6 And consider that all important human asset: education. One-third\nof white adults have at least a bachelor’s degree as compared to one in four African Americans\nand 17 percent of Hispanics.7 This matters because the advantages of a college degree for\n3 “Financial Inclusion,” World Bank, last modified April 5, 2017,\nwww.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview.\n4 See, e.g., Lael Brainard, “Why Opportunity and Inclusion Matter to America’s Economic Strength” (speech at the\nOpportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis,\nMay 22, 2017), www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20170522a.htm; Janet L.

See, e.g., “Have the Gains of the Economic Expansion Been Widely Shared?” in Monetary Policy Report\n(Washington: Board of Governors, June 21, 2016), p. 6,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20160621_mprfullreport.pdf.\n6 According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s “Quarterly Residential Vacancies and Homeownership” statistics for the\nfourth quarter of 2017, the homeownership rates by race were 72.7 percent for non-Hispanic white households; 42.1\npercent and 46.6 percent for black and Hispanic households, respectively; and 58.2 percent for Asian, Native\nHawaiian, and Pacific Islanders. See www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf.\n7 U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, 2017 Annual Social and Economic Supplement, “Educational\nAttainment in the United States: 2017,” December 14, 2017, www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/education-\nattainment/cps-detailed-tables.html.\n\n- 4 -\naccumulating income and wealth are lifelong and inter-generational.8 We likewise see evidence\nof financial disparities in the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Household Economics and\nDecisionmaking and Survey of Consumer Finances.9\nWhen individuals have unequal or insufficient access to financial products and services,\nsuch as credit, they may be deprived of a chance to fund an education, finance a business, or\npursue homeownership--opportunities that can provide greater financial security for themselves\nand their families and future generations. And as a nation, we are deprived of the benefits of\ntheir potential contributions to the economy.\nConsumer Protection\nIn the context of my earlier discussion of financial inclusion, federal consumer protection\nlaws are critical to ensuring consumers are treated fairly when offered financial products and\nservices. Discrimination and deception have no place in a fair and transparent marketplace.\nThese practices can close off opportunities and limit consumers’ ability to improve their\neconomic circumstances, including through access to homeownership and education.\nThe Federal Reserve’s consumer compliance supervisory program reflects our\ncommitment to promoting financial inclusion and ensuring that the financial institutions under\nour jurisdiction fully comply with applicable federal consumer protection laws and regulations.\nLet me give two examples involving the Federal Trade Commission Act’s prohibition against\nunfair or deceptive practices in products and services that will undoubtedly be familiar to the\naudience--student financial aid and mortgage lending. In the last few years, the Federal Reserve\n8 William R. Emmons, Ana H. Kent, and Lowell R.

The 2016 SHED is at www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm.\nSee also the Survey of Consumer Finances at www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nhas addressed deceptive practices in these areas through public enforcement actions that have\ncollectively benefited hundreds of thousands of consumers and provided millions of dollars in\nrestitution.\nIn the financial aid context, our actions required restitution for students who were not\ngiven full information about the potential fees and limitations associated with opening deposit\naccounts for their financial aid refunds.10 And in mortgage lending, our action required\nrestitution by a bank that had given borrowers the option to pay an additional amount to\npurchase discount points to lower their mortgage interest rate, but that did not actually provide\nthe reduced rate to many of those borrowers.11\nAs we mark the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, the fair lending laws remain\ncritical in fostering vibrant communities and a fair and transparent consumer financial services\nmarketplace. For all state member banks, we enforce the Fair Housing Act, and for banks of $10\nbillion dollars or less in assets, we also enforce the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Our\nexaminers evaluate fair lending risk at every consumer compliance exam. While we find that the\nvast majority of our institutions comply with the fair lending laws, we are committed to\nidentifying and remedying violations when they occur. Pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity\nAct, if we determine that a bank has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination, we refer\nthe matter to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Federal Reserve referrals have resulted in\nDOJ public actions in critical areas, such as redlining and mortgage-pricing discrimination. For\n10 In the Matter of Cole Taylor Bank, Docket Nos. 14-021-E-SMB, 14-021-CMP-SMB (July 1, 2014),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/enforcement20140701b.htm;\nIn the Matter of Higher One, Inc., Docket Nos. 15-026-E-I, 15-026-CMP-I (December 23, 2015),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/enforcement20151223a.htm;\nIn the Matter of Customers Bank, Docket Nos. 15-027-B-SM, 15-027-CMP-SM (December 6, 2016),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/enforcement20161206b.htm.\n11 In the Matter of Peoples Bank, Docket No. 17-041-B-SM (November 28, 2017),\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/enforcement20171128a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nexample, in our redlining referrals, the Federal Reserve found that the banks treated majority-\nminority areas less favorably than non-minority ones, such as through lending patterns,\nmarketing, and Community Reinvestment Act assessment-area delineations. For our mortgage-\npricing discrimination referrals, the Federal Reserve found that the banks charged higher prices\nto African American or Hispanic borrowers than it charged to non-Hispanic white borrowers and\nthat the higher prices could not be explained by legitimate pricing criteria.12\nEfficiency, Simplicity, and Transparency of Consumer Compliance Supervision\nConsumers deserve to be treated fairly, regardless of the size of the banking institution.\nYet, we can achieve this goal and still reduce regulatory burden through a balanced program of\ntailored and risk-focused supervision. Accordingly, we continue to seek opportunities to\npromote efficient, simple, and transparent supervision where possible, so that the institutions we\nsupervise can focus on finding solutions that work for all consumers and communities. In an\neffort to promote consumer compliance, our community bank supervisory program focuses our\nexaminations on the areas of highest consumer risk. This has improved the efficiency and\neffectiveness of our examinations and reduced regulatory burden for many community banks.\nBanks and consumers benefit when supervision is timely and effective.\nPut simply, our role as supervisors should not be to play “gotcha” with our banks, but to\nsupport their compliance efforts. The Interagency Consumer Compliance Ratings System,\npublished in November 2016, is an example of this approach.13 This guidance provides\nincentives for institutions to focus on managing their consumer compliance risks, preventing\n12 See, e.g., DOJ settlements with Midwest BankCentre, www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reaches-\nsettlement-midwest-bankcentre-regarding-alleged-lending; SunTrust Mortgage Inc., www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-\ndepartment-reaches-21-million-settlement-resolve-allegations-lending-discrimination; and Countrywide Financial\nCorporation, www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reaches-335-million-settlement-resolve-allegations-\nlending-discrimination.

Another\nexample of how we support our institutions is how we work with MDIs, which as I noted earlier,\nplay an important role in serving the needs of their local communities. We have dedicated\nReserve Bank staff who are in frequent contact with MDI leadership. Based on what we’ve\nlearned in the course of this outreach, we have expanded our Partnership for Progress--a program\nfor outreach and technical assistance to MDIs14--to include staff from our Community\nDevelopment function, and we have enhanced our MDI-related programing.\nOur commitment to transparency also includes a robust outreach program for banks. This\nincludes Consumer Compliance Outlook, a widely subscribed Federal Reserve System\npublication focused on consumer compliance issues, and its companion webinar series, Outlook\nLive.15 For example, in 2017, we sponsored an interagency webinar on fair lending supervision\nwith almost 6,000 registrants, a substantial share of which were community banks.16\nSmall Business Access to Credit\nAt the Federal Reserve, we view small business credit from several perspectives. For the\neconomy, small businesses need adequate and affordable credit in order to form, grow, and\nsucceed; otherwise they may underperform, slowing growth and employment. For many small\nbusiness owners, personal and business finances are intertwined. A well-functioning housing\nfinance market is vital for small business owners who may draw upon the equity in their homes\nto fund their businesses. Student loans may be needed to help fund the education that is\nimportant for both small business owners and their employees to boost profits and productivity.\nAnd, short-term credit matters for day-to-day management of cash flow, while longer-term credit\n14 See the partnership’s website at www.fedpartnership.gov.\n15 See https://consumercomplianceoutlook.org/ and https://consumercomplianceoutlook.org/outlook-live/.\n16 Federal Reserve System, “2017 Interagency Fair Lending Hot Topics,” Outlook Live webinar series, November\n16, 2017, https://consumercomplianceoutlook.org/outlook-live/2017/interagency-fair-lending-hot-topics/.\n\n- 8 -\nis essential for capital investments. So, entrepreneurs--just like consumers--need access to a\nvariety of credit sources.\nRecently, I had the pleasure of meeting a group of small businesses from across the\ncountry. By “small,” I mean some of these companies have just a handful of employees. The\ngroup included owners of a catering company from Dallas, a mechanical engineering company\nfrom Philadelphia, a marketing consulting firm from Cleveland, a combination bar and bakery\nfrom Brooklyn, and a gluten-free bakery from my hometown, Salt Lake City.\nThey shared with me the joys of running their own businesses, of creating jobs, and of\nproviding for their families as well as creating opportunities for their employees. They also\nspoke of their challenges, which I’m sure are familiar to many of you in this room. For one, the\nowners wear many hats, including CEO, chief operating officer, chief finance officer, head of\nsales and marketing, and some--quite literally--chief bottle washer. They also spoke of the day-\nto-day difficulties of finding, training, and retaining employees. And, they raised the challenges\nthey often face in gaining access to working capital, the lifeblood to sustaining and growing their\nbusinesses.\nThe anecdotes I heard touched on three related trends we have been observing in the\nsmall business credit environment. First, although lending standards have eased since the\nrecession and the financial condition of businesses has improved, some small business credit\nneeds, especially for the smallest of firms and minority small business owners, continue to go\nunmet. According to a 2016 Small Business Credit Survey conducted by our 12 Federal Reserve\nBanks, some small businesses still face persistent credit gaps, even though they often seek credit\nin small amounts. Of the firms that apply for credit, more than two-thirds apply for less than\n\n- 9 -\n$100,000, with substantial numbers of these applying for less than $25,000.17 However, smaller\nfirms often struggle to qualify for bank credit, and among firms that were denied, low credit\nscores and insufficient credit history were the most frequently cited reasons. In addition, our\nsurvey suggests that some low-credit-risk minority- and women-owned firms are less likely than\nlow-risk white-owned and male-owned firms to receive financing; and if they are approved, it is\nfor less than the amount sought.18\nSecond, there have been shifts in the composition of commercial bank lending to small\nbusinesses. Large banks’ share of small business lending has grown, especially among the\nsmallest loans. This represents a change from 20 years ago when small businesses relied more\non a relationship with local community banks for access to credit. For loans under $100,000,\nsmall banks of less than $1 billion in assets now hold a 19 percent share, down from 60 percent\ntwo decades ago. Today, it is the largest banks--those with greater than $50 billion in assets--\nthat account for more than 60 percent. Some of this trend may be due to industry consolidation,\nwhich has reduced the number of very small banks.\nThe composition of credit offered also is shifting. Loans entail high fixed costs that are\nroughly the same regardless of whether a loan is for $100,000 or $1 million, reducing the\nprofitability of smaller-dollar loans.19 Our data suggest that the growing share of small business\n17 While there are many working definitions of “small,” figures from the Small Business Credit Survey (SBCS) use\nfirms with less than 500 employees as a proxy for small businesses. Some 28 percent are seeking credit in amounts\nless than $25,000 and 42 percent reported seeking between $25,000 and $100,000. The SBCS is available at\nwww.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/2016/SBCS-Report-EmployerFirms-2016.pdf.\n18 According to special analyses of the Joint Federal Reserve Banks’ Small Business Credit Survey, among low-\ncredit-risk firms, 60 percent of minority firms that were approved received only partial funding, whereas 68 percent\nof low-risk, non-minority firms were approved for the full amount of financing requested. Women-owned firms also\nreported a funding gap. Among low-credit-risk firms, 48 percent of women-owned firms received all of the\nfinancing requested, compared to 57 percent of men-owned firms. Reports are available at\nwww.newyorkfed.org/smallbusiness/small-business-credit-survey-employer-firms-2016.\n19 BAI Banking Strategies, “Making Small Loans Profitably,” July 7, 2015, www.bai.org/banking-strategies/article-\ndetail/making-small-business-loans-profitably.\n\n- 10 -\nlending at larger banks may be partly due to their use of automated underwriting for credit\ncards.20 By providing credit cards, banks are expanding credit available to small businesses;\nhowever, some small business advocates note that this form of credit is generally more expensive\nand lacks the flexibility of other products.21 For example, personal or business credit cards may\nbe suitable for purchasing supplies, but not for payroll. In addition, this automated approach\nmay be more “cookie cutter,” meaning that firms that don’t meet standard lending criteria may\nnot qualify.22\nThese developments have created a space for the third trend we have been observing--the\nemergence of nonbank online alternative lenders that provide small-dollar business credit. For\nexample, some of the large technology firms are providing credit, at a rapidly growing pace, to\ntheir built-in customer base of merchants. Several of the businesses I met with mentioned they\nhad turned to nonbank online lenders after being turned down by banks. Some online lenders\nobtain access to a prospective borrower’s accounting software, merchant accounts, shipping, and\npayroll data in real time in order to underwrite businesses. Business owners can receive funds in\na couple of days or even hours.\nThis emergence of online lenders is part of a broader evolution of financial technology--\nor “fintech”--as seen in a wide range of products and services for both consumers and small\nbusinesses. I’m not surprised to see this important topic on your conference agenda. The use of\nfintech to expand access to credit has great promise and also associated risks. For example,\n20 Based on Federal Reserve analysis of FR-Y14 data for scored loans and cards (i.e., underwritten by owner’s\npersonal credit) for 2007 to 2016.\n21 Record of Meeting, Community Advisory Council and the Board of Governors, May 26, 2017, p. 2,\nwww.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/cac-20170526.pdf.\n22 See Rebel A.

And as regulators, we do not want to unnecessarily\nrestrict innovations that can benefit consumers and small businesses. At the same time, our\ninterest is in ensuring that banks understand and manage their risks when introducing new\ntechnologies or partnering with fintech companies, and that consumers and small businesses\nremain protected.23 This is why the Federal Reserve has been engaged in a broad and\nmultidisciplinary effort to develop a robust understanding of the technologies and activities in\nthis space, in order to study fintech’s opportunities and risks, and assess policy and supervisory\nimplications. 24\nFintech is also one of the factors driving calls for regulators to modernize the Community\nReinvestment Act, or CRA, as technology changes how financial products and services are\naccessed. As I’m sure most of you know, the CRA is an important law that recognizes banks'\naffirmative obligation to meet the credit needs of the communities they serve, including low- and\nmoderate-income communities. The CRA promotes financial inclusion by encouraging banks to\nextend mortgages, small business loans, and other types of credit as well as to provide\ninvestments and other services in communities where they take deposits, consistent with safe and\nsound banking operations. The arrival of new financial technologies, along with significant\nindustry consolidation and other structural changes, has changed the way that financial services\nare delivered to consumers and the ways in which banks lend in communities.

The information we\ngather helps us better understand factors affecting consumers and households, including low- and\nmoderate-income and historically underserved populations. We also continue to convene experts\nand practitioners from industry, academia, and community-based organizations to help provide\ncontext on what we are seeing in the data, to identify emerging issues, and to consider where\nthere may be data gaps and opportunities for additional research. In addition to yielding\nimportant insights that inform our policymaking, we hope these efforts can support the\nconversations you are having at conferences like this one.\nThank you, again, for inviting me to speak at your conference as we mark the notable\nanniversaries that this year brings. Together, our work clearly has a great deal of synergy, and I\nthank you for your efforts.

Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Ring-Fencing the Global Banking System: The Shift towards Financial Regulatory\nProtectionism”\nSymposium sponsored by Harvard Law School Program on International Financial Systems\nHarvard Law School\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nMay 16, 2018\n\nThank you to Professor Scott for inviting me to join this discussion on cross-border\nresolution and risks of fragmentation. Like many of my international counterparts in the\naudience, I maintain a deep commitment to cross-border banking and efficient movement of\ncapital and liquidity, which are important contributors to long-term economic growth. And it is\nwith that commitment in mind that I have considered the topic of today’s conference: “ring-\nfencing,” beginning with some reflections on what the term means. Many here use the term to\ndescribe local capital and liquidity requirements, which are imposed ex ante on local subsidiaries\nand designed to protect those entities and their creditors from losses. The term is also used to\nrefer to disruptive actions taken by host regulators to seize assets in the moment of crisis.1 This\ntype of ring-fencing occurs suddenly and unilaterally.\nBoth uses of the term are associated with the risk arising from the stress or failure of a\nglobal financial institution; however, whether ring-fencing as I first defined it--prepositioning--is\nhelpful or harmful in minimizing this risk depends on one’s perspective. The views of different\nstakeholders tend to vary depending on whether one is seeking to maximize efficient allocation\nof resources in good times or minimize losses in stress and, importantly, whether one is a home\nor host regulator.\nBefore the financial crisis, much of our collective orientation was on maximizing the\nefficient flow of capital across the globe. This should remain a paramount goal. Yet in the wake\nof the financial crisis, global regulators have understandably also focused on minimizing the cost\nof the failure of a global financial institution by mitigating the impediments to cross-border\nresolution. The single-point-of-entry (SPOE) and bail-in concepts hold particular promise for\n1 “Home regulator” refers to the prudential regulatory agency of the parent bank, and “host regulator” refers to the\nprudential regulatory agency of a foreign branch or subsidiary of the parent bank.\n\n- 2 -\nmost large global firms. However, a successful SPOE resolution of a large global firm has not\nyet been attempted and will require close cooperation among a large number of stakeholders,\nincluding both home and host country regulators. This cooperation will be based on an\nunderstanding of separate and mutual interests, not on trust alone. So while SPOE creates a\npotentially workable framework for resolution, setting the conditions for cooperation is critical.\nI grew up among the ranches of the American West, where we lived by the motto taught to me as\na young child: trust everyone, but brand your cattle. This is a theme that will run throughout my\nremarks today.\nIn addition to setting the stage for effective cooperation, I will focus specifically on the\ntype of ring-fencing that will almost certainly undermine the successful execution of an SPOE\nresolution--namely the disruptive seizure of assets by host regulators in the moment of stress. As\nwith other elements of our regime, I have been considering whether our current prepositioning\nrequirements for domestic and foreign firms operating in the United States are both minimizing\nthis risk and functioning in an efficient and transparent manner, and I will share some thoughts in\nthat regard. Our vantage point in the United States as a large home and host regulator would\ncounsel that it is sensible to find a middle ground and fine tune our approach as we learn more\nand global conditions evolve.\nResolution Considerations of a Home and Host Regulator\nTo enable cooperation and avoid a destabilizing seizure of assets by host regulators, I\nwould submit that all jurisdictions must find a balance of flexibility for the parent bank and\ncertainty for local stakeholders. Flexibility, or the ability to allocate capital and liquidity to\ndifferent parts of the group on an as-needed basis, helps to meet unexpected demands on\nresources and reduces the risk of misallocation and inefficient use of resources. Certainty, or the\n\n- 3 -\nlocal prepositioning of capital and liquidity to ensure a firm can satisfy local claimants under\nstressful conditions, helps to promote cooperation in the context of a cross-border resolution and\navoid incentives for more drastic action by host authorities.\nOne’s assessment of the optimal balance, as I alluded to earlier, can depend significantly\non where one sits in the regulatory constellation. The home regulator, by nature, will logically\nprefer flexibility in a resolution; consolidated capital and liquidity requirements are most\neffective if resources can be freely allocated around the consolidated firm where and when they\nare needed. Flexibility also helps offset the uncertainty in forecasting the location within the\nconsolidated firm where stress may arise. Yet I would also argue that home regulators should\nrecognize host jurisdictions may take action to restrict the flow of resources, or worse yet,\ndemand resources in the moment of crisis, even if the stress does not originally emanate from\ntheir location. Such actions tend to both limit the flexibility of the home regulator and\nundermine cooperation in times of stress.\nThe host regulator, by nature, will prefer the certainty that resources will be available to\nsatisfy local customers and counterparties under stressful conditions. This is particularly the case\nif the risk of default or the potential local loss given default of a foreign firm is high, and the\ntolerance for a government-assisted intervention for foreign banks is low. However, the host\nregulator should also recognize that it is ultimately in its interest for the SPOE resolution of the\nforeign bank to be successful and, given the uncertainty of the circumstances or location of\nlosses that emerge in an actual stress, adequate flexibility for the parent to deploy resources\nwhere needed is likewise in the host regulator’s interest.\nA global bank has other stakeholders who have preferences regarding flexibility or\ncertainty and can take actions that can potentially destabilize the firm. For instance, parent\n\n- 4 -\ncompany debt and equity holders may prefer less prepositioning, while local creditors and\nfinancial market utilities may prefer more. These other stakeholders can act in ways that can be\ndestabilizing. Building a system that is transparent and is perceived by stakeholders as allocating\nlosses fairly is key in this regard.\nFinally, I would like to note that the considerations of policymakers in determining the\nright balance of flexibility and certainty may differ depending on whether the resource at issue is\ncapital or liquidity. In resolution, the most important difference between capital and liquidity is\nthe speed with which financial stress can appear. Liquidity needs are sudden and tend to\nmanifest in all areas of the organization, and the consequences of not meeting liquidity demand--\nan immediate default on an obligation--can be grave. Capital needs, however, may be more\nlocalized and slower to evolve but are foundational to the execution of an SPOE resolution. It is\nunlikely that host regulators would be comfortable cooperating in an SPOE resolution strategy\nwithout some confidence in the viability of the entities in their jurisdictions.\nU.S. Approach\nHistorically, the United States and the United Kingdom have been in a unique position of\nhaving large interests as both home country and host country regulators of internationally active\nbanks. Soon, the European Union is likely to assume this privilege as well. We understand that\nany requirements we impose on foreign banks operating in the United States may well be\nimposed on U.S. firms operating abroad. In addition, we are operating under a veil of ignorance,\nas we don’t know whether the next firm in distress will be a U.S. firm operating globally or a\nforeign firm with U.S. operations. This provides us with strong incentives to view the risks from\nboth sides.\n\n- 5 -\nAs the home regulator to U.S. global systemically important banking organizations (G-\nSIBs), we and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have used the living wills\nprocess to set the expectation that a firm appropriately balance prepositioned and centrally\nmanaged resources.2 This expectation is based on the premise that the optimal balance will\ndepend on factors such as the firm’s structure and the host jurisdictions in which the firm\noperates. As such, the Board and the FDIC have asked U.S. G-SIBs to analyze and anticipate\ncapital and liquidity resources needed to ensure the continued operation of material entities in\nresolution. Regarding capital, the positioning of a U.S. G-SIB’s internal total loss absorbing\ncapacity (TLAC) should reflect a balance of certainty--prepositioning internal TLAC directly at\nmaterial entities--and flexibility--holding recapitalization resources at the parent, known as\ncontributable resources--to meet unanticipated losses at material entities.3\nRegarding liquidity, the Board and FDIC expect a U.S. G-SIB to appropriately estimate\nand maintain sufficient liquidity for material entities, an expectation known as Resolution\nLiquidity Adequacy and Positioning, or RLAP.4 RLAP expectations are intended to be designed\nso that liquidity is not “double counted” among home and host jurisdictions, to provide\ntransparency into the location of liquidity across the firm’s material entities, and to ensure that\nliquidity can flow where needed with minimal potential disruption. The RLAP approach is\n2 Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires a large firm to\nsubmit an annual resolution plan, or living will, that describes the company’s strategy for rapid and orderly\nresolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company. If the Federal\nReserve and the FDIC determine that a firm’s resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly\nresolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the agencies, acting jointly, may impose more stringent prudential\nrequirements on the firm until it remediates identified deficiencies.\n3 Guidance for 2017 section 165(d) Annual Resolution Plan Submissions by Domestic Covered Companies that\nSubmitted Resolution Plans in July 2015, available at\nwww.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20160413a1.pdf.\n4 Id.\n\n- 6 -\naimed at ensuring that surpluses in one host jurisdiction generally are not relied upon to meet\ndeficits in another host jurisdiction, given the confusion and vulnerabilities such reliance can\ncause in an actual stress. Specifically, a firm should be able to measure the stand-alone liquidity\nposition of each material entity and ensure that liquidity is readily available either at the parent or\nat that entity to meet any deficits.5 As with capital, firms are expected to have a balance of\nprepositioned and centrally managed liquidity--specifically, by balancing the certainty associated\nwith holding liquidity directly at material entities against the flexibility provided by holding\nhigh-quality liquid assets at the parent available to meet unanticipated outflows at material\nentities.\nAs a host regulator, our approach to local capital and liquidity regulations of foreign\nbanks with large U.S. operations is motivated by the lessons of the recent financial crisis, where\nmany foreign banks operating in the United States suffered severe stress and survived only with\nextraordinary support from the United States and their home country governments. In addition\nto increasing the resiliency of the U.S. operations of foreign banks, our approach also reflects\nboth resolution and competitive equity considerations.\nFrom a resolution perspective, our rules seek to ensure that there are sufficient resources\nin the United States today to ensure that we, as a host regulator, are well positioned to cooperate\nwith a home country authority in the event a firm experiences material stress or failure. Our\nrules also ensure that we do not have a strong incentive to limit flows or seek additional\nresources in the moment of crisis, which could be highly destabilizing in a stress event.\n5 The liquidity position of an entity reflects high-quality liquid assets at the material entity less stressed net outflows\nto third parties and affiliates.\n\n- 7 -\nFrom a competitive equity standpoint, we believe that U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks\nshould operate on a level playing field with their domestic counterparts. This is generally\nconsistent with the long-standing treatment of large and complex bank and nonbank subsidiaries\naround the world.\nAs such, our rules subject a large foreign bank to the same capital and liquidity\nrequirements as domestic bank holding companies by requiring the foreign bank to hold its U.S.\nsubsidiaries through a U.S. intermediate holding company (IHC) and imposing capital and\nliquidity requirements to the IHC. At the same time, we have adjusted our approach for the U.S.\nbranches of a foreign bank with a large U.S. presence in recognition that branches are subject to\na narrower set of permissible activities and operate as a direct extension of the parent bank. For\nthese U.S. branches, we have imposed local liquidity requirements in light of the liquidity\nvulnerabilities that many U.S. branches of foreign banks experienced in the crisis, but no\nseparate capital requirements.\nFor IHCs that are subsidiaries of foreign-owned G-SIBs, the Federal Reserve requires\nsuch a firm to issue a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments to its foreign parent,\nknown as internal TLAC, including a minimum amount of unsecured long-term debt.6 In the\nevent that an IHC was experiencing significant financial distress, the internal TLAC could be\nused to replenish the IHC’s equity and maintain its solvency. The U.S. implementation of\ninternal TLAC is modeled on the internal TLAC framework developed by the Financial Stability\nBoard (FSB), which includes a calibration of the amount of loss-absorbing resources that should\n6 12 CFR part 252, subpart G.\n\n- 8 -\nbe prepositioned in a given jurisdiction.7 Specifically, the FSB contemplates that internal TLAC\nrequirements of a subsidiary of a foreign bank expected to be resolved through SPOE would be\ncalibrated at 75 to 90 percent of the external TLAC requirement that would apply to the\nsubsidiary if it were to be separately resolved. In implementing the TLAC standards in the\nUnited States, the Board calibrated the internal TLAC requirement for IHCs of foreign-owned\nG-SIBs at the high end of the FSB range, at around 90 percent.\nAdjustments to the Current Regime\nThere are two principal points I have been making today. The first is that some amount\nof local capital and liquidity prepositioning can reduce the incentives for damaging and\nunpredictable seizures of resources by local regulators during times of stress--thus actually\nreducing the likelihood that improvised, beggar-thy-neighbor ring-fencing would frustrate\ncompletion of a successful SPOE resolution in the future. As we learned long ago out West, the\nbranding of cattle creates the possibility of trust.\nThe second point, however, is equally important: the best prepositioning structure is not\nan eternal verity mathematically deducible from first principles, but it is instead a practical\nbalance designed to promote cooperation among humans, and any such balance is likely to be\nimprovable with experience, reflection, and debate. We are interested in views from the firms\nand the public on how the regimes can be improved, and we expect to invite public comment on\nour living will guidance for U.S. and foreign firms in the near future. In addition, we are\ncurrently weighing the costs and benefits of our current approach of directing firms to determine\n7 Financial Stability Board, “Principles on Loss-Absorbing and Recapitalisation of G-SIBs in Resolution” and\n“Total Loss-absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Term Sheet” (November 9, 2015), available at www.fsb.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/TLAC-Principles-and-Term-Sheet-for-publication-final.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nthe appropriate amount of prepositioned capital and liquidity. We are also considering whether\nformalizing resolution capital and liquidity requirements through a rulemaking process would\nimprove the predictability and transparency of our approach.\nWe continue to believe that the IHC and attendant requirements are appropriate for\nforeign banks with large U.S. operations. However, in light of our experience with these\nstructures, I believe we should consider whether the internal TLAC calibration for IHCs could be\nadjusted to reflect the practice of other regulators without adversely affecting resolvability and\nU.S. financial stability. The current calibration is at the top end of the scale set forth by the FSB,\nand willingness by the United States to reconsider its calibration may prompt other jurisdictions\nto do the same, which could better the prospects of successful resolution for both foreign G-SIBs\noperating in the United States, and for U.S. G-SIBs operating abroad. Alternatively, it may be\npossible to streamline the elements of our resolution loss absorbency regime, which include both\nTLAC and long-term debt requirements. I will be recommending to my colleagues that we look\nclosely at these possibilities in the coming weeks and seek comment on ways to further improve\nthis framework.\nConclusion\nWe are committed to working with other jurisdictions to continue to build the foundation\nof the SPOE resolution framework. In addition to finding the appropriate balance of flexibility\nand certainty that I have discussed, we continue to advocate for increasing the standardization in\nthe global implementation of the regulatory capital rules, improving host supervisors’\ntransparency into the global liquidity and capital positions of a G-SIB on a consolidated and\ndeconsolidated basis, and addressing impediments to a successful SPOE resolution. As with all\nregulations, we will be open to considering adjustments that would improve transparency and\n\n- 10 -\nefficiency and will continue to reassess our regime as we make advancements in developing the\ncross-border resolution framework.",

But in the time since I\nbecame the Vice Chairman for Supervision at the Federal Reserve, we have seen\nagreement on the final pieces of the international framework for post-crisis regulation--\nthe so-called Basel III endgame. The Federal Reserve has issued a number of proposed\nrule changes that would improve our capital and stress testing regime. And in late May,\nthe Congress enacted the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection\nAct (EGRRCPA), which, among other things, directs us to further tailor our supervision\nand regulation of large banks with more than $100 billion in assets. In other words, the\nCongress wants to see action and has, to a certain degree, specified some of the steps we\nneed to take. How we respond to that task, especially as it applies to large banks, will be\nthe focus of my remarks today.\nBut before I delve into those details, I want to provide an overview of what I hope\nyou’ll take away.\nFirst, I want to underscore that I believe tailoring of financial regulation is good\npublic policy. The Federal Reserve Board is a firm adherent of the recent legislation’s\nunderlying principle that regulation should be tailored to risk. To an extent, as I will later\ndescribe, this principle is already embedded in several aspects of our supervisory\nframework.\n1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System.\n\n- 2 -\nSecond, the Federal Reserve will need to revise its framework to allow for a\ngreater differentiation in the supervision and regulation of large firms. To date, our\ntailoring of regulations has been based largely--but not exclusively--on asset size, which\nreflects an unduly one-dimensional approach. We have been evaluating additional\ncriteria that may provide for greater regulatory differentiation across large banks, and the\nrecent legislation is consistent with the goals of that initiative. Specifically, the\nlegislation recognizes that large banks have a variety of business models and risk\nprofiles; supervision should be flexible enough to incorporate this heterogeneity.\nThird, I believe we already have a good start on a path forward for tailoring\nregulation. In my remarks today, I will touch upon some potential factors we have\nidentified for tailoring the supervision and regulation of large banks.\nTailoring: A Primary Component of Post-Crisis Supervision and Regulation\nI think everyone in this room would agree that--while there are important ways it\ncan be improved--the body of post-crisis regulation adopted by the Federal Reserve and\nits fellow banking agencies has, taken as a whole, clearly made the U.S. financial system\nstronger and more resilient. In implementing these reforms, the Fed sought to achieve\ntwo parallel goals: (1) promoting the safety and soundness of individual banking\norganizations and (2) enhancing the stability of the broader U.S. financial system.\nA certain amount of tailoring was reflected from the beginning in how the Fed\nsought to achieve these goals. As the Board built its post-crisis framework, supervision\nand regulation were designed to increase in stringency in tandem with a firm’s size and\nsystemic footprint. This can be seen in stricter requirements in various elements of the\nregulatory capital framework that apply only to larger or more complex banks, including\n\n- 3 -\ncertain buffers and surcharges, the application of the supplementary leverage ratio, and\nthe application of the qualitative objections as part of the Board’s capital planning\nframework, among others. In April, the Board proposed the stress capital buffer, which\nwould simplify its regulatory capital requirements for the largest banks by integrating the\nstress test results with the Board’s non-stress capital requirements.\nFurther, the Board recognized that the failure of one of the largest banking\norganizations could create spillovers that would undermine U.S. financial stability and\nharm consumers and the broader economy. To offset this risk, the Board has required\nthese firms to internalize the cost of their potential failure in a tailored manner that\ncorresponds with their importance to the U.S. financial system. These efforts include the\nBoard’s capital surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and total\nloss-absorbing capacity requirements.\nThe EGRRCPA and Tailoring\nBut while the concept of tailoring is inherent in how the Board thinks about\nsupervision and regulation, reasonable people can disagree on the sufficiency of tailoring\nto date. In my view, we’ve made a good start in improving the efficiency of our\nregulatory regime. But we still have more to do to streamline our framework in a manner\nthat more directly addresses firm-specific risks.\nThe recent legislation requires us to reevaluate how we regulate banks that have\nbetween $100 billion and $250 billion in total assets. In particular, we need to make a\ntailoring-related decision in the near term: How will we decide which enhanced\nprudential standards should apply to which firms with total assets between $100 billion\nand $250 billion?\n\n- 4 -\nIn applying enhanced prudential standards for firms with total assets of more than\n$100 billion, the Congress requires the Board to consider not only size but also capital\nstructure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities, and any other factors the Board\ndeems relevant. While we use similar factors to calibrate the largest firms’ G-SIB\nsurcharges, we have not used them more holistically to tailor the overall supervision and\nregulation of large banks that do not qualify as G-SIBs. Further, consistent with the\nlegislation’s tailoring requirements, the Board must proactively consider how firms with\nmore than $250 billion in assets that do not qualify as G-SIBs may be more efficiently\nregulated by applying more tailored standards.\nIn conjunction with changing regulations, we also need to consider how such\nchanges would be reflected in supervisory programs, guidance, and regulatory reporting.\nAs supervisors, we need to balance providing appropriate relief to firms with ensuring\nthat firms are maintaining resources and risk-management practices so they can be\nresilient under a range of conditions. We must also ensure we receive the right\ninformation in a timely manner so we can identify emerging risks.\nA Path Forward\nBanks with Assets between $100 Billion and $250 Billion\nI want to spend the balance of my time focusing on the question I previously\nposed: On what basis will we decide to apply enhanced prudential standards to firms\nwith total assets in the $100-billion to $250-billion range? The recent legislation directs\nthe Board to consider factors other than size for differentiating supervision and regulation\nof large banking organizations.\n\n- 5 -\nBefore I talk about the “other” factors, let me acknowledge the merits of size as\none relevant factor to include on the list. We know that the effect of a large bank’s\nfailure on the economy is greater than when a smaller bank fails, even though the two\nbanks might be engaged in similar business lines. The recent financial crisis in 2008–09\nsaw a much more severe recession than other financial crises, such as the savings and\nloan crisis in the late 1980s that preceded the relatively mild recession of 1990–91, and\nthis appears at least in part related to the size of the affected institutions. In fact,\nempirical research done at the Federal Reserve shows that stress among larger banks does\nmore significant harm to the economy than stress at smaller banks, even after controlling\nfor the aggregate size of bank failures.2 We also know that larger banks are more\noperationally complex--even when not engaged in complex business lines--with a broader\ngeographic scope and more layers of management than smaller banks. Therefore, it\nseems appropriate to me that a path forward for tailoring supervision and regulation of\nlarge banks should not ignore size, but consider it as one factor--although only one\nfactor--along with other factors.\nBefore the enactment of the recent legislation, we had begun work on considering\nadditional factors that capture large firms’ degree of complexity and interconnectedness\nthat--in conjunction with size--may provide a better basis for tailoring supervision and\nregulation than size alone. The systemic effect of a bank’s failure or distress is positively\ncorrelated with that organization’s business, operational, and structural complexity.\n2 Pending research to be published by Federal Reserve Board staff in the near future suggests that an\nincrease in bank stress results in poorer economic performance in a way that scales with bank size. Put\nanother way, staff estimate that stress at a single bank with $250 billion in deposits would result in roughly\nan 84 percent decline in quarterly GDP growth, while stress among five banks each with $50 billion in\ndeposits would result in roughly a 24 percent decline in quarterly GDP growth. Although both scenarios\nhave $250 billion in total failed deposits, the negative impact is greater when the largest bank is stressed.\n\n- 6 -\nGenerally, the more complex a banking organization is, the greater the expense and time\nnecessary to resolve it. Similarly, financial institutions may be interconnected in many\nways, as large banks commonly engage in transactions with other financial institutions\nthat give rise to a wide range of contractual obligations. Financial distress at a large bank\nmay materially raise the likelihood of distress at other firms given the network of\ncontractual obligations throughout the financial system.\nSo how do we gauge the degree of complexity and interconnectedness of large\nfirms? Rather than formulating new and untested measures of these factors, I believe we\nwould be well served to begin by looking to our body of post-crisis regulation as a\nsource. I will highlight a few factors that already reside in various areas of our regulatory\nframework that I am considering.\nThe G-SIB surcharge indicators are likely to be a helpful source in this effort. For\nexample, one factor from that framework that we might consider for purposes of tailoring\nis cross-border activity. This would measure assets and liabilities related to transactions\nwith foreign banks, individuals, and companies, among others. This factor measures both\na firm’s complexity and resolvability, as foreign operations add operational complexity in\nnormal times and complicate the ability of the firm to undergo an orderly resolution in\ntimes of stress.\nAnother factor from the G-SIB surcharge framework that could be useful is a\nfirm’s use of short-term wholesale funding, which may serve as a proxy for liquidity\nvulnerability. Historically, reliance on short-term, uninsured funding from sophisticated\nfunding sources has created vulnerability to large-scale funding runs and increased risks\nrelated to financial sector interconnectedness. Specifically, this can lead to “fire sale”\n\n- 7 -\neffects that may affect broader financial stability--which occurs when banks that fund\nlong-term or illiquid assets with short-term deposits from financial intermediaries like\npension funds and money market mutual funds need to rapidly sell less-liquid assets to\nmaintain their operations.\nOutside of the G-SIB surcharge framework, the Board has employed a measure of\nnonbank activities in certain rulemakings. These activities, which are conducted outside\nof a regulated depository institution, represent another source of complexity for large\nbanks. For example, some nonbank entities engage in complex trading that is not\npermitted in depository institutions because of their risk.\nBanks with Assets Greater Than $250 Billion\nIn addition to thinking about how we will tailor our regulation and supervisory\nprograms for firms with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion, I believe the Board\nshould also review the requirements applicable to the firms with more than $250 billion\nin total assets but below the G-SIB threshold. This review should ensure that our\nregulations continue to appropriately increase in stringency as the risk profiles of firms\nincrease, consistent with our previously stated tailoring goals and the new legislation.\nThe supervision and regulatory framework for these firms should reflect that there are\nmaterial differences between those firms that qualify as U.S. G-SIBs and those that do\nnot. For example, we know that non-G-SIBs with more than $250 billion in assets are\ngenerally less complex and less interconnected than U.S. G-SIBs and thus pose relatively\nless risk to financial stability. G-SIBs, on the other hand, have more complex activities,\nare more interconnected, and pose a far greater risk to financial stability should they fail.\nYet at the moment, many aspects of our regulatory regime treat any bank with more than\n\n- 8 -\n$250 billion in assets with the same stringency as a G-SIB. I believe there should be a\nclear differentiation.\nNext Steps from the Federal Reserve\nIn my view, the Board should make it a near-term priority to issue a proposed rule\nconcerning tailoring of enhanced prudential standards for large banking firms. This\nproposal, of course subject to notice and comment, would address our statutory\nobligations under the recent legislation by proposing to tailor enhanced prudential\nstandards in a manner that recognizes relative complexity and interconnectedness among\nlarge banks. The statute sets an 18-month deadline for this regulatory process, but we\ncan and will move much more rapidly than this.\nIn terms of capital requirements, both risk-based and leverage capital\nrequirements should remain core components of regulation for large firms with more than\n$100 billion in total assets. Stress testing should continue to play an important role in\nassessing potential losses that large firms would suffer under a severely adverse\neconomic scenario; the recent legislation recognized the importance of stress testing by\nrequiring a supervisory stress test for these large firms. Therefore, the Board’s proposed\nstress capital buffer, if finalized, would be critical for these firms.\nHowever, we could consider a number of changes for less complex and less\ninterconnected firms related to their capital requirements. For example, such firms, even\nif above $250 billion in assets, could have less frequent company-run stress tests. For\nthose below $250 billion in assets, the statute requires supervisory stress tests to be\nconducted “periodically”, which suggests the legislature wanted us to at least consider a\nrhythm other than annually. Additionally, less complex and less interconnected firms\n\n- 9 -\ncould be exempted from requirements to calculate risk-weighted assets under the models-\nbased advanced approaches to capital.\nI continue to strongly believe that liquidity regulation should be a primary\ncomponent of supervision and regulation of large banks. We all saw the central role that\nliquidity risk played in the recent financial crisis. Minimum standardized liquidity\nmeasures and internal liquidity stress tests remain critical at firms with more than $100\nbillion in total assets. However, for less complex and less interconnected firms with\nassets greater than $100 billion, there may be opportunities to modify aspects of the\nstandardized liquidity requirements as well as expectations around internal liquidity stress\ntests and liquidity risk management. Similarly, banks with more than $250 billion in\nassets that are not G-SIBs currently face largely the same liquidity regulation as G-SIBs.\nAs I’ve said previously, I believe it would make sense to calibrate the liquidity\nrequirements differently for these firms relative to their G-SIB counterparts.\nResolution planning is especially critical to ensure that the largest banking firms\nstructure their operations in ways that make it more possible for them to be resolved upon\nfailure without causing systemic risks for the broader economy. But most firms with\ntotal assets between $100 billion and $250 billion do not pose a high degree of\nresolvability risk, especially if they are less complex and less interconnected. Therefore,\nwe should consider scaling back or removing entirely resolution planning requirements\nfor most of the firms in that asset range. Further, we should consider limiting the scope\nof application of resolution planning requirements to only the largest, most complex, and\nmost interconnected banking firms because their failure poses the greatest spillover risks\nto the broader economy. For firms that would still be subject to resolution planning\n\n- 10 -\nrequirements, we could reduce the frequency and burden of such requirements, perhaps\nby requiring more-targeted resolution plans.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I believe we have a unique opportunity to further tailor our\nsupervision and regulation framework for large banks in a manner that allows us to be\nmore risk-sensitive while still meeting our core goals of promoting safety and soundness\nand enhancing financial stability.\nThe recent legislation requires the Board to tailor its framework of supervision\nand regulation of large firms in a manner that continues to recognize size as one risk\nfactor, but also more holistically incorporates other risk categories. In implementing this\nlegislation, we should consider tailoring regulation further to take into account large\nbanks’ complexity and interconnectedness.\nOf course, the details of how we implement a tailored framework will be subject\nto debate, and you can expect the Federal Reserve to be highly engaged in the public\nfeedback process. Implementing the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and\nConsumer Protection Act is a high priority for the Board, and we look forward to hearing\nthe range of views as we make progress.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n5:45 a.m. EDT (11:45 a.m. local time)\nSeptember 5, 2019\nRefining the Stress Capital Buffer\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nProgram on International Financial Systems Conference\nFrankfurt, Germany\nSeptember 5, 2019\n\nIntroduction\nThanks to the Program on International Financial Systems and the European Central\nBank for the opportunity to speak to you today. I would like to take as my text today this\nreflection of the 20th-century philosopher, sociologist, and welterweight champion of the world,\nOscar de la Hoya: “There’s always room for improvement, no matter how long you’ve been in\nthe business.” As all of you know, 2019 marks the 10-year anniversary of our stress testing\nprogram in the United States. In only 10 years, stress tests have developed from an innovative\nbut untested tool to become a well-established element of the Federal Reserve’s bank supervision\nprogram for large banks. But developing and running those first tests required a willingness to\nchange, and an openness to innovation, which underlie every advance in human endeavor—\nwhether banking or boxing. In that same spirit of being open to change and innovation, my\nremarks will include some thoughts that might have seemed novel just a few years ago, but in my\nview, are ideas whose time has now come.\nAs the Federal Reserve has been considering refinements to our stress testing and capital\nframeworks, two goals have been at the forefront of our thinking: first, to simplify these\nframeworks to make them easier to apply and understand, and second, to maintain the overall\nhigh level of loss-absorbing capacity in the banking system. Let me expand on those two goals.\nGoals for Refining Stress Testing and Capital Frameworks\nOne of the great challenges of a regulator is to write rules that are comprehensive and\ndetailed enough to be effective while also being consistent and simple enough to be well\nunderstood. There is a well-documented tendency for regulation to grow by accretion. And with\nthat, there is always a risk that regulatory regimes will become less effective as they grow,\ndeveloping redundancies and inconsistences that can obscure initial intentions and impair\n\n- 2 -\nunderstanding. This is not a desirable outcome for financial regulation, and indeed, it is the\nresponsibility of any regulator to ensure that the rule frameworks remain well integrated and\ncredible.\nCongress has been adjusting the Dodd-Frank Act since its enactment, and, likewise, the\nFederal Reserve and other regulators have been making adjustments in the wake of the financial\ncrisis to innovations such as stress testing, a public process that in my view has helped make\nfinancial oversight more effective. The thoughts that I am airing in these remarks, part of a\npublic process of discussion and debate, should be seen as a continuation of the review and\nadjustment that has been taking place since the financial crisis. The goal is to simplify rules that\nhave grown more complex in the past decade and in some cases redundant and harder to\nunderstand.\nMy second goal, in considering these adjustments, is to maintain the high level of loss-\nabsorbing capacity in the U.S. banking system. Our financial system today is far more resilient\nthan it was before the crisis and I want to maintain that resiliency. We are all better served by\nwell-capitalized banks that have the ability to continue lending to households and businesses\neven during stressful times. Adjusting regulation in measured ways, such as those I will\ndescribe, is an appropriate and, in fact, necessary way to preserve the success we have achieved\nin strengthening the financial system.\nBefore I delve into describing the future direction of our stress testing and capital\nframeworks, allow me to begin with some background on the origins of the stress testing\nprogram and an overview of the changes we have made to our capital requirements since the\nfinancial crisis.\nBackground on the Fed’s Stress Testing Program\n\n- 3 -\nAt the height of the crisis, as a way to help restore confidence in the largest U.S. banks,\nthe Fed created the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) to estimate potential losses\nat those banks, if economic and financial conditions worsened. Building on the success of\nSCAP, the Board moved to the current stress testing assessment, known as the Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and Review (CCAR), to evaluate whether the largest firms have sufficient\ncapital to continue to lend and absorb potential losses under severely adverse conditions.\nAt the same time that we were building our stress testing program, we were also making\nchanges to capital rules to address weaknesses observed during the crisis. These included new\nminimum capital requirements and a capital buffer on top of these requirements. The buffer puts\nincreasingly strict and automatic limits on capital distributions as a bank’s capital declines\ntoward the minimum. Large banks are also subject to a potential countercyclical capital buffer\n(CCyB), which I will discuss more shortly. And the largest banks are subject to an additional\nbuffer of capital based on a measure of their systemic risk.\nStress testing and stronger capital requirements have combined to greatly strengthen the\nresiliency of the U.S. banking system. At the banks subject to CCAR, risk-based capital ratios\nhave more than doubled since 2009. Combined, these firms now have more than $1 trillion of\ncommon equity capital, and a ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets of 12.1%, which is\nmany multiples over the required ratio of Tier 1 common in 2009. As a result of these changes,\nlarge U.S. banks are substantially more resilient to stress than in the past.\nAt the same time, I believe our regulatory measures are most effective when they are as\nsimple and transparent as possible, and it is prudent to periodically review all of our practices to\nensure that they are achieving these goals. Importantly, although CCAR and our regulatory\ncapital requirements share similar ends, they were developed separately, due to the exigencies of\n\n- 4 -\nthe crisis, and this has led to significant redundancies, which I will describe in detail in a\nmoment. Just to name one prominent example, we now have 24 different requirements for total\nloss absorbency, while before the financial crisis we had 3. Perhaps there were some benefits to\nhaving overlapping approaches when we were still in the capital-building phase after the crisis.\nBut now that banks have built significant capital stores, I believe the overlapping requirements\nshould be combined for efficiency and simplicity.\nThe Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) Proposal\nLast year, the Board issued a proposal to address these redundancies. The proposal—\nknown as the stress capital buffer—would simplify our regulatory regime by integrating the\nstress test with our non-stress capital rules. I believe the SCB proposal stands as a good example\nof how our work can be done more efficiently and effectively, and in a way that maintains the\nresiliency of the financial system.\nFor large bank holding companies, the SCB would replace the fixed-for-all-times-and-\nfor-all-banks 2.5 percent risk-based capital buffer with a firm-specific buffer based on the firm’s\nmost recent stress test results. This would integrate our stress testing capital requirements with\nour point-in-time capital requirements. And as a result, the two separate capital frameworks\nwould be combined into one. Firms would have to manage according to one integrated set of\nrequirements and, when their capital is insufficient, would be required to rebuild their resiliency\nthrough one integrated set of limitations on their capital distributions.\nOriginally, we had planned to make the SCB final for the 2019 stress test cycle.\nHowever, we received thorough and insightful feedback on the proposal that we have been\nconsidering carefully. Among the comments we received were many that called for further\nsimplification of the SCB framework. Based on this feedback, I first would like to emphasize\n\n- 5 -\ntwo elements of the 2018 SCB proposal that, in my more considered judgment, I now believe\nshould not be a part of the final SCB framework. Second, I would like to introduce two new co-\nequal options, either of which would improve the final product.\nThe first element of the SCB proposal that I believe should be removed is the stress\nleverage buffer requirement.1 By its nature, a leverage ratio is a blunt instrument that treats all\nassets the same and therefore is not risk-sensitive. Thus, I am concerned that explicitly assigning\na stressed leverage requirement to a firm on the basis of risk-sensitive post-stress estimates is in\nconflict with the intellectual underpinnings of the leverage ratio. It is what the analytical\nphilosophers call a category mistake: like saying that, “Freedom has curly hair”. Of course,\nleverage ratios, including the enhanced supplementary leverage requirements, would remain a\ncritical part of our regulatory capital regime, and I believe our existing leverage ratios provide a\nsufficient backstop to the risk-based capital requirements. For these reasons, it seems out of\nplace and unnecessary to add a separate leverage capital buffer.2\nThe second element of the SCB proposal that I believe should be removed is the\nrequirement for banks to pre-fund the next four quarters of their planned dividend payments.\nThe stress tests currently require banks to set aside sufficient capital today to “pre-fund”\nexpected capital distributions, both dividends and repurchases, for all nine quarters of the capital\nplanning horizon. Removing the pre-funding of dividend requirement would simplify the SCB\nproposal. Additionally, the SCB already has a mechanism for curbing dividends and other\ndistributions when a bank’s capital ratio falls into the buffer. Requiring pre-funding of dividends\nis a needless redundancy. Even worse, the pre-funding of dividends could lead to a conflict with\n1 As proposed in the SCB, firms would have been subject to a new stress leverage buffer, where their leverage ratio\nrequirements would be sized based on their stress test each year.\n2 See www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20181109a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nthe mechanics of the SCB—the SCB could call for a restriction of dividend payments even when\nthose payments had been pre-funded. I believe it is better to focus on the root cause of our\nconcerns and take a comprehensive approach to ensuring that banks have sufficient capital,\nrather than focus on the individual elements of capital distributions.\nSome have argued that requiring pre-funding of dividends helps reduce pro-cyclicality.3\nLimiting pro-cyclicality, or being countercyclical, essentially means limiting both the highs and\nlows of a business cycle. And there can be value in doing so because, among other things, it can\nhelp reduce stress on our financial system. With a counter-cyclical stress test, as the economy\nstrengthens, the test should get tougher and be more stringent to mitigate the buildup of\nvulnerabilities during good times. Experience has shown that vulnerabilities can build during\ngood times as risk appetite grows and memories of earlier instability fade. But likewise, when\nthe economy does slow down, and losses mount at the banks, the tests should moderate so that\nfirms can draw on the buffers built up during good times to absorb those losses while continuing\nto provide credit to qualified borrowers.\nAs an alternative to requiring pre-funding dividends and in furtherance of the other goals\nI have mentioned, I would like to suggest two co-equal options that, in my opinion, would\nsimplify our capital requirements while limiting pro-cyclicality. Importantly, these two options\nalso are consistent with our goal of maintaining overall levels of capital in the banking system:\nThe first option would be to set the CCyB at a higher baseline level during normal times. And\nthe second option would be to raise the “floor,” or the minimum level, of the SCB.\n3 See, for example, Donald Kohn and Nellie Liang, “Understanding the Effects of the U.S. Stress Tests” (paper\npresented at “Stress Testing: A Discussion and Review” Conference, Federal Reserve Board, July 9, 2019),\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/-/media/Documents/events/2019/stress-testing/effects-of-stress-test-paper.pdf?la=en.\n\n- 7 -\nThe CCyB Option\nBefore I outline how we might modify the CCyB, let me explain what the CCyB is\ndesigned to accomplish and how it fits into the Board’s overall financial stability efforts. The\nCCyB, which was part of the original Basel III accord, is a macroprudential tool that allows the\nBoard to dynamically adjust capital levels of large banking firms when the risks to financial\nstability have meaningfully changed. In 2016, the Board released a policy statement detailing\nthe conceptual framework it would follow to set the CCyB. The policy statement details the\nrange of financial-system vulnerabilities and other factors the Board may take into account as it\nevaluates settings for the buffer, including but not limited to, leverage in the financial sector,\nleverage in the nonfinancial sector, maturity and liquidity transformation in the financial sector,\nand asset valuation pressures. Right now, our policy is to maintain a 0 percent CCyB when\nvulnerabilities are within the normal range, as they happen to be now.\nWhen we determine that vulnerabilities have risen to be meaningfully above normal, the\npurpose of the CCyB is to increase capital to a level that compensates for those other rising\nvulnerabilities and thus reduces risks back to a normal level. Some of those vulnerabilities have\nindeed been rising in recent years, but because of the strength of our capital requirements and\nCCAR, our assessment of overall vulnerabilities remains moderate. This raises the question of\nwhether our through-the-cycle capital levels in the United States have been set so high, that our\nCCyB is effectively already “on”: we already have capital at a level that compensates for these\nincreases in vulnerability, but because we did not reach that capital level through activation of\nthe CCyB, we have no way of acting countercyclically in a future downturn.\nI would advocate for revisiting that policy so that the CCyB is more closely integrated\ninto our overall capital framework, allowing greater scope for dynamic adjustments. While the\n\n- 8 -\nBoard has maintained the CCyB at zero since 2016, other countries have adjusted their\ncountercyclical buffers in response to vulnerabilities within their financial sectors or, in the case\nof the United Kingdom, to integrate its CCyB with its structural capital requirements. For\nexample, I find the U.K. framework, adopted by their Financial Policy Committee, to be quite\ncompelling. Specifically, under the British framework, the CCyB would equal a positive\namount—in the British case it’s 1 percent—in standard risk conditions. The effect of the policy\nis that the buffer can be varied in line with the changing risks that the banking system faces over\ntime.\nI see real merit in application of the U.K. approach in the United States, although the\nspecific percentage would of course be open to analysis. It could provide a flexible mechanism\nthat could complement other modifications to the SCB framework and allow the Board to adjust\ncapital requirements as financial risks are evolving. In addition, making greater use of a\ncountercyclical capital buffer would quite directly advance the goal of making the overall capital\nregime less pro-cyclical.\nUltimately, I would expect that the new baseline for the CCyB would be set at a level that\nwould maintain the overall level of capital in the U.S. banking system throughout the business\nand financial cycles—that is, taking account of the likelihood that there would be periods where\nit would be above the baseline as well as below the baseline. To be clear, this shift would\nrequire us to revisit our current CCyB policy and would introduce additional layers of\ndecisionmaking complexity to the SCB proposal. On balance, however, I think this kind of shift\nwould provide the Board with a helpful, additional tool that could be adjusted quickly in\nresponse to economic, financial, or even geopolitical shocks.\n\n- 9 -\nI’d also like to preemptively address a potential objection to this option. That is, that it\nmay be a “stealth” cut to our strong capital levels for the largest banks. I reject that\ncharacterization, and it is not supported by the approach I have outlined today. As I’ve said, we\nwould maintain our strong current loss-absorbency levels, and, though I have focused on the\nability to reduce the CCyB in times of stress, I also would stand ready to increase the CCyB\nabove the new baseline when it was appropriate to do so. Indeed, the advantage of a truly\nflexible capital requirement is for it not only to provide additional resilience during a boom, but\nalso to limit the risk of a pullback in credit supply aggravating an economic downturn.\nThe SCB Floor Option\nReturning to our goals of increasing simplicity, mitigating pro-cyclicality, and\nmaintaining the overall level of loss-absorbency in the system, I would like to advance another\nequally viable alternative to turning on the CCyB: raising the proposed SCB floor from the fixed\n2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets to a somewhat higher level—purely for the sake of\nillustration, let’s say 3 percent. Using 3 percent as an example, we would give each firm a buffer\nbased on the firm’s most recent stress test results, but which must be at least 3 percent. For\nexample, if a firm had a capital ratio decline of 2.7 percent during the stress tests, its SCB would\nnonetheless be sized at 3 percent, rather than 2.7 percent.\nFor firms that have stress test results indicating an SCB greater than 3 percent, this\nchange would have no impact compared to last year’s proposal. For firms that have stress test\nresults indicating an SCB at or slightly above 2.5 percent, this change would represent a modest\nincrease in the stringency of the SCB.\nRaising the floor may help to reduce pro-cyclicality by limiting the reduction in SCB\ncapital buffers when stress test losses decrease during good times. Raising the floor also would\n\n- 10 -\nhelp moderate any increase in those buffers at the onset of economic downturn conditions as\nlosses begin to increase. This approach would have three significant benefits as compared to the\nCCyB option: greater simplicity, transparency, and predictability. Raising the fixed floor would\nbe simpler to execute than the CCyB proposal because raising the floor once and for all times\nwould not require the Board to make complex, real-time decisions about how to adapt the\nregulatory framework to the evolving vulnerabilities to the economy. Raising the fixed floor\nalso would be more transparent and predictable for the public and the industry because a firm’s\ncapital requirement would vary less over time.\nThere are drawbacks to the higher fixed floor option, of course. For firms whose losses\nare typically close to the existing 2.5 percent floor, this change will affect them more than others\nand produce a capital regime with slightly less risk sensitivity. I also recognize, in terms of\ntargeting pro-cyclicality, this approach would be much less direct than more actively managing\nthe level of the CCyB.\nConclusion\nIn closing, let me say that it is my hope to have an SCB framework in place for the 2020\nstress tests. Of course, we will solicit public comment on potential revisions to the SCB proposal\nthrough the standard rulemaking process, and I expect that to occur in the near future. I further\nexpect that we will maintain the basic framework of the SCB while also incorporating some\nadditional refinements, such as to address volatility and provide better notice for firms in\nplanning their capital actions.\nAs I have stated, our goals remain to simplify our capital framework while maintaining\nthe overall amount of capital in the U.S. banking system. The refinements we are considering to\nthe SCB framework would also improve the efficiency, coherence, and transparency of the\n\n- 11 -\nregulatory capital framework and the core principles of our stress testing program that have\nproven successful. I look forward to continued feedback on CCAR as we work through the\nimprovements that I described, with a goal of ensuring that we maintain the same incentives for\neffective stress testing practices that exist today. As I am sure Oscar would agree, there is\nalways room for improvement in the stress testing ring.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n11:00 a.m. EDT\nOctober 15, 2020\nWhat Happened? What Have We Learned From It?\nLessons from COVID-19 Stress on the Financial System\nRandal K Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Institute of International Finance\nWashington, D.C.\n(via webcast)\nOctober 15, 2020\n\nThank you to the Institute of International Finance, for the opportunity to speak\ntoday. It has been eight months since COVID-19 appeared in the US and the attendant\ncontainment measures began to have severe effects on the U.S. economy and financial\nsystem (the “COVID event”). While the economy is recovering faster than we originally\nexpected, and the financial sector returned pretty quickly to stable functioning— in\nsignificant part due to strong action from governments and central banks around the\nworld—the shock of the COVID event was by many measures the strongest in recorded\nhistory, and for a while in the spring the outcome was—as the Duke of Wellington said\nof Waterloo—“a damn, close-run thing.”\nFor some time, those closest to the events were too involved in fighting the fire to\npull together an account of what had happened and what lessons we might learn. But at\nthis point, it is now possible, and I believe valuable, to assess what happened in the\nfinancial system in March and April, which parts of the system came under stress, and\nwhy. The COVID event resulted in a large and uniquely exogenous shock to the\neconomy and the financial system, and for that reason alone it can’t tell us everything\nabout what might happen in every future financial crisis. But as the first real life test of\nthe regulatory framework erected after the global financial crisis (GFC), I believe it can\ntell us a lot about what is working and what aspects of our framework may need\nstrengthening.\nIt seems like a very long time ago, but early this year, the U.S. economy was in\nvibrant good health. Output growth was solid, and unemployment was at a 50-year low.\nEquity markets reached record highs on February 19, and in financial markets generally\nwe saw high and in some cases stretched valuations. Business debt had been rising for a\n\n- 2 -\nwhile, while household borrowing was more moderate. At the core of the financial\nsystem, large banks were in a strong position, with much higher capital ratios and liquid\nassets than in decades. We had seen some notable volatility in short-term funding\nmarkets, including some spikes in repo rates in 2019, but overall vulnerabilities stemming\nfrom liquidity and maturity mismatches in the financial sector still appeared low—\nespecially so at large banks, which had substantially reduced their reliance on short-term\nwholesale funding from pre-crisis levels. In late 2019, market participants were telling us\nthat the most salient risks to the U.S. economy were from trade frictions, the challenges\nfacing monetary policy given the proximity of interest rates to their effective lower\nbound, and market liquidity.1\nThen the COVID event unfolded. On February 21, while we were with the Italian\nauthorities in Riyadh for the G20 meetings, Italy announced quarantines of the northern\ntowns being hardest hit by the new virus. This was a trigger for what became a rapid\nchange in market sentiment, as investors began to prepare for what was beginning to\nseem might be a significant slowdown in economic activity. Volatility rose; selling\npressure rose. As other European governments began to adopt travel bans, lockdowns,\nand school closures, there was a surging demand for safe assets. With fears of a\nwidespread economic slowdown proliferating in late February and early March, Treasury\nprices rose and yields fell sharply, as usually happens when the economic outlook\nworsens. And as often happens when a shock leads to a surging demand for safe assets,\nsome risky assets became very difficult to sell.\n1 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (Washington: Board of\nGovernors, November 2019), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-\n20191115.pdf.\n.\n\n- 3 -\nThen on March 11, roughly two weeks after the first Italian quarantines, the WHO\ndeclared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and several new countries announced lockdowns\nand border closings. This was the trigger that turned what up to then had been a\nreasonably familiar, if concerning, flight to safety into a historically unprecedented dash\nfor cash. Corporates preparing for a potentially extended disruption in revenues began\nseeking cash reserves en masse, while financial firms uncertain about the value of assets\nand counterparties began cutting their exposures.\nAs a result of this scissoring, we saw serious strains in several financial markets.\nSome of the most severe strains emerged in short-term funding markets and among\ninstitutions engaged in liquidity transformation. I will highlight a few. First, we saw a\npullback from commercial paper, or CP, markets. In an effort to contain risk in an\nabruptly slowing economy, investors shortened the maturities at which they were willing\nto lend in the CP market, in effect rushing for the exit and raising the possibility that\nlending might stop completely. Indeed, term CP markets did essentially shut down for\nsome period. At the same time, some prime and tax-exempt money market funds\nexperienced large redemptions, forcing these funds to sell assets. In addition, we saw\nlarge outflows at corporate bond funds and exchange traded funds. Corporate bond funds\npromise daily liquidity, but the underlying assets often take a longer time to sell. This\ncreates conditions that can lead to runs on these funds in times of stress.\nIndeed, each of these three developments—the pullback from CP and the elevated\nredemptions at prime money funds and at corporate bond funds—can be viewed as a kind\nof run by investors. A run occurs when investors concerned about potential losses\nclamber to withdraw funds or sell their positions before other investors do. These actions\n\n- 4 -\ncan lead to sharp declines in asset prices and impair the ability of businesses to fund their\noperations, leading to strains across the financial system and declines in employment and\nspending.\nA fourth area of strain was in the Treasury market—one of the largest and deepest\nfinancial markets in the world. Treasury securities play a central role in short-term\nfunding markets, such as the repo market, where they are a favored form of collateral.\nSignificant amounts of Treasuries are held by institutions that use short-term funding,\nlike broker-dealers and money market funds. And, the structure of the Treasury market\nhas evolved substantially in recent years, with the growth of high-speed and algorithmic\ntrading, and a growing share of liquidity provided by new entrants alongside established\nbroker-dealers. The new Treasury market structure has had notable episodes of market\nvolatility and stress, but none to compare with the COVID event.2\nTreasury market conditions deteriorated rapidly in the second week of March,\nwhen a wide range of investors sought to sell Treasuries to raise cash. Foreign official\nand private investors, certain hedge funds, and other levered investors were among the\nbig sellers. During this dash for cash, Treasury prices fell and yields increased, a\nsurprising development since Treasury prices usually rise when investors try to shed risk\nin the face of bad news or financial stress, reflecting their status as the ultimate safe asset.\nWhile trading volumes remained robust, bid-ask spreads widened dramatically,\nparticularly for older off-the-run Treasuries, but this soon spilled over into the more\n2 See the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal\nReserve Bank of New York, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and U.S. Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission, Joint Staff Report: The U.S. Treasury Market on October 15, 2014 (July 2015),\nhttps://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/Joint_Staff_Report_Treasury_10-15-\n2015.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nliquid on-the-run segment of the market, as well as the futures markets.3 The intense and\nwidespread selling pressures appear to have overwhelmed dealers’ capacity or\nwillingness to absorb and intermediate Treasury securities.4 In the end, the Federal\nReserve took a number of steps to support smooth market functioning, which I will\ndescribe in a moment.\nFortunately, even with these strains in financial markets, banks were able to\nremain a source of strength to the financial system and the economy. Banks entered this\ncrisis with much stronger balance sheets than the last one—with more and higher-quality\ncapital, more liquid assets, and less reliance on fragile funding. This is a testament to\nreforms implemented by the Fed and other agencies in the aftermath of the GFC. Not\nsurprisingly, however, the magnitude of the economic and financial disruptions from the\nCOVID event posed some major challenges to banks.\nFirst, in March, many businesses—unable to satisfy their large cash demand\nthrough CP or corporate bond issuance, for the reasons I described earlier—drew down\non their existing credit lines with banks in order to raise cash. As a result, commercial\nand industrial (C&I) loans in the banking system increased by nearly $480 billion in\nMarch—by far the largest monthly increase ever. Banks were able to fund these loans\nwithout notable problems through inflows of core deposits, other borrowing, and, to a\nlesser extent, by using their buffers of liquid assets. The inflow of deposits resulted from\nincreased demand for safe haven assets, reflecting confidence in U.S. banks. While\n3 Off-the-run Treasuries refer to all Treasury securities, except for the newest issue, which are called on-\nthe-run and which typically are the most actively traded Treasury securities.\n4 Limits on dealers’ intermediation capacity may be driven by their internal capital, liquidity, and risk-\nmanagement practices, their compliance with regulations and supervisory expectations, or concerns over\ntheir profit and loss statements.\n\n- 6 -\nbanks were a source of strain during the GFC, they were a source of strength during this\ncrisis. After March, as the economy started to recover, many firms repaid these\ndrawdowns and C&I lending by banks declined.\nIf the drawdown of credit lines tested the resilience of banks to liquidity shocks,\nfinancial distress at borrowers has been testing the resilience of banks to losses. The\nCOVID event has made it harder for many borrowers—businesses as well as\nhouseholds—to repay their debt. Encouraged by supervisors, banks have been working\nactively with their customers and have agreed to grant forbearance to millions of\nborrowers. At the same time, banks have recognized that the credit quality of many loans\nhas deteriorated considerably, and they have made sizable provisions to prepare for\nexpected loan losses.\nWhile banks have continued to lend, we have seen a notable tightening of bank\nlending standards. In the July Fed survey of senior loan officers, banks cited the\nuncertain economic outlook and industry-specific problems as the main reasons for\ntighter lending—the tightening was not due to capital or liquidity pressures.5 Although\nthe overall contraction in credit availability is less severe than during the GFC, tighter\nlending standards may make it difficult for some businesses and households to borrow\nduring the pandemic.\nWhile the continued ability of banks to lend to creditworthy borrowers has been\ngood news, a lot of credit in the United States is provided by nonbank financial\ninstitutions and markets. Indeed, almost two-thirds of business and household debt in the\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, The July 2020 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey\non Bank Lending Practices (Washington: Board of Governors, July 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/data/documents/sloos-202007-fullreport.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nUnited States is held by nonbanks, though much of the origination of the debt held by\nnonbank investors is done or facilitated by banks. And in March, this lending by non-\nbanks dried up. In addition to the strains in short-term funding markets, some vital long-\nterm lending markets were virtually closed. As the extent of the economic disruptions\nbecame clear, the cost of borrowing rose sharply for businesses issuing corporate bonds,\nfor state and local governments issuing longer-term municipal debt, and for issuers of\nasset-backed securities (ABS), such as originators of auto and student loans. Spreads in\nsome cases widened to post-crisis highs. Exacerbated by the problems in short-term\nfunding markets and at bond funds, market functioning and liquidity deteriorated, and\nissuance of new debt in long-term markets slowed markedly or stopped altogether.\nEffectively, the ability of creditworthy households, businesses, and state and local\ngovernments to borrow, even at elevated interest rates, was threatened.\nIn light of these unusual and exigent circumstances, the Federal Reserve took a\nseries of emergency actions to support liquidity in markets and the flow of credit to\nhouseholds, businesses, and communities. I won’t review in detail the kaleidoscopic\ngallimaufry of actions that we took to address the dysfunctions I’ve just been describing:\nemergency lending facilities under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to support\nliquidity in funding markets; similar facilities to support credit to nonfinancials; direct\npurchases of Treasuries; swap lines and repo facilities with foreign central banks. These\nare fully described elsewhere. Fundamentally, each measure was designed to address an\naspect of the pressures created by the large demand for cash in the real economy and the\ntemporarily limited willingness of financial firms to provide it. Our liquidity facilities\nrelieved pressure on markets created by mass liquidations of assets driven by the demand\n\n- 8 -\nfor cash, as did our direct purchases of Treasuries. Our credit facilities satisfied the cash\ndemand of borrowers more directly. Our swap lines and repo facilities with foreign\ncentral banks alleviated the shortage of dollars to satisfy dollar-denominated cash needs\nabroad.\nThe result of this quite muscular intervention has been the fairly rapid return to\nstable market function despite the severe pressures I have been describing. Interestingly,\nin many cases our facilities had their effect less by actually providing liquidity or credit,\nthan by providing a backstop. The “announcement effect” of the Fed’s willingness to\nstep in returned confidence to market participants and function to markets, without the\nfacilities themselves seeing large amounts of use.\nLooking back at these events since the COVID event, what have we learned about\nthe U.S. financial system? One lesson is that several short-term funding markets proved\nfragile and needed support – the commercial paper market and prime and tax-exempt\nmoney market funds, as key examples.\nThe runs on prime money funds and commercial paper were particularly\ndisappointing, since in many ways they resembled runs that we saw in these markets\nduring the GFC. Money fund reforms implemented in 2016 were followed by investors\nshifting away from prime money funds and towards MMFs that hold securities backed by\neither the U. S. government or government-sponsored enterprises. Because they hold\nsafer assets, government funds are less fragile. At the same time, some prime funds can\nstill “break the buck” by suffering losses, or can put up “gates” that limit redemptions.\nInvestors worried about losses at a money fund may feel some incentive to be among the\nfirst to withdraw from the fund, before it breaks the buck or puts up redemption gates in\n\n- 9 -\nthe face of large outflows. The shortening of maturities in the commercial paper market\nwas similarly reminiscent of the GFC. It appears that these short-term funding markets\nremain an unstable source of funding in times of considerable financial stress. The Fed\nand other financial agencies have accomplished a lot in requiring or encouraging market\nparticipants to rely less on unstable short-term funding, but it is worth asking whether\nthere may be other steps needed to secure these very important sources of liquidity.\nA second lesson we learned last spring is that the Treasury market is not immune\nto the problems of short-term and dollar funding markets. In light of the importance of\nthe Treasury market to many other financial markets as well as to monetary and fiscal\npolicy, this further heightens the need to think about additional steps addressing\nvulnerabilities in short-term funding markets. In addition, we have to ask: What can be\ndone to improve Treasury market functioning over the longer term so that this market can\nwithstand a large shock to demand or supply? I will simply raise that question, but not\nattempt to answer it here.\nA third, broader lesson from this event is that the regulatory framework for banks\nconstructed after the GFC, with the refinements and recalibrations we have made over the\nlast few years, held up well. We did not see a recurrence of the problems faced by the\nbanking sector during the GFC, and the financial system and the economy would have\nbeen much worse off if we had seen it. Instead, banks have been a source of strength. I\nalso believe that this conclusion is entirely consistent with the significant emergency\nmeasures undertaken by the Fed. Almost all of these measures were targeted towards\nfinancial markets, nonbank financial institutions, and the real economy. Moreover, the\nunprecedented and in many ways unimaginable nature of the shock posed by the COVID\n\n- 10 -\nevent made it appropriate to take these steps when we did, to backstop the functioning of\nmarkets essential to the financial system. Their creation was an unmistakable signal to\nmarket participants of the capability and willingness of the Fed to restore market\nfunctioning, and the fact that this functioning was restored so quickly, with relatively\nlittle borrowing, shows this message was received, and believed. The system worked.\nLooking across the areas in which strains suggest a need for further reforms, I am\nstruck at the prominence of the continued need to focus on vulnerabilities associated with\nshort-term funding. In some sense, this should not be surprising. Vulnerabilities\nassociated with short-term funding have always been at the heart of financial crises and\ncentral banks’ efforts to promote financial stability. Such vulnerabilities led to Walter\nBagehot’s 19th century dictum that central banks need to stand ready to lend freely\nagainst good collateral during periods of financial strain. Such vulnerabilities triggered\nthe panic of 1907 and led to the establishment of the Federal Reserve. Such\nvulnerabilities led to runs on banks in the Great Depression and a series of reforms,\nincluding the establishment of deposit insurance. And such vulnerabilities were among\nthose that precipitated the Global Financial Crisis. Following in that vein, at the\nFinancial Stability Board (FSB) I have formed a high-level steering group of central\nbankers, market regulators, and international organizations to oversee the FSB’s work on\nnonbank finance, and to help coordinate work across the range of global standard setting\nbodies that oversee the financial sector. The group is currently completing a holistic\nreview of the COVID event to better understand the role that vulnerabilities stemming\nfrom nonbank financial institutions played in those events and to define a work program\nto address such vulnerabilities during 2021.\n\n- 11 -\nOne might look to the emergence of strains in short-term funding markets in\nMarch of this year as an indication that previous reform efforts fell short. Perhaps, and\nwe will be looking at this at the FSB. But I have, as well, a more hopeful outlook, based\non the extent of the test we faced and the outcome. The COVID event precipitated the\nmost abrupt decline in U.S. and global economic activity in recorded history. It is far\nfrom shocking that funding strains emerged, and it is heartening that the banking system\nremained resilient and that policy efforts were able to calm financial markets relatively\nquickly. The lessons we draw from this year’s events as we seek to strengthen our\nregulatory framework will leave us better positioned for the next shock and thereby\nsupport financial stability and sustained economic growth.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n5:30 p.m. EDT (2:30 p.m. PDT)\nMay 4, 2018\nLiquidity Regulation and the Size of the Fed’s Balance Sheet\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Currencies, Capital, and Central Bank Balances: A Policy Conference”\na Hoover Institution Monetary Policy Conference\nStanford University\nStanford, California\nMay 4, 2018\n\nThank you very much to the Hoover Institution for hosting this important\nconference and to John Taylor for inviting me to participate.1 In my capacity as both the\nVice Chairman for Supervision at the Board of Governors and a member of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC), part of my job is to consider the intersection of\nregulatory and monetary policy issues, the subject of my discussion today. This topic is a\nvery complex and dynamic nexus, especially as regulation and the implementation of\nmonetary policy continue to evolve.\nOne important issue for policymakers, and the one that I will spend some time\nreflecting on today, is how post-crisis financial regulation, through its incentives for bank\nbehavior, may influence the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in the long run.\nSuch a topic is admittedly difficult to address in the time we have today, so I will focus\non a particular component of the regulation--the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)--and its\nlink to banks’ demand for U.S. central bank reserve balances. Besides illuminating this\nparticular issue, I hope my discussion will help illustrate the complexities associated with\nthe interconnection of regulatory and monetary policy issues in general. Also, let me\nemphasize at the outset that I will be touching on some issues that the Board and the\nFOMC are in the process of observing and evaluating and, in some cases, may be far\nfrom reaching any final decisions on. As such, my thoughts on these issues are my own\nand are likely to evolve, benefiting from further discussion and our continued monitoring\nof bank behavior and financial markets over time.\n1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nMonetary Policy and the Efficiency of the Financial System\nBefore I delve into the more complicated subject of how one type of bank\nregulation affects the Fed’s balance sheet, let me say a few words about financial\nregulation and how it relates to monetary policy more generally. As I have said\npreviously, I view promoting the safety, soundness, and efficiency of the financial system\nas one of the most important roles of the Board. So how is efficiency of the financial\nsystem connected to monetary policy? To put it in the simplest fashion, to the extent that\nthe efficiency of the financial system is improved, it will improve the transmission of\nmonetary policy to the real economy.\nImproving efficiency of the financial system is not an isolated goal. The task is to\nenhance efficiency while maintaining the system’s resiliency. Take, for example, the\nBoard’s two most recent and material proposals, the stress capital buffer and the\nenhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR). The proposal to modify the eSLR, in\nparticular, initially raised questions in the minds of some as to whether it would reduce\nthe ability of the banking system to weather shocks. A closer look at the proposal shows\nthat the opposite is true. The proposed change simply restores the original intent of\nleverage requirements as a backstop measure to risk-based capital requirements. As we\nhave seen, a leverage requirement that is too high favors high-risk activities and\ndisincentivizes low-risk activities.\nWe had initially calibrated the leverage ratio at a level that caused it to be the\nbinding constraint for a number of our largest banks. As a result, those banks had an\nincentive to add risk rather than reduce risk in their portfolios because the capital cost of\neach additional asset was the same whether it was risky or safe, and the riskier assets\n\n- 3 -\nwould produce the higher return. The proposed recalibration eliminates this incentive by\nreturning this leverage ratio to a level that is a backstop rather than the driver of decisions\nat the margin. Yet, because of the complex way our capital regulations work together--\nwith risk-based constraints and stress tests regulating capital at both the operating and\nholding company levels--this improvement in incentives is obtained with virtually no\nchange in the overall capital requirements of the affected firms. Federal Reserve staff\nestimate the proposal would potentially reduce capital requirements across the eight large\nbanks subject to the proposal by $400 million, or 0.04 percent of the $955 billion in\ncapital these banks held as of September 2017.2 So this recalibration is a win-win: a\nmaterial realignment of incentives to reduce a regulatory encouragement to take on risk at\na time when we want to encourage prudent behavior without any material capital\nreduction or cost to the system’s resiliency. Taken together, I believe these new rules\nwill maintain the resiliency of the financial system and make our regulation simpler and\nmore risk sensitive.\nLiquidity Regulations\nLet me now back up to the time just before the financial crisis and briefly describe\nwhy liquidity regulations are necessary for banks. Banking organizations play a vital role\nin the economy in serving the financial needs of U.S. households and businesses. They\nperform this function in part through the mechanism of maturity transformation--that is,\ntaking in short-term deposits, thereby making a form of short-term, liquid investments\n2 Required capital at the bank subsidiaries of these firms would be reduced by larger amounts--and would\nonly allow the firm to move that capital to different subsidiaries within the firm—but, more importantly,\nthe overall capital regime prevents this capital from being distributed out of the banking organization as a\nwhole except in this de minimis amount. Thus, the overall organization retains the same capital levels\nwithout the structure of capital regulation creating an incentive to add risk to the system.\n\n- 4 -\navailable to households and businesses, while providing longer-term credit to these same\nentities. This role, however, makes banking firms vulnerable to the potential for rapid,\nbroad-based outflows of their funding (a so-called run), and these institutions must\ntherefore balance the extent of their profitable maturity transformation against the\nassociated liquidity risks.3 Leading up to the 2007-09 financial crisis, some large firms\nwere overly reliant on certain types of short-term funding and overly confident in their\nability to replenish their funding when it came due. Thus, during the crisis, some large\nbanks did not have sufficient liquidity, and liquidity risk management at a broader set of\ninstitutions proved inadequate at anticipating and compensating for potential outflows,\nespecially when those outflows occurred on a rapid basis.4\nIn the wake of the crisis, a combination of regulatory reforms and stronger\nsupervision was needed to promote increased resilience in the financial sector. With\nregard to liquidity, the prudential regulations and supervisory programs implemented by\nthe U.S. banking agencies have resulted in significant improvements in the liquidity\npositions and in the risk management of our largest institutions. And, working closely\nwith other jurisdictions, we have also implemented global liquidity standards for the first\ntime. These standards seek to limit the effect of short-term outflows and extended overall\nfunding mismatches, thus improving banks’ liquidity resilience.\n3 While deposit insurance helps mitigate the incentive for many depositors to run, it cannot fully eliminate\nthis risk. For a discussion of this vulnerability, see Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig (1983),\n“Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 91 (June), pp. 401-19.\n4 See Senior Supervisors Group (2009), Risk Management Lessons from the Global Banking Crisis of 2008\n(New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, October),\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/newsevents/news/banking/2009/SSG_report.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nOne particular liquidity requirement for large banking organizations is the LCR,\nwhich the U.S. federal banking agencies adopted in 2014.5 The LCR rule requires\ncovered firms to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets (HQLA)--in terms of both\nquantity and quality--to cover potential outflows over a 30-day period of liquidity stress.\nThe LCR rule allows firms to meet this requirement with a range of cash and securities\nand does not apply a haircut to reserve balances or Treasury securities based on the\nestimated liquidity value of those instruments in times of stress. Further, firms are\nrequired to demonstrate that they can monetize HQLA in a stress event without adversely\naffecting the firm’s reputation or franchise.\nThe rules have resulted in some changes in the behavior of large banks and in\nmarket dynamics. Large banks have adjusted their funding profiles by shifting to more\nstable funding sources. Indeed, taken together, the covered banks have reduced their\nreliance on short-term wholesale funding from about 50 percent of total assets in the\nyears before the financial crisis to about 30 percent in recent years, and they have also\nreduced their reliance on contingent funding sources. Meanwhile, covered banks have\nalso adjusted their asset profiles, materially increasing their holdings of cash and other\nhighly liquid assets. In fact, these banks’ holdings of HQLA have increased significantly,\nfrom low levels at some firms in the lead-up to the crisis to an average of about 15 to\n20 percent of total assets today.6 A sizable portion of these assets currently consists of\nU.S. central bank reserve balances, in part because reserve balances, unlike other types of\n5 For a full description of the U.S. LCR, including which banks are covered, see Regulation WW--Liquidity\nRisk Management Standards, 12 C.F.R. pt. 249 (2017), https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CFR-2017-\ntitle12-vol4/CFR-2017-title12-vol4-part249.\n6 See Jane Ihrig, Edward Kim, Ashish Kumbhat, Cindy M.

Let me emphasize that policymakers have long been aware of the\npotential influence that regulations may have on reserve demand and thus the longer-run\nsize of the Fed’s balance sheet. And, of course, regulatory influences on banks’ behavior,\nmy focus today, is just one of many factors that could affect policymakers’ decisions\nregarding the appropriate long-run size of the Fed’s balance sheet.7 In particular, in\naugmenting its Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, the FOMC stated in June 2017\nthat it “currently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances, over time, to a\nlevel appreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial\ncrisis” and went on to note that “the level will reflect the banking system’s demand for\nreserve balances and the Committee’s decisions about how to implement monetary policy\nmost efficiently and effectively in the future.”8\n7 For example, a separate factor that is relevant for policymakers in this regard is the FOMC’s choice of\nlong-run framework for monetary policy implementation. For policymakers’ discussions of this factor, see\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, July 26-27, 2016,” press release, August 17,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20160817a.htm; and Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee,\nNovember 1-2, 2016,” press release, November 23,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20161123a.htm.\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “FOMC Issues Addendum to the Policy\nNormalization Principles and Plans,” press release, June 14, paragraph 6,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614c.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nWith that said, it is useful to begin by examining banks’ current reserve holdings.\nFigure 1 plots the aggregate level of reserve balances in the U.S. banking system, starting\nwell before the financial crisis. As you can see, the current level of reserves--at around\n$2 trillion--is many orders of magnitude higher than the level that prevailed before the\nfinancial crisis, a result of the Fed’s large-scale asset purchase programs that aimed to\nmitigate the severe economic downturn and stem disinflationary pressures in the wake of\nthe crisis. The vertical lines in the figure show key dates in the implementation of the\nLCR, including the initial Basel III international introduction of the regulation followed\nby its two-step introduction in the United States. A key takeaway from this figure is that\nthe Fed was in the process of adding substantial quantities of reserve balances to the\nbanking system while the LCR was being implemented--and these two changes largely\nhappened simultaneously. As a result, banks, in aggregate, are currently using reserve\nbalances to meet a significant portion of their LCR requirements. In addition, because\nthese changes happened together, it is reasonable to conclude that the current\nenvironment is likely not very informative about banks’ underlying demand for reserve\nbalances.\nBut now the situation is changing, albeit very slowly. Last October, the Fed\nbegan to gradually and predictably reduce the size of its balance sheet.9 The Fed is doing\nso by reinvesting the principal payments it receives on its securities holdings only to the\nextent that they exceed gradually increasing caps--that is, the Fed is allowing securities to\nroll off its portfolio each month up to a specific maximum amount. This policy is also\n9 The FOMC announced this change to its balance sheet policy in its September 2017 postmeeting\nstatement; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, September 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170920a.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nreducing reserve balances. So far, after the first seven months of the program, the Fed\nhas shed about $120 billion of its securities holdings, which is a fairly modest amount\nwhen compared with the remaining size of its balance sheet. Consequently, the level of\nreserves in the banking system is still quite abundant.\nSo, how many more reserve balances can be drained, and how small will the\nFed’s balance sheet get? Let me emphasize that this question is highly\nspeculative--policymakers have not decided the desired long-run size of the Fed’s\nbalance sheet, nor, as I noted earlier, do we have a definitive handle on banks’ long-run\ndemand for reserve balances. Indeed, the FOMC has said that it “expects to learn more\nabout the underlying demand for reserves during the process of balance sheet\nnormalization.”10 Nonetheless, let me spend a little time reflecting on this challenging\nquestion.\nHow banks respond to the Fed’s reduction in reserve balances could, in theory,\ntake a few different forms. One could envision that as the Fed reduces its securities\nholdings, a large share of which consists of Treasury securities, banks would easily\nreplace any reduction in reserve balances with Treasury holdings, thereby keeping their\nLCRs roughly unchanged. According to this line of thought, because central bank\nreserve balances and Treasury securities are treated identically by the LCR, banks should\nbe largely indifferent to holding either asset to meet the regulation. In that case, the\nreduction in reserves and corresponding increase in Treasury holdings might occur with\nrelatively little adjustment in their relative rates of return. Alternatively, one could argue\nthat banks may have particular preferences about the composition of their liquid assets.\n10 See Board of Governors, “FOMC Issues Addendum,” paragraph 6, in note 7.\n\n- 9 -\nAnd since banks are profit-maximizing entities, they will likely compare rates of return\nacross various HQLA-eligible assets in determining how many reserves to hold. If\nrelative asset returns are a key driver of reserve demand, then interest rates across various\ntypes of HQLA will adjust on an ongoing basis until banks are satisfied holding the\naggregate quantity of reserves that is available.\nRecent research by the Board staff shows that banks currently display a\nsignificant degree of heterogeneity in their approaches to meeting their LCR\nrequirements, including in their chosen volumes of reserve balances.11 Figure 2 shows a\nsubset of this research to illustrate this point. The top and bottom panels represent\nestimates of how two large banks have been meeting their HQLA requirements over time.\nIn each panel, the blue portions of the bars denote the share of HQLA met by reserve\nbalances, while the red, yellow, and brown slices of the bars represent the share met by\nTreasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and other HQLA-eligible assets,\nrespectively. Despite holding roughly similarly amounts of HQLA, the two banks exhibit\nvery different HQLA compositions, with the bank depicted in the top panel consistently\nholding a much larger share of HQLA in the form of reserve balances than the bank\nshown in the bottom panel. This finding suggests that there likely is no single\n“representative bank” behavioral model that can capture all we might want to know about\nbanks’ demand for central bank reserve balances.\nSome of the differences we see in bank behavior likely relate to banks’ individual\nliquidity needs and preferences. Indeed, banks manage their balance sheets in part by\ntaking into account their internal liquidity targets, which are determined by the\n11 See Ihrig and others, “Managing the Composition of High-Quality Liquid Assets,” in note 5.\n\n- 10 -\ninteraction between the specific needs of their various business lines and bank\nmanagement’s preferences. In any case, this picture illustrates the complexities that are\ninherent in understanding banks’ underlying demand for reserve balances, a topic for\nwhich more research would be quite valuable to policymakers.\nSo, what does this finding say about the longer-run level of reserve balances\ndemanded by banks? The answer is that there is a large degree of uncertainty. In fact,\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York surveyed primary dealers and market participants\nlast December to solicit their views about the level of reserves they expect to prevail in\n2025.12 A few features of the survey responses stand out. All respondents thought that\nthe longer-run level of reserve balances would be substantially lower than the current\nlevel of more than $2 trillion. In addition, there appeared to be a widely held view that\nthe longer-run level of reserves will be significantly above the level that prevailed before\nthe financial crisis. But even so, the respondents did not agree about what that longer-run\nlevel will be, with about half anticipating a level ranging between $400 billion and\n$750 billion.\nIt is important to point out that the Fed’s balance sheet will remain larger than it\nwas before the crisis even after abstracting from the issue of banks’ longer-run demand\nfor reserve balances. The reason is that the ultimate size of the Fed’s balance sheet also\ndepends on developments across a broader set of Fed liabilities. One such liability is the\noutstanding amount of Federal Reserve notes in circulation--that is, paper money--which\nhas doubled over the past decade to a volume of more than $1.6 trillion, growing at a rate\n12 The December 2017 Survey of Primary Dealers is available on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s\nwebsite at https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/survey/2017/dec-2017-spd-results.pdf.\nThe December 2017 Survey of Market Participants is available at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/survey/2017/dec-2017-smp-results.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nthat generally reflects the pace of expansion of economic activity in nominal terms.\nOther nonreserve liabilities have also grown since the crisis, including the Treasury\nDepartment’s account at the Fed, known as the Treasury’s General Account. Recent\ngrowth in such items means that the longer-run size of the Fed’s balance sheet will be\nnoticeably larger than before the crisis regardless of the volume of reserve balances that\nmight ultimately prevail.\nPutting the various pieces together, figure 3 illustrates how the overall size of the\nFed’s balance sheet may evolve. Given the uncertainties I have described, I have chosen\nto show three different scenarios, drawn from the most recent annual report released by\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which was published last month.13 These\nscenarios highlight the degree to which the longer-run size of the Fed’s domestic\nsecurities portfolio--also known as the System Open Market Account, or SOMA, which\naccounts for the vast majority of the Fed’s assets--will be affected by choices about the\nfuture level of reserve balances and the evolution of nonreserve liabilities. The\nassumptions underlying the scenarios are based on the distribution of responses from the\nsurveys I described earlier, as those surveys also asked respondents to forecast the likely\nlonger-run levels of several liabilities on the Fed’s balance sheet other than reserves.\nThe “median” scenario, represented by the red (middle) line in the figure, is based on the\n50th percentile of survey responses, while the “larger” and the “smaller” scenarios,\ndenoted by the gold dashed (top) and blue dotted (bottom) lines, are based on the\n75th and 25th percentiles, respectively.\n13 See Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2018), Open Market Operations during 2017 (New York:\nFRBNY, April), available at https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/annual_reports.html. Among other\nthings, the report reviews the conduct of open market operations and other developments that influenced\nthe System Open Market Account of the Federal Reserve in 2017.\n\n- 12 -\nThe figure illustrates that the Fed’s securities holdings are projected to decline\nabout $400 billion this year and another $460 billion next year as Treasury and agency\nsecurities continue to roll off gradually from the Fed’s portfolio. The kink in each curve\ncaptures what the FOMC has referred to as the point of “normalization” of the size of the\nFed’s balance sheet--that is, the point at which the balance sheet will begin to expand\nagain to support the underlying growth in liabilities items such as Federal Reserve notes\nin circulation. All else being equal, greater longer-run demand for currency, reserve\nbalances, or other liabilities implies an earlier timing of balance sheet normalization and a\nhigher longer-run size of the balance sheet, as illustrated by the top line. And the\nconverse--smaller demand for these liabilities and a later timing of normalization,\nillustrated by the bottom line--is also possible. In the three scenarios shown, the size of\nthe Fed’s securities portfolio normalizes sometime between 2020 and 2022. That is quite\na range of time, so as the balance sheet normalization program continues, the Fed will be\nclosely monitoring developments for clues about banks’ underlying demand for reserves.\nWhat will the Fed be monitoring as reserves are drained and the balance sheet\nshrinks? I would first like to emphasize that the Fed regularly monitors financial markets\nfor a number of reasons, so I do not mean to imply that we will be doing anything that is\nvery much different for our normal practice. As reserves continue to be drained, we will\nwant to gauge how banks are managing their balance sheets in continuing to meet their\nLCRs, watching in particular how the distribution of reserve balances across the banking\nsystem evolves as well as monitoring any large-scale changes in banks’ holdings of other\nHQLA-eligible assets, including Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed\nsecurities.\n\n- 13 -\nAnd on the liabilities side of banks’ books, we will be keeping our eye on both the\nvolume and the composition of deposits, as there are reasons why banks may take steps,\nover time, to hold onto certain types of deposits more than others. In particular, retail\ndeposits may be especially desired by banks going forward because they receive the most\nfavorable treatment under the LCR and also tend to be relatively low cost.\nRetail deposits have grown quite a bit since the crisis, especially in light of the\nprolonged period of broad-based low interest rates and accommodative monetary policy,\nlimiting the need for banks to compete for this most stable form of deposits. However,\nthe combination of rising interest rates and the Fed’s shrinking balance sheet, together\nwith banks’ ongoing need to meet the LCR, may alter these competitive dynamics.\nOf course, importantly, deposits will not necessarily decline one-for-one with\nreserve balances as the Fed’s balance sheet shrinks. The overall effects of the decline in\nthe Fed’s balance sheet will depend both on who ultimately ends up holding the securities\nin place of the Fed and on the full range of portfolio adjustments that other economic\nagents ultimately make as a result.14\nWe will also be monitoring movements in interest rates. In part, we will be\ntracking how the yields and spreads on the various assets that banks use to meet their\nLCR requirements evolve. For example, to the extent that some banks will wish to keep\nmeeting a significant portion of their LCR requirements with reserves, the reduction in\nthe Fed’s balance sheet and the associated drop in aggregate reserves could eventually\nresult in some upward pressure on the effective federal funds rate and on yields of\n14 For a discussion of the overall effects of the decline in the Fed’s balance sheet, see Jane Ihrig, Lawrence\nMize, and Gretchen C. Weinbach (2017), “How Does the Fed Adjust Its Securities Holdings and Who Is\nAffected?” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-099 (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, September), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017099pap.pdf.\n\n- 14 -\nTreasury securities. This situation could occur if some banks eventually find that they\nare holding fewer reserves than desired at a given constellation of interest rates and, in\nresponse, begin to bid for more federal funds while selling Treasury securities or other\nassets. Interest rates will adjust up until banks are indifferent with regard to holding the\nrelatively smaller volume of reserves available in the banking system.\nOverall, policymakers will be monitoring to make sure that the level of reserves\nthe Fed supplies to the banking sector, which influences the composition of assets and\nliabilities on banks’ balance sheets as well as market interest rates, provides the desired\nstance of monetary policy to achieve the FOMC’s dual mandate of maximum\nemployment and stable prices. Of course, we will need to be very careful to understand\nthe precise factors that underlie any significant movements in these areas, because factors\nthat are unrelated to the Fed’s balance sheet policies might also cause such adjustments.\nConclusion\nTo conclude, I would like to reemphasize that I have touched on some highly\nuncertain issues today--issues that, I would like to stress again, have not been decided by\nthe FOMC. One such issue that closely relates to my remarks today, and one I believe\nthe upcoming panel will likely address, is which policy implementation framework the\nFed should use in the long run. That is, broadly speaking, should the Fed continue to use\nan operational framework that is characterized by having relatively abundant reserves and\noperate in what is termed a “floor regime,” or should it use one in which the supply of\nreserves is managed so that it is much closer to banks’ underlying demand for reserves as\nin a “corridor regime”?\n\n- 15 -\nOf course, a host of complex issues underlie this decision, so I would just like to\nemphasize two general points. First, a wide range of quantities of reserve balances--and\nthus overall sizes of the Fed’s balance sheet--could be consistent with either type of\nframework. Second, while U.S. liquidity regulations likely influence banks’ demand for\nreserves, the Fed is not constrained by such regulations in deciding its operational\nframework, because U.S. banks will be readily able to meet their regulatory liquidity\nrequirements using the range of available high-quality liquid assets, of which reserve\nbalances is one type.\nImportantly, additional experience with the Federal Reserve’s policy of gradually\nreducing its balance sheet will help inform policymakers’ future deliberations regarding\nissues related to the long-run size of the Fed’s balance sheet, issues that will not need to\nbe decided for some time.\nThe final and most general point is simply to underscore the premise with which I\nbegan these remarks: Financial regulation and monetary policy are, in important\nrespects, connected. Thus, it will always be important for the Federal Reserve to\nmaintain its integral role in the regulation of the financial system not only for the\nvisibility this provides into the economy, but precisely in order to calibrate the sorts of\nrelationships we have been talking about today.\n\nLiquidity Regulation and the Size of the Fed’s Balance\nSheet\nRemarks by\nVice Chairman for Supervision Randal K.

Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nChair\nFinancial Stability Board\nat the\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, DC\nMarch 30, 2021\n\nIntroduction\nThank you for inviting me today. It’s an honor and a pleasure to speak here at the\nPeterson Institute, a group that has driven much of the most important discussion of\ninternational economic issues over my entire working life. I only wish that we could all\ngather in person—perhaps soon.\nA little over 420 years ago, a crowd-pleasing local fabler on a lightly populated\nisland in the North Atlantic made popular a phrase that has entered into our language:\n“Beware the Ides of March.” Caesar ignored the soothsayer, and the results weren’t\ngood; if recent history is any indication, perhaps we should keep the warning in mind as\nwell. In March 2008, we witnessed a significant domino fall in a chain of events that\nsparked the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) with the collapse and sale of Bear Stearns.\nMarch of the following year saw the nadir of the Dow Jones average—a 50% drop from\njust over a year earlier. And the margin calls and liquidity crunch in March of 2020, was\na salient echo of the other significance of the Ides of March for the Romans: the deadline\nfor settling debts, which have had an unsettling habit of coming due in March in our\nrecent financial history.\nIndeed, this time last year, both domestically and internationally, the financial\nregulatory community fortified itself as COVID-19 and related containment measures\nspread across the globe, what I refer to as the COVID event. The Financial Stability\nBoard (FSB) moved into high gear, holding weekly, and even daily, meetings with the\nmost senior leaders of central banks, finance ministries, and market regulators—to share\ninformation and shape a synchronized global approach to the financial stability\nchallenges at hand.\n\n- 2 -\nThis ability to spring into action on short notice is exactly why the FSB was\nestablished in the wake of the GFC. Its mandate, to promote international financial\nstability by coordinating the development of regulatory, supervisory, and other financial\nsector policies, at a global level, reflected a recognition of the growing\ninterconnectedness across our markets and economies.\nMy focus today will be on the future and the challenges we face going forward—\nin particular, nonbank financial intermediation, or NBFI, and cross-border payments.\nThese are only a portion of the FSB’s comprehensive work plan, but they are priority\nareas that will have significant impact on the financial landscape going forward.\nNBFI: Vulnerabilities, Interconnection, and Improving Resilience\nDeveloping an NBFI Perspective\nSince the GFC of 2008, the NBFI sector has grown and evolved considerably,\naccounting for almost half of all global financial assets at the start of the COVID event.\nWith this growth has come greater interconnectedness and complexity in intermediation\nchains. Even before the market turmoil of last March, the need to understand the\nvulnerabilities arising from the banking sector as well as those risks that have moved\noutside the banking system was viewed as critical to achieving and maintaining financial\nstability. The March market turmoil helped focus our attention on NBFI and pushed the\nFSB to give further priority to work in this area.\nBecause of the way this diverse sector is structured, developing an NBFI\nperspective requires bringing together regulatory, supervisory, and market perspectives\nand taking a broad view of how our financial ecosystem works. Even ahead of the\nCOVID event, in my role as chair of the FSB, I formed a high-level group of central\n\n- 3 -\nbankers and market regulators to oversee and coordinate work on NBFI—which, by\nMarch, was clearly a fortunate decision. Under direction of this senior group, the FSB\ncarried out its Holistic Review of the March Market Turmoil (Holistic Review), which\nexamined not only how different sectors of the market were affected, but also how these\neffects were transmitted throughout the system and which aspects of the financial system\nstructure may have amplified stress.1\nFSB Focus on March Market Turmoil and Needed Next Steps\nThe Holistic Review underscored how vulnerabilities in the financial system\namplified the economic shocks of the COVID event. In particular, it highlighted the\ndependence of the system on readily available liquidity, and vulnerabilities if liquidity\nstrains emerge—in money market mutual funds (MMFs) and open-end funds, through\nmargin calls and in core bond markets. Importantly, it provides a high-level view on how\nthese parts of the financial ecosystem operate and transmit risk while under stress.\nIn my view, one of the most significant findings relates to MMFs. The Holistic\nReview documented how the extremely high demand for liquidity, combined with a\nflight-to-safety, triggered a “dash for cash” that hit institutional prime money market\nfunds particularly hard. In the US, prime MMFs publicly offered to institutional\ninvestors had outflows of roughly $100 billion, or 30 percent of the funds’ assets, over\ntwo weeks in mid-March. This was a faster run, in terms of the percentage of fund assets\nredeemed, than during the turmoil in September 2008. Similar patterns were also seen in\nEurope, particularly for US dollar-denominated MMFs. Other funds that are active in\n1 Financial Stability Board, Holistic Review of March Market Turmoil (Basel: Financial Stability Board,\nNovember 17, 2020), https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P171120-2.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nshort-term funding markets, such as ultrashort bond funds, also saw unprecedented\noutflows in March.\nThe March market turmoil is the second time in roughly a decade that we have\nwitnessed destabilizing runs on MMFs. More concerning this time, however, is that we\nhad taken steps between these events precisely to reduce the likelihood of such runs.\nThe FSB will publish a report in July for consultation that will set out\nconsequential policy proposals to improve MMF resilience. The proposals should also\nreduce the likelihood that government interventions and taxpayer support will be needed\nto halt future MMF runs. This work will also consider the relationship between MMFs\nand short-term funding markets, with a particular focus on commercial paper and\ncertificate of deposit markets and the impact of dealer behavior.\nContinued work on other open-end funds, margining and bond market structure,\nand liquidity will come on the heels of the MMF deliverables. As a first step, the focus\nwill be on enhancing our understanding of vulnerabilities that could emanate from these\nsectors, including risk transmission channels. Addressing systemic risk in a dynamic\nsector that continues to evolve is no small feat. I expect policy-related discussions and\nrecommendations to follow the analytical work, though that will likely extend past this\nyear.\nAlthough my time is limited to provide more detail, I would like to note that the\ndisruptions in bond markets also raised questions about the role of leveraged investors\nand the willingness and capacity of dealers to intermediate in times of stress. Work is\nunderway to gather data and analyze dealer behavior to develop a comprehensive view on\n\n- 5 -\ntheir impact on financial market functioning and determine whether policy responses are\nnecessary.\nTurning to a different part of our NBFI work plan, the March market turmoil\ndemonstrated the benefits that central clearing brings for global financial stability.\nIndeed, central counterparties (CCPs) demonstrated resilience during this tumultuous\nperiod. Given their systemic importance, however, we continue to advance work to\nimprove CCP resilience and resolvability, as set out in the FSB 2020 resolution report. I\nam coordinating with the Chairs of the Committee on Payments and Market\nInfrastructures (CPMI), International Organization of Securities Commissions, and the\nFSB Resolution Steering Group on shaping these details. We expect to launch a\nworkstream this year aimed at further strengthening the resilience and resolvability of\nCCPs in default and non-default loss scenarios, including assessing whether any new\ntypes of resources would be necessary to enhance CCP resolvability.\nThe FSB and other standard-setting bodies have also begun work on margin\nactivity in centrally cleared and non-centrally cleared markets during the peak of the\nmarket volatility last year. We observed that margin calls by some CCPs may have been\nlarger than expected. While we need to ensure that CCPs are sufficiently margined as\ncritical nodes in the financial system, clearing members and their clients also need\nsufficient transparency and predictability to be able to manage their exposures.\nLooking Forward: NBFI Next Steps and Needed Components\nTo be successful, this broad and comprehensive agenda, which serves as a\ncornerstone of the FSB work program for 2021 and beyond, will require strong\ncoordination, commitment, and resources from the international regulatory community,\n\n- 6 -\nincluding at the FSB and other standard-setting bodies. Further, to ensure a sound,\npractical, and effective way forward, these workstreams will also require transparency\nand engagement among the public. The FSB is, therefore, seeking the input of market\nparticipants and other parties.\nThis NBFI work alone would be an ambitious agenda. But I believe the FSB is\nwell equipped to address this challenge while also furthering the other important elements\nof our broad agenda. Let me spend some time talking about another of these important\nobjectives: enhancing cross-border payments.\nEnhancing Cross-border Payments\nIn 2019, the G20 identified enhancing cross-border payments as a key priority and\nthe FSB has been dedicated to advancing this important work ever since. The challenges\nassociated with cross-border payments are widely known and longstanding. Prior\nattempts to make improvements have struggled to gain traction. In October 2020, the\nFSB delivered a multi-year roadmap to the G20 leaders who endorsed the way forward\nand committed to advancing meaningful change aimed at increasing the efficiency and\neffectiveness of cross-border payments.2\nUltimately, we are focused on addressing the core challenges associated with\ncross-border payments: cost, speed, accessibility, and transparency. It goes without\nsaying that making improvements is easier said than done. Frictions underlying existing\nprocesses span multiple legal, operational, processing, technological, and structural\nissues, which can differ greatly by region. To break down the magnitude of our task, the\n2 See Financial Stability Board, Enhancing Cross-border Payments: Stage 3 Roadmap (Basel: Financial\nStability Board, October 13, 2020), https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P131020-1.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nroadmap includes a set of practical actions designed to address specific topics, which we\nrefer to as “building blocks.” We are taking a comprehensive approach and engaging the\npublic and private sectors because both need to be a part of the solution if we are to\nachieve the ambitious goals we have set for ourselves.\nTo begin, we must decide what the actual improvements are that we want to see,\nand how we will monitor our progress in achieving them. These decisions will define the\nlevel of ambition, create accountability and shape how the roadmap is operationalized at\nthe global, regional, and national levels. As a first step, the FSB has formed a task force\nthat is responsible for setting specific, quantitative targets. These targets will set the tone\nand pace for work that follows and are therefore among the most important deliverables\nthe FSB will complete this year. We plan to publish a consultative paper in May and\ndeliver a final set of targets to the G20 in October.\nSeveral groups are charged with advancing one or more building blocks over the\ncourse of this year, with the FSB providing annual updates to the G20. To deliver the\nroadmap, we are collaborating closely with the Committee on Payments and Markets\nInfrastructures of the Bank for International Settlements, which has a key role given the\nposition of central banks in the payments ecosystem. In addition to setting targets, the\nFSB is leading multiple elements of the roadmap, advancing those building blocks that\nare more exploratory in nature, for example, the soundness of global stablecoin\narrangements. On this particular topic, last year, the FSB issued high-level\nrecommendations for the regulation, supervision, and oversight of global stablecoins, and\nwe will report to the G20 this year on the progress achieved at both international and\nnational levels.\n\n- 8 -\nBy their nature, cross-border payments are global and involve many other\ncountries outside of the G20 membership. We must therefore be inclusive in our\napproach, while remaining well organized to meet the milestones we have set for\nourselves. To this end, we have partnered with the World Bank and International\nMonetary Fund given their respective missions and global reach.\nIt will also be important to engage with financial institutions, service providers,\nindustry groups, practitioners, and academics as we advance this work. We plan to\ncommunicate information and seek feedback through public consultations, conferences,\nand bilateral and multilateral outreach. The roadmap sets our path, but the practical\nreality is, we need consensus among, and action by, many different—even competing—\nstakeholders to achieve success. We have purposely built into the roadmap opportunities\nto course correct because we expect to learn more as we go. The FSB will report\nannually to the G20 Summit and the public, sharing progress and seeking confirmation on\nthe next steps for this immensely important and ongoing work.\nOther Key Financial Stability Items for 2021\nWhat I have just discussed covers a large portion of the FSB’s 2021 work plan,\nbut I would be remiss if I did not mention a few other significant areas.\nWe are, of course, continuing to closely monitor vulnerabilities stemming from\nthe COVID event, including the rise in nonfinancial sector debt and measures of bond\nand equity market valuations. In April, the FSB will report on key considerations\ninvolved in amending or unwinding COVID-19 support measures, as appropriate. The\nFSB will play an important role once unwinding measures begin, given its work to\nsupport international information sharing on COVID-19 policy responses. The FSB also\n\n- 9 -\nplans to assess initial lessons learned from the COVID event for financial stability and\nshare them with the G20 in July.\nThe COVID event has underscored the financial sector’s susceptibility to\noperational risks especially those related to cybersecurity. The speed of technological\nchange and a growing reliance on third-party, technology-based services is increasingly\nintroducing new risks and vulnerabilities to the sector. To begin to address this, the FSB\nis focused on achieving greater convergence in areas such as regulatory reporting of\ncyber incidents, and we will deliver those recommendations to the G20 in October.\nBanking Reforms—an Assessment to Date\nNext month, the FSB will release the final report of its most ambitious evaluation\nof the effects of post-GFC banking reforms. The report on too-big-to-fail (TBTF)\nreforms is the FSB’s most analytically rigorous evaluation carried out to date. When\nlooking at these reforms, indicators of systemic risk and moral hazard moved in the right\ndirection, and effective TBTF reforms seem to have brought net benefits. In fact, at the\nbeginning of the COVID event, we observed a far more resilient banking sector than that\nwhich entered the 2008 crisis.\nYet, if the benefits of TBTF reforms are to be fully realized, there remains further\nwork to do. The FSB outlines this work in its forthcoming evaluation. Further analysis\nof such reforms, international financial standards, agreed G20 and FSB commitments,\nrecommendations, and other initiatives will provide us with better insights into whether\nthe reforms are working as intended or conflict with one another, are structured\nefficiently, and if they are in need of refinement.\nTransitioning Away from London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)\n\n- 10 -\nOne last particular item to mention: LIBOR. Transitioning away from LIBOR is\na significant undertaking that the FSB has been engaged in for almost a decade. The FSB\nset forth a roadmap for clear actions that financial firms and their clients can take to\nensure a smooth transition away from LIBOR.3 This year, the FSB will report to the G20\non ongoing progress and issues related to the LIBOR transition, including supervisory\nissues related to the benchmark transition.\nConclusion\nWe faced a confluence of events over the past year that demanded international\ncoordination in several key areas, and that is precisely why the FSB was created more\nthan ten years ago; a beacon at the end of another fateful March. The span of territory\nand topics covered can admittedly seem bewildering at times—I’ve covered only a few of\nthem today. Yet as the FSB builds its agenda for each coming year, the process is much\nlike a pointillist painting. Each topic, viewed by itself is a series of complex data\npoints—but, upon stepping back, we see the connection and interdependence of the\nvarious elements. The role of the FSB is to orchestrate a unified image and coherent\napproach; to ensure we continually monitor and address those hazards, the shape and\nform we have already identified, while allowing for vicissitudes like the COVID event,\nwhich arise quickly, with little notice, and that require extra space on the canvas.\nThere is little margin for error in our work. Achieving our objectives requires the\nutmost in diplomacy and rigorous analysis. In light of all the challenges we have faced\nover this extraordinary year, I am proud of what my colleagues in the FSB have done.\n3 See Financial Stability Board, Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks: 2020 Progress report (Basel:\nFinancial Stability Board, November 20, 2020), https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P191120.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nMy fellow public servants from across the globe working on FSB topics are steadfast in\ntheir daily pursuit of a unified mission—to promote international financial stability. I\nthink the work we have laid out for 2021 does just that.",

Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Strategic Approaches to the Fed’s Balance Sheet and Communications”\nSpring 2019 Meeting of the Manhattan Institute’s Shadow Open Market Committee\nNew York, New York\nMarch 29, 2019\n\nIt is a pleasure to address the Manhattan Institute’s Shadow Open Market\nCommittee (SOMC) today.1 The SOMC has long served as an important forum for\ndebate regarding the appropriate stance of monetary policy--debates that have often\nbrought alternative perspectives to the challenges facing the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) in the pursuit of its dual mandate of maximum employment and\nstable prices. As Allan Meltzer wrote about his and Karl Brunner’s founding of the\nSOMC, “Our objective at the time and after was not just to complain about the results of\npolicy actions. . . . We hoped also to improve policy discussion.”2\nThis afternoon, I will briefly remark on the economic outlook and the current\nstance of monetary policy, and I would then like to devote some time to a discussion of\nthe approach the Federal Reserve has taken on the setting of the countercyclical capital\nbuffer (CCyB) and why I see a setting of 0 percent, as recently affirmed by the Board, as\nthe current appropriate setting for the CCyB. Also, I will review some of the\ninternational experience with the CCyB. Given that the CCyB is a relatively new\nelement of our regulatory toolkit, the international experience has the potential to provide\nuseful information on how the CCyB can be made most effective.\nThe Economic Outlook\nBut first, let me turn to the economic outlook. At last week’s meeting, the FOMC\nleft the policy rate unchanged and reiterated its patient approach toward future policy\nadjustments.3 I supported this decision. It is prudent at this point to watch the evolution\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Allan H. Meltzer (2000), “The Shadow Open Market Committee: Origins and Operations,” Journal\nof Financial Services Research, vol. 18 (December), pp. 119-28 (quoted text on p. 120).\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC\nStatement,” press release, March 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190320a.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nof the incoming data in determining the appropriate stance of policy, particularly given\nsome indication that growth has slowed, at least temporarily, in the most recent data.\nThat said, I remain optimistic about the outlook for the U.S. economy, and I think that we\nhave the potential to maintain growth at a healthy pace in the years ahead.\nWith regard to the recent data, a sharp falloff in some retail sales measures in\nDecember suggested a slowing of consumption, the mainstay component of aggregate\ndemand. While I would not suggest ignoring this decline, it does seem rather inconsistent\nwith a number of other indicators, including the continued strength of the labor market\nand wage gains in recent months.\nAnd the labor market does remain strong. Even with a weak reading in February,\nthe three-month average gain in payrolls, at 186,000, remains above most estimates of the\npace of job gains needed to maintain downward pressure on an already historically low\nunemployment rate. As with retail sales, the February payroll number seems a bit odd,\nespecially when measured against the continued strength of the household survey for the\nsame month. That said, weak February payrolls are another reason to continue patiently\nwatching the data to see how economic conditions evolve.\nLooking past the near-term data, I see many reasons to expect relatively strong\ngrowth in the coming years, supported by gains in the productive capacity of the\neconomy. Regarding the inputs of production, I have been encouraged by the increase in\nlabor force participation over the past year. After a period of subdued growth, investment\nwas also strong last year, with spending on equipment and intangibles rising 7½ percent,\nincreasing the capital stock and adding to the productive potential of the economy.\nThough some recent investment indicators have been less robust, these data are volatile,\n\n- 3 -\nand I expect continued gains supported by profit growth, continuing impetus from\nincentives in the tax bill, and a generally favorable business environment.\nMost important, I have been encouraged by the recent step-up in labor\nproductivity growth. Last year’s increase of almost 2 percent marked the strongest\ngrowth since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis and was well above the\n1 percent pace that prevailed in the preceding five years. I think there are many reasons\nto believe that this faster productivity growth could be persistent. My expectation for\nfurther increases in capital spending is one. For another, it could be that tight labor\nmarkets have played a role in boosting labor productivity growth as employers work to\nincrease efficiency as new workers become harder to find.\nTurning to inflation, given the volatility and idiosyncrasies of the data, I view the\ncurrent reading on core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation, at\n1.8 percent, as being roughly consistent with our 2 percent objective. Overall, inflation\npressures are muted. But I do not believe that the seeming unresponsiveness of inflation\nto the apparent tightness of the labor market and other aspects of the economy tells the\nwhole story in evaluating slack versus constraint in the economy. Of the many\nexplanations for this phenomenon that have been offered, one possibility that we have to\nkeep in mind is that inflation has remained stable precisely because of the public’s\nconfidence that the Fed will maintain a framework that keeps the economy from\noverheating and inflation from rising significantly above the 2 percent benchmark.\nInflation could then for some time remain quite stable in the face of an economy running\nhot. But if public confidence began to erode because of Fed inaction, a possible\nconsequence could be the de-anchoring of inflation expectations, rather than a gradual\n\n- 4 -\nand controlled move to an inflation rate sustainably around our 2 percent goal. Of\ncourse, there are a variety of alternative explanations for the current surprising\nrelationship between inflation and unemployment, and perhaps all of them are part of a\nfull account. We should also be wary of a material and durable downward drift in\ninflation expectations below our objective, were we to see that develop, perhaps due to\nsecular changes in the formation of prices or perceived constraints on the ability of\nmonetary policy to react to future downturns. Either way, as a matter of prudent risk\nmanagement, we must conduct policy in a manner consistent with keeping inflation near\ntarget, validating the public’s trust in our commitment to our inflation objective and\nkeeping inflation expectations anchored.\nIn regard to policy, I am very comfortable remaining patient at this point and\nmonitoring the incoming data. That said, my sense is that further increases in the policy\nrate may be necessary at some point, a stance I believe is consistent with my optimistic\nview of the economy’s growth potential and momentum. In the language of central\nbanking, my estimate of the neutral policy rate remains somewhat north of where we are\nnow.\nCommunicating a data-dependent policy framework can be challenging,\nespecially if we do not want to appear to be overly discretionary. It would probably be\nclearest if we defined what data we are dependent on and how we depended on those\ndata--that is to say, if we adopted a monetary policy rule. Strict rules, however--to\nachieve their valuable heuristic benefit--are as much about ignoring some data as they are\nabout paying attention to other specific data. Indeed, while rules provide useful and\nimportant benchmarks, the complexity and evolving nature of the economy at the current\n\n- 5 -\njuncture argue for the consideration of a wide range of indicators in assessing the state of\nthat economy. This, in turn, can complicate the communication of data dependence:\nHow can we adopt and convey a clear strategic stance on policy while maintaining our\ncredibility if evolution of the data requires an evolution of that strategy?\nI prefer a framework where we make it clear that we are focused on broad trends--\nelsewhere I have used the aviation analogy that we should not “chase the needles” on the\ninstrument panel. We should be clear that, while we will respond to clear and durable\nevolution in these broad trends, we are not reacting to every piece of volatile data.4\nThe Countercyclical Capital Buffer and Financial Stability\nLet me now shift gears and return to the CCyB, beginning with how it fits within\nour broad set of efforts to promote financial stability. The core of that approach has been\nto establish a set of structural, through-the-cycle regulatory and supervisory standards to\nensure resilience against a broad range of shocks. In contrast to the pre-crisis framework,\nbanks, especially the largest and most systemic banks, are now required to maintain\nsubstantially higher and higher-quality loss-absorbing capital and other cushions; stress\ntesting examines the resilience of large banks to severely adverse economic conditions;\nliquidity requirements and regulatory incentives to limit reliance on short-term wholesale\nfunding have reduced funding risk among large banks and their affiliated broker-dealers;\nand resolution planning requirements reduce the risks that the failure of a large firm\nwould spill into the broader economy. Outside of the banking system, money market\nmutual fund reform has reduced this sector’s susceptibility to destabilizing runs by\n4 See Randal K. Quarles (2018), “Don’t Chase the Needles: An Optimistic Assessment of the Economic\nOutlook and Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Economic Club of New York Luncheon, New\nYork, October 18, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20181018a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\ninvestors, and requirements that many derivatives be centrally cleared have decreased the\nopacity and interconnectedness that contributed to the chaos of 2008.\nIn addition to these through-the-cycle measures, the Federal Reserve actively\nmonitors for the buildup of financial stability vulnerabilities and can require large banks\nto increase their loss-absorbing capacity through increases in the CCyB when systemic\nvulnerabilities are sufficiently large. While such countercyclical tools are new, their goal\nis to mitigate the buildup of vulnerabilities during buoyant periods, since experience has\nproven time and again that vulnerabilities can build during good times as risk appetite\ngrows and memories of earlier instability fade.\nEffectively mitigating the buildup of risk through the CCyB requires a systematic\nframework for analyzing vulnerabilities and a mapping of such changes in financial-\nsector risks into the appropriate level for the CCyB. The Board developed its framework\noutlining the objectives of the tool and the factors that would influence the determination\nof its appropriate level through a process of public consultation.5\nUnder our policy, the primary objective for activating the CCyB is to build\nfinancial-sector resilience during periods when the risks to financial stability have risen to\nmeaningfully above normal levels and there is an elevated possibility of potential losses\nwithin the banking sector that could place strains on the supply of credit or otherwise\nsubstantially impede economic and financial activity. A secondary objective for using\n5 In December 2015, the Board invited public comment on a proposed policy statement describing the\nframework that the Board would use to set the amount of the U.S. CCyB. See Regulation Q--Capital\nAdequacy of Bank Holding Companies, Savings and Loan Holding Companies, and State Member Banks,\n12 C.F.R. pt. 217, app. A (2018). See also Federal Reserve System (2016), “Regulatory Capital Rules:\nThe Federal Reserve Board’s Framework for Implementing the U.S. Basel III Countercyclical Capital\nBuffer,” proposed policy statement with request for public comment (Docket No. R-1529), Federal\nRegister, vol. 81 (February 3), pp. 5661-66.See 12 CFR part 217, Appendix A. See also 81 FR 5661\n(February 3, 2016).\n\n- 7 -\nthe CCyB is its potential to limit the buildup of financial vulnerabilities by slowing the\nrate of credit expansion--that is, the possibility that the CCyB may “lean against the\nwind” of credit fluctuations. This secondary objective, both in the original Basel\ndiscussions and in the Federal Reserve’s framework, is less central.\nA notable feature of the Board’s current framework is the decision to maintain a 0\npercent CCyB when vulnerabilities are within their normal range. Because we set high,\nthrough-the-cycle capital requirements in the United States that provide substantial\nresilience to normal fluctuations in economic and financial conditions, it is appropriate to\nset the CCyB at zero in a normal risk environment. Thus, our presumption has been that\nthe CCyB would be zero most of the time.\nCurrent Assessment of Financial Vulnerabilities\nWhen, then, would it be appropriate--given this framework--to activate the\nCCyB? That is, how do we know when financial vulnerabilities are elevated? The\nFederal Reserve continuously monitors vulnerabilities, as highlighted in our recent\nFinancial Stability Report.6 Our approach is organized around tracking four broad\nvulnerabilities that academic research and practical experience have shown can amplify\nnegative shocks and result in outsized losses in the real economy. These are asset\nvaluation pressures, household and business debt, funding risk, and financial-sector\nleverage. As part of this process, the Board considers a number of quantitative\nindicators--one of which is the credit-to-GDP (gross domestic product) gap proposed in\nthe Basel Committee guidance--that are indicative of potential vulnerabilities.\n6 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018), Financial Stability Report (Washington:\nBoard of Governors, November), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-\nreport-201811.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\nNonetheless, judgment must play an important role in this process, especially in assessing\nhow interactions between vulnerabilities may serve to mute or amplify the transmission\nof different kinds of shocks. The framework requires further judgment as to whether the\nCCyB is the most appropriate tool to address the particular areas of concern, which will\ndepend on, among other things, the extent to which banks subject to the CCyB are\nexposed to vulnerabilities or contributing to them.\nAssessing the current state of financial vulnerabilities is thus a critical part of the\ndecision on whether to activate the CCyB. Let me briefly give you my view of each of\nthe four categories in turn.\nAsset valuations increased to the high end of their historical ranges in many\nmarkets over 2017 and the first half of 2018, supported by the solid economic expansion\nand an apparent increase in investors’ appetite for risk. The market volatility and\nsubsequent rebound have muddied the picture somewhat; however, it does seem that\nvaluation pressures have eased to some extent in a particular locus of concern, the market\nfor leveraged loans--that is, syndicated loans to lower-rated or unrated borrowers with\nalready significant debt loads.\nNow, regarding debt outstanding, borrowing by businesses has reached a\nhistorically high level relative to the size of the economy or business assets and there are\nalso signs of deteriorating underwriting standards. Of course, this has happened at a time\nwhen corporate profits relative to the size of the economy are also quite high, mitigating\nsome of the concern this might suggest--but the riskiest forms of business debt have\nincreased the most amid such signs. These developments could potentially leave the\ncorporate sector vulnerable to a sharp slowing in economic growth, although we think the\n\n- 9 -\nbanking sector has only limited direct exposures to such borrowers and, to the extent they\ncan be measured, indirect exposures are also limited.\nThe notable levels of vulnerability in asset valuation pressures and business\nborrowing must be considered alongside modest vulnerabilities associated with\nhousehold borrowing and the historically low levels of financial-sector leverage and\nfunding risk. Household debt relative to GDP has fallen substantially from the level of a\ndecade ago, and the credit quality of household borrowing remains relatively solid,\ndespite pockets of weakness evident in some areas of auto lending. Even more important,\nbanks now have substantially higher-quality capital and more of it than in the 2000s,\nowing importantly to the structural reform of capital requirements and stress testing. In\nfact, under last year’s stress tests, capital levels at the largest U.S. banks after a\nhypothetical severe global recession would have been higher than the actual capital levels\nof large banks in the years before the crisis. Moreover, around 20 percent of the assets of\nthe most systemically important financial institutions are highly liquid assets that can be\nsold quickly in the event of stress. And, following reforms to money market mutual\nfunds and other steps, the volume of short-term uninsured funding, most prone to runs, is\nwell below pre-crisis levels.\nTaken as a whole, financial system vulnerabilities strike me as being not outside\ntheir normal range, which is consistent with a zero CCyB under the Board’s framework\nand is why I supported the Board’s decision to keep the CCyB at zero earlier this month.\nInternational Experience with the Countercyclical Capital Buffer\nWhile policymakers in the United States have maintained the CCyB at zero since\n2016, other countries have adjusted their countercyclical buffers in response to\n\n- 10 -\nvulnerabilities within their financial sectors. Currently, 13 countries have announced a\nCCyB above zero, ranging from 0.25 percent in Luxembourg to 2.5 percent in Hong\nKong, Norway, and Sweden.7 The CCyB is a novel approach to financial regulation, and\nI think it is important that we, as regulators, learn from other countries’ experiences with\nthe CCyB. I see three important explanations for differences in the CCyB across\ncountries.\nPerhaps the most important and direct reason for different CCyB levels among\ndifferent countries is that they face different vulnerabilities. According to national\nauthorities’ announcements, the decisions to activate the buffers were generally\nmotivated by credit growth, household debt, and housing prices; in this regard, it is\nnotable that mortgage credit or house prices have expanded rapidly in several countries\ndeploying the CCyB, including Hong Kong and the Nordic countries that have set their\nCCyB at 2.5 percent. For example, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s decision to\nincrease the CCyB level to 2.5 percent in January 2018 was importantly linked to housing\ndevelopments.\nAnother explanation for the differences in observed CCyB levels across countries\nis the range of available macroprudential tools to stem the buildup in financial\nvulnerabilities in different countries and the degree to which such tools have been the\npreferred means for addressing identified vulnerabilities.8 For example, housing market\n7 This figure includes countries that have announced a positive CCyB that will become effective at some\npoint within the next year.\n8 See International Monetary Fund, Financial Stability Board, and Bank for International Settlements\n(2016), IMF-FSB-BIS, Elements of Effective Macroprudential Policies: , Lessons from International\nExperience (Basel, Switzerland: IMF, FSB, and BIS, , (August 2016), http://www.fsb.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/Elements-of-Effective-Macroprudential-Policies1.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nbooms, as noted above for Hong Kong, have been a concern in several countries in recent\nyears.9 Accordingly, some national authorities have used macroprudential tools focused\non housing, such as caps on loan-to-value ratios, to try to increase the resilience of\nborrowers and to indirectly strengthen the resilience of the banks and the financial system\nshould their housing booms turn to busts. For example, policymakers in Canada have not\nactivated the CCyB in response to concerns about housing market risks, but they have\nlowered the maximum loan-to-value ratio for various mortgage products and capped\ndebt-service-to-income ratios.10 The availability of such alternative tools for limiting\nsystemic risk may be among the factors influencing the decision to adjust, or not adjust,\nthe CCyB in a number of countries. In this regard, it is notable that the set of\nmacroprudential tools in the United States is limited relative to that in many other\ncountries.11\nFinally, another difference, one that is particular to the United Kingdom, is the\nframework adopted by the U.K. Financial Policy Committee (FPC) to integrate the CCyB\nwith its structural capital requirements. Specifically, under the FPC’s framework, the\nCCyB would equal 1 percent in standard risk conditions--but to avoid having this be a\n9 Such booms have raised concern in Australia, Canada, and the Nordic countries. See International\nMonetary Fund (2018), Source: IMF, Global Financial Stability Report, (Washington: IMF, October\n2018), https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2018/09/25/Global-Financial-Stability-Report-\nOctober-2018.\n10 See Bank of Canada (2017),, Financial System Review, (Ottawa: BOCBank of Canada, November\n2017), https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/fsr-november2017.pdf.\nAnother example of a macroprudential tool used in some countries is a sector-specific version of the\nCCyB. Switzerland, for example, has activated a housing-sector CCyB to address imbalances related to\nresidential mortgage and real estate markets. See Swiss National Bank (2013), “Countercyclical Capital\nBuffer: Proposal of the Swiss National Bank and Decision of the Federal Council,” press release,\nFebruary 13, https://www.snb.ch/en/mmr/reference/pre_20130213/source/pre_20130213.en.pdf.\n11 See Douglas J. Elliott, Greg Feldberg, and Andreas Lehnert (2013),, “The History of Cyclical\nMacroprudential Policy in the United States,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2013-29\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 2013),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201329/201329pap.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\nsignificant increase to already very high levels of capital, the FPC undertook a one-time\nadjustment to its other capital buffers in order to offset part of this increase. The effect of\nthe policy is that the buffer can be varied--both up and down--in line with the changing\nrisks that the banking system faces over time. This approach is an interesting deviation\nfrom the idea in the original Basel discussions and the framework adopted in many other\njurisdictions, in which structural capital requirements are set at levels aimed to deliver the\ndesired level of resilience, with the CCyB raised to positive values only at times when\nvulnerabilities are above normal.\nIn practice, the U.K. framework appears to have provided the FPC with additional\nflexibility, as it has adjusted the CCyB with evolving financial risks associated with, for\nexample, Brexit. As I examine this experience, systems similar to the United Kingdom’s,\nwhere the CCyB is positive during normal times, may allow policymakers to react more\nquickly to economic, financial, or even geopolitical shocks that occur amid otherwise\nnormal conditions, without relying on the slow-moving credit aggregates contemplated in\nthe original Basel proposal. Moreover, this setting of the CCyB permits more gradual\nadjustments in the CCyB, especially in periods with a high degree of uncertainty about\nthe level of financial vulnerabilities. Another possible benefit of a system that has\nadditional flexibility is the ability to coordinate the setting of the CCyB with the setting\nof monetary policy in situations where such coordination is valuable. At the same time, I\nwould not expect such situations to be the norm, as the objectives and governance of\nmonetary policy and macroprudential policies are separate for good reasons.\n\n- 13 -\nConclusion\nIn the United States, we have built a substantially safer financial system by\nfocusing on using structural tools that confer through-the-cycle resilience. With that\nconstruction work largely behind us, attention naturally turns to the set of time-varying\nfinancial regulations--particularly the CCyB.\nThe overall capital framework in the United States has been designed to ensure\nhigh capital levels without having to activate the CCyB, with the implication being that\nthe bar for activation would be a high one; but, as a result, much of the time there would\nnot be any buffer to reduce if conditions were to precipitously deteriorate. The United\nKingdom’s approach to setting the CCyB also relies on having a high overall level of\ncapital during normal times, but, by “swapping” some portion of static capital for CCyB\nin reaching that high capital level during normal times, and thus making some of that\ncapital part of a releasable buffer, U.K. policymakers have built in more flexibility to\nmove buffers down in times of stress. Other countries provide additional “data points” in\nterms of possible ways of approaching the CCyB.\nWith the CCyB in active use around the world, I am confident that the academic\nand policy communities will learn a great deal about how best to use this new tool to\nbuild a more resilient financial system.",

How High is Too High?:\nManaging Recent Inflation Developments\nwithin the FOMC’s Monetary Policy Framework\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Charting a New Course”\n2021 Milken Institute Global Conference\nBeverly Hills, California\nOctober 20, 2021\n\nThank you to the Milken Institute for the opportunity to join you today. This\nmorning I’d like to outline my view of current economic conditions and the economic\noutlook and then turn to the implications for monetary policy. In particular, with\nemployment still well below its February 2020 peak, I will focus on how the escalation in\ninflation this year is testing the monetary policy framework adopted by the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC) in August 2020.1\nOutlook for Economic Growth\nRecent data suggest that growth in the third quarter is likely to be lower than we\nhad expected, but the foundations remain in place for strong economic growth over the\nremainder of this year and next. Employment is growing, financial conditions are\naccommodative, businesses are investing, and households, in the aggregate, have a large\nstock of savings to draw on for future spending. Weaker growth in payrolls in August\nand September, along with uneven consumer spending in July and August, appear to\nreflect ongoing concerns in some parts of the country about the spread of COVID-19,\nespecially in high-contact service industries. Supply bottlenecks and labor shortages that\nhave been more widespread and persistent than many expected are camouflaging\ncontinued strong underlying demand for goods, services, and workers. Supply\nconstraints are particularly evident in interest-sensitive parts of the economy, such as\nresidential investment and vehicle sales, limiting the scope for additional monetary\naccommodation to stimulate activity in those sectors.\nI expect that these developments, however, have for the most part simply\npostponed activity temporarily and that robust growth will return in the coming months.\n1 All of my remarks today represent my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nThere is evidence in recent weeks that we seem to be moving into a new phase of the\neconomy. Nominal retail sales rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in September on the heels\nof a nine-tenths increase in August, an indication that consumers kept up their pace of\nspending. Robust business investment in equipment and intangibles continued in the\nsecond quarter, and indicators suggest another gain in the third quarter. Forward\nindicators of business spending and the need for firms to replenish depleted inventories\npoint to strong investment into next year.\nThe Labor Market Continues to Strengthen\nWithout a doubt, the headline job gains in August and September were lower than\nexpected, but, as I will show, based on almost every other major labor market indicator,\nthere is ample evidence that the demand for labor is strong. At last measure, the Labor\nDepartment reported that job openings remained near a record high in August, and a\nrecord number of workers were voluntarily quitting their jobs, an indicator of their\nconfidence in finding a better one. Other measures of job openings by education level\nindicate that jobs are plentiful even for less-skilled workers who have been affected the\nmost by the COVID event. Another indicator I’ve been watching closely is the so-called\nU-6 unemployment rate, which consists of people who are working part time but prefer\nfull-time work and discouraged workers who want a job but have given up looking. U-6\nunemployment declined significantly over the past two months to 8.5 percent in\nSeptember, roughly the same level as in the middle of 2017, when most everyone\nconsidered the job market to be quite healthy. In fact—and this will not be news to most\nof you—shortages of skilled workers in many occupations predated the COVID event\nand are likely to persist after its effects have faded. Some of this shortage reflects the\n\n- 3 -\naging of the workforce, changes in the types of jobs people want to do, and the time it\ntakes to train workers.\nStrong demand for labor is outpacing supply, and, naturally, that development is\nputting upward pressure on wages. Through September, average hourly wages are up 4.6\npercent over the past 12 months, the largest and most sustained increase in wages for\nworkers since the 1990s.\nI noted the imbalance between the demand and supply for labor, and some of the\nlabor market indicators that are still well short of pre-COVID levels are those related to\nlabor force participation, which has been about unchanged this year on balance. I expect\nthat as conditions normalize, this measure will pick up, but it is unlikely to return to its\nFebruary 2020 level. One reason is that a disproportionate number of older workers\nresponded to the initial shock of the COVID event by retiring, which may be an area\nwhere participation and employment struggle to retrace lost ground. Longer-lasting\nchanges in labor force participation could make wage pressures more persistent and have\nimplications for the assessment of maximum employment.\nTapering Asset Purchases\nSince the middle of last year, the Fed has been increasing its holdings of Treasury\nsecurities and agency mortgage-backed securities by $120 billion a month to foster\nsmooth market functioning and to support the economy by putting downward pressure on\ninterest rates. Conditions had improved considerably by the time we announced our\nforward guidance for asset purchases in December, but the unemployment rate remained\nat 6.7 percent, near-term growth was being constrained by heightened social-distancing\nrestrictions amid surging hospitalizations from COVID-19, and inflation was running\n\n- 4 -\nsignificantly below 2 percent. As we sit here today, demand for labor is strong, and\nunemployment has declined to 4.8 percent. We have exceeded the previous high for real\ngross domestic product and are close to reaching the pre-COVID trend. Inflation, about\nwhich I will say more shortly, is running at more than twice the FOMC’s longer-run goal.\nTaking all of the evidence into account, I think it is clear that we have met the test\nof substantial further progress toward both our employment and our inflation mandates,\nand I would support a decision at our November meeting to start reducing these\npurchases and complete that process by the middle of next year. Bear in mind that asset\npurchases are pressing down on the accelerator, adding each month to the amount of\naccommodation the Fed is providing to the economy through downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates. Reducing purchases and ending them on this schedule is not\nmonetary tightening, but a gradual reduction in the pace at which we are adding\naccommodation.\nMonetary Policy When the Goals Are Not Complementary\nA move to reduce the pace of asset purchases soon also is entirely consistent with\nthe FOMC’s plan to pursue our longer-run maximum-employment and price-stability\ngoals, and our new monetary policy strategy, which we refer to as our framework. The\nforward guidance that we put in place for asset purchases was an operationalization of the\nnew framework. Last December, with inflation running well below 2 percent and\nunemployment still elevated, we committed to continue purchasing assets at least at the\ncurrent pace until we had made substantial further progress toward our goals. In most\nsituations, those goals are complementary. That is, high unemployment usually coincides\n\n- 5 -\nwith subdued inflationary pressures. Therefore, at the time, we did not foresee those\ngoals coming into conflict.\nBut we are facing a situation now where inflation is high even though\nemployment has yet to fully recover from the COVID event. In that case, according to\nthe FOMC’s monetary policy framework, when objectives are not complementary, the\nCommittee “takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the\npotentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to\nreturn to levels judged consistent with its mandate.”2\nApplying those principles throughout 2021, we have been very patient and\nfocused on the need for the labor market to recover as quickly as practicable from the\nsevere damage experienced during the darkest days of the COVID event. We are\nremaining patient because, despite some periods of rapid progress, the recovery in jobs\nhas been uneven and is still incomplete.\nEarly on, patience was easy: In December of last year, my FOMC colleagues and\nI were expecting much lower inflation—the median projection for 2021 by FOMC\nparticipants was 1.8 percent. The FOMC’s preferred inflation gauge did not crack 2\npercent until March 2021. But, by June, prices had risen 4 percent over the previous 12\nmonths, ticked up to 4.2 percent in July, and increased further to 4.3 percent in August.\nThe median of the most recent projections by FOMC participants traces a path in which\ninflation ends the year just a touch lower than the current level. Nonetheless, I do not see\nthe FOMC as behind the curve, for three reasons: Most of the biggest drivers of the very\n2 See the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, paragraph 6, available on the\nBoard’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-\ntools-and-communications-statement-on-longer-run-goals-monetary-policy-strategy.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nhigh current inflation rates will ease in coming quarters, some measures of underlying\ninflation pressures are less worrisome, and longer-term inflation expectations are\nanchored, at least for now.\nFirst, let me address the big drivers of this year’s price increases. The inflation\nwe have experienced so far has been very unusual and largely related to supply\nconstraints associated both with production and distribution problems related to COVID\nand with a demand shock arising from the unprecedented and rapid reopening of the\neconomy. We all saw the remarkable price increases and shortages in the used car\nmarket. There have been a few other very specific and identifiable supply problems that\nhave driven some other prices to very high levels—the semiconductor shortages that led\nto auto production slowdowns, for example, and, in some cases, labor shortages or\nrestrictions related to the COVID event were associated with trade disruptions.\nSecond, if we recognize that much of the excessive inflation we are seeing this\nyear is directly attributable to disruptions that, like the COVID event, will end, then\nmonetary policy often can look through those types of disruptions to consider what\ninflation will be in the future when this episode passes. To get a fix on where inflation is\nheaded, it is helpful to consider measures of inflation that try to filter out the most\nunusual and presumably transitory price increases that may be driving headline inflation.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s trimmed mean measure of inflation systematically\nremoves prices that are increasing or decreasing at abnormally large rates, in order to get\nsome perspective on underlying inflation pressures. For the 12 months through August,\nthe Dallas trimmed mean inflation was an even 2 percent. Of course, while this metric\nmay provide a better indicator of future PCE (personal consumption expenditures)\n\n- 7 -\ninflation, I do not mean to suggest that this is necessarily a better reading on current\ninflation—consumers and businesses have to pay for the goods whose prices have risen\nsharply, and those increases are being felt.\nThat brings us to the third reason that I do not think the FOMC is behind the\ncurve: anchored inflation expectations. We monitor longer-term expectations of future\ninflation because we believe they influence changes in actual inflation over the medium\nterm. In fact, our new framework recognizes that stable, well-anchored inflation\nexpectations help return inflation to 2 percent when it is running high, as it is now, as\nwell as when it has fallen somewhat below that goal, as it often does during a recession.\nSo far, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, as well as\nsurveys of professional forecasters, have increased only moderately this year, moves that\nmore or less reversed declines in those expectations over the previous half-dozen years.\nMeasuring expectations is an inexact science, but smoothing through the ups and downs\nin expectations in recent years leaves these indicators within a range that has been\nconsistent with inflation near our 2 percent goal.\nHow Long is Too Long?\nGoing forward, the question is not only whether inflation will fall in the coming\nmonths, but also how far it will fall and if it will fall soon enough to avoid spurring a\nconcerning rise in longer-term inflation expectations. I agree with my FOMC colleagues\nand most private forecasters that inflation likely will decline considerably next year from\nits currently very elevated rate. For instance, most of the September Summary of\nEconomic Projections forecasts for PCE inflation in 2022 were between 1.9 and\n\n- 8 -\n2.3 percent, with a minimum of 1.7 percent and a maximum of 3.0 percent.3 But I see\nsignificant upside risks to my current inflation outlook. Supply constraints in production\nand distribution already have become more widespread and have lasted longer than most\nforecasters anticipated. As noted earlier, labor supply constraints are making it difficult\nfor businesses to keep up with demand. This dynamic will continue to support robust\nwage growth, putting further upward pressure on prices. Moreover, there is evidence in\nthe past couple of months that a broader range of prices are beginning to increase at\nmoderate rates, and I am closely watching those developments.\nThe fundamental dilemma that we face at the Fed right now is this: Demand,\naugmented by unprecedented fiscal stimulus, has been outstripping a temporarily\ndisrupted supply, leading to high inflation. But the fundamental productive capacity of\nour economy as it existed just before COVID—and, thus, the ability to satisfy that\ndemand without inflation—remains largely as it was, and the factors that are disrupting it\nappear to be transitory. Looked at purely in that light, constraining demand now, to bring\nit into line with a transiently interrupted supply, would be premature. Given the lags with\nwhich monetary policy acts, we could easily find that demand is damping just as supply\nis increasing, leading us to undershoot our inflation target—and, in the worst case, we\ncould depress the incentives for supply to return, leading to an extended period of\nsluggish activity and unnecessarily low employment.\nBut “transitory” does not necessarily mean “short lived.” Indeed, we are\ndiscovering that it’s going to take more time than we had thought for supply to return to\nnormal, and with demand already high during that time, I am monitoring the extent to\n3 The September 2021 Summary of Economic Projections is available on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nwhich it could be further boosted by the additional fiscal programs currently under\ndiscussion. If those dynamics should lead this “transitory” inflation to continue too long,\nit could affect the planning of households and businesses and unanchor their inflation\nexpectations. This could spark a wage-price spiral that would not settle down even when\nthe logistical bottlenecks and supply chain kinks have eased. So the central question we\nhave to answer is “How long is too long?”\nI am among those who see a good chance that inflation will remain above\n2 percent next year, but I am not quite ready to conclude that this “transitory” period is\nalready “too long.” We haven’t yet met the more stringent tests for liftoff that we have\nlaid out in forward guidance about the federal funds rate. Let me quote from the latest\nFOMC statement: Raising rates will not be appropriate “until labor market conditions\nhave reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum\nemployment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed\n2 percent for some time.”4 Importantly, the level of uncertainty around the paths for\ninflation and employment are higher than normal as we navigate the unprecedented\nreopening of the world economy. Therefore, we will remain outcome based, waiting to\nsee further improvements in employment and the evolution of inflation pressures in\ncoming months. And, if the broadly held expectation that inflation will recede next year\nturns out to be wrong or if inflation expectations show signs of becoming unanchored to\nthe upside, I am confident that the monetary policy tools at our disposal can bring\ninflation down toward our 2 percent goal.\n4 See the September 2021 FOMC statement, paragraph 4, which can be found on the Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm\n\n- 10 -\nHow High Is Too High?\nI said just now that the central question is “How long is too long?” I am also\nkeenly aware, however, that inflation of 4 percent or more certainly cannot be\ncharacterized as only “moderately” above 2 percent, and thus we also have to deal with\nthe question of “How high is too high?” Moreover, the two questions are obviously\nrelated: we can tolerate inflation of 2.5 percent as supply returns to normal without\ndramatically affecting inflation expectations, for a much longer period than we can\ntolerate inflation of 4.5 percent. So, how high is too high? I cannot speak for my FOMC\ncolleagues on this issue, but I will conclude with some thoughts of my own.\nIn 2012, the FOMC formally adopted a longer-run inflation target of 2 percent,\nand since then, that target has been reaffirmed annually by the Committee including in\nour new framework adopted in August 2020.5 The key innovations in the new\nframework relative to the previous incarnation are designed primarily to address the risk\nthat inflation and inflation expectations could settle below our 2 percent target. That risk\nemanates from the understanding that several longer-run changes in the U.S. economy\nmay have conspired to reduce the level of the equilibrium federal funds rate—the level at\nwhich it is neither slowing nor speeding up economic activity. In turn, a lower average\nlevel of interest rates would make it more difficult, on balance, for the Federal Reserve to\nrespond to negative shocks to the economy with sizable cuts to interest rates. The\ninability to cut interest rates sufficiently can then reinforce downward pressures on\n5 See the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” in note 2.\n\n- 11 -\ninflation such that it begins to run persistently below the FOMC’s 2 percent goal and\ncauses inflation expectations to fall with it.\nAs is well known by now, those revisions to the Fed’s monetary policy\nframework put new emphasis on reaching maximum employment and introduced new\nflexibility in how to account for progress toward our price-stability goal by seeking\ninflation that averages 2 percent over time to ensure longer-term inflation expectations\nremain anchored at this level. This revision implies that monetary policy will provide\nmore support for economic activity over a typical business cycle than had been the case,\nin order to prevent longer-term inflation expectations—and, ultimately, inflation itself—\nfrom settling below 2 percent.\nIn this low interest rate environment, some researchers have suggested going\nfurther than our current framework does in allowing inflation to run moderately above 2\npercent for some time following periods where it has run persistently lower than 2\npercent, and actually raising the inflation target to 2.5 percent or 3 percent or even 4\npercent.6 At the outset of our recently completed review, we reaffirmed that inflation at a\nrate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with our congressional mandate\nfor price stability.7 I believe that any future discussion of a higher target would need to\naddress whether it remained consistent with that congressional mandate. I would also\nemphasize that at this point, the public is very accustomed to a world of inflation near 2\n6 See Lawrence M. Ball (2013), “The Case for Four Percent Inflation,” Central Bank Review, vol. 13\n(May), pp. 17–31; and Philippe Andrade, Jordi Galí, Hervé Le Bihan, and Julien Matheron (2019), “The\nOptimal Inflation Target and the Natural Rate of Interest,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall,\npp. 173–255.\n7 See Richard H. Clarida (2019), “The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools,\nand Communication Practices.” speech delivered at the 2019 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by\nthe Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, New York,\nFebruary 22, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20190222a.htm.\n\n- 12 -\npercent, which has allowed households and businesses to operate with considerable\ncertainty. Research shows that such certainty is valuable for households and businesses\nto make sound financial decisions and to avoid economic distortions that could hinder\neconomic growth.8\nMy strong support for our consensus framework is predicated not only upon its\nnew features designed to address inflation that falls too low, but also its commitment to\nprevent longer-term inflation expectations from rising materially above a level consistent\nwith our 2 percent goal. In this sense, the current elevated rates of inflation are not\nchallenging our new framework any more than they would have challenged our previous\nframework or, for that matter, most reasonable frameworks for conducting monetary\npolicy. As I said earlier, when our price-stability and employment goals are not\ncomplementary, the framework calls for policy to depend on the remaining shortfall from\nour maximum-employment goal, on the extent to which inflation continues to exceed 2\npercent, and on the amount of time we expect it will take for employment and inflation to\nmeet our goals.\nI remain quite optimistic about the capacity and willingness of consumers and\nbusinesses to power a robust expansion as we put the COVID event behind us, even with\nthe headwinds coming from the supply side. But that forecast for growth and uncertainty\nabout the resolution of supply constraints mean that there are upside risks to inflation\nnext year. So my focus is beginning to turn more fully from the rapidly improving labor\nmarket to whether inflation begins its descent toward levels that are more consistent with\nour price-stability mandate, as most forecasters and most of my colleagues on the FOMC\n8 See Engin Kara and Tony Yates (2021), “A Case against a 4% Inflation Target,” Journal of Money,\nCredit and Banking, vol. 53 (August), pp. 1097–1119.\n\n- 13 -\nexpect over the next year. I would also be quite wary of further increases in inflation\nexpectations in this environment. If inflation does remain more than moderately above 2\npercent, be assured that the FOMC has the framework and the tools to address it.",

Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nAmerican Bar Association\nBanking Law Committee Meeting 2020\nWashington, D.C.\nJanuary 17, 2020\n\nIt’s a great pleasure to be with you today at the ABA Banking Law Committee’s\nannual meeting. I left the practice of law—and immersion in the company of lawyers—\nclosing in on 20 years ago now, but there have been many times during my long sojourn\namong businessmen and economists that I have reflected with fondness and some\nnostalgia on the famous adage of Harrison Tweed (the “Tweed” of Milbank, Tweed, a\nreformer of the bar, the “most democratic of aristocrats,” and the last man to unironically\nwear a cape in the lobby of the Chase Manhattan Plaza) which most of you can no doubt\nrecite by heart: “I have a high opinion of lawyers. With all their faults, they stack up\nwell against those in every other occupation or profession. They are better to work with\nor play with or fight with or drink with than most other varieties of mankind.” Speaking\nhere feels a lot like coming home.\nThis afternoon, I would like to talk with you about the outwardly mundane but\nincreasingly consequential topic of bank supervision. Twenty years ago, when I would\nhave been among your number at this meeting, this would have been my cue to pull out\nmy Blackberry and start checking my emails. The structure and content of regulation\nwas both intellectually interesting and professionally meaningful; I considered bank\nsupervision, by contrast, as both too workaday and too straightforward to merit the\ncommitment of much legal horsepower or personal attention. I could perhaps have been\nexcused by the callowness of youth, yet it was a common view at the time. Having now\nbeen immersed for the last two years both in the practice of supervision and in the\ncomplementary relationship between the regulatory and supervisory processes, I realize\nthat this wasn’t true then, and is certainly not true now. It is not a drafting accident that\nthe Dodd-Frank Act gave my position at the Federal Reserve the title of Vice Chairman\n\n- 2 -\nfor Supervision. Notwithstanding the extensive reform of bank regulation after the crisis,\nwhich has had much consequence for the industry (most of it salutary) it is the process of\nexamination and supervision that constitutes the bulk of our ongoing engagement with\nthe industry and through which our policy objectives are given effect.\nThis division of labor is important for lawyers and policymakers to think about\ndeeply because the processes of regulation and supervision are necessarily different in\ncrucial respects. Regulation establishes a binding public framework implementing\nrelevant statutory imperatives. Because a rule is designed to apply generally, rules must\nbe based on general principles intended to achieve general aims, rather than reverse-\nengineered to generate specific effects for specific institutions. Given their general\napplicability, there must be a general process for all those with an interest—industry,\nacademics, citizens, Congress—to have notice of, and opportunity to comment on all\nrules, ensuring that all potential effects and points of view are taken into account in the\nrule’s crafting. And given their general function, rules must be clear and public: Those\naffected must know what to expect and what is expected.\nSupervision, by contrast, implements the regulatory framework through close\nengagement with the particular facts about particular firms: their individual capital and\nliquidity positions, the diverse composition of their distinct portfolios of assets, their\nbusiness strategies, the nature of their operations, the strengths and weaknesses of their\nmanagement. Much of the granular information used by supervisors is, accordingly,\nproprietary and confidential, and many of their judgments and decisions are closely\ntailored to specific circumstances.\n\n- 3 -\nGiven the strong public interest in the safe, sound, and efficient operation of the\nfinancial industry and the potential for hair-raising and widespread adverse social\nconsequences of private misjudgment or misconduct in that industry, close and regular\nsupervision of this sort can help us all sleep restfully. Yet, the confidential and tailored\nnature of supervision sits uncomfortably with the responsibilities of government in a\ndemocracy. In the United States, we have a long-standing, well-articulated framework\nfor ensuring that regulations conform with the principles of generality, predictability,\npublicity, and consultation described above. Supervision—for good reason, in my\nview—is not subject to this formal framework. But it is currently not subject to any\nspecific process constraint promoting publicity or universality. This leaves it open to the\ncharge, and sometimes to the fact, of capriciousness, unaccountability, unequal\napplication, and excessive burden.\nHere, then, is a conundrum. We have a public interest in a confidential, tailored,\nrapid-acting and closely informed system of bank supervision. And we have a public\ninterest in all governmental processes being fair, predictable, efficient, and accountable.\nHow do we square this circle? In my time with you today, we will not do more than\nscratch the surface of this question. It is a complex and consequential issue that, for\ndecades now, has received far too little attention from practitioners, academics,\npolicymakers and the public. Evaluating this question will be a significant focus of mine\ngoing forward, and I hope that there will be much discussion in many fora from which we\nat the Fed, and at other regulators, can learn. So today, I simply want to open the\nexploration of some these conceptual issues, and then offer some specific suggestions—\n\n- 4 -\nby no means comprehensive—on some obvious and immediate ways that supervision can\nbecome more transparent, efficient, and effective.\nThe Importance of Transparency\nLet me begin by delving a little more deeply into the distinction between\nregulation and supervision and the process applicable to both. In delegating to agencies\nsuch as the Fed the significant power to write regulations, Congress has codified a\nregulatory process that emphasizes transparency. This process was born in the 1930s, in\nthe tumult of government expansion that was the New Deal, when Congress began a\ndecade-long debate over how to manage the new regulatory state. The result, the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA), was, I should note, developed with the active\ninvolvement of the American Bar Association. The APA continues to serve as the basis\nfor the public disclosure and participation required for agency rule-writing and for the\njudicial review affected parties are guaranteed to challenge rules.\nThis transparency is intended to prevent arbitrary, capricious, and thus ineffective\nregulation by inviting broad public participation and mandating a deliberate public debate\nover the content of proposed rules. One obvious purpose of this transparency is to\nprovide clarity and predictability: it helps make clear how agencies are considering\nexercising their discretion. The significant process protections in laws such as the APA\nare also meant to ensure fairness. The wisdom behind this approach is that fairness both\nhelps bring forth more considered and effective regulations and builds respect for and\nadherence to the law, which is essential for enforcement. Transparency is central to our\nability to assert that our rules are fair.\n\n- 5 -\nNot everything that government does, however, can be accomplished in exactly\nthe same way that regulations are written. One of these things is bank supervision.\nBank Supervision\nBanks are subjected to supervision, in addition to regulation, as an additional form\nof government oversight because of their complexity, opacity, vulnerability to runs, and\nindispensable role in the economy, enabling payments, transmitting monetary policy, and\nproviding credit. The government provides a safety net to banks in the form of deposit\ninsurance, and in return, banks are subject to government oversight that mimics some of\nthe monitoring that the private sector would provide, absent the government safety net.\nThe bank regulatory framework sets the core architectural requirements for the banking\nsystem, but it isn’t enough to set the rules and walk away like Voltaire’s god. The\npotential consequences of disruption in the financial system are so far-reaching, and the\nerosion of market discipline resulting from the government safety net sufficiently\nmaterial, that it is neither safe nor reasonable to rely entirely on after-the-fact\nenforcement to ensure regulatory compliance. Supervisors are in a good position to\nmonitor individual firms’ idiosyncratic risks. And in addition to what they do at\nindividual banks, supervisors monitor for risk that may be building among clusters of\nbanks or across the banking system. These “horizontal” exams across multiple banks\nhelp highlight new or emerging risks and help examiners understand how banks are\nmanaging these risks.\nThrough their engagement with banks, supervisors promote good risk\nmanagement and thus help banks preemptively avert excessive risk taking that would be\ncostly and inefficient to correct after the fact. Where banks fall materially out of\n\n- 6 -\ncompliance with a regulatory framework or act in a manner that poses a threat to their\nsafety and soundness, supervisors can act rapidly to address the failures that led to the\nlack of compliance or threat to safety and soundness.\nThis is a crucial point: Supervision is most effective when expectations are clear\nand supervision promotes an approach to risk management that deters bad behavior and\ndecisions by banks. Clearly communicating those expectations is essential to effective\nsupervision, and in a larger sense, clear two-way communication is the essence of\neffective supervision. Supervisors rely on banks to be frank and forthcoming, and\nsupervisors in turn can help secure that frankness by explaining what their expectations\nare and why their expectations are reasonable, not arbitrary or capricious. Greater\ntransparency in supervision about the content of our expectations and about how we form\nour expectations and judgments can make supervision more effective by building trust\nand respect for the fairness and rationality of supervision.\nI don’t believe the Federal Reserve has communicated as clearly as it could with\nthe banks we supervise. More transparency and more clarity about what we want to\nachieve as supervisors and how we approach our work will improve supervision, and I\nhave several specific proposals.\nBroadly speaking, these actions fall into three categories: (1) large bank\nsupervision, (2) transparency improvements, and (3) overall supervisory process\nimprovements.\nLarge Bank Supervision\nLast fall, we completed a cornerstone of the recent banking legislation to tailor\nour rules for regional banks. This was entirely consistent with a principle at the heart of\n\n- 7 -\nour existing work: Firms that pose greater risks should meet higher standards and receive\nmore scrutiny. Our previous rules relied heavily on a firm’s total assets as a proxy for\nthese risks and for the costs the financial system would incur if a firm failed. This simple\nasset proxy was clear and critical, rough and ready, but neither risk sensitive nor\ncomplete. Our new rules employ a broader set of indicators, like short-term wholesale\nfunding and off-balance-sheet exposures, to assess the need for greater supervisory\nscrutiny.\nThat said, the composition of our supervisory portfolios has not yet been aligned\nwith our recent tailoring rules. For example, the Large Institution Supervision\nCoordinating Committee (LISCC) portfolio includes all Category I firms, which have the\ngreatest risk profile, along with certain Category II and Category III firms, which are less\nsystemic. Other Category II and Category III firms, on the other hand, are supervised\nunder our large and foreign banking organizations (LFBO) portfolio.\nSince the crisis, we have been giving significant thought to the composition of our\nsupervisory portfolios, and, in particular to whether and how we should address the\nsignificant decrease in size and risk profile of the foreign firms in the LISCC portfolio\nover the past decade. Because of these changes, which I will describe in more detail\nmomentarily, I believe there is a compelling justification to make changes today to the\ncomposition of the foreign banks in the LISCC portfolio.\nSeparately and in keeping with the goal of transparency, I think it is important\nthat all the Fed’s supervisory portfolios have a clear and transparent definition. Today\nnearly all of our supervisory portfolios have such a crisp and clear formulaic definition\nspecified in the public domain, but the LISCC portfolio does not. My goal is to develop,\n\n- 8 -\nprospectively, a clear and transparent standard for identifying LISCC firms. My\npreferred approach for achieving this objective would be to align the LISCC portfolio\nwith our recent tailoring categorizations. I believe we should draw the LISCC line to\ncoincide with Category I. The justification for this line-drawing is that Category I firms\npose the most systemic risk and require the most supervisory attention. In this state of\nthe world, Category II and III firms would remain subject to heightened supervisory\nstandards that are commensurate with their risk profile.\nAllow me to draw out what this approach could mean for the foreign banks that\ncurrently are in the LISCC portfolio. Since 2010, these four banks have significantly\nshrunk their U.S. footprint, and their U.S. operations are much less risky than they used\nto be. Since 2008, the size of the LISCC FBOs’ combined U.S. assets has shrunk by\nabout 50 percent, and they have reduced the assets at their broker-dealers from a peak of\n$1.9 trillion in 2008 to $340 billion today, a reduction of over 80%. In addition, the\nestimated systemic impact of the LISCC FBOs today is much smaller than the U.S.\nGSIBs. The average method 1 GSIB score of the combined U.S. operations of the\nLISCC FBOs is less than a quarter of the average GSIB score of the six non-processing\nU.S. GSIBs.\nThus, if any foreign banks move out of the LISCC portfolio based on this de-\nrisking, they would move into the LFBO portfolio, where they would be supervised\nalongside other foreign and domestic firms with similar risk profiles. Notably, this\nchange in supervisory portfolio would have no effect on the regulatory capital or liquidity\nrequirements that currently apply to the four LISCC FBOs. Similarly, the change would\nnot result in a loss of insight into the activities of these firms.\n\n- 9 -\nIn the same spirit, I think we should consider publishing the internal procedural\nmaterials that the Fed uses to supervise the LISCC firms, sometimes referred to as the\nProgram Manual. The Manual contains a description of the main supervisory processes\nfor identifying risks and our approach for addressing them. Publishing the Manual would\nhelp the public and the banks better understand why we take the actions that we take as\nsupervisors and would demystify some of our processes. If we took these two simple\nsteps—defining LISCC firms and publishing the Program Manual that governs our\nsupervisory approach—it would go a long way in helping to make our supervisory\npractices more understandable and accessible without undermining supervisory\neffectiveness.\nLet me now turn to the ratings framework that applies to all large holding\ncompanies. A firm’s supervisory rating, which is confidential, is important because it\naffects things such as the firm’s ability to engage in mergers and acquisitions and to enter\nnew lines of business. Just over a year ago, the Board began implementing a new ratings\nframework for large holding companies called the large financial institutions (LFI)\nratings framework. The LFI ratings framework focuses on three components of a firm’s\noperations: capital, liquidity, and governance and controls. We inaugurated the LFI\nratings framework for LISCC firms in January 2019 and for other large holding\ncompanies at the beginning of this year.\nAs we gain more experience with LFI, we will be paying close attention to how\nthe new rating system is working and whether it is achieving its intended purpose. There\nare two features of the ratings system that I will be particularly interested to monitor, and\nwhich may well require adjustment. These are the embedding of qualitative “risk\n\n- 10 -\nmanagement” standards in the capital and liquidity components of the ratings (as opposed\nto standardized quantitative measures of capital and liquidity adequacy) and the ascetic\nprinciple by which a firm’s “well managed” status is determined by its lowest component\nrating, no matter how good the bank is at everything else.\nRegarding our stress tests under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(CCAR), I continue to look for ways to make the tests more transparent without making\nthem game-able and without diluting their potency as a supervisory tool. I will mention\nthree of these transparency-enhancing ideas. First, I expect that we will continue to\nprovide more transparency on the models used in CCAR. We started providing improved\ntransparency on models last year, and as I have previously said, we will remain on that\npath until we have released substantial details on all of our key models. We also continue\nto consider ways to increase the transparency around the scenarios we use in CCAR,\nincluding, for example, by modifying our scenario design policy statement to provide\ngreater transparency on the design of the global market shock component of the stress\ntests.\nSecond, I expect that as part of the stress capital buffer, we will give banks\nsignificantly more time to review their stress test results and understand their capital\nrequirements before we demand their final capital plan. Firms are currently permitted to\nrevise and resubmit their capital plans after receiving their stress test results. But it is\ndone on a short timeframe, and allowing additional time would produce better results\nwithout in any way reducing the stringency of the stress tests. Fundamentally, I think\nbanks will be better able to do intelligent capital planning if we provide them with their\n\n- 11 -\ncomplete set of regulatory capital requirements before we require submission of a capital\nplan.\nThird and finally, we continue to look for ways to reduce the volatility of stress-\ntest requirements from year to year. We are considering a number of options, such as\naveraging outcomes over multiple years or averaging the results of the current year’s\nstress test with the results of one or more previous years. Again, the goal here is not to\nmake the tests less strenuous but to give banks a greater opportunity to plan for them and\nto meet our expectations ex ante rather than through an ex post remedial process.\nTransparency Improvements\nThe next three actions I’m proposing also relate to improved transparency, and\nthey would improve our processes for supervising all banks. The first would be to create\na word-searchable database on the Board’s website with the historical interpretations by\nthe Board and its staff of all significant rules. Regulatory interpretations by Board staff\nhave grown piecemeal over the decades and haven’t consistently been treated as the\nvaluable resource they are. The Board’s website has select interpretations of many laws\nbut does not provide a comprehensive, user-friendly collection of regulatory\ninterpretations, FAQs, and commentary. This project will require some effort of course,\nas well as vigilance to keep the interpretations up to date, but I believe that the end result\nwill be well worth it.\nThe second of these transparency actions would be putting significant supervisory\nguidance out for public comment. The Board already invites comments on its\nregulations, as required under the APA, and regularly invites comment on some\nsupervisory guidance and statements of policy. This practice of seeking comment on\n\n- 12 -\nguidance leads to better, more informed supervision and better engagement by banks. I\nwould like the Board to seek comment on more supervisory guidance going forward.\nThird and finally, as another improvement related to guidance, I support\nsubmitting significant supervisory guidance to Congress for purposes of the\nCongressional Review Act. Currently, the Fed does this for rules but not guidance. I\nsupport doing so for significant guidance because significant guidance, though\nnonbinding, can still have a material impact on bank behavior. I believe this step would\nenhance the Fed’s accountability and help build support for supervisory guidance.\nOverall Supervisory Process Improvements\nThe last category of proposals includes five areas of improvement that all relate to\nwhat we call the “supervisory process”—how we go about conducting our\nresponsibilities. Like my other suggestions, these are all rooted in common sense with a\nview toward maintaining firm and fair supervision.\nThe first is to increase the ability of supervised firms to share Federal Reserve\nconfidential supervisory information (CSI) with employees, affiliates, service providers,\nand other government agencies to promote greater compliance with laws and facilitate the\nresponse to enforcement actions. We have received feedback that our rules can prevent\nbanks from sharing CSI with a wide variety of relevant parties who need to know this\ninformation in order to help the bank remediate identified supervisory issues. We issued\na proposal last year to address this shortcoming in our CSI rules, and I expect the Board\nwill be able to issue a final CSI rule later this year.\nThe second process improvement is having the Board adopt a rule on how we use\nguidance in the supervisory process. I would expect the rule to state that the Board will\n\n- 13 -\nfollow and respect the limits of administrative law in carrying out its supervisory\nresponsibilities. In particular, consistent with the September 2018 interagency statement\non guidance, we would affirm the sensible principles that guidance is not binding and\n“non-compliance” with guidance may not form the basis for an enforcement action (such\nas a cease-and-desist order) or supervisory criticism (such as a Matter Requiring\nAttention (MRA)). This rule would be binding on the Board and on all staff of the\nFederal Reserve System, including bank examiners.\nThe third and fourth process improvements relate to supervisory communication.\nThe third improvement is to restore the “supervisory observation” category for lesser\nsafety and soundness issues. This approach would provide supervisors with a tool—\nsupervisory recommendations—for continuing to raise concerns about less pressing\nsupervisory matters while focusing a bank’s attention on the most urgent matters, those\nthat would receive MRAs. We removed this category of supervisory commentary in\n2013 to better focus bank management on deficiencies found during the supervision\nprocess. (By way of comparison, both the FDIC and OCC retained this tool.) On\nreflection, I think there is value in supervisory observations. They allow an examiner to\ngive notice about a supervisory concern even if that concern has not risen to the level of\nan MRA.\nThe fourth process improvement would be limiting future MRAs to violations of\nlaw, violations of regulation, and material safety and soundness issues. MRAs are\nsupervisory communications that identify areas where banks are out of compliance with\napplicable legal standards or otherwise are engaged in practices that create substantial\nsafety and soundness risks. MRAs identify the source of the compliance failure,\n\n- 14 -\ndeficiency, or safety and soundness weakness and generally include an expected\ntimeframe for remediation. MRAs are not legally binding and are not enforcement\nactions.\nNevertheless, MRAs carry weight because they can affect a bank’s supervisory\nrating. In limiting MRAs to legal violations and significant supervisory concerns, we\nwould take care to clearly define the breadth of what constitutes a “material safety and\nsoundness issue.” This distinction is important as a matter of fairness. Banks should be\nable to understand the line between MRAs significant enough to affect the bank’s\nsupervisory rating and less significant matters that don’t affect a bank’s supervisory\nrating but raise concerns that should be considered by banks. Greater fairness contributes\nto greater supervisory effectiveness. Together, the third and fourth process\nimprovements would be calibrated to improve communications so that banks can focus\non remediating key weaknesses while maintaining awareness of emerging ones.\nUltimately, a bank that promptly corrects its material safety and soundness weaknesses\nwill be better able to serve its customers and intermediate credit through a range of\nscenarios, including under stress.\nThe final process improvement is to make routine our existing practice of having\nan independent review of important supervisory communications and guidance\ndocuments. We want to make sure that our supervisory communications, including\nMRAs, focus on violations of law and material safety and soundness issues and that these\ncommunications don’t mistakenly give the impression that supervisory guidance is\nbinding. We already closely scrutinize MRAs issued to the LISCC firms and in\nhorizontal reviews of other large domestic and foreign banks. This extra scrutiny is a\n\n- 15 -\nsensible practice that should be regularized and expanded across our supervisory\nportfolios.\nWith respect to prospectively assessing future guidance, the key goals here would\ninclude reassessing the scope of key guidance documents, removing inappropriate bright\nlines from guidance, and removing any mandatory language from guidance. I will\ndiscuss each of these goals in turn.\nAs I mentioned, the Board adopted a final tailoring rule last year that adjusted the\nregulatory standards applicable to banks, based on their risk profile. I think it would be\nuseful for us to review our guidance in light of this tailoring exercise, such as guidance\non stress testing and capital planning, and to update the scope of guidance where\nappropriate.\nRegarding bright lines, bright lines tend to carry the implication that the standard\nthey are delineating is binding. For this reason, rules often include bright lines so that it\nis clear how to stay in compliance with the rule. Putting bright lines in guidance, even\nwhen the bright line is phrased as a “should” rather than as a requirement, blurs the line\nbetween guidance and rules, and for this reason, it is a practice we should avoid.\nFor the same reason, it is inappropriate to put mandatory language in guidance.\nThis practice can create the same distortions as the use of bright lines.\nConclusion\nObviously, the incremental changes to our supervisory processes described above\ndo not completely answer the question with which I began my remarks today: How can\nwe square the public interest in agile supervision with the public interest in transparency\nand accountability? This should be an ongoing question of high priority, both at the Fed\n\n- 16 -\nand more broadly among those who care about our system of financial regulation.\nEqually obviously, however, these suggestions would strengthen our practice of\nsupervision and increase the vigor and credibility of our supervisors.\nThe changes to supervision since the crisis have made the financial system\nstronger and more resilient than it was before. The incremental changes I have outlined,\nto increase transparency, accountability, and fairness, would make supervision more\nefficient and effective, and our financial system stronger and more stable.",

Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nChair\nFinancial Stability Board\nat\n2019 European Bank Executive Committee Forum\n“The Future of Banking: The Human Factor”\nBrussels, Belgium\nApril 2, 2019\n\nThank you for the opportunity to join you. I am grateful for the chance to speak with\nsuch a diverse and distinguished group of academics, industry leaders, and colleagues in\nregulation and central banking. Conversations like these always remind me that, while we all\napproach our roles in the financial sector differently, we share a deeper commitment to a\ncommon goal: a safe, stable, and resilient financial system, capable of supporting strong and\nsustainable economic growth.\nA decade ago, that common goal became an imperative. The financial regulatory\ncommunity worked frantically to repair the vulnerabilities that the global financial crisis exposed\nand to address a set of financial risks that failed to respect national borders. The financial system\nwe have today bears the imprint of our response a decade ago. Basel III is now final.\nDerivatives markets are now safer and better regulated. Levels of capital and liquidity at the\nlargest banks are now higher, and with reforms to recovery and resolution, the risks and potential\ncosts of a catastrophic failure of a major institution are lower. These are profound\naccomplishments of international cooperation, which returned the global financial system from\nthe brink of collapse to stability and health. But health does not make cooperation or vigilance\nany less necessary. On the contrary, as the G20 leaders said in creating the Financial Stability\nBoard (FSB), “a sense of normalcy should not lead to complacency.”1\nThe FSB exists to help sustain the common efforts made in the throes of the crisis--to\nidentify and address systemic vulnerabilities, to develop stronger regulatory and supervisory\npolicies, and to create a more resilient global financial system. It is a platform, and a place for its\n24 members and 73 representatives to coordinate their work; to identify and address issues that\nspan financial products, intermediaries, and markets; and to avoid the pre-crisis regulatory\n1 Leaders’ Statement, The Pittsburgh Summit (G20), September 24–25, 2009, https://www.treasury.gov/resource-\ncenter/international/g7-g20/Documents/pittsburgh_summit_leaders_statement_250909.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nfragmentation that left financial stability risks unaddressed. The relevance of this platform, to its\nmembers and to a changing financial system, is critical to preserving our last 10 years of hard-\nearned gains.\nToday, I want to briefly outline three tenets that I believe are essential to preserving the\nrelevance and vitality of the FSB: engagement, vigilance, and analysis. These principles, which I\ndiscussed more fully in remarks last week, underlie the most successful elements of the post-\ncrisis reforms.2 They should remain the foundation of the FSB’s work, as we turn from drafting\nnew standards to implementing them and devote more time and attention to the emerging\nvulnerabilities.\nEngagement\nRegulatory cooperation has long been essential to financial stability--not only because it\nfosters consistency in global rules, but also because it fosters trust. When authorities develop\nnew policy together, when they identify common standards and implement them in their home\ncountries, and when they plan and debate the nature of emerging risks, they also develop a\ncommon understanding of each other’s work and a common approach to addressing new\nproblems.\nHowever, trust among regulators means little on its own. It must come with the trust of\nthe constituencies regulators serve, and the trust of those whom our decisions affect. The FSB is\na conduit for this trust, as it is accountable to the G20 and to the nations and people the G20\nleaders represent. We have an obligation to make the most of that conduit, by engaging in\ngenuine, substantive dialogue with a wide range of stakeholders, to a greater and more effective\n2 Randal K. Quarles, “The Financial Stability Board in 2019” (speech at the Joint Conference of the European\nCentral Bank and the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, Frankfurt, Germany, March 28, 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20190328a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\ndegree than in the past. We should invite reflection on the design and impact of our efforts,\nsolicit input on risks to financial stability, and better communicate our mission and activities to\nthe public, without the veneer of technical jargon.\nThe FSB can begin this work at home, by strengthening the role of the regional groups\nthat are already part of the organization. In 2011, the FSB established six consultative groups\nrepresenting large regions of the globe. The intent was to expand our outreach beyond the\nmembership of the G20 and to better reflect the FSB’s global mission and impact. Today, the\ngroups meet once or twice a year and help the FSB obtain broader input into its policy\ndevelopment agenda. They can, and should, have the opportunity to do more--not only to\npromote implementation of international policy initiatives but also to give a clear view of\nfinancial stability developments in their respective regions. A study of the groups’ operations is\nnow underway, which will shed light on how to upgrade their effectiveness as an outreach and\nfeedback mechanism.\nWe can also engage more effectively outside the FSB--with businesses, public\ninstitutions, market participants, and scholars--and give the public the means and the opportunity\nto provide meaningful feedback on our work. Some steps are already underway. We established\na new expectation that all FSB policy recommendations will be open for at least 60 days of\npublic comment, instead of the shorter periods used in the past. We began a recent effort around\nthe differences in regulatory environments and market conditions across jurisdictions--known as\n“market fragmentation”--by convening key stakeholders and academics for a full-day workshop,\nwhich I hope will be the rule for future projects, not the exception. Earlier this year, we released\npublicly the FSB work program for the first time.3\n3 See http://www.fsb.org/2019/02/fsb-work-programme-for-2019/.\n\n- 4 -\nThis broad engagement is essential to understanding new developments that are relevant\nto financial stability. Take, for example, the “fintech” trends I discussed in remarks last week, to\nwhich the FSB is dedicating significant attention. Claims about fintech run the gamut from the\nutopian to the apocalyptic--yet the mantle of fintech covers a wide range of new business\nmodels, products, and trends. Their contours and their impact also vary across national\nboundaries, from mobile wallets in Kenya, to online mortgages in the United States, to money\nmarket funds founded by technology companies in China. Understanding one of these new uses\nof technology is not the same as understanding all of them. Identifying the risks and\nopportunities they pose requires context, information, and insight that can only come from a\nvariety of stakeholders with experience developing, using, and monitoring them.\nI will continue to seek ways to invite and encourage engagement during my\nchairmanship, and to give the public a clearer and fuller view of FSB’s decisionmaking process.\nFew efforts are closer to the heart of our collective work or to the accountability and trust that the\nFSB helps foster.\nVigilance\nTrust and accountability are also prerequisites for the FSB to pursue its mission. The first\nprong of our mandate, now a decade old, is to “assess vulnerabilities affecting the global\nfinancial system, and identify and review . . . the regulatory, supervisory, and related actions\nneeded to address them . . . .”4 The FSB’s primary role, and its principal contribution to\ninternational financial regulation, is to look forward--to see past the issues and practices of the\nday, and identify new vulnerabilities, long before they lead to widespread economic distress.\n4 “Financial Stability Board Charter,” April 2, 2009, http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_090925d.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nThe FSB’s Standing Committee on Assessment of Vulnerabilities (under the leadership\nof FSB Vice Chair Klaas Knot of De Nederlandsche Bank, here today) is an important forum and\ncatalyst for this work. In the months ahead, the committee will develop a new framework for the\nidentification and assessment of financial vulnerabilities. Their efforts will rely on transparent\nengagement with a wide range of stakeholders--including banks and nonbank financial\ninstitutions, the academic community, financial regulators, national authorities, and standard-\nsetting bodies. This kind of broad outreach is essential. The causes of financial crises rarely\nannounce themselves ahead of time, and only a wide range of views can give us the perspective\nand understanding to address them in advance. The right model for this work is not a small team\nof detectives--it is a search party.\nThe FSB’s efforts on nonbank financial intermediation, which I discussed last week,\nreflect a similar approach. Nonbank financing has grown since the financial crisis, and it has\nbeen a source of systemic risk, often involving high leverage, maturity and liquidity mismatches,\nopaque structures, and concentrated holdings of risky assets. Nonbank financing can also lead to\nlower lending standards, bidding up the price of risky assets and sending an encouraging signal\nto credit underwriters. These channels played a role in the recent global financial crisis, and\nmore recently, new forms of interconnectedness between nonbank financial firms and the\nbanking system have emerged. In some scenarios, both domestically and internationally, such\nties could amplify risks.\nThese developments raise important issues. Is the growth of nonbank financing altering\nexisting market structures? Are there new vulnerabilities in the financial system? How will\nnonbank financing develop, and how should it do so? The FSB is taking a variety of\ncomplementary approaches to answering these questions.\n\n- 6 -\nFirst, we produce an annual report that outlines the developments in nonbank financing,\ndetailing global trends and potential risks and providing reliable information to foster public\ndiscussion. Second, the FSB develops policies to promote the resilience of these firms (without\nimpeding the growth of sustainable nonbank financing models), and we work closely with other\nmultinational organizations to monitor implementation. Finally, and going forward, we must\nbegin analyzing the effectiveness of the policies on nonbank financing that have been\nimplemented.\nAnalysis\nThe same spirit of self-reflection should guide the FSB’s efforts in other policy areas.\nStakeholders trust the FSB to undertake thoughtful, detailed work on emerging risks to financial\nstability. Yet identifying those risks before a crisis means dealing in uncertainty, and making\npolicy on evolving issues, where no one can claim complete expertise. To maintain that trust, we\nmust be willing to make improvements when the evidence justifies it--to undertake rigorous\nanalysis, before and after issuing new standards, and to follow that analysis where it leads.\nMany post-crisis policies, including those aimed at the implicit subsidy for “too-big-to-\nfail” institutions, have been in place long enough to allow for evaluation. We can now begin to\nask fundamental, critical questions: What have the effects of these reforms been, whether\nintended or unintended, salutary or adverse? Have we successfully reduced or eliminated the\nproblem? Has there been a tradeoff, in the form of new, unintended risks or costs?\nAs I have described elsewhere, the FSB is launching a global study with multinational\npolicymakers to start answering these important questions as part of its broader effort to evaluate\nthe effects of post-crisis reforms. We intend to bring analytical rigor to these questions, and we\nrecognize that the academic community has undertaken much work in this area. As a result, we\n\n- 7 -\nwill draw extensively on academic advisors during all phases of the work we are undertaking. I\nalso encourage other experts in this field to look closely to the consultative document that will be\ncoming from the study next year. We welcome the input as we undertake the study of this\nsignature issue from the crisis.\nThe task of this project, like the task of the FSB itself, is to foster insight on the road\nahead. The work of the FSB reflects the fact that, in a global financial system, we cannot see and\naddress emerging problems alone. Working as allies and colleagues, we have bound up most of\nthe wounds from the last financial crisis. To avoid reopening them--and returning to a\nfragmented international regime--we will have to recommit to collaboration, embrace insight\nwhere it emerges, and follow evidence where it leads. With broad engagement, rigorous\nvigilance, and committed analysis, the risks ahead of us can be less dangerous than the ones we\nleft behind.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n5:30 a.m. EST (2:30 p.m. local time)\nNovember 14, 2019\nBrief Remarks\nby\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nChair\nFinancial Stability Board\nvia prerecorded video\nto\n“Supervision in a Digital Era,” the 26th Annual Conference\nof the International Association of Insurance Supervisors\nAbu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates\nNovember 14, 2019\n\nI greatly regret I couldn’t be with you today in Abu Dhabi. You are in a region of\nthe world that’s a fitting place to discuss the future of insurance supervision because of\nits ties to the very origins of insurance. The first written system of laws, the Hammurabic\nCode, in fact, included the first rules on loss liability. The ancient Arab tribal practice of\ntakaful, a system of guarantees, gave rise to one of the earliest forms of mutual insurance,\nwhich was used to protect ship owners and cargo. The Middle East is the cradle of\ncivilization, and civilization itself has always depended on the rules and guarantees that\nare the basis of insurance.\nAnd while I couldn’t be part of the your discussions, I am grateful for this\nopportunity to reach you with a message about how the International Association of\nInsurance Supervisors (IAIS) is supporting the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) goal of\npromoting a strong and stable global financial system.\nThe FSB was created to gather national and regional authorities together in a\nforum that considers and addresses financial stability risks. The IAIS’s mission, to\npromote effective supervision of the insurance industry, is in full alignment with the\ngoals of the FSB. The new global financial architecture built in the aftermath of the crisis\nrequires continued cooperation among authorities, standard-setting bodies, and all\nstakeholders. Such cooperation is the basis of the FSB, and the basis for what the IAIS\nhas achieved in the past quarter century, and what you are striving to achieve in the\nfuture.\nSince becoming Chair of the FSB last December, I have had some time to observe\nthe important work of the IAIS as one of the standard-setting bodies that are essential to\nthe FSB. The IAIS has been an active contributor to the FSB’s work through the Plenary\n\n-2 -\nand Steering Committees. It’s also a valuable part of the work of the FSB Standing\nCommittees on Supervision and Regulatory Cooperation and Standards Implementation.\nFSB members tell me they appreciate the regular updates by IAIS Executive Committee\nchair Vicky Saporta. Our two organizations have worked together closely on addressing\nsystemic risk related to insurance. In particular, I appreciate the work of the IAIS to\ndevelop a Holistic Framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the\ninsurance sector.\nAs I indicated a moment ago, I know that the IAIS is celebrating its twenty-fifth\nanniversary. As we think back to 1994, and the step forward the IAIS represented for\ncooperation and coordination on insurance oversight, I think we can all marvel at how\nmodest, relative to today, were the demands and the aspirations at that time for\ninternational standard-setting. On the one hand, insurance had been a global business for\nwell over a century. On the other, the idea that an insurance company could be at the\ncenter of a global financial meltdown would have seem far-fetched. Likewise, even after\nthe financial crises in developing countries in the late 1990s, few people believed that the\nworld’s largest and wealthiest economies could all be threatened with ruin by a truly\nglobal crisis. It is for this reason that we are not this year also celebrating the twentieth\nanniversary of the Financial Stability Forum, which was created in that more innocent\nera. It was replaced by the FSB a decade ago because of the urgent need for a larger and\nmore ambitious organization to deal with the global crisis that few had seen coming.1\nThat global financial crisis demanded a global response and the Group of 20\n(G20) leaders called on national authorities to cast a wider net for membership than the\n1 https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20191003a.htm\n\n- 3 -\nFinancial Stability Forum could offer. The first ten years of the FSB have seen important\nachievements in promoting global financial standards that have addressed weaknesses\nrevealed by the financial crisis. Today, banks are more resilient due to higher capital and\nliquidity standards. We are addressing the “too-big-to-fail” problem, including through\nnew statutory resolution frameworks and resolution planning. Over-the-counter\nderivatives markets are simpler and more transparent. And the risks emanating from non-\nbank financial intermediation that contributed to the crisis have diminished significantly.\nBut the FSB’s policy work needs to advance in a few important areas. While\nresolution plans are in place for the global, systemically important banks, more work is\nneeded to build effective resolution regimes for insurers. We have to keep up the\nmomentum to ensure that markets have confidence that bailouts using taxpayer funds are\na thing of the past.\nThe future, and the prospects for success, of both the FSB and the IAIS will turn\non how we address the challenges of the changing nature of financial services that are\ncoming from technological innovation and other sources. Your conference theme this\nyear, “Supervision in a Digital Era” is timely, and the panels you have planned on these\ntopics can inform the supervisory responses that all our governments are weighing. The\nrapid changes transforming the financial landscape mean we can’t rely on the past for\nanswers.\nThe FSB is committed to a forward-looking agenda to address new vulnerabilities\nand new challenges. Like the IAIS, we are developing a new financial stability\nsurveillance framework. We’re also examining possible unintended negative\nconsequences of market fragmentation. And something that is capturing the attention of\n\n- 4 -\nmany regulators are recent proposals to launch stablecoins on a global scale. The FSB\nhas been looking at crypto-assets and has formed a group of experts to examine the\nimplications of these recent proposals. The FSB and IAIS share many common concerns\nabout risks to financial stability—Fintech, cyber risk and operational resilience are just\nsome of them.\nThe IAIS has advanced the effort to tackle these problems with an active and\ncomprehensive program of outreach: by extending the length of public consultations\nwhenever possible; by expanding participation of new stakeholders in public events; by\norganizing subject matter specific workshops on emerging risks; by expanding efforts to\nseek input from consumer groups; and, by reaching out to academics with more\nroundtable discussions with investors and rating agencies.\nIn closing, congratulations again to the IAIS on its silver anniversary, and doubly\nso for embracing such an ambitious agenda for the future. On behalf of the FSB, we look\nforward to working with you to set standards for financial regulation and supervision that\nwill promote a strong and stable financial system. Thank you for this opportunity to\nspeak, and I wish you a successful and engaging conference.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n8:30 a.m. EDT\nSeptember 27, 2019\nLaw and Macroeconomics: The Global Evolution of Macroprudential Regulation\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Law and Macroeconomics,” a conference at\nGeorgetown University Law Center\nWashington, D.C.\nSeptember 27, 2019\n\nGood morning. I would like to thank Georgetown University Law Center and the\nconference organizers, Anna Gelpern and Adam Levitin, for the opportunity to speak to\nyou.\nI was particularly delighted to be asked to speak at today’s conference because the\ntopic is law and macroeconomics, a field that my experience has persuaded me is of the\nfirst importance, but ill understood, and surprisingly understudied. Now, this may at first\nblush sound like a beloved former president, venturing into a grocery store—“Golly, can\nyou believe these scanners!?”—because the field of law and economics was already\nsturdily established when I was in law school back in the Coolidge Administration, and is\nnow well over half a century old. It has been the source of some of the most innovative\nand influential legal scholarship over the lifetimes of everyone here, and in many ways\nthe insights of the law and economics movement have become the default framework that\npolicy makers and practitioners alike use when we think about the law conceptually, and\noften even at the level of granular application.\nYet, while we have called this law and economics, it would be more precise to\ncall it law and microeconomics. Both law and microeconomics are centrally concerned\nwith incentives—how are they constructed, how do they operate, how do legal or\neconomic actors respond to them—and the interplay between these different ways to\nthink about incentives has been a natural and fruitful focus of investigation in a broad\nrange of legal studies: tort law, property law, criminal law, contract law, corporate law.\nBut both law and economics are also centrally concerned with systems, the\nperformance and relationships of broad aggregates of laws or economic activity. Not\nmerely how do individual actors react to changes in incentives, but how do large-scale\n\n- 2 -\ncombinations of actors respond to changes in systems: how are legal or economic\nsystems constructed, how do they operate, how do those systems constrain wide areas of\nhuman activity. The interplay between those two ways of thinking about systems would\nseem to be as natural and fruitful a focus of investigation as is law and microeconomics,\nbut it is only just beginning to be thought of as a field in itself.\nFor a concrete example, think about the often observed fact that corporate profit\nmargins have been increasing steadily over the last few decades. Law is likely to have\nbeen a significant element in this evolution, but not any individual law. Rather an entire\nsystem of laws—laws relating to corporate governance, corporate combinations, taxation,\nlitigation, labor—have evolved over an extended period of time. And, under this theory,\none outcome of this system—higher corporate profit margins—would likely give firms\ngreater scope to increase wages without increasing prices, thus offering a potential\nexplanation for the flattening of the Phillips curve, the traditional macroeconomic\nrelationship between the unemployment rate and inflation. For a policymaker who\naccepted this theory, his comfort in maintaining a very low rate of unemployment could\ndepend significantly on his understanding of that underlying legal system and his\nestimation of how its evolution would likely proceed in the future.\nThus, the formal union of law and macroeconomics should seek to examine the\ninterplay between a legal system and macroeconomic outcomes, above and beyond the\nconnections a particular law may have with its impact on human behavior. Scholars and\npolicymakers have spent our time primarily thinking about the impact of single laws, but\nit is appropriate to focus more broadly, especially since we have in fact repeatedly sought\nover the past century to revamp our system of laws to improve macroeconomic outcomes.\n\n- 3 -\nConsider the roaring debate in the half-dozen years after the 1929 market crash\nthat led to the establishment of the foundations of federal financial regulation in the\nUnited States. Laws creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and a federal\ndeposit insurance and receivership framework, establishing the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, and greatly expanding the responsibilities and capabilities of the Federal\nReserve System were very purposefully intended to help restore confidence in the U.S.\nfinancial system as a necessary condition to foster a recovery from the devastation of the\nGreat Depression. In essence, we designed and implemented a new system of financial\nregulatory laws to alter macroeconomic outcomes, not only to affect individual behavior.\nThe debate around those laws, in the 1930s, was not an academic one, because the pain\nand suffering of that era was evident—at the time Congress was debating the Banking\nAct of 1935, which established the modern framework for the federal bank regulation and\nsupervision, the unemployment rate in the United States was still 20 percent.1\nI will leave to others the question of whether every detail of the laws passed in\nthis period was equally effective, in the short or long term, in promoting macroeconomic\nstability. But we should recognize that rules to promote financial stability and a healthy\neconomy have deep roots in the American legal tradition.\nThe Post-Crisis International Consensus\n1 Arguably, the history of law and macroeconomics has even deeper roots. Prior to the Banking Act of\n1935, Congress had passed the National Bank Act of 1863 in response to the financial crisis that emerged\nduring the early days of the American Civil War. Its purpose was to create a national banking system and\nestablish a national currency. The following year, Congress passed the National Bank Act of 1864, which\nestablished the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and gave the federal government the authority to\nsupervise commercial banks. Some might even characterize the First and Second Banks of the United\nStates as early efforts at law and macroeconomics.\n\n- 4 -\nBuilding upon that strong tradition, I would like to focus this morning’s remarks\non the role that law and macroeconomics has played since the financial crisis in\npromoting a more stable economy. I am, of course, referring to macroprudential financial\nregulation.\nLet’s rewind the tape. After many decades of remarkable financial stability in the\nUnited States since the 1930s, the focus of financial oversight had moved away from\nsystemic risks. Prior to the financial crisis, the better part of our regulatory framework\nwas microprudential in nature—individual laws geared toward mitigating the fallout from\nidiosyncratic shocks to firms. This framework was designed to protect investors and\ndepositors, viewed negative shocks as not originating from the financial system, and did\nnot take into account risks that might be shared by financial firms.2 This is not to say that\nregulators did not understand the consequences of an interconnected system and the\npotential of contagion. For instance, the U.S. government, under the able leadership of\nTreasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, recognized and responded to the financial stability\nrisks of the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s. The United States had interests in\nstabilizing allies in Latin America, but a central part of the motivation was to contain\npotential risks to the U.S. economy.\nThe events of 2008–09 redefined our mission by more explicitly connecting\nmacroeconomic and financial stability, as in the 1930s. Congress and the executive\nbranch embraced a sweeping response, designing a system of laws to reflect a recognition\nthat the cumulative, interconnected behavior of financial institutions had implications for\n2 See Claudio Borio, Towards a Macroprudential Framework for Financial Supervision and Regulation?\nBank of International Settlements Working Papers No. 128 (Basel, Switzerland: BIS, February 2003),\nhttps://www.bis.org/publ/work128.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nfinancial stability and that even the behavior of a single large and complex institution\ncould have implications for financial stability. This new system was also adopted at the\ninternational level. Starting with the G20 summit in Washington, D.C., in November\n2008, the global community established the runway for a structural change. The\nsubsequent G20 summit in London led to the establishment of the Financial Stability\nBoard (FSB), with a strengthened mandate as a successor to the Financial Stability\nForum. Subsequently, including at the following summit in Pittsburgh, world leaders\nagreed that the supervision of individual financial institutions had to account for the\nfinancial system as a whole, and it was recognized that shocks could originate from\nwithin the system and could spread to institutions with common exposures. In other\nwords, the supervisory framework had to be macroprudential—focusing on mitigating\nsystemic risk and accounting for macroeconomic consequences.3 This reorientation was\na defining part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, and internationally, in the Basel III Accord.\nSection 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, in particular, requires the Board to implement\nheightened capital and liquidity standards, concentration limits, and stress testing—all to\nfurther the macroprudential purpose of preventing or mitigating risks to the financial\nstability of the United States. As I will discuss later, the Board has followed through with\nrules such as the G-SIB surcharge, the liquidity coverage ratio, and single-counterparty\ncredit limits, just to name a few; and, importantly, we have used macroeconomic\nconsiderations in calibrating some of these rules.\nAn Evolving Regulatory Perspective\n3 See Busch and van Rijin (2018), supra.\n\n- 6 -\nNow, let’s fast forward to the present. Over a decade has passed since the\nmigration began toward a renewed focus on macroprudential regulation. Our evolution\ndid not stop with the Pittsburgh G20 summit in 2009. Indeed, global financial standard-\nsetters have continued to adapt and learn as they implemented and updated regulations in\nline with the global consensus that was reflected in Basel III. I would like to highlight\nthree important regulatory paradigm shifts that follow from this renewed focus on\nmacroprudential regulation.\nTaking Stock of the Entire Banking Sector\nFirst, in line with the pivot away from microprudential regulation, we have a\nrenewed focus not only on the health of individual financial firms but on the amount of\ncapital in the entire banking sector. Note that the idea of improving the stability of the\nfinancial system by regulating individual bank capital has been around for decades.\nGlobal policymakers began construction of the modern risk-based, bank capital\nframework in the 1980s, when the aforementioned Latin American debt crisis increased\nconcerns that the capital held by large international banks was deteriorating. Since then,\nregulators, such as the Board, have continued to have one eye focused on the capital held\nat individual firms. Now, over a decade after the crisis, exercises such as stress testing\nhave caused us to have the other eye focused on and assessing the amount of capital in\nthe entire banking system.\nConsidering Macroeconomic Outcomes in Calibrations and Impact Analyses\nThe second paradigm shift is that regulators have improved their methods of\nconducting quantitative analysis of regulations. Such analysis, including conventional –\ncost-benefit analysis, traditionally did not take macroeconomic variables like gross\n\n- 7 -\ndomestic product (GDP) growth or the unemployment rate. That is no longer the case.\nSince regulators are given the task of maintaining the stability of the system as a whole,\nthey must concern themselves with externalities and spillover effects to the broader\neconomy. At the Federal Reserve, several regulatory initiatives have exemplified this\nchange in quantitative analysis.\nAt the height of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve created the first stress\ntest, the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), to estimate potential losses at\nthose banks, if economic and financial conditions worsened. Building on SCAP, the\nFederal Reserve moved to the current stress testing assessment—the Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and Review (CCAR)—to evaluate whether the largest firms have\nsufficient capital to absorb potential losses and continue to lend under stressful\nconditions. In the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve simulates macroeconomic\nscenarios like a recession in which GDP falls and the unemployment rate rises\nsignificantly. In the 2019 stress test cycle, for example, we tested banks against a\nhypothetical global recession in which the unemployment rate in the United States rose to\n10 percent.4 The stressed banks were required to show that they could continue to meet\nminimum capital requirements in the face of those hypothetical macroeconomic shocks.\nAside from CCAR, the FSB compiles an annual list of global systemically\nimportant banks (G-SIBs), which are subject to stricter capital requirements in the form\nof a capital surcharge. These banks must meet this higher capital standard based on the\njudgement that their potential failure would have a larger, systemwide impact on the\n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2019 Supervisory Scenarios for Annual Stress Tests\nRequired under the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing Rules and the Capital Plan Rule (Washington: Board of\nGovernors, February 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20190213a1.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\neconomy. The goal, therefore, is to reduce a G-SIB’s probability of failure so that its\nexpected impact on the economy would be the same as that of a non-G-SIB.\nSimilarly, to reduce the risks of interconnectedness and contagion, the United\nStates and other jurisdictions have implemented rules that limit the exposure that one\nbank may have to a single counterparty.\nFinally, research on optimal bank capital levels by staff at regulatory and\nsupervisory bodies around the world have factored in macroeconomic costs and benefits.\nSpecifically, these models assume that higher capital requirements would reduce the\nprobability of a financial crisis occurring but would increase the cost of bank lending,\nthereby lowering GDP growth. Not surprisingly, these models have produced a wide\nrange of capital estimates given the wide range of underlying assumptions.\nCombating Pro-cyclicality\nThe third paradigm shift at the Fed is combatting pro-cyclicality. To be sure,\nnone of the regulatory developments that I have discussed so far screams\nmacroeconomics quite as loudly as a time-varying, discretionary regulatory regime the\nexpress goal of which is to fight pro-cyclicality. Cyclicality—in this case, fluctuations in\nthe economy based on the business cycle—is a concept that is near and dear to every\nmacroeconomist’s heart. In fact, theoretical studies of economic cycles go back to the\nearly 1800s, and the National Bureau of Economic Research’s tracker of the U.S.\nbusiness cycle dates economic contractions and expansions back to the 1850s. Quite\nimpressive. There’s also more than just a handful of volumes of articles and book\nchapters written on the business cycle and countercyclical fiscal policy.\n\n- 9 -\nIn the context of macroprudential regulation, pro-cyclicality represents a problem\nbecause banks tend to build up excessive credit during an economic expansion. Limiting\npro-cyclicality means limiting both the highs and lows of a credit cycle.\nAlong with many other jurisdictions, the United States adopted a countercyclical\ncapital buffer (CCyB) to address the issue. The U.S. CCyB is a capital buffer that ranges\nfrom zero percent to 2.5 percent of covered institutions’ risk-weighted assets. Domestic\nregulators have discretion to switch the CCyB on or off anywhere within that range in\norder to prevent or mitigate the overheating of credit markets under their jurisdiction. In\nsetting the buffer, the Federal Reserve takes into account, among other things, leverage in\nthe financial sector, leverage in the nonfinancial sector, maturity and liquidity\ntransformation in the financial sector, and asset valuation pressures. Notably, the CCyB\nis not calibrated bank-by-bank and is not calibrated asset-class-by-asset-class. Rather,\nregulators set the buffer based on their perception of the aggregate domestic credit cycle,\nwhether it’s too hot, too cold, or just right. Under the Board’s current policy, we would\nactivate the CCyB based on “when systemic vulnerabilities are meaningfully above\nnormal.”\nBased on this policy, the CCyB is currently set at zero percent in the United States\nbut has been turned on in France, Hong Kong, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and\nNorway. It is worth noting that, in the United Kingdom, the CCyB is set equal to a\npositive level—1 percent—in normal times. As a result, their buffer can be adjusted\nupward or downward based on the perceived risks of the time-varying credit cycle. As I\nhave recently said, I see real merit in exploring the U.K. approach as a tool to promote\nfinancial stability.\n\n- 10 -\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by offering a few thoughts on three research topics that fall\nsquarely in the intersection of law and macroeconomics.\nCentral Bank Mandates\nFirst, while international agreements such as Basel III demonstrate that the\ninternational regulatory community has agreed on the high-level systematic changes and\ndeveloped similar perspectives following the crisis, national governments gave different\nregulatory powers—in both degree and scope—to their central banks in pursuit of the\nnew post-crisis consensus.5 In the United States, Congress did not change the Federal\nReserve’s dual mandate but did provide new responsibilities to promote financial\nstability. There was no change to the European Central Bank’s monetary policy mandate,\nbut it received direct supervisory authority over some of the Eurozone’s largest banks\nthrough the Single Supervisory Mechanism and also continues to monitor financial sector\nrisks. The Bank of Japan does not control Japan’s macroprudential toolkit but does play\nan active role in monitoring systemic risk. The Bank of England, on the other hand, was\nexplicitly tasked with a new financial stability mandate, and it oversees macroprudential\nregulation.\nIn line with the debates over central bank independence and macroeconomic\noutcomes, legal scholars who engage in cutting-edge research on institutional design may\nhave thoughts on which model leads to the best outcomes for financial stability.\nFinancial Stability Monitoring\n5 See Ed Balls, James Howat, and Anna Stansbury, Central Bank Independence Revisited: After the\nFinancial Crisis, What Should a Model Central Bank Look Like? Harvard Kennedy School M-RCBG\nAssociate Working Paper No. 87 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Kennedy School, 2018),\nhttps://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/mrcbg/files/67_central.bank.v.2.pdf.\n\n- 11 -\nSecond, in addition to giving varying degrees of power to their central banks,\nnational governments also created new bodies that promote financial stability, such as the\nFSB and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), to monitor systemic risk and\nidentify systemically important institutions and activities. For example, the main issues\non the FSB agenda for this year were developments in financial technology, nonbank\nfinancial intermediation, and evaluation of too-big-to-fail reforms.6 In the same vein, the\nFSOC produces annual reports that highlight such threats and vulnerabilities, including\nnews ones such as cybersecurity.7\nGiven today’s audience, I very much look forward to hearing your thoughts on\nthese issues, particularly suggestions on ways in which our legal framework can be used\nto mitigate these risks and the extent to which additional macroeconomic tools should be\ndeveloped to monitor or address evolving risks.\nDue Process\nThird and finally, since I have spent a good part of this speech talking about\nissues that are near and dear to every economist, I feel like it is only fair for me to wrap\nup by discussing an issue of equal, if not greater, emotional import to lawyers: due\nprocess. Specifically, I’d like to close by talking about the due process considerations\nassociated with the aforementioned macroprudential policies. There is nothing improper\nabout mitigating negative externalities through regulation, and that is an important\npurpose of much post-crisis financial regulation. However, it is also well-accepted that\n6 Randal K. Quarles, “The Financial Stability Board in 2019” (speech at the Joint Conference of the\nEuropean Central Bank and the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, Frankfurt, Germany, March 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20190328a.htm.\n7 See U.S Department of the Treasury, Financial Stability Oversight Council Annual Report 2018\n(Washington: U.S. Treasury, 2018), https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm578.\n\n- 12 -\ndue process requires the fair, evenhanded application of laws so that individuals are not at\nthe mercy of the arbitrary exercise of government power.8 As I have alluded to\nthroughout my remarks, we are currently placing a much greater regulatory burden on a\nselect group of banks—the largest and most complex firms—because we believe their\nfailures would bring down the entire financial system.\nSome might argue that, during the financial crisis, we dispensed with due process\nconsiderations while conducting version 1.0 of the stress tests. This is why\nI have strongly pushed for the recent shift toward greater transparency around the\nstructure of the stress tests and the models themselves. It affords greater due process to\nthe affected participants.\nIn the same vein, I would welcome greater legal scholarship on the due process\nconsiderations associated with bank supervision as a process distinct from bank\nregulation. By bank supervision, I refer to the processes and activities identified with\nexamining banks, including checking compliance with laws and regulations, assessing\nbank capital and liquidity levels, assigning supervisory ratings to banks, and taking\nformal and informal enforcement actions. While it is important for bank supervision to\nbe up to the task of assessing the world’s largest banks, especially in light of the financial\nstability risks that I have been describing today, an equally important task is making sure\nthat supervisors are acting fairly. Although questions of fairness are routine in law and\neconomics, there is ample room to explore these issues as they relate to bank supervision.\n8 See Paul Tucker, Unelected Power: The Quest for Legitimacy in Central Banking and the Regulatory\nState (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2018), https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11240.html.\n\n- 13 -\nWhile transparency and fairness are pillars of due process, I appreciate that there\nare other approaches worth considering on this matter. With this growing field of law\nand macroeconomics, I hope to see and implement many interdisciplinary solutions on\nthe path forward.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n7:15 a.m. EDT (12:15 p.m. CEST)\nMarch 28, 2019\nThe Financial Stability Board in 2019\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nChair\nFinancial Stability Board\nat\nJoint Conference of the European Central Bank and the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking\nFrankfurt, Germany\nMarch 28, 2019\nPage 1 of 13\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here today at the European Central Bank in my capacity as chair of\nthe Financial Stability Board (FSB) to help celebrate the Journal of Money, Credit and\nBanking’s (JMCB) 50th anniversary. The broad scope of the JMCB, and the diversity of its\nscholarship parallels, in some ways, the FSB itself. As we dealt with the global financial crisis,\nthe heads of state and government of the G20 tasked the FSB with identifying and addressing\nvulnerabilities in the global financial system and developing stronger regulatory and supervisory\npolicies to create a more resilient global financial system in the pursuit of financial stability. Our\nbroad mandate has considerable overlap with the fields that the JMCB covers within its pages.\nThe FSB includes 24 jurisdictions and 73 representatives, including all the members of the G20.\nAlso similar to the JMCB, the FSB is celebrating an anniversary this year, with its creation\nhaving occurred 10 years ago. We are a far cry from the JMCB’s 50 years, but I hope that in\ntime our continuing work--and not just our response to the late crisis--will prove valuable enough\nthat we one day merit a similar celebration.\nI am especially pleased to speak at this conference today because the FSB welcomes and\nencourages the participation of the academic community in tackling issues of global financial\nstability. I would like to see a greater and more direct contribution of academic subject-matter\nexperts to our work. You may have noticed that the FSB sent out a call for nominations last\nmonth for academics to advise our work in evaluating post-crisis reforms--in this particular\ninstance, the evaluation that will examine the effects of the too-big-to-fail reform package that\nthe G20 endorsed in 2010 and that the FSB and other standard setters have implemented since\nthen. In our initiatives to examine the consequences of post-crisis reform, the academic\ncommunity can help advance the field with analytical tools and critical insight.\nPage 2 of 13\n\nThe financial crisis exposed fault lines in the financial system that had to be addressed\nimmediately, comprehensively, and vigorously. The body of post-crisis regulation that resulted\nwas founded on the work of academics, including important papers published in the JMCB, and\ninvolved the energy and efforts of many standard setters, regulators, supervisors, and central\nbanks. It was an exemplary feat of cooperation and coordination, and it has unquestionably\nmade the financial system safer and more resilient.\nToday, the post-crisis reform agenda has been largely completed. Basel III is final, the\nlargest global banks have substantially more capital and liquidity, over-the-counter derivatives\nmarkets are safer, and steps have been taken to address the risks of too-big-to-fail institutions.\nThrough greater monitoring and policy measures, the FSB is addressing risks from nonbank\nfinancial intermediation. And there has been remarkable progress on the difficult and\nunglamorous task of establishing workable resolution regimes that are consistent with the FSB’s\nclearly defined principles. While we must still work to ensure full, timely, and consistent\nimplementation of the agreed reforms, it is time for the FSB to turn more of its energy and\nattention to the future.\nIn my time with you today, I would like to do two things. First, I would like to share\nwith you my view on how the work of the FSB must evolve if we are to merit that future\ncelebration and some of the core principles that I think should inform that work. After\ndiscussing those principles, I want to focus your attention on some of the work priorities that the\nFSB will be addressing throughout 2019 and beyond, including nonbank financing, fintech, and\nevaluating the too-big-to-fail reforms.\nCore Principles\nPage 3 of 13\n\nLet me turn to the core principles--engagement, rigor, and analysis. These core principles\nreflect goals that are both inward and outward looking. From within, FSB members have the\noccasion to reflect on how our work is executed--that is, we must ask ourselves how we can\naccomplish our mission more effectively, improving the financial sector’s ability to support\neconomic growth without threatening financial stability. Outwardly, we will endeavor to reach\nout to a greater number of constituents and stakeholders for their input on the important financial\nstability issues they are encountering. This is also a good time to inform a wider public audience\non the nature of our mission in a clear, articulate, and jargon-free manner.\nEngagement\nAs the FSB pivots away from the urgency of post-crisis reform development, it is an\nopportune time to improve our efforts at effective engagement. Recognizing the wide-reaching\neffects of its work, the FSB must seek input from a broad range of stakeholders, each of whom\nbrings a different perspective to the issues under consideration. While we are directly\naccountable to the G20, we are, through the G20, accountable to all of the people affected by our\nactions. In my view, that means we must engage in genuine, substantial dialogue with all of\nthese stakeholders, to a greater and more effective degree than we have in the past.\nTo start, we can strengthen the role of the six regional groups that are a part of the FSB\norganization. In 2011, the FSB established six consultative groups representing large regions of\nthe globe--the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, the\nCommonwealth of Independent States, and Asia. The intent was to expand its outreach program\nbeyond the membership in a systematic manner to better reflect the FSB’s global mission. Each\ngroup meets once or twice a year and helps the FSB obtain broader input into its policy\ndevelopment agenda. These groups should be re-engineered to not only promote implementation\nPage 4 of 13\n\nof international policy initiatives within their respective regions, but also to be in a strong\nposition to keep abreast of developments in financial markets and thus inform FSB policy. We\nhave initiated a study of the operations of the regional groups that will help inform us on ways to\nupgrade their effectiveness as an outreach and feedback mechanism. I am particularly interested\nin how we can take lessons learned from this study to move forward with our enhanced\nengagement.\nEngagement outside of the FSB is also very important to our mission. We currently\nengage with businesses, institutions, market participants, and academics on much of our FSB\nwork. For example, we have in the past conducted public consultations on FSB policy\nrecommendations, albeit sometimes with very short timetables. We have now established an\nexpectation that public consultation will be at least 60 days. We need to give the public adequate\ntime to comment on FSB proposals, which can, at times, be quite complex.\nBeyond public consultation, we must convene more meetings with the private sector and\nacademic community to build a more robust and meaningful dialogue. For example, we kicked\noff the work we have undertaken at the behest of the Japanese G20 Presidency to study\ndifferences in regulatory environments and market conditions across jurisdictions that may have\nfinancial stability implications--often referred to as “market fragmentation”--by hosting a\nworkshop with key stakeholders and academics. This was quite successful, and I look forward to\nsuch interactions being the rule. In addition, we need to improve our interaction and cooperation\nwith other standard-setting bodies, such as the Basel Committee, the Committee on Payments\nand Market Infrastructure, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, and the\nInternational Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). While we have worked together\nPage 5 of 13\n\nin the past, we all owe it to the global community to seek out opportunities for improved\ncooperation and engagement.\nTo improve FSB transparency, we will be taking a number of important steps. For\nexample, on February 12, 2019, the FSB published a comprehensive work program on its\nwebsite for the year ahead.1 This is the first time in the FSB’s history that the work program was\ndisseminated publicly. Over the term of my chairmanship, I will continue to look for steps that\nwill allow all stakeholders to have a more open window into the FSB’s decisionmaking process\nand products. I believe improved transparency into the FSB process is critical to our mission.\nI’m reminded of Lord Hewart’s famous--and oft-quoted--remark concerning the importance of\njurisprudence to the public: “Not only must justice be done; it must also be seen to be done.” We\nshould be able to apply this concept to the field of global financial standard setting.\nRigorous Vigilance\nThe second principle I would like to discuss concerns how we assess and mitigate\nvulnerabilities in the global financial system. The post-crisis reforms addressed the fault lines\nthat led to the crisis and the contagion effects felt around the world, but they will never replace\nthe need for vigilance. If we are not rigorously vigilant, we still risk another crisis. What we\nneed are forward-looking methodologies that use the most advanced analytical tools to spot\nvulnerabilities well in advance before they lead to widespread financial distress and economic\ncosts. Here the academic community can continue to contribute with cutting-edge and robust\nmodeling techniques.\nWe can only mitigate financial vulnerabilities if we identify them accurately and in a\ntimely manner. As such, the FSB’s Standing Committee on Assessment of Vulnerabilities under\n1 The document is available at http://www.fsb.org/2019/02/fsb-work-programme-for-2019/\nPage 6 of 13\n\nthe leadership of FSB Vice Chair Klaas Knot of the Dutch National Bank will be directing a\nconsiderable amount of energy to developing a cutting-edge framework for the identification and\nassessment of financial vulnerabilities. Again, the principles of transparency and engagement\nwill shape the work of the group. It is important that a wide spectrum of financial participants be\nbrought into the process, from banks and nonbank financial institutions to financial regulators to\nnational authorities and multilateral standard-setting bodies and the broad academic community.\nThis task is essential to the mission of the FSB; financial developments move at a rapid pace, and\nbeing able to quickly and accurately assess vulnerabilities is essential if we are to take action to\nprevent future crises.\nAnalysis\nFinally, the FSB members must employ a critical eye toward the effects of the regulations\nthat have been put in place. Many of the reforms have been in place long enough for them to be\nevaluated. We can judge whether reforms are having their intended effects and making the\nfinancial system more resilient. Are any regulatory reforms causing unintended, adverse effects?\nCan we achieve the same, strong level of financial resilience with reforms that are more efficient,\nsimple, transparent, and tailored? The FSB must champion efficient and effective regulation in\norder to maintain public support for the progress we have made.\nKey Pieces of the FSB’s Work Plan\nNow I would like to turn to three prominent issues on the FSB’s agenda in 2019. I will\nstart with two relatively new issues that continue to evolve and grow in sophistication: nonbank\nfinancing and fintech, and then I will turn to the important work we are beginning on evaluating\nthe effects of reforms aimed at ending too big to fail.\nFintech\nPage 7 of 13\n\nI will loosely define fintech as technology-enabled financial innovation that results in\nmaterial changes to the provision of financial services. As is often the case when technological\ninnovation meets established business, fintech has attracted a great deal of attention, ranging\nfrom utopian claims to hostile skepticism. Claims about fintech’s promise abound: it has the\npower and potential to reduce economic inequality, increase financial inclusion, and boost\neconomic growth. Through the introduction of new methodologies, greater information curation,\nand reduction in processing costs, fintech could potentially reduce financial volatility and\nvulnerabilities.\nWe are already seeing significant changes to how many people around the world obtain\nfinancial services. For example, in Kenya, a mobile payments technology has introduced mobile\nwallets to millions of people, many of whom never had a bank account. In the United States, the\nlargest mortgage provider is an online lender. In China, a technology firm started the world’s\nlargest money market fund.\nYet, alongside this growth in fintech, as my predecessor as FSB chair emphasized, we as\nregulators must ensure that as we maximize the potential benefits in the development of fintech\nwe minimize the potential risks and costs. The FSB monitors and analyzes the financial stability\nimplications of financial innovation as part of our mandate to identify and address vulnerabilities\nin the global financial system. Let me outline two areas that we have started to examine in\ngreater detail: the potential effects from the entry of large technology firms into financial\nservices and the potential effects from the growth in decentralized financial technologies.\nOver the last decade, the world has witnessed an explosion of large technology firms that\nare weaving themselves into our daily lives: for example, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Tencent,\nand Baidu. Some of these firms are increasingly providing some financial services, such as\nPage 8 of 13\n\npayments, credit, insurance, and asset management. Their involvement can support financial\nservices broadly. For example, their technology may increase speed and efficiency, and the\nubiquity of their presence in our lives may allow them to offer financial services in a more\nconvenient way or at lower cost to consumers. Further, as they are only dipping their toes into\nthe edges of the financial services water, the effects they have on the provision of financial\nservices could grow enormously if they were to dive in.\nLooking at the technologies that underlie some of the recent innovative financial\nproducts, we see a move toward decentralization--that is, a movement toward technologies that\nconnect financial market participants directly without an intermediary. The potential areas of\nimpact are broad: settling interbank payments; verifying and reconciling trade finance invoices;\nexecuting, enforcing and verifying the performance of contracts; and keeping an audit trail to\ndeter money laundering.\nBoth the potential entry of large, established technology companies into financial services\nand the ability of technology to decentralize financial transactions raise a number of issues, some\nof which may touch on financial stability. Technological innovation offers the promise of a\nsubstantially more efficient financial system. But new systems, processes, and types of\nbusinesses will bring with them novel fragilities. We continue to be responsible for ensuring that\nthe financial system be sufficiently resilient that businesses and households worldwide need not\nfear the collapse of the system that serves their needs.\nThese are open questions that need to be addressed, and because they touch on issues of\nfinancial stability, the FSB is putting significant resources into understanding these potentially\nimportant developments. To be clear, we are not trying to oppose innovation, because\ninnovation, including fintech, offers the world many potential benefits. As the group charged\nPage 9 of 13\n\nwith ensuring financial stability, however, we have to work to ensure that we can reap the\nbenefits offered by these new technologies without harming financial stability. We hope to offer\nsome answers to these questions in the coming years and to do so in line with the principles I\noutlined earlier. We will address the questions with discipline and analytical rigor in a way that\nincorporates the views of the public and key stakeholders and that results in answers that are\npractical and intelligible.\nNonbank Financial Intermediation\nThe second issue I would like to discuss is nonbank financing. Since the global financial\ncrisis, nonbank financing has grown relatively rapidly, in both its absolute size and its relative\nimportance in intermediating credit. In the jurisdictions that the FSB closely monitors, nonbank\nfinancial assets are just under 50 percent of total global financial assets, a share that has grown\nby close to 5 percentage points since 2009. Nonbank financial intermediation (the artist formerly\nknown as “shadow banking”) provides a valuable alternative to bank financing and helps to\nsupport real economic activity. Accordingly, the shift within the financial system toward\nnonbank financing represents a welcome increase in the diversity of the sources of lending to\nboth firms and households.\nEven though the core of the financial system is much more resilient than before the\nglobal financial crisis, with strengthened bank capital and liquidity requirements, nonbank\nfinancing has been a source of systemic risk. Nonbank financing often features high leverage,\nmaturity and liquidity mismatches, opaque structures, and concentrated holdings of risky assets.\nNonbank financing can also lead to lower lending standards, bidding up the price of risky assets\nand sending an encouraging signal to credit underwriters. All of these channels played a role in\nthe recent global financial crisis. More recently, new forms of interconnectedness between\nPage 10 of 13\n\nnonbank financial firms and the banking system have emerged that could, in some scenarios, act\nas channels for domestic and cross-border amplification of risks.\nGiven these potential risks, and the large--and increasing--role for nonbank financing, we\nneed to monitor closely its development. Is the growth of nonbank financing altering the\nexisting market structures? Are there new vulnerabilities in the financial system? How will\nnonbank financing develop?\nTo answer these important questions, the FSB is progressing on three related tracks.\nFirst, the FSB produces an annual report that outlines the developments in nonbank financing,\ndetailing the global trends and potential risks. Second, the FSB promotes the resilience of\nnonbanks through the development of a range of policies to address systemic vulnerabilities\nwhere they arise, while not impeding the growth of sustainable nonbank financing models. In\nthis way, we hope to promote resilient nonbank financial intermediation. The FSB, working\nalongside other standard-setting bodies such as the Basel Committee and IOSCO, is monitoring\nthe implementation of these policies. Finally, knowing it is arrogant to expect that we got\neverything right the first time around, it is imperative that we start analyzing the effectiveness of\nthe policies that have been implemented. How should we alter our policies? Have we modelled\nthe risks from nonbank financing accurately? Have we missed a crucial new source of systemic\nrisk? These are all questions that we must ask ourselves.\nEvaluation of Too-Big-To-Fail Reforms\nThe third issue that I would like to raise is the problem of “too big to fail”--that is, the\nperception by investors that some institutions will receive support from their governments if they\nbecome distressed. This weakens market discipline and allows such firms to become even\nlarger, more leveraged and more complex. To address this challenge, the FSB and other global\nPage 11 of 13\n\nstandard setters developed a framework and a set of policy measures intended to reduce the\nmoral hazard risks posed by systemically important financial institutions. These measures are\nintended to make the financial system more resilient, for example through higher capital and\nliquidity requirements, while simultaneously allowing these institutions to fail without causing\ndisruption to critical services, such as payments. A key element of the FSB’s policy measures to\naddress too big to fail is its total loss absorbing capacity standard. Under this standard, the FSB\nintroduced a bail-in (in contrast to a bailout) strategy that necessarily employs a gone concern or\npost-failure loss-absorbing and recapitalization capacity for the set of global systemically\nimportant banks.\nCrucially, by raising resolution standards, we have improved the potential for non-\ndisruptive bank failure. The implementation of these standards is most advanced in the banking\nsector, especially for the largest globally important banks. The FSB established crisis\nmanagement groups, collections of supervisors who monitor resolution plans of the firms. At the\nsame time, we must be conscious that we have not actually tested the failure of a large bank in\nthe marketplace--surely a good thing!\nStanding over a decade on from the start of the financial crisis, we must ask ourselves,\nhow effective have we been at reducing the problem of too big to fail? Have we achieved our\nobjective to reduce or eliminate the problem? Have we introduced new unintended risks to the\nfinancial system or costs to other financial market participants?\nTo start answering these important questions, as part of its broader effort to evaluate the\neffects of reforms, the FSB is launching an evaluation of the effects of these too-big-to-fail\nreforms. We intend to bring analytical rigor to these questions, and we recognize that the\nacademic community has undertaken much work in this area. As a result, we will draw\nPage 12 of 13\n\nextensively on academic advisors during all phases of the work we are undertaking. I also\nencourage other experts in this field to look closely to the consultative document that will be\ncoming from the study next year. We welcome the input as we undertake the study of this\nsignature issue from the crisis.\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by reiterating some of the broad themes I intended to convey today.\nFirst, I touched on some of the key principles that I hope will guide the FSB work while I am\nchair. Those principles include expanded engagement with a broad range of stakeholders and\nexperts, rigorous and careful examination of financial vulnerabilities that may threaten our\nfinancial system, and analytical examination of past reforms to ensure that they are making the\nfinancial system as resilient as it can be in the most efficient manner possible.\nSecond, I shared some of the key questions we are working on relating to the rise of large\ntechnology firms in the financial sector and decentralized financial technologies, the growing\nimportance of the nonbank financial sector, and our burgeoning efforts to look at how well we\nhave addressed too big to fail, the signature issue of the recent financial crisis.\nMoving forward there will surely be additional issues to address and areas to examine.a\nDuring my time as chair of the FSB, I hope to make progress not only on the areas I have\noutlined but on a range of forward-looking issues and continue to demonstrate the value of the\nFSB. International standard-setting bodies serve an important role within our global financial\nsector, and I look forward to the FSB advancing our progress and work in these areas.\nPage 13 of 13",

Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nUtah Center for Neighborhood Stabilization 10-Year Celebration\nSalt Lake City, Utah\nAugust 20, 2019\n\nThank you for the kind introduction and for this opportunity to recognize the\ncontributions of the Utah Center for Neighborhood Stabilization (UCNS) to the vitality of\nour state’s communities. Over its 10 years, UCNS has improved the lives of many\naspiring homeowners, renters, and small business owners and helped to build a more\nhealthy and vibrant Utah.1\nAs some of you may know, I grew up in Roy, not too far from here, and have\nlived in either the Ogden or Salt Lake City areas for many decades. Although I spent a\nlot of my professional career in New York and London, and these days spend a good deal\nof my time in Washington, D.C., this is still my home, as it is yours. Like many others,\nI’m thankful for the work of UCNS and its affiliates, which are investing in the\nbetterment of this city and other Utah communities and working to ensure that the\nbenefits of those investments extend to everyone living here.\nI’ve spent most of my career in the private sector, and as I think about the\napproach of UCNS as a nonprofit organization, I am struck by the extent of\nentrepreneurship you bring to your work. Like many kinds of businesses, you deploy\ntechnical expertise and management skill to make investments, with either debt or equity\nfinancing, to generate healthy returns. Some of those returns, measured in dollars, help\nyou continue to carry out your mission, but some of them also come in the form of\npromoting small businesses, affordable housing, and community facilities such as\nrecreation centers, health-care clinics, and childcare facilities, among other things that\nbuild stronger communities. Private- and public-sector partners who support community\n1 UCNS is the parent organization of four separate organizations that, in combination, work to advance\naccess to affordable housing, including homeownership and housing near high-capacity or high-frequency\ntransit; support economic development and job creation by funding small businesses; and improve access to\nimportant community infrastructure.\n\n- 2 -\ndevelopment value entrepreneurship, and it also makes for a healthier and more\nsustainable organization, which allows you to continue your important work.\nBy all evidence, UCNS is advancing its goals in spectacular fashion. I expect a\nlarge part of this success comes from the collaborative approach that you take to those\nefforts. It seems that collaboration is a common thread that runs through your programs.\nFor example, that is apparent in UCNS’s dedication to working closely with developers\nto finance affordable housing near high-capacity transit. These important investments\nhelp workers get access to the transportation they need to get to work, without a longer\ncommute that strains finances and detracts from family life. Housing affordability is a\ngrowing challenge in Utah, and promoting mass transit—among UCNS’s other\nobjectives—has a role to play in keeping housing and transportation affordable.\nA collaborative approach also shows up in the close partnership that UCNS has\nhad with local governments to establish and maintain the Utah Small Business Growth\nInitiative, which supports economic development and job creation by helping small\nbusinesses qualify for financing with banks or other financial institutions.\nAnd collaboration is apparent in your work with lenders and affordable housing\nproviders to facilitate the acquisition, rehab, and sale of foreclosed homes to lower-\nincome borrowers, which helps those families secure the dignity and wealth-building\nopportunity that comes with stable homeownership.\nThis kind of cross-sector collaboration between the private, public, and nonprofit\nsectors is critically important to extending economic opportunity and access to financial\nservices to low- and moderate-income families. I am happy to report that organizations\nlike UCNS have an active partner in the Federal Reserve, through our community\n\n- 3 -\ndevelopment function, when it comes to supporting these types of partnerships. I will\nhighlight just a few examples of work the Fed has recently undertaken that intersects with\nthe work of UCNS.\nAs is the case in Utah, families in many states across the country face challenges\nin finding good quality housing they can afford. The Federal Reserve is actively engaged\non this issue, and has conducted research and brought together stakeholders to understand\nit better and consider solutions. As many of you in this room probably know, Utah is\nlocated within the district of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. In September\n2014, the San Francisco Fed co-hosted a symposium that explored innovative models for\nsupporting equitable development, including the development of affordable housing,\naround public transit investment. The event brought together community development\nfinancial institutions, local transit authorities, banks, policymakers, and other\nstakeholders and included participants from Salt Lake City. More recently, in August\n2018, the San Francisco Fed hosted a roundtable here to gather key decisionmakers to\ndiscuss ways the city and county could reduce barriers and provide more incentives for\nthe development of housing that is affordable to lower-income families. In March of this\nyear, the San Francisco Fed published an analysis of public-private loan funds for the\nconstruction and preservation of affordable housing.2 The study spells out the relative\nadvantages of different types of funds for different kinds of projects—preservation versus\ndevelopment, for example—and details which funds are best for the early, middle, or late\nstages of a project.\n2 Elizabeth Mattiuzzi, “Funds for Kickstarting Affordable Housing Preservation and Production: Lessons\nfor New Investors,” Community Development Research Briefs (San Francisco: Federal Reserve Bank of\nSan Francisco, March 2019).\n\n- 4 -\nTurning to support for small businesses, community development staffers across\nthe Federal Reserve conduct extensive research and analysis of the challenges and\nopportunities facing small business owners. For example, the 12 Federal Reserve Banks\ncollaborate on the annual Small Business Credit Survey, which surveys business owners\nabout their financing needs and experiences to provide timely insights to policymakers,\nservice providers, and lenders.3 In addition to providing information on small business\ncredit conditions, the Federal Reserve is trying to advance understanding of the best\neconomic development strategies for supporting small businesses. The Kansas City Fed\nhas helped lead on these issues through its “Grow Your Own” entrepreneurship-based\neconomic development guidebook, and its 2018 Growing Entrepreneurial Communities\nSummit.4\nThese are just a few of the ways that Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of\nGovernors support the efforts of community development organizations. I hope that our\nwork will be useful as you chart a path forward for your second decade of service to\nUtah, and I look forward to continued collaboration between the Federal Reserve and\ncommunity development organizations such as UCNS. Together, we can help support\nthriving communities across the Wasatch Front, the state of Utah, and across our nation.\nThank you again for inviting me to speak, and congratulations again for 10 years of\nbuilding stronger communities in Utah.\n3 See www.fedsmallbusiness.org/ for more information.\n4 The guidebook is available at\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/community/gyo/entrepreneurship-econ-dev-local-\ncommunities.pdf.",

Quarles\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nChair\nFinancial Stability Board\nat\nThird Conference on Financial Stability\nMadrid, Spain\nOctober 18, 2021\n\nThank you, Pablo, for the kind welcome. It is an honor to be here at this\nimportant conference on financial stability. And it is great to be here in Madrid and see\nall of you in person. I commend the organizers for their attention to detail in bringing us\ntogether as we all emerge from the events of the last 18 months.\nI’m here with you today as the Chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and\ntoday the FSB stands at an inflection point. From here, we can look back at the events\nand actions of the last 18 months to see what we have learned. And—in light of that—we\ncan then look forward, to see how the FSB will address ongoing and future financial\nstability challenges. All of the researchers attending this conference are no doubt doing\nsomething similar—looking back to learn so that we can better prepare for the future.\nLiving through the events of last year was an experience of near chaos. The\nworld had stopped functioning the way it should, leading to unexpected—and in some\ncases almost unimaginable—outcomes, including in our financial markets. As we got\nsome distance from the turmoil and studied pieces of the problems, patterns started to\nemerge. We began to appreciate nuances that we hadn’t appreciated in the moment. This\nconference is being held just a few blocks from where Picasso’s Guernica hangs, and in\npreparing these remarks I reflected on the first time I saw the painting, almost half a\ncentury ago—at that time at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, before Picasso\nwould let the painting come to its home in Spain. One’s first look at Guernica is chaotic,\ndizzying, viscerally frightening, hard to comprehend. But after looking about it, thinking\nabout it, living with one’s memory of the images for some time (in my case, I still think\nI’m understanding new things about it after 50 years), we start to see the story told by the\nbits and pieces.\n\n- 2 -\nThe economic and financial shock created by the outbreak of COVID-19 and the\nglobal imposition of attendant containment measures—what I typically refer to as the\n“COVID event”—was precisely the kind of global crisis that the FSB was created for,\nand—as was envisaged—the FSB has played a central role. But our work is not finished.\nAs we emerge from the acute phase of the COVID event, the FSB’s focus is shifting from\ncrisis management to addressing forward-looking issues.\nAt an event last October, I spoke about some of the lessons of the COVID event\nfor the U.S. financial system. Today, speaking as FSB Chair, I’d like to reflect on the\nrole the FSB played. How did we respond in the crisis? What lessons can we draw?\nAnd where can we sharpen our focus for the road ahead?\nReacting and Responding to Crisis: Leveraging Cooperation to Ensure Stability and\nContain Spillovers\nThe period between the Global Financial Crisis and the onset of the COVID event\nprovided some calm for an organization that was built to address crisis. But the FSB was\nnot idle. During that decade, FSB members focused on enhancing the global financial\nsystem’s resilience to shocks. Together, we strengthened our respective frameworks for\nanalyzing vulnerabilities and monitoring risks. We developed measured policy responses\nto address those vulnerabilities and risks and assessed reforms made in the wake of the\nGlobal Financial Crisis. FSB members have been working alongside one another for\nsince 2009 to improve tools for resilience. Just as important, members have built trust\namong themselves, been transparent with their actions, and coordinated with each other.\nThis has all been vital in preparing us to work together in the unprecedented and\nunpredictable landscape of the last 18 months.\n\n- 3 -\nEarly in the crisis, as the COVID event unfolded, the FSB provided a forum\nwhere members met regularly—some part of the FSB was meeting almost constantly in\nthe early weeks—to exchange information about the trajectory of the COVID event,\npolicy responses across member jurisdictions, and areas where the potential for spillovers\nneeded to be addressed. Navigating a crisis is no small feat. As we, collectively, moved\nthrough the experience, we did not have much opportunity to share details on how we\nworked together to forge a coherent path. In outlining the many steps we took together, I\nhope to provide an anatomy of coordination through crisis.\nGiven the openness of information sharing, FSB members were able to quickly\nidentify areas of concern that required action. We used real-time input to focus on four\ncritical nodes of the global financial system: financing of the real economy; access to\nU.S. dollar funding; meeting financial intermediaries’ liquidity demands; and monitoring\ncounterparty risks. This open communication and real-time monitoring improved\npolicymakers’ clarity around executing emergency measures to help stabilize domestic\neconomies. Additionally, this information sharing helped FSB members ensure\ncoordinated steps and minimize opportunities for harmful spillovers.\nThroughout the COVID event but especially in the spring of 2020, FSB members\nconvened every week—sometimes every day. Our staff in Basel regularly presented data\nfor members to consider and discuss, in addition to members sharing their own\njurisdiction-specific information and analysis. To provide deeper analysis for\npolicymakers, the FSB formed several expert groups to examine and assess specific\nissues as they unfolded. This coordination helped enable the swift and bold interventions\nthat maintained market functioning globally.\n\n- 4 -\nMany of the supervisors in the FSB’s membership provided banks with flexibility\nfor their capital and liquidity buffers and encouraged banks to work with borrowers on\nloan modifications. The FSB also supported the delay of non-critical work to reduce the\noperational burden on firms and authorities. Collectively, these steps sent a strong signal\nabout our resolve to lessen the economic fallout from the COVID event and helped\nprevent a disorderly sale of assets.\nThe supervisors and the regulators in the FSB membership also convened more\nfrequently to discuss market developments and to coordinate on the measures they were\ntaking. The FSB also cataloged the thousands of steps our members took to respond to\nthe COVID event so that a playbook of sorts is available for the future.\nGetting broad stakeholder input was also important to the FSB and to me\npersonally, particularly given the varied impact of the COVID event and divergent paths\nto recovery. The FSB consulted directly with private-sector stakeholders, gathering input\nfrom academics, financial-sector participants, and trade associations. This input remains\ncritical as we consider our path forward, including how to unwind emergency policy\nmeasures.\nMoving from Analysis to Action: Non-bank Financial Intermediation under the\nCOVID Lens\nA key lesson of the COVID event is that non-bank financial intermediation is a\ncritical area for action—especially short-term funding markets, where the money market\nfund sector has more than $8 trillion in assets under management globally. During\nnormal times, companies and retail investors treat shares in money market funds like\ncash—as fully fungible, riskless, and payable on-demand. But the funds’ promise of\n\n- 5 -\nliquidity and investors’ resulting expectations are not always well-aligned with the\nliquidity of the instruments in which money funds invest. This misalignment—or\n“liquidity transformation”—creates incentives for money market fund investors to\nredeem when market liquidity becomes scarce.\nAnd that’s exactly what happened during the COVID event. Runs on some types\nof money market funds in March of last year were similar in scale to the devastating runs\nin 2008 and again contributed to stress in systemically important short-term funding\nmarkets.\nEven before the COVID event, the FSB had assembled a senior group from\ncentral banks and market regulators to assess vulnerabilities in the non-bank sector and to\ncoordinate and drive forward any needed reform. We were fortunate to have had this\ngroup in place when the COVID event brought these vulnerabilities into sharp focus.\nThe FSB swiftly undertook a review of financial markets in March of 2020, which\nremains the most financially volatile and uncertain period of the COVID event. The\nFSB’s November 2020 report to the G20, titled Holistic Review of the March Market\nTurmoil, set the stage for an ambitious work program aimed at enhancing resilience in\nnon-bank financial intermediation.1\nOne of the first fruits of that program was published a week ago. Our report,\nPolicy Proposals to Enhance Money Market Fund Resilience, sets out a framework for\nassessing vulnerabilities in money market funds and a policy toolkit.2 Using the analysis\n1 Financial Stability Board, Holistic Review of the March Market Turmoil (Financial Stability Board, 2020),\nhttps://www.fsb.org/2020/11/holistic-review-of-the-march-market-turmoil/\n2 Financial Stability Board, Policy Proposals to Enhance Money Market Fund Resilience, (Financial\nStability Board, 2021), https://www.fsb.org/2021/10/policy-proposals-to-enhance-money-market-fund-\nresilience-final-report/\n\n- 6 -\nof vulnerabilities contained in this report, each member will take a close look at the\nspecific money fund vulnerabilities in its jurisdiction and will use the toolkit to address\nthose vulnerabilities.\nTo monitor for progress, the FSB, working with the International Organization of\nSecurities Commissioners, will review members’ progress in two years. In five years, the\nFSB will then do a more thorough assessment across our membership of the effectiveness\nof the measures in addressing risks to financial stability. The aim of this work is to\nenhance money market fund resilience and minimize the need for future extraordinary\ncentral bank interventions to support the sector.\nLessons from the COVID Event\nThe lessons learned from the COVID event were not confined to the non-bank\nsector. In fact, the FSB is publishing a series of reports covering a broad range of topics\nrelated to the COVID event, including our interim findings on the lessons learned. The\nfindings of that report, to be finalized later this month, will drive our future work agenda.\nLet me share a few of my own views on the key lessons learned.\nMy first takeaway is that the global financial system entered the latest crisis more\nresilient than the last. Although extraordinary support measures were still necessary to\nmitigate the impact of the COVID event, the implementation of the G20-endorsed\nreforms from the last crisis helped contribute to our shared resilience. Basel III, which\nhas led to a near doubling of capital ratios since 2011, positioned banks to better absorb\nthe macroeconomic shock. In addition, derivatives markets are safer with better\ntransparency, central clearing, and margin requirements.\n\n- 7 -\nMy second observation from the COVID event is the importance of policy\nflexibility for each of our jurisdictions. Of course, baseline consistency across standards\nis necessary. But indeed, one size rarely fits all. Our varied policy needs and tools make\ncoordination even more important to achieving common goals and results. The global\nregulatory framework, done right, is like a tightly woven piece of fabric. It can get pulled\nin different directions at the same time, and it won’t shred or unravel. In times of crisis,\nthe warp and woof of policy tools across the globe need to be woven tightly enough for\nthe fabric of our financial system to withstand the stress, but flexibly enough that it will\nnot tear. Uncoordinated regulation can create flaws: gaps, fragmentation, and arbitrage\nopportunities, which are the types of defects the FSB strives to prevent. But excessively\ngranular harmonization can create regulation that doesn’t jibe with the circumstances in a\nparticular jurisdiction. We try to ensure that our members are weaving a strong fabric in\nconcert.\nA third observation is that there are instances where policy may fail to have the\ndesired effect. I found banks’ apparent reluctance to use buffers an interesting lesson\nfrom the COVID event. Some evidence suggests that banks may have been hesitant to\nuse their regulatory capital buffers to meet credit demand (despite the stated intent from\nsupervisors that banks should use their buffers under stress). This may be due to\nuncertainty regarding potential future losses or the wider market stigma that may result if\na bank were to use its buffers. Perhaps the extensive fiscal and monetary support\nprovided to borrowers averted banks’ need to use buffers. Research into this reluctance\nwill be important so that we can improve our macro- and micro-prudential tools for the\nnext time we need them.\n\n- 8 -\nRenewed Focus on 2022 and Beyond\nAs “normal” slowly returns, the FSB is setting upon the daunting task of\nrefreshing its workplan. The FSB’s comparative advantage lies in convening\npolicymakers and experts to tackle cross-border and cross-sectoral threats to financial\nstability.\nNon-bank financial intermediation remains at the top of the FSB’s priority list\nbecause of the urgency to address vulnerabilities. Our policy proposals for enhancing\nmoney market fund resilience give jurisdictions a good start on assessing and addressing\nvulnerabilities in their jurisdictions. Other areas, such as short-term funding markets,\nopen-ended funds, and margin requirements, also require further assessment. The FSB is\nactively engaged in work in each of those areas.\nEven as we address the most acute vulnerabilities, the highly interconnected and\ninnovative nature of our global financial system requires constant vigilance to ensure\nstability. The FSB must learn more about those risks to financial stability that are less\nwell understood.\nOne of these areas is climate-related financial risk. Although there is a vast\namount of international work ongoing in this area, there remains much to learn about the\nclimate-related complexities outside the financial system as well as within it. In light of\nthe increasing amount of international work related to climate, the FSB has developed for\nthe G20 a roadmap to help guide global efforts to understand and address the financial\nrisks from climate change. Progress on the FSB’s climate roadmap will depend on the\ncollective efforts of the FSB, its membership of national authorities, and international\n\n- 9 -\norganizations. It sets out in one place the way forward on disclosures, data,\nvulnerabilities analysis, and regulatory and supervisory approaches.\nThe FSB is also closely watching cryptoassets and stablecoins. In the last 18\nmonths, cryptoassets’ market capitalization has grown from less than $200 billion to as\nmuch as $2.4 trillion. Stablecoins have increased from less than $10 billion in market\ncap to more than $130 billion. Almost exactly one year ago, in October 2020, the FSB\nreleased high-level recommendations for the regulation, supervision, and oversight of\nglobal stablecoin arrangements. Technology and innovation continue to advance rapidly.\nWe need to be mindful of whether our regulatory and supervisory approaches\nappropriately address risks while preserving the benefits that innovation can bring. As\nthese continue to develop, we continue to explore difficult questions. Are these digital\nassets currencies? Or securities? Deposits? They don’t fit neatly into our regulatory\nbuckets, and they operate in the digital ether where they can easily cross national borders.\nThe FSB issued a new report last week to highlight our own findings as we\nmonitor progress and seek to coordinate the regulation of global stablecoins. Digital\nassets may not be current threats to global financial stability. Yet as we’ve learned from\nsome forms of non-bank financial intermediation, those products, services, and\ninstitutions that fall between the regulatory cracks one day can become systemic\nproblems the next. The goal of our work is to guard against new risks that emerge from\ninnovation without stifling this same innovation.\nIndeed, the global financial system’s reliance on information technology remains\na known risk, but one that has been well managed during the crisis. Technology has\nallowed us to coordinate and communicate more effectively throughout the COVID\n\n- 10 -\nevent. Virtual calls have quickly replaced in-person meetings. It may seem like second\nnature now, but we only dreamed of having this ability 20 years ago. While these\nadvances bring us great benefits, financial authorities must remain highly vigilant to the\never-present risk of cyber-attacks on our financial system.\nAs we remain vigilant to these known risks and vulnerabilities, the FSB last\nmonth rolled out a new forward-looking surveillance framework for monitoring and\nassessing vulnerabilities. The surveillance framework reflects the learning of the past\ndecade and prepares us to face the challenges of an ever-evolving financial landscape.\nWhen the FSB was founded in the wake of the global financial crisis, the “science” of\nfinancial stability was still nascent. Now, more than a decade later, we have furthered\nour understanding of how financial crises result from shocks that act on existing\nvulnerabilities.\nThis new framework will better account for resilience, our capacity to absorb\nshocks, in order to better appraise net vulnerabilities and identify gaps. It will also\nsystematically scan the financial landscape to better capture new and emerging\nvulnerabilities and emphasize those that may prompt cross-border spillovers. The\nindicators will be dynamic and will include asset prices and asset quality, funding,\nliquidity, leverage, complexity, cross-border linkages, and operational considerations.\nThe framework also incorporates monitoring of the balance sheets of non-financial\nsectors like households, corporates, and sovereigns.\nAlong with these indicators, the new framework will obtain input for assessing\nvulnerabilities from qualitative surveys, working groups, and private sector workshops.\nIt will preserve flexibility and recognize our members’ inherent differences. I see the\n\n- 11 -\nnew surveillance framework as an important communication and framing device within\nthe FSB, with the G20, and with the public. Unforeseeable and exogenous shocks, like\nCOVID-19, will require us all to be resilient, vigilant, and agile. The FSB welcomes\npublic comment and discussion regarding the new framework, and I expect it to be a\nuseful construct for years to come.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the COVID event was the first great test of the FSB, and I think we\ndid the job we were born to do. I want to thank the many of you here today who are\nresearching these issues, sharing your findings at conferences like this one, and enriching\nthe work of the FSB.\nFor our part, the FSB will continue convening G20 policymakers and experts to\nassess vulnerabilities, coordinate policy responses, and evaluate effectiveness. In doing\nso, we will always strive to consult with a wide variety of stakeholders to help us respond\nto the most pressing financial vulnerabilities of our time. Continued collaboration and\ncooperation among financial sectors, regulators, governments, academia, and\ninternational organizations will be one of our greatest advantages as we prepare for the\nnext crisis.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:00 a.m. EDT\nJuly 19, 2018\nIntroductory Remarks\n(via prerecorded video)\nby\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nAt the\nAlternative Reference Rates Committee Roundtable\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, New York\nJuly 19, 2018\n\nGood morning. I am sorry that I cannot be with you in person for this third roundtable\nhosted by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), but I wanted to tape these\nremarks to make clear the Federal Reserve’s full commitment to mitigating the risk to financial\nstability should a key reference rate cease to be available. We support the ARRC and its work.\nAnd support for the ARRC is not limited to the Federal Reserve System: the Bureau of\nConsumer Financial Protection, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency, Office of Financial Research, Securities and Exchange Commission, and U.S.\nTreasury Department are all ex officio members of the ARRC.\nSince many have only recently begun to pay more attention to these issues, let me remind\nyou of our reasons for convening the ARRC four years ago. The Federal Reserve began its role\nin co-chairing the Financial Stability Board’s working group on interest rate benchmarks and\njoined in international efforts to strengthen LIBOR following reports that employees at several\nbanks sought to manipulate these rates. We have served on the ICE Benchmark\nAdministration’s (IBA’s) LIBOR Oversight Committee as an observer and actively worked with\nIBA in developing the reforms set out in IBA’s Roadmap for LIBOR. Thanks in part to this, and\nthanks much more to the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA’s) efforts as the regulator of\nLIBOR, the safeguards against that type of manipulation happening again have been greatly and\nappropriately tightened.\nBut as part of this process, we also examined data that we had begun to collect on the\nmarkets that underlie LIBOR and found that those markets had become extraordinarily thin. On\nmost days, the banks that submit to LIBOR have been forced to rely on their own judgement and\n\n- 2 -\nmodels in submitting to LIBOR rather than actual transactions. Many of them have become\njustifiably uncomfortable with a system that pins hundreds of trillions of dollars’ worth of\nfinancial contracts to that type of judgement call.\nPeople may have some general sense of this, but because IBA does not release data on\nthe transactions that actually underlie LIBOR, many may not be aware of how truly thin these\nmarkets have become. At the last roundtable, Jay Powell showed data on the volume of\nborrowing in wholesale unsecured U.S. dollar markets. That chart can be found in the ARRC’s\nSecond Report, which estimated that on a typical day the volume of three-month funding\ntransactions was about $500 million. On many days there is much less. By way of comparison,\nwe estimate that there are roughly $200 trillion of financial securities referencing U.S. dollar\nLIBOR.\nTo help provide some further transparency, I will show data that we have on the number\nof transactions involved. These data are based on the information available to the Federal\nReserve, which is fairly comprehensive but still may differ in some respects from that available\nto IBA, so I should caution that this is merely an informed estimate of the number of transactions\nunderlying U.S. dollar LIBOR and may not be exact. As you can see in the slide, there are a few\nmore transactions at the shorter LIBOR maturities. On average, we observe six or seven\ntransactions per day at market rates that could underpin one- and three-month LIBOR across all\nof the panel banks. The longer maturities have even fewer transactions. There are two to three\ntransactions each day for six-month LIBOR. On average, there is only one transaction that we\nsee underlying one-year LIBOR, and many days there are no transactions at all.\n\n- 3 -\nThe secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) has only been in existence three months,\nand SOFR futures have only been trading for two months, but on a daily basis there are already\nmore transactions underlying them than there are underpinning LIBOR. And SOFR itself\nreflects over $700 billion in overnight repurchase agreement (repo) transactions every day. One\nof the many benefits of using a rate so firmly anchored in a market of this depth is that no one\ncan question whether SOFR is representative. It clearly is.\nWith LIBOR reliant on expert judgment rather than direct transactions, many banks\nincreasingly uncomfortable providing that judgment, and the official sector unable to compel\nthem to do so indefinitely, it was obvious to us that this structure—which bases so many trillions\nof financial instruments on such a small number of underlying transactions—was potentially\nunstable. It was clear that the market needed to develop alternatives in case the worst happened,\nand this was the reason that we convened the ARRC four years ago.\nWe asked the ARRC to identify a robust alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR and to develop\na plan to promote its use. Sandie O’Connor will speak shortly about the ARRC’s work, but I\nwant to emphasize that this has been a model of cooperative effort between the private sector and\nthe public sector. When the ARRC started, the interest rate benchmarks that they would\neventually narrow their choice down to did not even exist. Those rates have not been easy to\ncreate, and as the ARRC expressed interest in a Treasury repo rate benchmark that would span\nthe widest possible scope of the market, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York put great effort\nin working with the Federal Reserve Board and Office of Financial Research to create SOFR.\nThe result, the rate the ARRC has chosen, reflects the largest and deepest rates market in the\nworld and is a huge accomplishment for all of us.\n\n- 4 -\nThat accomplishment is only the start of what will be many. As I noted, just three\nmonths after SOFR has begun production, we have already seen the introduction of futures\nmarkets on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. LCH has now begun to offer clearing of SOFR\novernight index and basis swaps, and CME Group will begin to do so within a few months.\nThese are steps that the private sector must lead, and they have, but it is important that the public\nsector encourage the development of SOFR markets where it can. The ARRC has issued a first\nletter to U.S. regulators asking us to consider exemptions for legacy swaps seeking to incorporate\nthe International Swaps and Derivatives Association’s protocol or exemptions for amending to\nmove from LIBOR to SOFR, and these are issues that we should look at seriously; we should\navoid placing unintended hurdles in the way of those who may seek to transition from LIBOR.\nHere is something you don’t hear often in the context of any large, complex undertaking\ninvolving input from a large number of stakeholders: The effort to implement SOFR is ahead of\nschedule. The ARRC has recognized that we have to make transitioning to SOFR as easy as it\ncan be. That is the reason that it has added the creation of a forward-looking term rate as the\nfinal step in its Paced Transition Plan. As the ARRC has noted and the Financial Stability Board\nhas now reiterated, this kind of forward-looking term rate will be useful in facilitating a\ntransition away from LIBOR in some cash markets, such as corporate loans, but it is not\nprimarily intended for use in derivatives markets. In fact, we have to encourage use of SOFR in\nderivatives markets to the fullest extent possible if a robust forward-looking term rate is to be\ncreated.\nFor that reason, we also have to find ways to encourage uses of SOFR in those cash\nmarkets where it is appropriate. The European Investment Bank’s recent announcement that it\n\n- 5 -\nwould issue a floating rate note paying a compound average of Sterling Overnight Index Average\n(SONIA) shows that this can be done.1 In the spirit of encouraging this type of use of SOFR, I\nthink it is appropriate for the Federal Reserve to consider publishing a compound average of\nSOFR that market participants could then use. It has been suggested that we could call it SAFR,\nfor secured average financing rate, and this is something that we are encouraging our staff to\nexplore. Publishing a compound average rate that encourages broader use of SOFR would help\nmake our financial system more resilient. Sandie will talk more about the creation of the\nforward-looking term version of SOFR in her remarks. SAFR would not be a competitor to this\nforward-looking rate, it would be in alliance with it. If there were a large volume of products\nreferencing the compound average rate, there would likely be related demand for futures\ncontracts to hedge those positions, helping to make the forward rate more robust.\nIt is important that we find ways to make it as easy as possible to use SOFR because the\nrisks to LIBOR are, at this stage, quite considerable. Even as the ARRC and similar currency\ngroups in other jurisdictions were being formed, the FCA was exerting considerable effort to\nconvince banks to continue submitting to LIBOR. We have to be aware that two banks left the\nU.S. dollar panels despite this encouragement, and that the agreement that the FCA reached with\nthe remaining banks to continue submitting voluntarily through the end of 2021 now has just\nthree-and-a-half years left. And as Andrew Bailey noted last week, there is also the prospect that\nLIBOR could be judged to be nonrepresentative under the European Union’s Benchmark\nRegulations, which would severely curtail the liquidity of products referencing LIBOR.\n1 See the European Investment Bank’s announcement at www.eib.org/investor_relations/press/2018/fi-2018-12-\nEIB%20issues%20markets%20first%20SONIA%20GBP%20benchmark%20with%20GBP%201bn%205y%20issua\nnce.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nApart from the questions as to whether LIBOR will continue or whether IBA or the FCA\nmay judge that it is not representative, market participants should consider whether a rate with so\nfew transactions underlying it is really their best option. Do we really need or want to use other\ntenors of LIBOR in municipal or financial floating-rate notes? For some, the answer to this may\nstill be yes, but it is then imperative that they work to incorporate safer fallback language into\ntheir contracts as quickly as they can. This is something that the ARRC has been working on\nintensively this year and much of today’s roundtable will discuss. But for others, the safest thing\nyou can do would be to move away from using LIBOR. Regardless of your answer to this\nquestion, we all have a stake in the ARRC’s work, both in promoting SOFR and in promoting\nbetter contract language. I want to thank you all for coming to this roundtable, and want to thank\nSandie and the ARRC for all the work that has made it possible.\n\nMedian daily number of unsecured wholesale borrowing\ntransactions observed for U.S. dollar LIBOR panel banks\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n2017-Q1 2017-Q2 2017-Q3 2017-Q4 2018-Q1 2018-Q2\n1-month LIBOR 3-month LIBOR 6-month LIBOR 1-year LIBOR\nNote: Chart key describes bars in order from left to right for each quarter.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:00 p.m. EDT\nJune 19, 2020\nThe Adaptability of Stress Testing\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nWomen in Housing and Finance\nWashington, D.C.\nJune 19, 2020\n\nThank you for the opportunity to again address this group, which has played such\nan important role encouraging diversity, and a diversity of perspectives, in housing and\nfinance. I gave my first speech to Women in Housing and Finance almost 30 years ago.\nYou’ve been kind enough to invite me back in each of my tours of duty in public service\nsince then, and throughout that time you have been an exemplar of the adage that\ndiversity is the art of thinking independently together.\nToday, I’d like to talk to you about how banking regulation and supervision is\nadjusting to the unprecedented economic challenges posed by the coronavirus outbreak\nand especially the containment measures taken in response, which together we call the\n“COVID event.” In particular, I will discuss how the COVID event is affecting a\ncornerstone of the Federal Reserve’s oversight of large banks—our periodic stress tests,\nwhich verify that banks are prepared to deal with severe economic and financial\nconditions. Although our stress tests were not designed to test specifically against the\neffects of the COVID event on the economy and on our banks, they were designed to be\nflexible. I will describe modifications we’ve made to the stress test process this year,\nincluding expansions in stress testing appropriate to the unique circumstances we face,\nand preview our approach to the results the Fed will release next week.\nLet me start with some more general background on stress tests, among other\nsteps the Federal Reserve Board has taken since the 2007-2009 financial crisis to\nstrengthen the financial system and increase its resiliency. Since the financial crisis, we\nhave mandated a substantial increase in the quantity and quality of capital in the banking\nsystem, including specially targeted higher capital requirements for the largest banks\ncritical to overall financial stability. Capital provides a cushion to ensure that banks are\n\n- 2 -\nprepared to face financial stress and other unexpected circumstances. Our requirements\ninclude capital buffers that are designed to be drawn down in periods of stress, in addition\nto minimum capital requirements. We have also established periodic stress tests to\nexamine how banks would respond to hypothetical adverse financial and economic\nconditions.\nThe Fed took these steps so that, during a crisis, banks would be in a position of\nstrength and would not be forced to curtail lending to preserve capital, which would only\nworsen the crisis. In early March, in a move unrelated to the COVID event, the Board\nsimplified its capital rules by finalizing a stress capital buffer requirement. This new\nframework uses our stress tests to set capital requirements for large banks and has the\nsame goal as the previous framework: using forward-looking analysis to help ensure that\nbanks have sufficient capital to survive a severe recession while still being able to lend to\nhouseholds and businesses.1\nThis year, as every year, the stress test began in February with the publication of a\nhypothetical scenario. This scenario, however, predated the serious economic effects of\nthe COVID event, which began in March. This timing presented challenges and\ndemanded changes to our usual process, and we responded with an approach that required\nmore extensive analysis than normal. We simply would not have been doing our jobs if\nwe had just run the test using a scenario framed before the economy began to deteriorate\nin March.\n1 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report\n(Washington: Board of Governors, May 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/202005-supervision-and-regulation-\nreport.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nOne reason for changing course hearkens back to the first stress test in 2009, the\nSupervisory Capital Assessment Program, or SCAP. Like this year’s test, SCAP was\nconducted in the midst of a crisis. One goal was to provide information, transparency\nand market discipline. But another goal was to restore and maintain public confidence in\nthe financial system. In that sense, ever since then stress testing has acted to stabilize and\nstrengthen the financial system, and it is this ongoing benefit that would be put at risk if\nwe failed to alter our approach to make it relevant to the unique circumstances we face.\nWhile the first test likewise was conducted during a crisis, the current situation is\nunlike what we have faced in subsequent stress tests. In normal circumstances, we can\ntake our time to carefully examine data and make a deliberate judgement about the capital\nplanning of banks. This time, we have had to act much more quickly to be timely and\nrelevant. That necessarily means a different approach.\nWe didn’t have the time or the comprehensive data to run a complete and updated\nCOVID event stress test. Normally, we publish our scenarios, which serve as the\nhypothetical basis for the test, two months before the start of the process, and we take two\nmonths to run the test. We use data that banks submit around six weeks after the end of\neach quarter, so the test we run beginning in April normally uses data submitted in\nFebruary and March reflecting bank balance sheets as of December. We also normally\nask banks to complete their own stress tests using our scenarios before we begin our\nstress test.\nAnother consideration was preserving the forward-looking benefits of stress tests.\nAs we weighed how to proceed on this year’s stress testing process, it was clear that the\n\n- 4 -\nstarting point was a lot less important than the considerable uncertainty we continue to\nface about the course of the COVID event and thus the path of the recovery.\nFor that reason, we decided to stick with the February 2020 severely adverse\nscenario as the starting point for a different approach. We are calling this forward-\nlooking approach a sensitivity analysis, and now I’ll try to explain how that differs from a\nfocus on just one severely adverse scenario.\nBased on past experience and our standing policies, our February scenario\nassumed stress in corporate debt and real estate markets, among other details, and an\nincrease in unemployment considerably larger than occurred in the Great Recession.\nCompared to what we are now experiencing, this scenario was less severe than the\nunprecedented drop in employment and output in the second quarter of 2020 but more\nsevere than the extent of stress we’re seeing in debt markets. It also didn’t include the\nunprecedented extent of fiscal stimulus.\nBut the larger issue is the unprecedented uncertainty about the course of the\nCOVID event and the economy. The range of plausible forecasts is high and continues to\nshift. We don’t know about the pace of reopening, how consumers will behave, or the\nprospects for a new round of containment. There’s probably never been more uncertainty\nabout the economic outlook. Although our policies on stress testing emphasize the value\nof not increasing capital requirements under stress and thus exacerbating a downturn, our\nfirst priority must be—and is—to understand the implications of quite plausible downside\nscenarios from our current position for bank capital.\nIn light of that uncertainty, our sensitivity analysis considers three distinct\ndownside risk paths for the economy:\n\n- 5 -\n• first, a rapid V-shaped recovery that regains much of the output and employment\nlost by the end of this year;\n• second, a slower, more U-shaped recovery in which only a small share of lost\noutput and employment is regained in 2020;\n• and third, a W-shaped double dip recession with a short-lived recovery followed\nby a severe drop in activity later this year due to a second wave of containment\nmeasures.\nLet me emphasize that these are not forecasts by the Fed or me, only plausible\nscenarios that span the range of where many private forecasters think the economy could\nbe headed.\nWhile using the same models as our regular stress tests, our sensitivity analysis is\ndifferent from our normal use of a severely adverse scenario in several ways. First, there\nare three possible paths instead of one because we must consider this range of outcomes.\nWhile we retained the basic structure of the February 2020 scenario, we swapped out a\nfew key variables such as the unemployment rate, change in economic output, and\nTreasury bill rates. We also didn’t follow our scenario design policy statement in\nformulating these three alternative paths. We chose rough approximations of economic\npaths rather than detailed scenarios, which means that the usual set of detailed variable\ndata that we use will not be available. Finally, the analysis is still based on year-end\n2019 data but with targeted adjustments to account for the most material changes to\nbanks’ balance sheets in the first quarter related to the COVID event, such as sizeable\ncredit-line drawdowns by corporations.\n\n- 6 -\nGiven the changing economic circumstances and the need to act quickly, we\ndidn’t publish these three economic paths in advance and ask banks to model their\nexposures to them. The targeted adjustments to banks’ balance sheets include the\nsubstantial growth in corporate loan balances and stress on borrowers in certain industry\nsectors that are most exposed to a sharp drop in demand.\nAlthough we didn’t run our full stress test on these three possible downside risk\npaths for the economy, and while our adjustments only capture the most material changes\nin balance sheets since last year, this sensitivity analysis has helped sharpen our\nunderstanding of how banks may fare in the wide range of possible outcomes. We think\nit makes the most sense to share with the public some of what we have learned when we\npublish the results of our stress testing process on Thursday of next week.\nLet me lay out what that announcement will entail. First, as a point of reference,\nwe will disclose stress test results using the February 2020 scenario, run against bank\nexposures as of December 2019. As in past years, this will include both firm-specific and\naggregate results. To be more precise, this portion of our disclosure, based on the results\nof the February 2020 scenario, will be identical in all material ways to last year’s stress\ntest disclosure. This approach provides continuity and comparability with past stress\ntests. For the sensitivity analysis, we will provide key details about the three downside\nrisk paths for the economy and targeted adjustments. We will also provide results\naggregated across banks that will compare how the banking system as a whole would fare\nunder the three distinct views of the future.\nBecause of the limitations I described in examining the three downside risk paths\nfor the economy, our disclosure of the sensitivity analysis will not provide firm-specific\n\n- 7 -\nresults. This adapted stress test, based on December 2019 exposures, will still give\ndetailed information about the vulnerabilities of firms to the range of stresses that may\nplay out.\nAs a next step, we plan to move ahead and provide all banks subject to stress\ntesting with a stress capital buffer requirement based on the February 2020 scenario,\nunder our new approach integrating stress testing with capital requirements. Our new\nframework for establishing capital requirements was calibrated based on the assumption\nthat we would set these requirements using a full stress test based on published scenarios.\nIndeed, the overall severity of the February scenario and our V-shaped sensitivity\nanalysis are roughly the same. And, as I noted earlier, we kept in mind the principle that\nif possible we should avoid measures that tighten minimum capital levels during a crisis,\nto avoid intensifying that crisis. Should our assessment of the COVID event’s likely\nevolution change, of course, we will act expeditiously to resize the buffer or take other\nappropriate actions.\nLet me take a minute to explain how and when we will disclose those stress\ncapital buffer requirements. In prior years, the results from Dodd-Frank Act stress tests\nand the related Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review were released over a two-\nweek period. But in a change, we will be releasing the results from both exercises at the\nsame time. We are able to do this because the new capital framework uses the results of\nthe stress tests to establish the size of banks’ stress capital buffers, which they can draw\ndown in times of stress, and allows the banks to adjust their capital plans after receiving\nthose results.\n\n- 8 -\nBy giving the firms their effective capital buffer requirement for the coming year\nand allowing them to adjust their capital plans to that buffer, the change will result in a\nmore thoughtful assessment of risks. Once the banks have determined their final capital\nplans, the Board will publicly release the final capital requirements for each individual\nfirm later this year, before they take effect in the fourth quarter, as planned.2\nIn addition, given the special circumstances this year we will use the results of our\nsensitivity analysis to inform our overall stance on capital distributions and in ongoing\nbank supervision. The sensitivity analysis will help us judge whether banks would have\nenough capital if economic and financial conditions were to worsen.\nAs I have noted, our largest banks entered the COVID event in a position of\nstrength, with high levels of capital and liquidity, and they have demonstrated that\nstrength in the support they have provided to the economy during a crisis. In addition, I\nwill note that almost all of our large banks have suspended share repurchases for the\nsecond quarter. In light of the ongoing economic uncertainty, I consider this move for\nthe second quarter a prudent step as a very substantial capital conservation measure.\nBefore the COVID event over 70 percent of the capital distributions of global\nsystemically important banks, for example, came in form of share repurchases, which\n2 Some banks may determine that they are required, for purposes of compliance with the\nsecurities laws, to publicly disclose their stress capital buffer requirement before the\nBoard publicly releases this information later in the year. In order to give all banks\nsubject to this year’s exercise sufficient time to understand their stress test results and\nmake any necessary changes to their capital plans, we expect banks to wait until after\nU.S. markets close on June 29, 2020, to publicly disclose any information about their\nplanned capital actions and stress capital buffer requirements. Doing so will provide for\na more orderly dissemination of information to the public.\n\n- 9 -\nceased in March. The sensitivity analysis will help the Board assess whether additional\nmeasures are advisable for certain banks or certain future developments.\nLet me conclude by reiterating that stress tests remain a valuable tool, even in this\ntime of extreme uncertainty. Our use of the sensitivity analysis is an acknowledgement\nthat the path ahead is unusually uncertain, but that the work of verifying the resiliency of\nbanks must continue, to aid the recovery by bolstering public confidence in the financial\nsystem. The new stress capital buffer framework will likewise aid capital planning and\nrisk management by banks, leaving them better prepared to maintain lending to\nhouseholds and businesses. We will closely monitor the condition of these banks and the\nbroader financial system in the coming months, including through additional COVID-\nrelated analysis. We will not hesitate to take additional policy actions should they be\nwarranted under the then-prevailing economic conditions.\nThank you, and I am happy to respond to your questions.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n12:15 p.m. EDT\nOctober 18, 2018\nDon’t Chase the Needles:\nAn Optimistic Assessment of the Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nEconomic Club of New York Luncheon\nNew York, New York\nOctober 18, 2018\n\nThank you for having me.1 I very much appreciate the opportunity to speak to\nthis distinguished group and look forward to my discussion with Greg Ip. Now almost\nexactly a year into my appointment as Vice Chairman for Supervision, I have, as might\nbe expected, spoken publicly most often about banking and the financial system more\ngenerally. However, supervision and regulation are not all that I do at the Federal\nReserve, and I welcome this opportunity to speak to another part of my day job, as a\nmember of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Today I would like to offer\nmy take on the economic outlook, which is optimistic, and explain how I view my\noptimism as consistent with the continued gradual pace of policy tightening that many\nCommittee participants have projected. In particular, I will explain how my views on\npotential growth help shape my outlook, both for the economy and for the appropriate\npath of monetary policy. Relatedly, I will discuss the uncertainties that arise when a\ncentral element of the outlook--in this case, the potential capacity of the economy--is\nunknown and largely unobservable. Such uncertainty can complicate policymaking in\neven what appears to be a very healthy economy, providing a further argument for\ngradualism.\nWhere We Are Now\nIn previous remarks on the economic outlook, delivered at a National Association\nfor Business Economics conference in February, I characterized the U.S. economy as\nbeing in a “good spot” and asked if the economy had reached a positive turning point\n1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System.\n\n- 2 -\nfollowing an extended period of post-crisis slow growth. I argued that while it might be\ntoo soon to call a turning point, there was a definite possibility of an upside surprise.2\nSo now that we are fairly deep into 2018, where do we stand overall? My view\nhas not changed all that much from February. While many other forecasters had to revise\nup their forecasts over the course of the year, my own outlook is basically unchanged,\nbecause the economy is evolving essentially as I expected at the outset of the year. The\neconomy remains in a good spot. Gross domestic product increased a robust\n3-1/4 percent in the first half of the year, and indicators suggest continued strong growth\nthrough the summer. Economic conditions are as close to meeting the Federal Reserve’s\ndual mandate for monetary policy--maximum sustainable employment and price\nstability--as they have been in a long time. Inflation is in line with the Committee’s\n2 percent objective, and the unemployment rate is at nearly a 50-year low.\nHow long can this strong growth be sustained? The answer depends largely on\nwhat form growth takes. Growth that is supported by increases in the productive capacity\nof the economy should be durable. However, if growth primarily reflects strong demand\nthat stretches production beyond its sustainable capacity, the economy will run into\nconstraints that will result in slower growth, higher prices, or a potentially destabilizing\nbuildup of financial imbalances. So, which is it? Unfortunately, it is very difficult to tell.\nI will return to that question shortly.\nThat said, I see many reasons to be optimistic about the growth of the potential\ncapacity of the economy over the next few years. In part, my optimism is rooted in the\n2 See Randal K. Quarles (2018), “An Assessment of the U.S. Economy,” speech delivered at “Promoting\nSustained Growth: Policy Tensions and Risks,” 34th Annual NABE Economic Policy Conference,\nWashington, February 26, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/quarles20180226a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nview that many of the factors that have been weighing on potential growth since the\nfinancial crisis could be lifting. So, have we reached the turning point? While I believe\nthe issue remains unresolved, the recent evidence is encouraging.\nHave We Reached a Turning Point?\nWhy am I optimistic about the economy’s supply potential? The growth of\npotential can, at the most basic level, be broken down into two factors: the supply of\nlabor and the productivity of that labor. Productivity, in turn, is importantly affected by\nchanges in the stock of capital--that is, machines and factories--as well as technological\nadvances and improved production methods. I see reasons to be hopeful about both\nfactors.\nLet us start with labor. For some time, the contribution of the labor force to\npotential growth has been held down by the predictable drag of baby boomers moving\ninto retirement. However, the decline in labor force participation following the financial\ncrisis exceeded even what might be expected given this long-standing downward trend--\nin particular, as the participation of prime-age workers (those between the ages of 25 and\n54) fell and teenagers exited the workforce in droves. The reasons behind the fall in\nparticipation among non-retirement-age workers have been the subject of much debate.\nHowever, I see little reason to assume that it will be permanent, and we have already seen\nsome signs of a turnaround. Thus, I think there is some potential for labor force\nparticipation to move up, perhaps as workers respond to the incentives of plentiful job\nopportunities and higher wages, thereby adding to the productive capacity of the\neconomy and pushing back the constraints on growth.\n\n- 4 -\nSome recent labor force trends have been promising. For example, the two-\ndecade-long trend increase in the population not in the labor force on account of\ndisability peaked in 2014 and has started to move down quite rapidly--again, for reasons\nthat defy easy explanation but may reflect the general improvement in labor market\nopportunities.3\nI will now turn to productivity. Labor productivity has averaged an annual\ngrowth rate of only 3/4 percent since 2011, far below the 2-1/4 percent pace that\nprevailed in the two decades before the financial crisis. Although there are competing\ntheories, the productivity decline is not well understood, and a consensus explanation has\nyet to emerge. As such, the slowdown could reverse unpredictably as well. The most\nrecent data have been moving in the right direction, but only haltingly, with labor\nproductivity increasing about 1-1/4 percent over the past year.\nThere are reasons that productivity growth could shake off some of its recent\ntorpidity. I would like to start with the capital stock. After a few years of abysmal\nbusiness-sector investment spending, it appears as though the drought has broken. After\npicking up in 2017, business fixed investment climbed a robust 10 percent at an annual\nrate in the first half of this year, likely supported by lower corporate tax rates and other\nincentives in last year’s tax bill. Also, indicators for investment, including orders and\nshipments of nondefense capital goods, point toward continued strength, and survey\nevidence points to high business optimism and solid capital expenditure plans. More\ncapital should allow labor to be more productive.\n3 See Ernie Tedeschi (2018), “Will Employment Keep Growing? Disabled Workers Offer a Clue,” New\nYork Times, March 15.\n\n- 5 -\nI am also a bit of a techno-enthusiast. We are in the early stages of a more\nwidespread application of a wave of new technologies, such as 5G communications, AI\n(artificial intelligence) and machine learning, and 3-D printing. It might be that the\nproductivity gains associated with these and other new technologies are embodied in new\ncapital equipment and will only now start to become apparent as the investment drought\nof recent years comes to an end. A tighter economy could also create incentives for firms\nto revamp their production methods to save on scarce labor resources.\nTo summarize, the economy has been doing very well. Whether this performance\nis sustained will be importantly determined by whether growth is supported by increases\nin the economy’s potential. I am hopeful that potential growth, and particularly\nproductivity, could accelerate from its relatively anemic pace of late, sustaining growth\nwithout overheating the economy. The more the economy’s potential growth increases,\nthe more gradual we can be in our removal of monetary policy accommodation. Thus, an\nassessment of the pace of potential growth will be an important input into what I view as\nthe appropriate path of policy to achieve our objectives of maximum sustainable\nemployment and price stability.\nThe Difficulty in Identifying Potential\nThe tricky thing, as I pointed out earlier, is that potential output is unobserved and\ncan only be inferred from the behavior of other measured economic indicators.\nTraditionally, as taught in Econ 101, inflation provides a signal on whether the economy\nis operating above or below its potential level. If inflation moves up in a sustained\nmanner, not just because of temporary shocks, then the economy is likely operating\nabove its productive capacity, as firms have the leeway to raise prices given the strength\n\n- 6 -\nof demand. Likewise, if inflation moves down persistently, then the economy is likely\noperating with some slack, as firms restrain prices to sell their products in the face of\nweak demand.\nIf inflation is the primary indicator of the economy’s position relative to potential,\nhow confident can we be in the quality of the signal? It has been noted--quite frequently,\nI might add--that the relationship between inflation and the tightness of the economy has\ngotten weaker, which is to say that inflation appears to be less affected by movements in\neconomic slack or tightness, traditionally measured by the unemployment rate, than in the\npast. As the role of slack in explaining inflation has diminished, inflation expectations\nhave assumed greater importance. However, it is reasonable to ask, if inflation is, in fact,\nnow largely a reflection of inflation expectations, is inflation still a good indicator of the\ncyclical state of the economy? Or, more directly, can we count on inflation to warn us in\ntime if the economy is overheating?\nTo be a little controversial, perhaps what we are witnessing with inflation is an\napplication of what has been called Goodhart’s law, named after Charles Goodhart, the\ndistinguished scholar of central banking at the London School of Economics.4 The law\ncan be summarized as the idea that if an indicator becomes a target of policy, that\nindicator loses its value as a gauge of the state of the economy. Rather, the indicator\nbecomes a signal of the public’s belief in the competence and commitment of the\ngovernment agency that is targeting the indicator.\n4 For the original formulation of the law, see C.A.E. Goodhart (1975), “Problems of Monetary\nManagement: The U.K. Experience,” in Papers in Monetary Economics, vol. I (Sydney: Reserve Bank of\nAustralia).\n\n- 7 -\nSomething along these lines could be happening to inflation, especially given the\nimportant role of expected inflation in the behavior of actual inflation. Perhaps inflation\nis just sending a signal of people’s trust in the Fed’s ability to meet its inflation objective.\nIf so, no complaints here. That is a good thing. However, a problem does arise if the Fed\nremains reliant on inflation as our only gauge of the economy’s position relative to its\npotential. There are risks in pushing the economy into a place it does not want to go if\nwe limit ourselves to navigating by what might be a faulty indicator. Anchored inflation\nexpectations might mask the inflation signal coming from an overheated economy for a\nperiod, but I have no doubt that prices would eventually move up in response to resource\nconstraints. The ultimate price, from the perspective of the dual mandate, would be an\nunanchoring of inflation expectations.\nOf course, I view this more as a risk than my baseline expectation. As I have\nsaid, I am optimistic about potential growth, and I expect that even relatively strong\ngrowth can be met without running into economic constraints. However, I also think that\nwe should pay attention to other indicators of tightness and overheating in addition to\ninflation. There are other signs of potential besides inflation, including, but not limited\nto, direct measures of labor utilization or indications of shortages and bottlenecks in\nproduction.\nPolicy Considerations\nHow should these thoughts affect monetary policy? I began my remarks by\nnoting that there may be reason to think that the productive capacity of our economy\ncould be accelerating, which would allow a more gradual withdrawal of accommodation\nwithout overheating. But I have noted as well that there may be reason to think that\n\n- 8 -\nresource constraints could be more binding than current inflation measures would\ntraditionally indicate, which would call for a more athletic response. Moreover, there is\ntoday a higher degree of uncertainty about many of these factors--measures of labor\nslack, the relation between labor slack and inflation, the sensitivity of current inflation\nmeasures to actual resource constraints, and the future growth of productivity, to name a\nfew--than there has been for many years. In such an environment, some have argued that\nthis greater uncertainty leaves policymakers without a clear guide and market participants\nwithout a firm anchor, meaning policy itself could drift--perhaps dangerously.\nI do not think that is the case at all. Instead, I think this situation reinforces and\nsupports the importance of a clear, steady strategy and a gradual, predictable approach to\nthe removal of accommodation as we continue to monitor the data. The analogy I\nfrequently use is the old pilot’s adage of “Don’t chase the needles.” The control panel of\nany airplane has an instrument to guide your course: a circular gauge with a vertical bar,\nor “needle,” running through the center of it. If the bar moves sideways to the left, you\nare drifting off course and should change course to the left until the bar comes back into\nthe center of the circle; if it moves to the right, you change course to the right. Today\nthese instruments get their inputs from the plane’s GPS (Global Positioning System) and\nare fairly sensitive and accurate, but decades ago, when I was a young man first learning\nto fly in the clouds, they got their information from radio beacons stationed on the ground\nand were quite squirrelly. The bar could wander from side to side for a while for any of a\nnumber of reasons--distance from the beacon, the angle you were approaching it from,\ninterference from other instruments on the panel, sunspots, or rain--and because of this\nuncertainty, the first rule taught to us as young pilots was, “Don’t chase the needles.”\n\n- 9 -\nPrecisely because of the uncertainty around the course inputs, the right strategy\nwas to set a course based on your knowledge of the destination, winds, and performance\nof your plane; communicate that course clearly to air traffic control so everyone knew\nwhat you were doing; and then stick to that course steadily even as the course needle\nmight waver from side to side across your instrument. If the needle moved to one side\nsubstantially and stayed there pretty consistently, then you would make a small, firm\ncorrection--but even then, only gradually and with clear communication about what you\nwere doing. In a world where you had great confidence in the sensitivity of your\ninstrument, such as in today’s GPS-based avionics, you could respond immediately to\nmoment-to-moment changes in your course readings, but in the world of radio beacons\nand sunspots, “chasing the needles” would at best lead to inefficient fishtailing across the\nsky, and at worst to a substantial deviation from your destination.\nToday uncertainty around many of the macroeconomic inputs to monetary policy\ndecisions argues for just the same approach to navigation. Rather than meaning that\npolicy will drift because of this uncertainty, it means that policymakers should chart a\ncourse that is stable, gradual, and predictable; communicate it clearly; and then follow\nthat course through the temporarily shifting and sometimes conflicting signs from the\neconomy unless some strong and steady signal requires a firm but moderate correction.\nGiven that the economy has performed fundamentally as I expected at the outset of this\nyear, the right strategy is to maintain the gradual course that I have thought appropriate\nfor some time now. Put another way, while I think that there is enough reason to think\nthat the productive capacity of our economy might be increasing so that we should not\nfeel compelled to accelerate our pace, I also think there is enough doubt about current\n\n- 10 -\ninflation as an infallibly reliable measure of current resource constraints that the\ncontinued gradual removal of accommodation is appropriate. Like pilots back in the days\nof radio beacons, don’t chase the needles.",

Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“The Road to Serfdom at 75: The Future of Classical Liberalism and the Free Market”\nNinth Annual Conference of the William F. Buckley, Jr., Program at Yale\nNew Haven, Connecticut\nNovember 1, 2019\n\nI am delighted to be back in New Haven and particularly to be in the company of\nso many students interested in thinking rigorously about ideas. And I am honored to be\nparticipating in the William F. Buckley, Jr., Program’s conference today on Friedrich\nHayek and the future of classical liberalism.1\nOver the course of this afternoon, you will hear a series of presentations that put\nHayek’s thinking in the context of contemporary developments and that offer a variety of\nperspectives on his intellectual legacy. Hayek was a prolific—some might even say\nprofligate—thinker. He was at various times, and in various modes, an early\nneuropsychologist, an epistemologist, a theoretical economist, a political philosopher, a\nmoral philosopher, a philosopher of science, a historian of ideas, a public intellectual, and\na social polemicist. This vast range has caused some to undervalue his contributions as\nan economist, notwithstanding his eventual Nobel Prize—when Hayek moved to the\nUnited States in 1950, the University of Chicago Economics Department would not hire\nhim because, as Milton Friedman said, “At that stage, he really wasn’t doing any\neconomics,” and Paul Krugman famously said that “the Hayek thing is almost entirely\nabout politics, not economics.”2 Others believe his broader thought, while seminal, was\ninconsistent across these various areas, and Hayek himself never demonstrated how it all\nhung together. In my contribution to the discussion today, I want to examine a particular\nexample of the lasting effect that Hayek has had on economic thinking—one pertaining\nto the importance of freely determined prices for producing efficient economic\n1 All of my remarks today represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal\nReserve Board, the Federal Open Market Committee, or the Financial Stability Board. I would like to\nthank Ed Nelson for his assistance in preparing these remarks.\n2 See, respectively, Cassidy (2000) and Krugman (2011).\n\n- 2 -\noutcomes—and consider how Hayek’s insights in this area can, in fact, tie together the\nvarious strands of his larger philosophy.\nSo as not to appear entirely out of touch with more immediate developments, I\nwill end by descending from the empyrean to the terrestrial with a discussion of the\neconomic outlook and the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) policy decision\nfrom earlier this week.\nHayek and Economics\nHayek’s contributions to economics ranged widely, and many were important and\nof lasting influence. Among them were his studies of the relationship between the\neconomic and political arrangements of a society. That body of work included, of course,\nhis celebrated book The Road to Serfdom, which was published 75 years ago this year\nand is a focus of this event, as well as his later monograph, The Constitution of Liberty.3\nIn addition, Hayek contributed prominently to monetary analysis. His work in this area\nincluded the theory of the business cycle that was part of the thinking of the Austrian\nschool of economics.4 It also included Hayek’s studies of the feasibility and implications\nof private-sector currency issuance—contributions that have informed modern-day\nanalyses of the repercussions of electronic money.5\nToday, however, I will be concerned instead with still another key contribution\nthat Hayek made to economic analysis: understanding the operation of the price system.\n3 See Hayek (1944, 1960). For an extensive analysis of these books, see Caldwell (2004) and, more\nrecently, Caldwell (forthcoming).\n4 See, for example, Hayek (1935). For an examination of this body of work, see O’Driscoll (1977).\n5 See especially Hayek (1976). For recent formal investigations of the topic, see Brunnermeier, James, and\nLandau (2019) and Fernández-Villaverde and Sanches (2019). My Board colleague, Lael Brainard, has\nrecently discussed the policy implications of electronic money. See Brainard (2019). The potential\nimplications of privately issued currency in the form of stablecoins are under active consideration by the\nFinancial Stability Board, which I chair, in work to be delivered to the Group of Twenty later next year.\n\n- 3 -\nThis contribution was formalized in his most famous paper in the economic-research\nliterature: his article “The Use of Knowledge in Society,” which was published in the\nAmerican Economic Review in September 1945.6\nHayek (1945) Revisited\nIt is worth outlining the basis for the high esteem in which economists hold\nHayek’s 1945 contribution. In 1974, the press release by the Royal Swedish Academy of\nSciences that announced Hayek’s Nobel Prize in Economics stated: “The Academy is of\nthe opinion that von Hayek’s analysis of the functional efficiency of different economic\nsystems is one of his most significant contributions to economic research in the broader\nsense. . . . His guiding principle when comparing various systems is to study how\nefficiently all the knowledge and all the information dispersed among individuals and\nenterprises [are] utilized. His conclusion is that only by far-reaching decentralization in a\nmarket system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of\nknowledge and information.”7\nIn the research that the academy described, Hayek’s 1945 paper was the key\narticle. More recently, this paper received further prominent acclaim when it was\ncategorized by an expert panel as being one of the top 20 articles ever published in the\nAmerican Economic Review.8\nWith regard to the paper’s contribution to the understanding of economic\nprocesses, an illuminating discussion was provided in 2005 by Oliver Williamson—\nhimself later a Nobel laureate in economics. Williamson cited Hayek’s 1945 paper,\n6 See Hayek (1945).\n7 See Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1974, paragraph 10).\n8 See Arrow and others (2011, p. 4).\n\n- 4 -\nalong with Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations from the eighteenth century, as forming\nthe core of a “venerated tradition in economics” of studying the notion of “spontaneous\norder” arising from a freely operating market system.9\nHow does Hayek’s case for the price system fit in alongside the other work that\nWilliamson mentioned? As Paul Samuelson—yet another Nobel Prize winner—had\noccasion to note, the argument for the price system that Hayek articulated in 1945 was\ncomplementary with, but distinct from, the argument that Adam Smith espoused in The\nWealth of Nations.10 Smith focused on how market mechanisms guide producers toward\nsatisfying consumers’ wants. Hayek instead stressed how the market mechanism makes,\nas he put it, “fuller use . . . of the existing knowledge” than a directed economy is able to\ndo.11\nHayek emphasized that the signals transmitted by the various individual prices in\nthe economy could, together, serve as a useful means of guiding overall resource\nallocation. The reason is that prices convey messages to consumers and producers even\nwhen the information that drives prices is not aggregated or directly observed.12 For\nexample, a large increase or decrease in the price of gasoline conveys information that\ninfluences consumer behavior and that also affects the behavior of energy producers,\neven when neither of these sets of market participants are aware of the precise factor\ninitiating the price change. As a related matter, Hayek recognized that prices transmit\n9 See Williamson (2005, p. 1). This discussion referred to Smith (1776) and Arrow and Debreu (1954)\nalongside Hayek (1945).\n10 See Samuelson (1983, p. 6).\n11 The quotation is from Hayek (1945, p. 521).\n12 Hayek’s analysis therefore differed from general equilibrium approaches to economic problems,\nexemplified by the work of Arrow and Debreu (1954). Such approaches tend to evaluate market outcomes\nin terms of their ability to reproduce the allocation decided on by a hypothetical social planner who\npossesses complete knowledge of all information in the economy and who is charged with maximizing the\nwelfare of the community.\n\n- 5 -\ninformation even in a situation in which much of that information is not explicitly\ndisclosed by one market participant to another, or even consciously articulable by any\nmarket participant at all. Hayek believed that all of us “know” many things that we\ncannot articulate but that we nevertheless act on in practical situations, and the price\nsystem can therefore aggregate and transmit that knowledge which we could not\notherwise convey.\nHayek’s analysis had implications for the viability of different economic systems.\nWith regard to centrally planned economic systems—which had considerable support in\nthe West in 1945, in light of the increased use of government economic controls in many\ncountries during World War II and the dismal performance of market economies during\nthe Great Depression—Hayek’s analysis suggested that these systems would likely\nexhibit great inefficiency. To Hayek, it was totally unrealistic to expect an economy to\noperate efficiently if it was based on the “direction of the whole economic system\naccording to one unified plan,” as such a plan lacked the valuable information embedded\nin market-determined prices.13\nThe economist Gregory Mankiw has elegantly summed up Hayek’s insight here:\n“Information is very, very dispersed among the population. . . .Nobody can possibly\nknow all the information you need to run a centrally planned economy.”14 Hayek’s\neconomic analysis therefore complemented the philosophical and political arguments he\nmarshaled against centrally planned economies in The Road to Serfdom. Again, it is\nimportant to recognize that this is not a contingent or technological problem. It is not\nonly that the dispersion of knowledge makes it hard to gather, although that is certainly\n13 See Hayek (1945, p. 521).\n14 See Mankiw (2017).\n\n- 6 -\ntrue—but if that were the only issue, then perhaps future advances in technology such as\nquantum computing would remove that obstacle. Rather, as already mentioned, we all\nknow many important things that we cannot articulate; and many of these things we come\nto know precisely through our participation in trade and exchange through the market.\nThis type of knowledge (a) is by its nature not conveyable to a central planner because\nwe are not fully aware of all we know, and (b) would not even exist apart from the social\ninteractions facilitated by the market which a central planner would replace.\nThe flip side of Hayek’s analysis was that, while there are insurmountable\nobstacles to economic efficiency via a central plan, an efficient economy may still be\nobtainable by letting the price system work. To quote Mankiw again, Hayek’s analysis\nimplies that “markets figure out a way to aggregate, in a decentralized way, dispersed\ninformation into desirable outcomes.”15 Furthermore, this mechanism does not require\nthe government or any one individual to process that dispersed information into a central\nnetwork or to be able to aggregate the information into a statistical series. It is, instead,\nsufficient for the proper operation of the price mechanism that the relevant information\nbe embodied implicitly in the economy’s multiplicity of prices of individual goods and\nfactors of production. This information is recorded in such prices because they respond\nto the behavior of individual buyers and sellers in the economy.16 Consequently, as\nlongtime Hayek scholar Gerald O’Driscoll has observed: “What particularly\nrecommends the price system to Hayek is the ‘economy of knowledge’ with which it\noperates. It is [in Hayek’s description] nothing short of a ‘marvel.’ ”17\n15 See Mankiw (2017). See also Taylor (2012, p. 1).\n16 The process is interactive, with market participants not only influencing prices, but also responding to\nprice signals.\n17 See O’Driscoll (1977, p. 27).\n\n- 7 -\nHow Hayek (1945) Has Influenced Economics\nHayek’s 1945 paper has had a great influence on subsequent economic research.\nIt has been found to be highly relevant to a variety of areas of economic inquiry. For\nexample, Hayek’s analysis has proved valuable in the development of standard\nmicroeconomics, since his contribution deepened economists’ understanding of the\nworking of the price system and promoted further investigation of the question of how\ndecentralized information is transmitted by markets.18 Hayek’s emphasis on prices as\nprocessors of information has also had applications to international trade theory.19 And\nin macroeconomics and monetary theory, Milton Friedman’s Nobel lecture, published in\n1977, cited Hayek’s 1945 paper when arguing that, because it disrupted the signals\narising from relative-price movements, inflation both lowered the efficiency of the\neconomy and led output to deviate from its natural (or full-employment) level.20 Hayek\nlikened the price mechanism to a “system of telecommunications,” and Friedman’s\ndescription of inflation as a form of “static” interrupting price signals was in keeping with\nthis analogy.21\nHayek’s ideas on prices influenced Joseph Stiglitz in his analysis of markets with\nasymmetric information and Roger Myerson’s insights on mechanism design theory.\nEach of these bodies of work earned a Nobel Prize.22\n18 See, for example, Serrano (2002).\n19 For example, an article in the area of international trade noted (Bernhofen and Brown, 2004, p. 49):\n“The insight that prices contain the relevant information about underlying economic fundamentals goes\nback to the pioneering work of Hayek (1945).”\n20 See Friedman (1977, pp. 456–67). The notion that distortions to relative-price patterns lead the\neconomy’s output level to deviate from its natural value would be formalized by Woodford (2003).\n21 See Hayek (1945, p. 527), and, for Friedman’s use of the analogy between inflation and static, see\nFriedman and Friedman (1980, pp. 17, 274).\n22 Shortly before he received the prize, Stiglitz (2000, p. 1468) noted that the 1945 Hayek paper recognized\nthat “the central problem of economics was a problem of knowledge or information”—and so it anticipated\n\n- 8 -\nQualifications and Extensions\nI do not want to leave the impression, however, that all of the conclusions in\nHayek’s 1945 paper have become unchallenged principles chiseled into the economic\nconsensus. On the contrary, one of the reasons why the paper has been so influential is\nthat it remains a benchmark reference for understanding the case for relying primarily on\na market system, based on freely determined prices, for determining the production and\nallocation of resources. The paper has therefore set a high bar for preempting the price\nsystem or for other interventions in the market: When economists point to cases in which\nmarket mechanisms can be improved on by regulation or other public-sector intervention,\nor to instances in which price signals do not appear to be operating effectively, they need\nto identify a specific market failure as the source of the inefficiency. Essentially, they\nneed to establish instances in which the price system can be improved on as a means of\nprocessing information.23\nEven Hayek acknowledged that the price mechanism works within an ecosystem\nof laws and social institutions, and those may evolve in ways that interfere with the\nsignaling of prices. For example, one of the important events that raised doubts about the\nfunctioning of the private market’s pricing process occurred in the years leading up to the\nthe field of the economics of information. And in his Nobel lecture, Myerson (2008, p. 586) credited\nHayek’s “widely influential paper” with helping spur mechanism-design research—by characterizing\nalternative institutional frameworks as different mechanisms for “communicating widely dispersed\ninformation about the desires and the resources of different individuals in society.”\n23 For example, while Stiglitz (2000) agreed that the price system is a means of collecting and transmitting\ndispersed information, he took issue with the notion that this system always produced the most efficient\neconomic equilibrium. Specifically, Stiglitz argued that incomplete information could lead to\nunnecessarily high unemployment and other undesirable outcomes that could be improved on by\ngovernment intervention. In a similar vein, Dasgupta (1980, p. 115) noted in response to Hayek’s (1945)\nposition: “It can immediately be argued that the fact that much information is private is not on its own\nsufficient to warrant the unfettered play of market forces to be judged the best possible resource allocation\nmechanism.”\n\n- 9 -\nfinancial crisis. This period featured pricing by financial markets that seemed, in some\nprominent cases, not to be adequately reflecting information about actual risks. Spreads\non risky private-sector debt reached very low levels, and damaging spillovers to the\nnonfinancial sector occurred in the form of unduly high real estate prices and excessive\nleverage by borrowers in the housing market. One of my predecessors at the Federal\nReserve Board, Donald Kohn, has noted the seeming herd-like behavior of financial\nmarkets in the pre-crisis period that generated this situation—an “underpricing of risk.”24\nThe financial crisis, and the deep recession that followed it, prompted changes in\nthe United States’ regulatory framework. These changes have been designed to make the\nfinancial system more resilient than it was before the crisis. By creating appropriate\nincentives and rules, they should also encourage financial markets to price risk more\nappropriately than they did in the years leading up to the crisis—for example, by\nreducing the danger of investor complacency regarding the riskiness of their investments\nand the possibility of adverse scenarios. If we follow Hayek and regard the price system\nas like a telecommunications network, and then apply that metaphor to the financial\nsector, we can think of the institutional and regulatory changes to the financial system\nover the past decade as designed to improve the reliability and signal quality of the\ntransmissions.25\nHow does all of this relate to the larger questions of philosophy and social order\nto which Hayek devoted much of his thought? Hayek’s insights about the price system\ndepend importantly on his theory of knowledge: The information that is available to us\nas a society is the aggregate of the highly dispersed and sometimes inarticulate\n24 See Kohn (2009). See also Yellen (2017, p. 4).\n25 I recently discussed post-crisis reform to financial regulation in Quarles (2019).\n\n- 10 -\nknowledge possessed by each of us individually. It is not only hard to convey that\ninformation to a central authority for processing into a rational decision—it is also\nconceptually impossible given the nature of that knowledge. And, indeed, important\nparts of that knowledge will not even be generated except through our interaction with\neach other through the mechanism of the market. Trying to centralize economic\ndecisionmaking, then, is not just too hard to do as a practical matter. It would actually\nreduce the amount of knowledge available to us as a society, by replacing those myriad\nindividual interactions in a free marketplace. Thus, even if some technological way to\naggregate information other than through prices could be invented, it would lead to less\nefficient, less humane outcomes because it would be based on less total human\ninformation. The price mechanism, then, is not just a matter of economics—it is a matter\nof social and, indeed, civilizational progress. As Hayek says in The Constitution of\nLiberty, “[C]ivilization begins when the individual in pursuit of his ends can make use of\nmore knowledge than he himself acquired and when he can transcend the boundaries of\nhis ignorance by profiting from knowledge that he himself does not possess.”26 I think\nthis ties together the various threads of Hayek’s thought throughout a long life: his early\nwork on psychology (“How do we know?”), his later epistemology (“What do we know,\nand what does it mean to know it?”), his economics (“How do we make knowledge\nusable?”), and his social and political theory (“What institutions will ensure that the\ngreatest amount of human knowledge will be usable in the pursuit of their human\nfulfillment?”). Contrary to those polemicists across the ideological spectrum whose\ntendentious simplifications of Hayek’s thought would turn him into a crude icon rather\n26 See Hayek (1960, p. 22).\n\n- 11 -\nthan a complex thinker, this is a deeply human, and a deeply humane, project. I will look\nforward to the contributions of the others you will hear from today in how Hayek\nelaborated it and how we can further these principles today.\nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nNow I would like to turn to the current economic scene and this week’s FOMC\ndecision. Let me start by saying that the U.S. economy is doing well, and I am optimistic\nabout the outlook. Economic conditions are currently very close to meeting our—that is,\nthe FOMC’s—dual-mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price\nstability.\nA particular source of strength has been the labor market. Setting aside the\nmonthly volatility and, specifically, the effects of the recent strike at General Motors,\nlabor market indicators are as strong as they have been in quite some time. The\nunemployment rate has been running near a 50-year low, and the proportion of the\npopulation currently employed is close to its highest level in a decade. Encouragingly,\nlabor force participation has held up, as the tight labor market has motivated workers to\neither join or remain in the labor force, halting, at least for the time being, a long-standing\ndownward trend. Although the pace of job gains has slowed this year, we expected some\ndeceleration because of how low the unemployment rate has fallen.\nA strong job market and high employment have in turn supported economic\ngrowth. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) grew 2-1/2 percent over the past four\nquarters, a healthy pace by historical standards and a major contributor to overall growth\nsince consumption represents over two-thirds of economic activity. Because the labor\n\n- 12 -\nmarket remains tight, I expect wage growth to pick up, which would then in turn\nunderpin further strength in consumption and overall growth.\nFor the other half of our mandate, inflation as measured by the PCE index was 1.3\npercent over the 12 months ending in September, while core PCE inflation, which\nexcludes increases in the prices of food and energy, was 1.7 percent. While these\nreadings are below our 2 percent inflation objective, they are fairly close, and my\nassessment is that inflation will inch toward our objective in the coming months.\nOutside the near term, I am also optimistic about the longer-term potential of the\nU.S. economy. I am heartened by a recent pickup in labor productivity growth. A\nnotable development of the post-crisis period has been the abysmal pace of labor\nproductivity growth. After averaging about a 2-1/4 percent pace in the two decades\nleading up to the crisis, labor productivity growth has been closer to 1 percent, on\naverage, since 2011. While there has been much speculation, it remains to be seen what\nhas driven this slowdown. Consequently, the slowdown could resolve unpredictably.\nAlthough the quarterly data are volatile, I have been encouraged by a pickup in labor\nproductivity in the first half of this year, when it grew at a 3 percent annual rate. Further\nout, I admit to being a bit of techno-enthusiast, and I see the potential for many emerging\ntechnologies, including 5G communications, artificial intelligence and machine learning,\nand 3-D printing, to further boost productivity growth in the coming years.\nHaving established my optimism, I will now circle back to some more worrying\nsigns in the recent data that suggest some headwinds are holding back growth. One\nprominent factor weighing on a relatively robust domestic economy has been weak\ngrowth among our trading partners. The International Monetary Fund projects that global\n\n- 13 -\neconomic growth in 2019 will be the slowest since the financial crisis. Partly as a\nconsequence of weak foreign growth, U.S. exports have been flat over the past year.\nAnother weak spot has been investment. After a strong 2017 and start to 2018,\nbusiness fixed investment has tailed off this year and fallen outright in the second and\nthird quarters. I find the weakness of investment to be of particular concern because\nincreasing investment and the capital stock are important for raising the potential capacity\nof the economy. It is likely that some of the weakness in capital spending is a result of\nelevated uncertainty, for foreign growth generally but also specifically for trade\ndevelopments.\nAgainst this backdrop, at our meeting earlier this week, we decided to lower our\ntarget range for the federal funds rate for the third time this year. We took this action to\nhelp keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide\nsome insurance against ongoing risks. By lowering the federal funds rate this year, we\nare supporting the continued expansion of the economy. Overall, with these policy\nadjustments, I believe that the economy will remain in a good place, with the labor\nmarket remaining strong and inflation staying close to our 2 percent objective. We see\nthe current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming\ninformation about the economy continues to be broadly consistent with our outlook of\nmoderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric\n2 percent objective.\n\n- 14 -\nReferences\nArrow, Kenneth J., B.

Quarles\nVice Chairman for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“An International Perspective on the Future of Bank Stress Testing”\nSymposium sponsored by Harvard Law School Program on International Financial\nSystems\nHarvard Law School\nCambridge, Massachusetts\nNovember 16, 2018\n\nProfessor Scott, and our hosts from Harvard and the Program on International\nFinancial Systems, thank you for the chance to participate in today’s meeting. Looking\naround the room, I see a mix of past and current colleagues, from academics, to\nsupervisors and central bankers, to researchers and practitioners in industry. All of you\nhave seen, felt, and lived different aspects of the transition to the post-crisis regulatory\nframework, and I am grateful to hear your perspectives on such a critical aspect of it.\nIn the depths of the financial crisis, the first regulatory stress tests were designed\nunder intense scrutiny with high-stakes consequences. Their contribution--an\nindependent public view of the capital adequacy of the largest firms--helped reinforce the\nbanking system at a critical juncture. Since then, stress testing has meaningfully\nincreased the post-stress resiliency of large financial institutions, and become a critical\ntool in keeping the system strong.\nThose accomplishments are real, and we should aim to do more than simply\npreserve them. Now is a prudent time to consolidate the gains we have made, and to\npromote the efficiency and transparency of our processes. Today, I will review some of\nour efforts along those lines, focusing on proposed changes to our stress-testing program.\nThese changes, which I described in more detail in remarks last week, are intended to\nimprove the program, maintaining its dynamism and flexibility while providing adequate\nnotice to regulated firms, without altering materially the stringency of the tests or the\noverall level of capital in the system.1\nI share these views with a deep appreciation of the decades of international\nexperience represented in this room. The crisis came with a reminder that the financial\nsystem is global, that risks in one country can quickly spread to another, and that in\nkeeping the system and the economy safe, we have no choice but to work together. I\nlook forward to hearing your thoughts on the changes I outline, and on how to improve\nour stress testing processes in the years ahead.\n1 See Randal K. Quarles (2018), “A New Chapter in Stress Testing,” speech delivered at the Brookings\nInstitution, Washington, DC, November 9.\n\n- 2 -\nStress Capital Buffer\nMany of you are familiar with the Federal Reserve’s proposed stress capital buffer\n(SCB), which would replace the current fixed buffer requirement of 2.5 percent of risk-\nweighted assets with one based on each firm’s stress test results.2 I believe the proposal\nrepresents an important milestone in crafting an integrated capital regime, and in keeping\nwith its importance, we have received extensive and thoughtful public comments,\nidentifying elements of it that could benefit from further refinement. I described several\nof these elements last week, including my views on some areas which I believe we should\nrevisit: improving measurement of risks in the trading book; encouraging less sticky\nforms of capital distribution without requiring dividend pre-funding; and reevaluating the\ninteraction of the capital buffer with capital distributions. Today, I want to highlight\nthree elements in particular.\nForemost among these is the volatility of stress test results. Some volatility in\nannual results is necessary to preserve the dynamism of the stress test, and to reflect\nchanges in macroeconomic conditions, salient economic risks, and the composition of\nfirm balance sheets. However, when the largest banks in the system are fully meeting\ntheir capital requirements, a highly variable capital requirement from year to year can\npresent a significant management challenge. I believe there is an important balance to\nstrike in this area, which will let us preserve dynamism while reducing volatility, and we\nplan to seek comment on a relevant proposal in the not-too-distant future.\nThe second is the sequencing of stress test results with capital plan submissions.\nCurrently, and under the SCB proposal, a firm must decide whether to increase or\ndecrease its planned dividends and share repurchases for the upcoming year without\nknowledge of a key constraint: the results of the stress test. Initially, this phasing\nreflected the view that firms should think rigorously about their capital uses and needs,\nrather than relying primarily on the results of the supervisory stress test to guide those\nplans. However, now that we all have several years’ experience with this system, firms\nhave told us that they would be able to engage in more thoughtful capital planning if they\n2 Amendments to the Regulatory Capital, Capital Plan, and Stress Test Rules, 83 Fed. Reg. 18,160 (April\n25, 2018), www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-04-25/pdf/2018-08006.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nhad knowledge of that year’s stress test results before finalizing their distribution plans\nfor the upcoming year. I am sympathetic to their concerns, and will ask the Board to\nadjust the operation of the rule, so that firms know their SCB before they decide on their\nplanned distributions for the coming year. Of course, we expect firms to continue to\nmaintain robust stress testing practices and use those results to inform their capital\ndistribution plans, and we will continue to use the supervisory process to reinforce this\nexpectation.\nThe third is the post-stress leverage requirement. As the Federal Reserve has long\nmaintained, leverage requirements are intended to serve as a backstop to the risk-based\ncapital requirements. By definition, they are not intended to be risk-sensitive. Thus, I am\nconcerned that explicitly assigning a leverage buffer requirement to a firm on the basis of\nrisk-sensitive post-stress estimates runs afoul of the intellectual underpinnings of the\nleverage ratio, and I would advocate removing this element of the stress capital buffer\nregime. Of course, leverage ratios, including the enhanced supplementary leverage\nrequirements, would remain a critical part of our regulatory capital regime, and we will\nmaintain the supervisory expectation that firms have sufficient capital to meet all\nminimum regulatory requirements.\nTo give these issues the careful consideration they deserve, I expect we will adopt\na final rule in the near future, settling the basic SCB framework while re-proposing\ncertain elements. I expect that the first SCB would not go into effect before 2020, and\nthat CCAR will remain in place in 2019 for firms with over $250 billion in assets or that\nare otherwise complex. However, we will consider whether we can move forward with\nany aspects of the SCB proposal for CCAR 2019, such as assumptions related to balance\nsheet growth, and I will ask the Board to exempt firms with less than $250 billion in\nassets from the CCAR quantitative assessment and supervisory stress testing in 2019.\nTransparency\nIn the meantime, several initiatives are also underway to provide additional\ntransparency into stress testing. I expect you will soon see the Federal Reserve issue a\npolicy statement describing governing principles around the supervisory stress testing\nprocess—and with it, a commitment to disclosing additional detail about supervisory\n\n- 4 -\nstress test models and results, along with portfolios of hypothetical loans and associated\nloss rates. I expect we will begin providing some of this additional detail starting in early\n2019. I also expect the Board will seek comment on the advisability of, and possible\napproaches to, gathering public input on scenarios and salient risks facing the banking\nsystem each year.\nTransparency matters not only because it provides additional due process to\naffected participants; it also creates an opportunity for broader, more insightful comments\nfrom the public. As a result, it can allow us to be more nimble and better informed in our\nscenario design. However, we want to maintain incentives for firms to conduct their own\nstress tests rigorously and thoughtfully, and avoid the risk that firms will use this new\ninformation to engage in transactions that are solely designed to reduce losses in the test\nwithout reducing actual risk. Firms have indicated that additional disclosure about\nmodels would not affect their own stress tests. We expect them to make good on that\nrepresentation, as the Federal Reserve’s stress test is not, and cannot be, a full picture of a\nfirm’s resiliency in light of its idiosyncratic risks. We are confident that we can address\nthese concerns through the regular examination process, by closely monitoring changes in\nfirms’ portfolios and ensuring sufficient capital, controls, and governance in light of the\nrisk characteristics of their activities.\nQualitative Objection\nI also want to reiterate a point regarding the role of the qualitative objection. The\nFederal Reserve eliminated this element of CCAR for large and noncomplex firms in\n2017, in part because of improvements in risk management at those firms.3 In my view,\nthe time has come to normalize the CCAR qualitative assessment by removing the public\nobjection tool, and continuing to evaluate firms’ stress testing practices through normal\nsupervision. While supervisory assessments would continue to center on a firm’s capital\nplan submissions, examination work would continue on a year-round basis, taking into\naccount the firm’s management of other financial risks, and culminating in a rating of the\nfirm’s capital position and planning. Firms with deficient practices would receive\n3 The capital planning evaluation remains as part of the normal supervisory process for these firms.\n\n- 5 -\nsupervisory findings through the examination process, and would be at risk of a ratings\ndowngrade or enforcement action if those deficiencies were sufficiently material.\nConclusion\nThese changes are aimed at preserving the foundation laid over nearly a decade of\nstress testing experience, including by many of the people in this room. Our goal is to\nbolster the program’s credibility by increasing its transparency, simplicity, and stability,\nwhile maintaining the strength of the supervisory and internal stress testing elements that\nare central to the program today. These adjustments will be coupled with our continued\ncommitment to strong supervision, and our expectation that financial institutions manage\ntheir risks and hold sufficient capital to continue operations through times of stress. I\nlook forward to hearing your insights into these changes, and I thank you for your time.",

Quarles\nVice Chair\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nAtlanta, Georgia\nFebruary 25, 2021\n\nOne of the principal themes of human history—and certainly of economic history\n–is that of a sudden technological breakthrough originally deployed for one purpose\nbeing gradually refined over time until new and better versions of it are eventually\ndeployed for a much broader range of purposes. The breakthrough supplies the drama,\nbut it’s the steady incremental improvement over time that makes the greatest difference.\nThe Phoenicians dramatically improved the speed and cargo load of their commercial\nvoyages with the invention of the trireme—massive boats, powered with three tiers of\noarsmen, rather than the standard one or two—dispatched from Tyre and Sidon in the\nservice of exploration, commerce, and colonization. But the Greeks improved on the\ndesign, bit by bit, and over many years, until they became not commercial vessels\nferrying cargo from Carthage to Cádiz, but warships that revolutionized naval combat\nand enabled Athens—led by the obstinate upstart Themistocles who built a fleet of 200\ntriremes, the largest navy Greece had ever seen—to challenge and defeat the Persian\nKing. Or, somewhat closer to home, consider the development of radar in World War II.\nThat initial innovation was instrumental in winning the war but continued refinement has\nled to technologies that can promptly warn us of tornados or even steer our cars.\nIn the world of bank supervision, our equivalent of the trireme has been the stress\ntest. The initial innovation of stress testing gave us an urgently needed tool to measure\nhow much additional capital banks with mounting losses needed to survive the financial\ncrisis more than a decade ago. But because we continued with the refinement, we now\nhave a tool that also helps us to set capital requirements credibly in the banking system,\nin good times as well as times of financial stress.\n\n- 2 -\nToday, I’d like to share with you my perspective about how stress testing has\nenhanced the credibility of our capital adequacy framework, highlight some features of\nthe upcoming stress test, and offer some thoughts on the importance of continued\ninnovation in supervision. In particular, I will discuss how stress testing serves as both a\ngeneral tool to set bank capital requirements throughout the credit cycle and recently as a\nspecialized tool to provide an analytical grounding for the decisions we have made on\ncapital distributions during the COVID event. Then I will briefly review the recently\nreleased scenario for the 2021 test and discuss other changes for the upcoming stress\ntesting cycle.\nThe 2020 Stress Tests\nWe now use stress testing in two important but different ways: to set capital\nrequirements during normal times and to assess capital adequacy during exigent times. In\nMarch of last year, the Board of Governors finalized the stress capital buffer requirement,\nwhich uses the Fed’s stress test results to set capital requirements for large banks, and by\ndoing so, simplified our overall capital regime.\nWhile this new framework has the same goal as the previous Comprehensive\nCapital Analysis and Review (CCAR) framework—using forward-looking analysis to\nhelp ensure that banks have sufficient capital to survive a severe recession while still\nbeing able to lend to businesses and household—it integrates our stress testing regime\nwith our ongoing capital requirements so that large banks now have a single suite of\ndynamic and risk-sensitive capital requirements. While that framework is simpler, it is\nno less stringent than the CCAR framework—a framework that contributed to a more\nthan doubling of the common equity ratio at banks between 2009 and 2019. At the time\n\n- 3 -\nwe made the stress capital buffer final last March, we estimated that the stress capital\nbuffer would have further increased capital requirements for the largest and most\ncomplex banks. By design, the new framework better captures systemic risk by requiring\nthose banks to establish a buffer to absorb losses they’d take in a severe recession in\naddition to their G-SIB surcharges.\nIt is useful here to pause and put stress testing in the context of bank supervision\nin general. Both supervision and stress testing specifically have roles during normal\ntimes as well as times of stress, but those roles are somewhat different depending on the\ncircumstances. Like all supervision, stress testing conducted during normal times of solid\neconomic growth and financial stability is aimed at helping ensure banks remain in safe\nand sound condition. We use it to set the capital buffers, which give firms incentives to\nhold capital during normal times, so they are prepared to weather downturns. During\nperiods of economic and financial turmoil, the goals shift to understanding banks’\nexposure to the turmoil and to ensuring that banks can support households and businesses\nby continuing to lend. The modern bank stress testing regime was born in the solvency\ncrisis of 2009 but remains a flexible tool that can be used to understand the implications\nof a range of macroeconomic and financial conditions.\nThat includes conditions that few could have imagined, such as those that\ndescended last spring. The temporary shutdown of large segments of the economy\ncaused an unprecedentedly large and swift drop in economic activity. Equally\nunprecedented was the degree of uncertainty, both downside and upside, about how the\neconomy would progress throughout the remainder of 2020.\n\n- 4 -\nWe responded to that abrupt change in environment by adapting stress testing to\nconduct a sensitivity analysis, an application of the stress testing models used to inform\nthe Board of Governors about risks to bank solvency during those rapidly changing\nconditions. The sensitivity analysis we conducted was possible because we routinely\ncollect standardized data from banks on their exposures and have developed our own loss\nand income models at the Fed. Thus, we were able to conduct this analysis purely\ninternally, without putting additional burdens on banks during an already-difficult time.\nThat analysis used the same models as the regular stress test, but we made several\nchanges with the goal of gaining a real-time understanding of the implications for bank\ncapital of quite plausible downside scenarios. The sensitivity analysis included three\nadditional scenarios that reflected the potential economic implications of the COVID\nevent, as we understood them at the time. We also incorporated targeted adjustments to\naccount for material changes to bank balance sheets resulting from the COVID event,\nsuch as large drawdowns on corporate credit lines.\nAt that time of great uncertainty, this sensitivity analysis helped sharpen our\nunderstanding of how banks might fare under the wide range of possible paths of the\neconomy. We published that analysis to bolster public confidence in the financial system\nby providing a rigorous and timely assessment of the condition and prospects for the\nbanking sector, based on data and well-established analytical methods. The additional\nanalysis gave the public a view into the intellectual underpinnings of the policy actions\nthe Board took, which included special limitations on—but not a complete elimination\nof—capital distributions and a requirement for all firms to re-assess their capital needs\nand submit another capital plan in late 2020 in light of the economic uncertainty. The\n\n- 5 -\nDecember round of stress tests that followed informed an adjustment to and extension of\nthe distribution limitations into the first quarter of 2021, and we are continuing to use\ninsights from the stress tests as we consider when to lift the limitations.\nThroughout the COVID event, the stress test has provided analysis necessary to\ntailor our actions to the risks we faced, and we have used the results from it to provide the\npublic with transparency into the analysis that informs our decisions. The investment\nwe’ve made in the Fed’s own stress test models gave us an extra tool relative to\nregulators in other jurisdictions, who generally rely on banks’ own models for projections\nof losses and revenues in their supervisory stress tests. While those other jurisdictions\ncancelled or postponed their scheduled stress tests to avoid putting additional burdens on\nbanks to run models during a period of financial stress, we expanded our internally-run\nanalysis to meet the evolving conditions. We used the opportunity to inform ourselves\nabout the impact of various plausible paths that the recovery might take and to provide\nthe public with more frequent assessments of bank health. And as a result of the\nmeasures taken by the Board and the banks, U.S. bank capital levels actually increased\nlast year, despite substantial increases in loan loss reserves—funds that banks set aside to\ncover expected losses. The aggregate common equity ratio across large banks increased\nfrom 12 percent at the end of 2019 to 12.8 percent at the end of 2020. During this same\ntime, large banks built roughly $90 billion in loan loss reserves.\nIt may not have been possible to use stress testing in such a central way had we\nnot done the work to establish its credibility over the past decade. That credibility is built\non a foundation of cutting-edge models, which estimate how different bank assets would\nrespond to economic stresses. Our careful execution of those models allows us to\n\n- 6 -\nconfidently disclose detailed results to the public. Those innovations prepared us to adapt\nquickly and respond to the unprecedented shock associated with the COVID event, which\nconfirmed that stress testing is still effective in these unprecedented times.\nThe Fed’s stress testing models are subject to continual development by experts\nin credit risk measurement, borrower behavior, and financial markets. Like a barometer,\nthe models give us an early warning of stormy financial conditions ahead by distilling\nbank positions and scenarios into estimates of potential losses and revenues. These\nmodels are reviewed by a group of experts inside the Fed but outside the stress testing\nprocess that challenges their assumptions, further improving their credibility. The\nmodels span all material exposures held by banks, providing a comprehensive assessment\nof the risks different types of scenarios pose to overall bank capital.\nOur disclosures of the results stemming from those models, along with\ntransparency about the model assumptions, have given banks, markets, and the broader\npublic a lens through which to understand risk in the system. We have built credibility\nover time through our consistent and increasingly detailed public disclosures. For nearly\na decade, we have published the scenarios and results, and a few years ago we greatly\nexpanded our disclosure of the modeling methodology in an additional annual\npublication.\nLooking Ahead to the 2021 Stress Test\nContinuing in that tradition, two weeks ago we initiated the 2021 stress test with\nthe publication of this cycle’s stress scenarios. As we’ve said many times, the scenarios\nare not projections or predictions. They are designed according to a longstanding\nframework that we published after incorporating feedback from the public. This year, the\n\n- 7 -\nmacroeconomic scenario envisions a severe global recession accompanied by a period of\nheightened stress in U.S. commercial real estate and corporate debt markets. As\ndiscussed in recent financial stability reports, the current environment presents unique\nchallenges for those asset classes, and our focus on them in the scenarios is consistent\nwith the salient risks they pose to banks. The scenario layers additional significant stress\non top of the stress already absorbed by banks over the past year, with the unemployment\nrate rising back to nearly 11 percent and stock prices falling more than 50 percent.\nIn March, we will publish the details of the methodologies that underlie our\nmodels. This will mark the third year since we enhanced the disclosures to provide\nsignificantly more information about the stress testing models relative to earlier years.\nThat information includes ranges of loss rates, estimated by using the models, for actual\nloans held by CCAR firms; portfolios of hypothetical loans with loss rates estimated by\nthe models; and more detailed descriptions of the models, such as equations and key\nvariables that influence the results of the models. These disclosures enhance the ability\nof the public to understand and interpret the supervisory stress test results. And as I’ve\nnoted before, I believe these enhanced disclosures have been a step in the right direction\ntoward striking the right balance between rigor and transparency. They do not reveal\neverything about our models—lest we find ourselves in a “model monoculture” where\nsupervisors and banks converge on the same sets of risks, ignoring other potential\nproblems.\nIn June we’ll publish the firm-level results from the test. Though 2021 is a year\nin which smaller firms are not subject to the supervisory stress test, the Board recently\nmade final a rule that will allow them to opt in. Should they do so, their results will also\n\n- 8 -\nbe disclosed, and their stress capital buffers will be updated using the stress test results\nwe publish in June. These actions, including greater transparency around our stress\ntesting models and greater flexibility in our stress testing process for smaller firms,\nrepresent innovations that I believe help to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of\nsupervision.\nFuture Innovation in Stress Testing\nAs we look to the future, the Fed must continue to innovate so that stress testing\nremains effective. In the near term, we must strive to understand the implications of the\nCOVID event on how we measure financial risk. Borrowers are facing unemployment,\ncash flow disruptions, and continued economic uncertainty. The programs put in place to\nhelp those borrowers are critical for our recovery but will further complicate risk\nmodeling as borrower stress may be obscured by temporary stimulus. For example, it is\ndifficult to tell whether a borrower who has continued to make loan payments during the\nCOVID event is able to do so because of stimulus payments or because they have\ncontinued to earn income. Borrowers benefitting from temporary forbearance may or\nmay not be able to resume payments once the forbearance ends.\nOver the longer term, we must continue to sharpen our thinking around the\ninterrelationships between bank risk and broader changes, such as advancing\ntechnologies and growth in non-bank finance. Those forces are undoubtedly altering\nbank risk, and it will take creative and timely research to understand the implications.\nOur agenda also includes initiatives that could reduce the volatility in the stress test\nresults without sacrificing either their probative value or their rigor. We will continue to\nexplore those possibilities.\n\n- 9 -\nAt the same time, we regularly get calls from the public to review various aspects\nof our models. For example, in recent years, representatives from an affordable housing\ngroup noted that the global market shock for real estate investments also affected certain\nlower-risk public welfare investments, thereby discouraging investment in affordable\nhousing. We deliberatively studied the issue, concluded that the public welfare\ninvestments indeed posed a lower risk to bank capital than the other real estate\ninvestments, and adjusted downward the shock we apply to those investments in advance\nof the 2020 stress test.\nMore recently, we received feedback from banks via appeals of their stress capital\nbuffers. I was encouraged by the fact that a number of the issues the banks raised were\nalready on our research agenda. The banks, however, did raise issues relating to interest\nrate hedges, loss-sharing agreements, and loans that use fair value option accounting that\nthe Board directed staff to investigate and address promptly. I am hopeful that the\nfeedback we receive from the public as well as our own analysis will help us set the right\npriorities in our research and development work.\nBut innovation is not just about improving tools like stress testing. It is also about\nidentifying new ways to apply those tools to a broader set of problems faced by the\nBoard, in supervision, and perhaps beyond. The sensitivity analysis I described earlier\ndemonstrates how we are able to adapt and apply a familiar tool in a new way to conduct\ncritical analysis at a critical moment.\nDrawing on that experience, I believe there is a need for more data and data-\ndriven analysis broadly in supervision, which is related to the larger goal of enhanced\ntransparency. Important aspects of supervision are appropriately private, to protect a\n\n- 10 -\nbank’s confidential business information and to avert speculation about a bank’s finances\nthat could be destabilizing. And not every aspect of a supervisor’s work can be\nquantified. But I believe that there is room for supervisors to be more transparent about\ntheir analytical processes in general, and more forthcoming about the data used as the\nbasis for supervisory judgments. Stress testing can serve as an example of what may be\npossible as we explore those avenues. Themistocles saw the possibilities of an evolving\ntechnology in a changing world. That applies, too, to the ongoing work of reviewing,\nadjusting and improving supervision and stress testing to ensure that banks can continue\nsupporting households and businesses in good times and in those that are more\nchallenging.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:10 a.m. EDT\nJune 3, 2019\nThe Next Stage in the LIBOR Transition\n(via prerecorded video)\nRemarks by\nRandal K. Quarles\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nAlternative Reference Rates Committee Roundtable, cohosted by\nthe Alternative Reference Rates Committee and\nthe New York University Stern School of Business and Its Salomon Center\nfor the Study of Financial Institutions\nNew York, New York\nJune 3, 2019\n\nGood morning to you all. I am sorry I cannot be present at the Alternative\nReference Rates Committee’s (ARRC) fourth roundtable, but I wanted to share these\nremarks with you at what is the start of the next critical stage in the transition away from\nLIBOR.1\nSince 2014, the official sector has publicly warned that LIBOR could become\nunstable. Not everyone paid attention to those warnings, but the risks that we pointed to\nhave materialized. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has intervened to preserve\nLIBOR’s stability only through the end of 2021. Despite that development, some\ncontinue to speculate that LIBOR can remain in production indefinitely. My key\nmessage to you today is that you should take the warnings seriously. Clarity on the exact\ntiming and nature of the LIBOR stop is still to come, but the regulator of LIBOR has said\nthat it is a matter of how LIBOR will end rather than if it will end, and it is hard to see\nhow one could be clearer than that.\nThe Federal Reserve convened the ARRC based on our concerns about the\nstability of LIBOR. The ARRC was charged with providing the market with the tools\nthat would be needed for a transition from LIBOR: an alternative rate that did not share\nthe same structural instabilities that have led LIBOR to this point, a plan to develop\nliquidity in the derivatives market for this new rate so that cash users could hedge their\ninterest rate risk, and models of better contract language that helped limit the risk from a\nLIBOR disruption.\n1 Vice Chair for Supervision Quarles also serves as Chair of the Financial Stability Board. The remarks\nrepresent his own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nThe ARRC has provided these tools. Now it is up to you to begin using them.\nWith only two and a half years of further guaranteed stability for LIBOR, the transition\nshould begin happening in earnest. I believe that the ARRC has chosen the most viable\npath forward and that most will benefit from following it, but regardless of how you\nchoose to transition, beginning that transition now would be consistent with prudent risk\nmanagement and the duty that you owe to your shareholders and clients.\nThe ARRC’s work began by focusing on creating a derivatives market for the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), its recommended alternative to U.S. dollar\nLIBOR, because end users require derivatives markets to hedge their cash exposures.\nThe CME Group, LCH, and Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, all now offer futures or\nswaps markets on SOFR, and participation in these markets is growing. As liquidity in\nthese markets continues to develop, my hope is that many of you will avail yourselves of\nthem to close out your LIBOR positions. In the meantime, it will be crucial in ensuring\nglobal financial stability that everyone participate in the International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association’s (ISDA) consultations on better fallback language for LIBOR\nderivatives and then sign the ISDA protocol so that these fallbacks apply to the legacy\nbook of derivatives.\nLikewise, the ARRC has now offered better fallback language for new issuance of\ncash products that refer to LIBOR. It seems clear that much of the contract language\nbeing used currently did not envisage and is not designed for a permanent end to LIBOR.\nThe ARRC’s fallback recommendations represent a significant body of work on the part\nof a wide set of market participants and set out a robust and well-considered set of steps\n\n- 3 -\nthat expressly consider an end to LIBOR.2 I urge everyone to avail themselves of this\nwork; it is, again, important for prudent risk management and your fiduciary\nresponsibilities that you incorporate better fallback language. Issuers should demand it of\nthemselves, and investors should demand it of issuers.\nThere is, however, also another and easier path, which is simply to stop using\nLIBOR. At this moment, many seem to take comfort in continuing to use LIBOR—it is\nfamiliar, and it remains liquid. But history may not view that decision kindly; after\nLIBOR stops, it may be fairly difficult to explain to those who may ask exactly why it\nmade sense to continue using a rate that you had been clearly informed had such\nsignificant risks attached to it. And make no mistake—as good as the fallback language\nmay be, simply relying on fallback language to transition brings a number of operational\nrisks and economic risks. Firms should be incorporating these factors into their projected\ncost of continuing to use LIBOR, and investors and borrowers should consider them\nwhen they are offered LIBOR instruments. If you do consider these factors, then I\nbelieve you will see that it is in your interest to move away from LIBOR.\nIn convening the ARRC, we have set a model of public-private sector cooperation\nto address a key financial stability risk. Ultimately, the private sector must drive this\ntransition—these are private contracts, and each of you must choose how you can best\naddress this risk—but the public sector must help. At a recent roundtable on the LIBOR\ntransition held by the Financial Stability Board, we heard calls from the private sector to\nprovide greater clarity on regulatory and tax implications of the transition and also calls\nfor a more “muscular” regulatory approach.\n2 The ARRC’s recommendations for fallback contract language can be found at\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/arrc/fallbacks-contract-language.\n\n- 4 -\nIt is incumbent on the official sector to take these requests seriously, and we are.\nFor example, the Federal Reserve is working with the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission and other U.S. prudential regulators to provide greater clarity on the\ntreatment of margin requirements for legacy derivatives instruments. Agency staff are\ndeveloping proposed changes to the margin rules for non-cleared swaps to ensure that\nchanges to legacy swaps to incorporate a move away from LIBOR, including adherence\nto the ISDA protocol, would not affect the grandfathered status of those legacy swaps\nunder the margin rules. This has been a key request of the ARRC, and we will look\nforward to public comment on the proposal.\nThe Federal Reserve’s supervisory teams have already included a number of\ndetailed questions about plans for the transition away from LIBOR in their monitoring\ndiscussions with large firms. The Federal Reserve will expect to see an appropriate level\nof preparedness at the banks we supervise, and that level must increase as the end of 2021\ngrows closer. Our supervisory approach will continue to be tailored to the size of\ninstitution and the complexity of LIBOR exposure, but the largest firms should be\nprepared to see our expectations for them increase. As we consider the answers we have\nreceived from these firms, we will assess how our supervisory expectations for them\nshould evolve in the coming year.\nLet me address one additional point relating to our supervisory stress tests, in an\neffort to provide further clarity. Some have recently claimed that the Federal Reserve’s\nsupervisory stress tests would penalize a bank that replaces LIBOR with SOFR in loan\ncontracts by lowering projections of net interest income under stress. As can be seen in\nour recently published enhanced descriptions of the supervisory stress-test models, the\n\n- 5 -\ninterest rate variables that drive projections of net interest income under stress are the\nyield on 10-year Treasury bonds, the yield on 3-month Treasury bills, and the 10-year\ntriple-B corporate yield.3 That is, the supervisory projections of net interest income are\nprimarily based on models that implicitly assume that other rates such as LIBOR or\nSOFR move passively with short-term Treasury rates. Given these mechanics, choosing\nto lend at SOFR rather than LIBOR will not result in lower projections of net interest\nincome under stress in the stress-test calculations of the Federal Reserve.\nI hope I have been able to provide you with some further clarity today. I am sure\nthat the rest of the roundtable will do so as well. I want to applaud the members of the\nARRC who are working hard to make sure this threat to financial stability is avoided.\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test 2019:\nSupervisory Stress Test Methodology (Washington: Board of Governors, March), table 2, p. 23,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2019-march-supervisory-stress-test-methodology.pdf.",

    "text": "June 03, 2021\n\nVice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles\n\nAt The Prudential Regulation Conference (via webcast)\n\nAs many of you know, I am speaking to you from Salt Lake City, which, among its myriad other virtues, was the home of one of the earliest passenger airlinesâWestern Air Express, which ran its first passenger flight in the spring of 1926: Eight hours in a Douglas M2 between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, with one stop in Las Vegas for fuel. Two of the first passengers sat on the mail sacks in the back, and those early plane travelers were adventurers in other ways as well. That year there were 12 fatal commercial airplane crashes and that number rose to 59 a year by 1930. That's not total deathsâthat's fatal crashes, with many people on each plane. Comparing hours flown and number of flights, that would be as if we had 7,000 fatal airplane crashes in a typical year today, with hundreds of thousands dead.\n\nBut we did not have 7,000 fatal crashes last year. We had five in the entire world. The year before we had eight. Air travel is famously the safest way to get from point A to point B, as a result of decades of innovation in technology and operating processes. Importantly, however, even as the airline industry was improving safety, it was equally focused on improving efficiencyâespecially as we moved into the era of jet travel in the 1960s. The eight-hour trip between Salt Lake and Los Angeles now takes an hour and a half even counting all the nosing around on the ground (although an argument can be made that a typical coach seat may not be that much more comfortable than sitting on the mail bags). Yet average fuel burn has been falling every year since 1960 and continues at a strong paceâin the first decade of the 21st century, fuel efficiency on domestic flights increased by another 40 percent. The airlines recognized that the public has a strong interest in safety, but that it also has a strong interest in other values as well. A more efficient airline is easier on the environment, cheaper for the consumer, and a stronger contributor to the overall economy. And, obviously, these continuing improvements in operation have been achievable without any compromise in safety.\n\nI think you can see where I am going with this. In the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve, the international regulatory community, and the banking industry took action to radically improve the safety of the banking system: new capital and liquidity rules, new stress testing requirements, a new resolution framework. Together, these have greatly strengthened the safety of the financial system. Actual common equity capital ratios for large banks have roughly doubled since the crisis (and are at least six times as great as the pre-crisis requirements).\n\nBut in implementing these safety requirements, we did not pay as close attention to efficiency. Yet the public interest in efficiency is also strong, so over the last four years we have comprehensively sought ways to improve the efficiency of the system while maintaining its safetyâwhich is every bit as possible in the financial system as it has been for the airlines. While this has been a broad project, today I want to focus on four examples of measures that illustrate this phenomenon. These measures have enjoyed support across the political spectrum because they have brought measurable benefits to the American people.\n\nTailoring Regulation The first that I would cite is our broad work since 2018 on tailoring our bank regulatory framework. That year, a bipartisan majority in Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA), which made modifications to the Dodd-Frank Act and called on the banking agencies to further tailor regulation to better reflect the business models and activities of the different banking firms that we supervise. The legislation recognized that it is possible to keep the system just as safe while allowing the financial system more capacity to support the real economy and more flexibility in doing so.\n\nAs I have said before, one of my goals as Vice Chair for Supervision has been to make our regulatory framework as simple, transparent, and efficient as possible. In particular, we must always ask whether the cost of regulationâwhether in reduced economic growth or in increased frictions in the financial systemâis outweighed by the benefits of the regulation. If we have a choice between two methods of equal effectiveness in achieving a goal, we should choose the one that is less burdensome for the system.\n\nThis principle guided our activity in differentiating among firms based on their risk profile and applying tailored standards accordingly. In keeping with the intent of EGRRCPA, the Fed adopted a revised tailoring framework for the application of our enhanced standards to large firms. That framework rightly differentiates standards, including capital and liquidity requirements, based on the risk profile of an individual firm. Our previous framework relied heavily on a firm's total assets to determine the stringency of our regulatory requirements. However, the tailoring framework relies on a broader array of indicatorsâsize, as well as measures of short-term wholesale funding, non-bank assets, off-balance sheet exposures, cross-jurisdictional activityâto better align our prudential standards with the risk of a firm. Under the tailoring framework, the most complex, systemically important firms are subject to the most stringent requirements, while less complex firms are subject to commensurately reduced requirements. This allows firms to focus resources more on their core lending function to support the real economy, which was certainly in evidence during the booming economy in the run-up to COVID.\n\nOur tailoring of regulation was not limited to just large banks. The banking agencies worked on a range of measures to better reflect the risk profile of smaller banking organizations. These include expanded eligibility for our small bank holding company policy statement, and an increased scope of banks eligible for longer examination cycles. Most prominently, we also adopted a simple measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banksâthe community bank leverage ratio. These measures also made our regulatory framework more efficient, tailoring the regulation of community banks to their risks.\n\nAnother key change to improve the efficiency of our framework was the introduction of the stress capital buffer requirement, which integrated our stress testing and regulatory capital frameworks. The stress capital buffer requirement is a firm-specific capital requirement that is calibrated based on the results of the stress test and was designed to provide a through-the-cycle, unified approach to capital distribution restrictions. This change enhanced our framework by better differentiating between firms that posed the most systemic risk and other large banks. Additionally, this change contributed to simplifying our capital framework by reducing the number of capital requirements to which large banks are subject from 18 to 8 without reducing its resiliencyâa material improvement in efficiency, and thus in the ability of banks to focus on service to customers rather than duplicative compliance\n\nForeign Banks In addition to tailoring regulation, we have tailored supervision. As an example, the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC) portfolio was adjusted in scope so that it now encompasses all Category I firms, or U.S. GSIBs, and only those foreign banks with U.S. operations that would be identified for Category I standards if they were housed within a bank holding company. The adjustment resulted in certain foreign banks being moved out of the LISCC portfolio and into a separate supervisory portfolio with all other foreign banks along with domestic banks of similar sizes and risk profiles. The removal of these foreign banks from the LISCC portfolio reflects their significantly reduced risk profile and size in the United Statesâsince 2008, the size of their combined U.S. assets has shrunk by about 50 percent and they have reduced the assets at their broker-dealers from a peak of $1.9 trillion in 2008 to $360 billion, a reduction of more than 80 percent. As a result of these substantial changes, it has clearly become appropriate to supervise the present-day U.S. operations of these foreign banks alongside domestic and foreign banks with a similar risk profile in our Large and Foreign Banking Organization (LFBO) portfolio.\n\nThis means that these organizations will be horizontally assessed against other foreign banks. By grouping foreign banks together, this portfolio reassignment enhances the ability of supervisors to take into account, in a comprehensive fashion, of the structural features and specific risks associated with the cross-border character of foreign banking operations in the United States. It is obviously incorrect to say that this is \"weaker\" supervision: these banks are subject to the same capital and liquidity requirements that they were before and the supervisors in our LFBO portfolio are expert public servants. Indeed, this approach may be more effective in identifying risks unique to foreign banks. For example, the Archegos exposures in foreign banks outside the United States that resulted in recent losses outside the United Statesâlosses that could not have been picked up by LISCC supervisionâmight have benefited from a supervisory structure that was more focused on foreign-bank-specific risks.\n\nThe Countercyclical Capital Buffer The third example of a decision we have made to improve the ability of the banking system to provide support to a strong economy has been our treatment of the countercyclical capital buffer, or CCyB. Large banks are subject to a potential CCyB, which is a macroprudential tool that allows the Board to dynamically adjust capital levels of large banking firms when the risks to financial stability have meaningfully changed. There were many calls from outside the Fed for us to activate the CCyB in the years before the COVID event. It is clear now that those calls were mistaken.\n\nThe Board's CCyB policy statement details the range of financial system vulnerabilities and other factors the Board may take into account as it evaluates settings for the buffer, including but not limited to, leverage in the financial sector, leverage in the nonfinancial sector, maturity and liquidity transformation in the financial sector, and asset valuation pressures. Our policy has been to maintain a 0 percent CCyB when vulnerabilities are within the normal range and, when they rise to a level meaningfully above normal, to increase the CCyB to a level that compensates for the rising vulnerabilities.\n\nAs you no doubt have noticed, we did not increase the CCyB in the strong economy before the COVID event. That is because we have a consistent, disciplined, and comprehensive framework that lays out the proper factors to evaluate when deciding to turn the CCyB on or off, and the framework did not suggest vulnerabilities were particularly high. That framework has guided our decisions over the past few years and provided clear and transparent guidance to the public.\n\nThe Federal Reserve should only turn on the CCyB in times of significant irrational exuberance; for example, in the face of a self-reinforcing cycle of borrowing and asset prices of the kind we saw in 2004â06. Yet, in my view, our through-the-cycle capital levelsâthat is, our fixed capital requirementsâin the United States have been set so high, that our CCyB is effectively already \"on.\" As a result, existing capital requirements for banks in the United States were already at a high enough level to maintain financial stability. When capital levels are sufficiently high, it would needlessly reduce the ability of firms to provide credit to their customers to turn on an additional capital requirement like the CCyB. Indeed, as I said at the time, the problem under our framework would instead be finding ways to turn down the CCyB thus embedded in our through-the-cycle capital requirements when the system was hit by a shock. Although the Fed had no formal CCyB to release when the COVID event struck, the U.S. banking system played a major role in taking deposits from, and extending credit to, households and businesses in 2020, and we did indeed have to take temporary measures to \"turn down\" our implied CCYB through limited exemptions to some of our capital requirements. The U.S. banking system performed very well in the COVID event compared to other jurisdictions that did have a CCyB that they released.\n\nThe Volcker Rule Finally, a fourth example: changes to the implementation of the Volcker rule that have had the effect of providing greater ability for banks to support dynamism and innovation through venture capital funds, including incentives for banks to make investments in low-income areas, benefitting different groups, including minority entrepreneurs.\n\nOver the past four years, the agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker rule have broadly simplified the rule's compliance requirements. We have adhered to the intent of the rule while providing greater clarity and certainty for permissible activities. In particular, the most recent revisions opened up opportunities for banks to invest in the communities they serve through a variety of fund structures without running afoul of the Volcker rule restrictions.\n\nOur clarification of the definition of \"covered funds\" in the Volcker rule has allowed banks to make a broader range of fund investments that support communities, with the confidence that they are permissible. In passing the Community Reinvestment Act, Congress found that regulated financial institutions have a continuing obligation to help meet the credit needs of their local communities, so it is eminently sensible that the Volcker rule regulations allow banks to meet these important obligations. 1\n\nOther changes finalized last year allow banks to make investments in rural business investment companies and qualified opportunity funds. Rural business investment companies promote economic development and job creation in rural areas, while qualified opportunity funds support long-term investments in economically distressed communities.\n\nTogether, these changes have given greater certainty to banks about what is permissible and what is not under the Volcker ruleâa clear efficiency gainâwhile also allowing them to make a broader range of investments that support innovative growth and benefit local communities.\n\nThe COVID Event These are just a few examples of changes we have made over the last four years that have bettered the ability of the system to perform its function of providing credit to households and businesses. But have we been as successful as the airlines in making efficiency improvements while continuing to make the system safer? That proposition faced a significant test in the spring of 2020, with the arrival of COVID-19 and the severe effects that measures to contain it had on the economy and financial system. It allowed us to gauge not only the resilience of our regulatory framework but the effectiveness of our efforts over the last four years to ensure that our framework did not hamper banks' ability to perform their critical function to lend to households and businesses and serve as financial intermediaries.\n\nWhen the COVID event began last year, the magnitude of the economic and financial disruptions was staggering. Voluntary and mandated quarantines, lockdowns, and social distancing efforts hammered aggregate demand, caused unfathomably large job losses clustered in certain service sectors, and sharply increased uncertainty. Workplaces closed, travel was curtailed, and global supply chains were disrupted. Large sectors of the global economy, such as tourism and transportation, came to an abrupt stop. As concerns about the virus and measures to contain it spread, these effects grew.\n\nAt the same time, certain critical financial markets seized up or ceased to function effectively. Short-term liquidity markets were strained as investors \"dashed for cash,\" focusing on their own liquidity. The commercial paper market, where companies raise cash by issuing short-term debt, seized up to an extent similar to the fall of 2008. And as in the financial crisis, investors in certain prime and tax-exempt money market funds with immediate cash needs submitted redemption requests that resulted in significant outflows from these funds. Equity prices plunged and yields on corporate bonds widened significantly. Perhaps I can simply underscore the peril of the time by noting that the Treasury marketâthe lifeblood of the financial systemâbecame highly dysfunctional, something that didn't even happen in 2008 or 2009. This was truly a massive global shock.\n\nAs businesses closed and consumers stayed home, 22 million jobs were lost in scarcely two months. The unemployment rate soared from 3.5 percent in February 2020 to 14.8 percent in April 2020, well above the highest rates experienced in the United States since the Great Depression. 2 In addition to the immediate and apparent impact of the COVID event, there was also tremendous uncertainty regarding the path of future government responses. Macroeconomic experts, both at the Federal Reserve, and elsewhere, constructed many different plausible scenarios for how the economy would fare, and this was reflected in scenario-writing related to stress tests. Our June 2020 stress tests included a sensitivity analysis, designed in April 2020, that used three alternative downside scenarios that spanned the wide range of projections made at that time by professional forecasters. Those scenarios included peak unemployment rates ranging from 16 percent to 19.5 percent and assumed no additional fiscal measures to support the economy.\n\nSo how did the bank regulatory system do? By any measure, quite well.\n\nEntering the COVID event, the banking system was fortified by over 10 years of work to improve safety and soundness, both by regulators and by banks themselves. Higher levels of capital and liquidity, better risk management, and more robust systems enabled the banking system to absorb an unprecedented shockâwhile providing refuge from market instability, delivering essential public aid, and working constructively to support borrowers and communities. In short, the full set of post-2008 reformsâas refined and recalibrated by the work of the last four yearsâensured that this time would truly be different than the last. With respect to capital, banks actually built capital during the COVID event, thanks to actions from regulators and their own voluntary actions, even despite setting aside close to $100 billion in loan loss reserves. The aggregate common equity tier 1 capital ratio for the banking system in the second half of 2020 materially exceeded its pre-COVID-event level. Capital ratios remain well above regulatory minimums for all firms. Banks also strengthened their liquidity positions during the COVID event, primarily due to an influx of deposits and their reinvestment in reserves. The share of bank liquid assets as a share of total assets far exceeds the pre-COVID-event metric.\n\nBanks also served as a source of strength to the economy. With respect to lending, businesses were able to draw on pre-existing credit lines to meet the massive demands for cash. Banks of all sizes also funded the bulk of the more than $795 billion in Paycheck Protection Program loans. According to our weekly data, commercial and industrial loans increased $715 billion between the week of February 26th and their peak on May 13th. For millions of struggling households, interest and principal payments on loans were delayed. In addition, through May 2021, more than $2.2 trillion of central bank reserves and roughly $3.7 trillion of deposits had been absorbed by banks.\n\nOverall, the regulatory framework for banks constructed after the financial crisis, with the refinements and recalibrations we have made over the last few years, has held up well. The banking system remained strong and resilient, and banks served as a source of strength to the economy, and our stress tests indicated this would have been the case even without the substantial fiscal assistance provided to the rest of the economy. We have already learned many new lessons regarding our financial system during this experience. One lesson in particular I wanted to highlight is that our rigorous, forward-looking capital framework, which includes the stress capital buffer, works very effectively. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, we required large banks to resubmit their capital plans and restricted their capital distributions. Those restrictions are slated to end following this quarter if large banks perform well on the upcoming stress test. While it was sensible at the time, given that this was the first real world test of our system, for us to use the belt and suspenders approach of additional, temporary capital distribution restrictions, we now know that we can have particular confidence in the stress capital buffer framework, as it is informed by a real-time stress testing regime. In the future, having learned the lessons of this test, we will be able to rely on the automatic restrictions of our carefully developed framework when the stress test tells us the system will be resilient, rather than using ad hoc and roughly improvised limitations. 3\n\nWe cannot say, however, that the entirety of the financial system performed well, even parts that were subject to reforms following the financial crisis. As I have mentioned previously, the run on prime money funds and commercial paper were particularly concerning, as they resembled the runs faced during the financial crisis, despite subsequent reforms to those markets. The government had to step in yet again to stem the outflows from the prime money funds to stabilize financial markets. Addressing the shortcomings we saw among non-banks continues to be a focus of both domestic policymakers and the international community, particularly under my chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board. We cannot afford to allow the same things to happen again.\n\nIn the end, our banking system performed well over the challenges of the last year. U.S. banks remain in good condition. First-quarter data showed that aggregate capital ratios increased, and banks continued to maintain ample levels of liquidity. We must, of course, remain vigilant in safeguarding our banking system. New threats can, and will, emerge. In a few weeks, we will learn the results of our annual stress test and will publicly release an update on the health of large banks, evaluating their balance sheets against a quite severe hypothetical recession. The COVID event did, however, serve to reinforce that the safeguards we have built and maintained since the financial crisis have passed the strictest stress test of all.\n\n1. 12 U.S.C. 2901(a)(3).

    "text": "July 07, 2020\n\nVice Chair for Supervision and Chair of the Financial Stability Board Randal K. Quarles\n\nAt the Exchequer Club, Washington, D.C. (via webcast)\n\nGood afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I would like to thank the Exchequer Club for hosting this event, and I look forward to future events taking us back to the luncheon discussions at the Mayflower Hotel, as has been the club's tradition now for over half a century.\n\nThis afternoon I will consider the challenges that the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and, especially, the containment measures taken by many governments in response (which together I will call the \"COVID event\") pose for the financial system and international cooperation on financial stability. I will do so in the context of a report that the Financial Stability Boardâthe FSBâpublished last week, evaluating the progress we have made in addressing the too-big-to-fail problem for banks. The evaluation has relevant and timely things to say about the resilience of banks, and the financial system more generally, during this time.\n\nThe COVID Event: An Unprecedented Policy Response to an Unprecedented Economic Shock Let me start with the challenges posed by the COVID event for financial stability. The containment measures of the COVID event represent the biggest test that the financial system has faced since the global financial crisis of 2007-08. After years of reforms, we now face a real life stress test even more severe than those previously hypothesized. But unlike the global financial crisis, this shock originated from outside the financial system.\n\nThe first phase of the impact of the COVID event on the financial system was the market turmoil we experienced in March. This was the result of severe uncertainty triggering major re-pricing and volatility in global financial markets, disrupting the flow of credit to the economy. We saw many examples of a \"dash for cash,\" with firms drawing down their lines of credit with banks, and the indiscriminate sale of assets by investors in order to obtain liquidity.\n\nThe policy response by central banks and governments to this liquidity shock was rapid and decisive. The authorities worked together to address the problem through a combination of monetary, fiscal, and regulatory measures. These interventions led to rapid improvements in financial markets. Credit spreads have narrowed for both investment-grade and high-yield bonds, markets are functioning in an orderly manner, and credit provision to the economy has held up.\n\nHowever, the COVID event is not behind us yet. Many households and businesses remain under pressure. According to the latest International Monetary Fund forecast, the global economy is projected to contract sharply by 4.9 percent in 2020, a much worse outcome than during the 2007â08 financial crisis. While some indicators suggest a rebound in activity, the path of recovery remains highly uncertain.\n\nBanks entered the current crisis in a much stronger position than they did the global financial crisis. They are much better capitalized and more liquid than back in 2008. This is a direct outcome of the G20 regulatory reforms adopted in the aftermath of that crisis and measures taken by the banking industry, which have improved the resilience of the core of the financial system. This has allowed the banking system to absorb rather than amplify the current macroeconomic shock. It has also enabled banks to play a central role in measures to support the flow of credit to the economy. A number of stress tests carried out recently in FSB jurisdictions have confirmed that banks are able to continue lending even in the face of this extreme shock.\n\nLess than two weeks ago, we at the Federal Reserve concluded that our banks would generally remain well capitalized under a range of extremely harsh hypothetical downside scenarios stemming from the COVID event. Even with that demonstrated strength, howeverâgiven the high levels of uncertaintyâwe took a number of prudent steps to help conserve the capital in the banking system.\n\nWe know that the financial system will face more challenges. The corporate sector entered the crisis with high levels of debt and has necessarily borrowed more during the event. And many households are facing bleak employment prospects. The next phase will inevitably involve an increase in non-performing loans and provisions as demand falls and some borrowers fail.\n\nThe official sector is providing a rapid and coordinated response to support the real economy, maintain financial stability, and minimize the risk of market fragmentation. The FSB is overseeing international cooperation and coordination of the responses of financial authorities to the COVID event.\n\nToo-Big-to-Fail Reforms Have Made Banks More Resilient and Able to Support the Economy This brings us to the FSB's evaluation of too-big-to fail reforms. I should note at the outset that the analysis was conducted before the onset of the COVID event. Nevertheless, a number of its conclusions are relevant to policymakers and market participants in the current situation.\n\nWe should first cast our minds back to the global financial crisis. While the issue of \"too big to fail\" had occupied regulators and finance professionals for decades, it was in the 2008 crisis that the contours of the too-big-to-fail problem in a globalized world became clear. In 2010 Mervyn King, the then Governor the Bank of England, noted that \"most large complex financial institutions are globalâat least in life if not in death.\" In this pithy sentence, he summed up the challenge policymakers faced.\n\nDecades of bank expansion and cross-border integration had provided many economic and social benefits, such as the ability to finance global supply chains. However, the web of relationships and exposures had become complex and opaque. When big banks ran into trouble during the financial crisis, regulators faced a stark choice: disorderly failure or taxpayer-funded bailouts.\n\nAt the heart of the problems faced by authorities at the time were two issues:\n\nDrawing on the lessons from the crisis, the G20 Leaders endorsed a package of reforms to tackle these two problems for systemically important banks. This package comprised:\n\nI mentioned earlier that banks have entered this crisis in a position of strength. Bank capital has increased significantly. For global systemically important banksâGâSIBsâtier 1 capital ratios have doubled since 2011 to 14 percent. This is a combined a result both of the Basel III reforms agreed in 2010 and of independently improved decision-making at our large banks. But the too-big-to-fail evaluation also finds that the capital surcharges for systemically important banks have contributed to enhanced resilience. Moreover, banks in advanced economies have built up significant loss-absorbing and recapitalization capacity by issuing instruments that can bear losses in the event of resolution.\n\nSupervisors and firms are better equipped to deal with problems that occur. Supervisory oversight of systemically important banks has learned the lessons of the crisis and has added a macroprudential perspective. The Basel III framework introduced additional capital and liquidity buffers, which are intended to be usable in a downturn to help maintain the flow of credit to the real economy.\n\nSignificant Progress in Making Banks Resolvable Before the global financial crisis, the resolution of failing banks was a niche subject. In hindsight, most authorities around the world had given it far too little attention. This was the main reason why authorities had so few options for our global systemic banks in the middle of the crisis.\n\nThings have changed, and for the better. Resolution authorities have sprung up or have been strengthened around the world. And resolution frameworks provide these authorities with the powers to resolve a systemically important bank in a manner that maintains financial stability and reduces taxpayer exposure.\n\nThe FSB's evaluation shows that investors increasingly expect failing banks to be resolved rather than bailed out. The funding cost advantages enjoyed by systemically important banks have fallen. Market prices suggest that investors are now pricing the risk of having losses imposed on them in the event of a bank failure. For most jurisdictions that are home to G-SIBs, credit rating agencies no longer assume governments will bail them out.\n\nRecovery and resolution planning has improved banks' capabilities to produce timely, accurate and granular information. Timely information in a crisis is key to assessing the scale of a problem and to deciding what to do about it. This additional information has already proved helpful to both banks and authorities during the pandemic.\n\nTaken together, these resilience and resolution reforms lower the probability of banks failing, reduce the consequences and costs of a bank failure, and provide additional options for dealing with failing banks that simply did not exist before the global financial crisis.\n\nReforms Are Achieving Their Policy Objectives But More Work Is Needed We have to ask ourselves, however, whether we have addressed the problem set out by Mervyn King in the wake of the global financial crisis. Can authorities now resolve complex international banks without recourse to public funds, while maintaining financial stability? And does the coordinated international approach we have now adopted provide for effective resolution of banks, by ensuring that while they are global in life, we also have a global solution in death?\n\nThe FSB evaluation provides evidence that the reforms are indeed achieving their objectives. We are moving to a world in which G-SIBs can be global in life and orderly in death. We think that we are getting closer to a solution to the problem framed by Mervyn King. We have an internationally coordinated response grounded in national law. By pre-positioning loss-absorbing resources in life, and planning for an orderly resolution in the event of failure, we can provide the policymakers who come after us with more options than they had in the great financial crisis if they are faced with future systemic financial stress.\n\nThere is, of course, more to do. The benefits of reforms cannot be realized unless they are operationalized. All FSB jurisdictions need to implement resolution reforms and to improve their resolution capabilities so they are fully prepared to respond to a bank failure or a crisis.\n\nThe FSB's evaluation shows that systemically important banks remain very complex, highlighting the importance of resolution planning. The evaluation also highlights gaps in the information available to public authorities and to the FSB and standard setters, which reduces their ability to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of resolution regimes. The FSB continues its work to ensure that banks, other financial institutions and market infrastructures can be effectively and safely resolved. These are issues on which we will need to reflect and work further.\n\nThe financial landscape is also changing, and the FSB needs to be responsive. The FSB's monitoring shows that the share of bank assets as a percentage of total financial assets has dropped from 46 percent in 2008 to 39 percent in 2018. As non-bank financial institutions increase their market share, risks have moved outside the banking system. The market turmoil in March underlines the need to better understand the risks in non-bank financial intermediation and reap the benefits of this dynamic part of the financial system without undermining financial stability.\n\nThere may be lessons for us to learn about the framework that we need to apply to this sector, which is different fromâand less developed thanâthe one used for banks. At the FSB, we established earlier this year a balanced working group of bank and nonbank authorities to look closely and concretely at these issues, and the COVID event has given focus and vitality to this effort. Separately, we have already announced that our next evaluation will examine the post-crisis reforms to money market funds, which were once again front and center in the COVID event.\n\nFinally, we want to hear from you. Our consultation closes on 30 September. We are keen to receive responses from a wide range of stakeholders. I would highlight the need for responses to be grounded in evidence. The FSB will take account of feedback to the consultation and publish a final report in early 2021. This will also provide us with additional evidence on how banks have responded to the pandemic and any lessons learned for our evaluation.\n\nI look forward to your questions.",

    "text": "December 11, 2020\n\nVice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles\n\nAt the Federal Reserve Board, Harvard Law School, and Wharton School Conference: Bank Supervision: Past, Present, and Future (via webcast)\n\nTorrential thanks to our partners Harvard Law School and The Wharton School for organizing this conference, and to the Federal Reserve staff who have played a key role. And an equally huge thanks to all of the moderators and panelists who are participating in today's event and to all of you who are tuning in. I have very much enjoyed the discussion so far, and I hope that the conference will encourage both more and a wider variety of academic work on bank supervision.\n\nIn many respects, the focus of today's conference on bank supervision, rather than regulation, and the relatively recent efflorescence of scholarly attention to that topic, are welcome new developments. In other respects, however, the question of the proper scope of bank supervision is not a new topic at all. In going through some family papers recently, I came across this cri de coeur from one Elton Hall, president of a small bank in Victor, Idaho, as quoted in the Teton Valley News in November, 1921:\n\nThe government has so governed [my] bank that [I] no longer knew who owned it. I am inspected, examined and re-examined, informed, required, restrained, and commanded. . . . I am supposed to be an inexhaustible supply of money . . . , and because I will not sell all I have and go out and beg, borrow, or steal money to give away, I have been cussed, discussed, boycotted, talked to, talked about, lied to, lied about, held up, hung up, robbed and nearly drained, and the only reason I am clinging to life is to see what in hell is coming off next.\n\nWere Mr. Hall transported to the District of Columbia in 2020, he would immediately realize that he had clearly had no idea what was \"coming off next\" if he had thought he was over-imposed upon in Idaho's Teton Valley in the winter of 1921. But before the bankers in the congregation become too inclined to commiserate with him, I should note that the reason I know anything about Mr. Hall, and the reason his quote is among those family papers, is because his bank failed not so many years thereafter, as did nearly half the small banks in the country between 1920 and 1930. Mr. Hall's bank on the western slope of the Tetons was acquired by a visionary young banker from Utah by the name of Marriner Eccles. This was during the Roaring '20s, well before the Great Depression and the Banking Crisis of 1933. Before the evolution of modern supervisory practices, bank failures were extremely common, even in boom times.\n\nSo, how should we think about this new, yet very old, question? I'd like to begin as many of you have today, by focusing first on regulationâas a way of throwing into relief some key issues that are both important and hard about its cousin supervision.\n\nOne of my goals at the Board of Governors has been to make our regulatory framework simpler, more consistent, more predictable, and more efficient. This approach is not new. It draws on many decades of practical experience and public policy analysis. At its most basic, this approach rests on the premise that we should continuously challenge ourselves to make sure that our policies are achieving their intended objectives, based on evidence and a data-driven assessment of their impact on the public.\n\nThese principlesâsimplicity, consistency, and predictabilityâare all connected to what is perhaps a more fundamental principle of regulation, and indeed of law itselfâtransparency. Transparency makes the intent of regulators clear and their actions more predictable to those regulated. Regulations are more effective when they are well understood and more effective when their predictability and consistency build respect for the fairness of regulation that encourages compliance. Transparency helps guard against regulation that is arbitrary or capricious. Transparency is enshrined in statutory process protections such as those in the Administrative Procedure Act, which facilitates understanding and communication.\n\nAll these principlesâsimplicity, predictability, transparency, efficiencyâlead to better regulatory outcomes. All other things equal, simpler rules are better because they are easier to understand, to implement by banks, and to supervise by examiners. Predictable, consistent, and clear rules are more effective because they are consistent across firms and over time. In addition, we develop rules through an iterative process that takes place in the open. Through this process we learn about potentially unanticipated consequencesâwhich allows us to avoid these surprises, which are in no one's interest. The public comment process also naturally facilitates a dialogue with the organizations that would be subject to the rules, as well as any interested party, helping the government to produce a regulatory framework that takes into account both benefits and costs. A focus on efficiency helps ensure that we avoid any unnecessary burden and externalities.\n\nWe relied on these principles in establishing the new regulatory framework in the wake of the global financial crisis. The essential elements of that frameworkâwhich now includes dynamic and risk-sensitive capital requirements and rules-based, quantitative liquidity standardsâall reflect extensive and significant consultations with the public and careful analysis of the impact that these rules will have on individual banks and the U.S. banking system. Our benchmark for capital adequacy is now based on standardized measures of risk and leverage across all banks. This is supplemented by an annual stress test with extensive transparency and disclosure around the process and results that provides additional, consistent risk sensitivity. We now regulate liquidity as one of our enhanced prudential standards for large banks, with two clear quantitative standardsâthe short-term liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and long-term net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirementsâand clear expectations for liquidity risk management, articulated in a regulation that went through a public notice and comment process.\n\nPartly as a product of these improvements, we have made our regulations more efficient by better differentiating among risks. Our capital rules require firms that hold riskier positions either to maintain capital that addresses those risks or to take steps to de-risk. Our liquidity rules similarly require firms with more unstable funding to hold more liquid assets or to improve the stability of their funding. In addition, last year the Board adopted changes to our overall regulatory capital and liquidity frameworks that differentiates among the systemic risks presented by individual banks. Under the revised framework, the most complex, systemically important firms are subject to the most stringent requirements, and less-complex firms are subject to less-stringent requirements. In the long run, these changes will lead to fairer, more efficient results, while preserving the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system and broader financial stability.\n\nBecause of the improved regulatory framework in place early this year, banks were in a strong position to deal with the challenges of the COVID event. For example, in March of this year, customers of U.S. banks drew down nearly $480 billion on existing lines of credit to cover cash needs during the severe disruption in revenues in the early days of the COVID eventâby far the largest monthly increase in history. Banks were able to fund these loans without notable problems in part by drawing on liquidity buffers created by the new regulatory system. They have not only maintained, but actually increased their capital during this timeânotwithstanding the large provisions taken earlier in the year. And they have continued to extend credit throughout the protracted evolution of the COVID event, to this point largely satisfying the demand for credit in the economy.\n\nOf course, having clear, consistent, predictable, and efficient rules of the game is not the end of the story. Our rules are not an academic exercise. They represent concrete, binding requirements on real people and real businesses. Our obligations to the public mean we need to verify that our rules are being followed, detect emerging risks, and make sure any deficiencies are swiftly addressed. This is the task of the bank supervisor, rather than the bank regulator.\n\nRegulation and supervision are different tasks, and I have spent this time reviewing how we have pursued the goals of simplicity, predictability, transparency, and efficiency in regulation in part to lay the groundwork for showing how much harder it is to pursue those goals in the realm of supervision. Regulation and supervision both flow from the statutory authority granted to the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies by Congress establishing our duty to promote a safe and sound banking system. Regulation does that on a generalized, system-wide basis. Supervision, in contrast to regulation, looks at firm-specific issues, such as how a firm's idiosyncratic risks are evaluated under our regulations, and at risk-management frameworks that cannot easily be assessed through standardized risk measures. For example, while our capital rules require banks to hold a specific level of capital, our exams focus on subjects such as the plans of management to make sure they can meet those capital requirements on an ongoing basis. Supervisors summarize the results of these examinations and their overall assessment of a firm in the form of a supervisory rating, the importance of which I will discuss shortly.\n\nThe progress we have made on regulation creates an opportunity for us to focus more of our attention on supervision and the principles of simpler, more consistent, more predictable, and more efficient supervisory standards. For example, because the Board found that there had been significant improvements in risk management since the global financial crisis, we removed the \"qualitative objection\" from our stress testing process. 1 Similarly, we simplified our capital framework through the introduction of a stress capital buffer (SCB) requirement. 2 How should supervision evolve in light of the new stronger and more comprehensive regulatory edifice we now have in place?\n\nAn example: after we emerge from the COVID event, we will no longer need to maintain temporary limitations on capital distributions by large banks and can instead rely on the regulatory capital framework that the Board established earlier this yearâthe SCB. Among its many advantages, under this framework we will no longer need to review periodic requests from banks for additional capital distributions. Instead, the SCB sets a clear and explicit capital target that firms must stay above at all times. As a result, firms can rely on that SCB target to define how much capital they can distribute in any given calendar quarter. This is a better process because it is more predictable and more efficient.\n\nThat said, we may still want to conduct a limited review of the capital plans of banks to give some insight into risks that the stress test might not fully pick up. For example, if a firm enters a new line of business and does not yet have a good framework for assuring its managers can measure the results of that business in light of its risks, supervision can detect that shortcoming and the firm can help address this vulnerability before the uncaptured risks materialize. Similarly, our new long-term stable funding ruleâthe NSFR ruleâprovides objective standards to address risks that fall outside the boundaries of our short-term funding requirementâthe LCR ruleâand thereby takes some pressure off supervisors to monitor these risks on a case-by-case basis. However, the LCR and NSFR do not address all sources of liquidity risk, and poor dynamic liquidity risk management can lead to a firm's failure just as surely as a present-tense lack of liquidity. In these ways, bank supervision can act as an early warning system and identify risks before they metastasize into problems that drain a firm's financial resources or liquidity position.\n\nYet as important as the practice of supervision is, these examples also show that it is inherently more judgmental, nuanced, discretionary, variable, and opaque than the practice of regulation. And variability and opacity breed distrust, even when that distrust is not at all merited. The point here is that all the benefits that come from simplicity, predictability, and transparency would be equally valuable in supervisionâbut necessarily much harder to obtain while maintaining the benefits of supervision, which are substantial if we are not to return to a world where half the small banks in the country will fail during one of the most prosperous decades in our history.\n\nKeeping all this in mind, and given the success of our refinement of the overall regulatory framework, I believe it is natural to reflect on our overall supervisory communications, including our supervisory ratings framework, to consider ways to simplify it and make it more efficient, and especially make our ratings more consistent and more predictable. We already have a good deal of transparency around our supervisory standardsâwe publish our supervisory manuals, we publish guidance, and we seek public comment on the most significant guidance. We also recently published standards for how we would assign firms to the large institution supervision coordinating committee, or LISCC, portfolio. 3 However, in contrast to the rulemaking process, and in order to appropriately protect a bank's confidential business information, the vast majority of the communication about the bank supervision process takes place confidentially. The most notable exceptions are when we find material deficiencies at a bank and take a public enforcement action to correct them.\n\nSupervisory ratings are an interesting and special case because they are confidential communications that can have public consequences. A supervisory rating is a confidential assessment of the strength of a bank in one or more risk areas, or, in some cases, a composite view of the aggregate risks facing the bank. Ratings have the obvious benefit of summarizing the overall condition of a firm. Among other considerations, this summary includes qualitative judgments about risk management and an assessment of whether the firm is in compliance with applicable regulations, such as capital and liquidity requirements. Ratings also promote comparative analysis across firms that face similar risks.\n\nRatings date back to the first half of the 20th century, and possibly earlier, when they were used to classify banks, in much the same way as examiners assign ratings today. 4 The modern version of ratings was the result of the establishment by Congress of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) in 1978. The FFIEC established the \"CAMEL\" rating system in the same year to promote consistent examination practices across depository institutions. The Federal Reserve followed suit with a supervisory rating system for bank holding companies in 1979. Since that time, ratings have become enshrined in the federal banking laws. In particular, they play a role in interstate branching requirements and in determining whether or not holding companies can engage in expanded financial activities.\n\nWhile the ratings themselves remain confidential supervisory information, the Federal Reserve has taken steps to provide information to the public around the rating process. For example, the standards we use to assign the ratings have always been published. In addition, the Board has sought public comment on the two most recent iterations of its ratings systems for holding companies, the RFI rating system and the LFI rating system. 5 And in the past year, the Board began publishing aggregate data on supervisory ratingsâorganized by different bank cohortsâas part of its report on bank supervision. 6\n\nOne concept that is inextricably linked to a supervisory rating is whether or not a firm is \"well managed.\" By law, in order to be well managed a firm must have at least a satisfactory management rating, if any is given by its supervisor, and a firm also must have at least a satisfactory overall or composite rating. When the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act expanded the range of financial activities that were permissible for companies that own banks, such as securities underwriting and insurance underwriting, it did so with certain conditions. To elect to be a \"financial holding company\" and be eligible to engage in these types of expanded financial activities, a bank holding company and its lead depository institution subsidiary, among other things, must be and remain well-managed. 7\n\nBecause of these significant consequences, I believe it is appropriate to take note of the process distinctions between the development of rules and the development of supervisory ratings. Rules are drafted in full view of the public, subject to a comment period before they become final, and federal agencies have an obligation to provide a rationale for their rules. In contrast, supervisory ratings are confidential and have immediate effect. Banks are not permitted to disclose them. Although, as I have discussed, there are published standards as to how bank supervisors should assign these ratings, there will always be borderline cases and close calls, and these decisions are made out of the view of the public.\n\nThere are at least two reasons why it is critical that we get ratings correct. The first is that the supervisory rating is the most important communication that we have with firms. It encapsulates our expert judgment of the firm and lets the firm know how its performance compares with our standards. And second, as discussed, ratings have material real-world consequences. A firm with unsatisfactory ratings faces significant competitive disadvantages relative to firms deemed to be satisfactory. As noted, these firms are prohibited from expanding their range of financial activities and will generally face headwinds in acquisitions.\n\nSince the financial crisis, our supervisors have identified potential weaknesses at firms and encouraging them to address those weaknesses. And firms now have substantially stronger and more resilient risk-management systems. They are better able to identify, measure, and manage their risks. These improvements have not gone unnoticed. As our supervision report demonstrates, the overall ratings trajectory in the industry has been quite positive. 8\n\nThere are some straightforward steps we could take to simplify our ratings, with no loss of effectiveness. We already have a model for a simpler ratings framework. The new framework that applies to our largest firms, the LFI ratings framework, focuses on the three areas that are the core of our supervisory focus: capital, liquidity, and governance. 9 We could consider a similar simplification to the RFI rating system that applies to less-systemic holding companies and the CAMELS ratings system that applies to depository institutions. In terms of improving regulatory efficiency through ratings, being clearer to firms about how we apply these standards would help to promote a more efficient banking system. In particular, we could be clearer about how we weight the various factors that generate the rating. Banks could benefit because they would be better positioned to anticipate supervisory feedback and understand what steps they need to take to improve their ratings. Supervisors can benefit by being grounded in more predictable criteria.\n\nMy concern is that, despite the fact that our examiners have used ratings for almost 100 years, we don't have a particularly well-developed theory of ratingsâprinciples regarding the internal processes and standards that promote consistency and predictability in our assessment of the condition of banks. As I've discussed, there is broad agreement that ratings are a beneficial, even necessary, part of bank supervision. Yet we have very few studies or other empirical support for this conclusion. This stands in sharp contrast to the analysis behind the long list of regulatory achievements that I mentioned. To give an example, we have a pretty good idea, grounded in economic analysis, about how much capital a global systemically important bank, or G-SIB, needs to maintain to promote its safety and soundness but not nearly as much support for our view about where to draw the line between a satisfactory rating and an unsatisfactory rating. For example, at a large global financial firm, what should be the difference between a satisfactory and unsatisfactory rating on capital planning, provided the firm otherwise has strong capital levels? Where should we draw that line? How do we decide the close calls, and what is our default for ties?\n\nI don't know what the right answer is, and I suspect that it will vary depending on the circumstances. Although there will be a range of qualitative factors that affect our conclusion, it must be the case that we can learn from our previous experiences and distill a presumptive answer. That sort of approach, one grounded in analysis and based on evidence, has ably supported our regulatory framework. I would like to see what science can bring to ratings. I think this could be especially helpful in terms of the consistency and predictability of ratings. Since ratings are assigned by humans and humans are fallible, being more deliberate about the processes behind them can only help us. While we have made some progress in making ratings simpler and therefore more efficient, and more consistent with actual supervisory practices, I would like to see our approach to ratings made more express and deliberate. Since the global financial crisis, the Fed, along with the other prudential supervisors, has implemented a number of controls to improve consistency and support appropriate calibration of ratings, as we view them internally. We have tools in place to monitor ratings and detect whether there is any unusual variability in them. I suspect there is more work that could be done to use evidence and make sure our processes facilitate consistent results.\n\nAs I have alluded to, most of these efforts have been inward-facing, and we could benefit from efforts to show the public that our ratings are consistent and predictable. I see two paths to achieve this goal. One of those is oriented toward processes and procedures. One is more substantive. They are not mutually exclusive.\n\nIn terms of processes and procedures, there is always the question of whether ratings are consistent when administered in different circumstances by different people. I would like to explore approaches to ratings that would yield similar results when those ratings are assigned by different staff and across different points in time. One way to do this would be to subject ratings to the scrutiny of multiple parties with a range of perspectives and experiences. This is how the public rating agencies, such as Moody's, Fitch, and S&P, approach ratings, through ratings committees. And this is how we approach rating the largest, most systemically important firms through the LISCC, where a committee that includes independent Federal Reserve experts has an opportunity to provide feedback on the ratings of the firms in the LISCC portfolio. Designing this process so that it is reliably consistent and predictable for all banks is an area we should study further. Another method we could explore is to dedicate some portion of our exam work to reviewing compliance with concrete regulatory standards, such as some of our liquidity risk-management standards, where the standards lend themselves to that approach. And we would commit in advance to giving the findings from these reviews a particular weight in our ratings discussions. I think this overall modelâwhere the supervisory assessment is vetted by a Federal Reserve committee with independent views, or at least reviewed by staff within the Federal Reserve outside the normal assessment process, and where we explicitly take compliance with regulatory standards into account in assigning ratingsâcould be a good one for helping to promote greater consistency and predictability, especially in cases where the subject matter lends itself to such standards.\n\nAnother process improvement involves guidance. At times, we find it helpful to elaborate on our regulatory standards through supervisory guidance. Some risk areas that don't easily lend themselves to regulation, such as certain kinds of risk management, also can benefit from supervisory guidance. In both cases, we can enhance the predictability of our supervisory process by inviting public feedback on any applicable guidance or other supervisory standards. For example, in connection with a recent rule on our capital planning requirements, we invited public feedback on our outstanding supervisory guidance on capital distributions for firms of all sizes. In the recent past, we also have sought comment on our approach to risks associated with governance and internal controls. We will continue to look for feedback on our guidance. All of these approaches will improve the predictability of our ratings and also improve their legitimacy.\n\nIn terms of substantive changes to show the public that ratings are consistent and predictable, my lodestar would be to rely wherever possible on empirical analysis to direct our policy choices and to be open to change where supported by this analysis. As supervisors, we should be extremely supportive of efforts to better understand ratings as an assessment and communication tool, as well as those that make our supervision processes have more repeatable outcomes. We should encourage our examiners and economists to conduct more empirical analysis around supervisory ratings. For example, some recent scholarship suggests ratings can have a positive impact on reducing the insolvency risk of supervised firms. 10 We should do more analysis and careful examination to identify what drove those results.\n\nAs we conduct this analysis, my sense is that we should focus on two main variables: the consequences of the ratings that I've describedâfor example, a firm having its activities or acquisitions curtailedâand whether or not these consequences are properly calibrated relative to the circumstances that gave rise to the rating. To illustrate, let's return to the earlier example of a firm with a deficiency related to the risk management of its capital adequacy but that has proven itself through our stress tests to have sufficient financial resources. In contrast, imagine a bank that does not share the risk-management deficiency but whose stress test results indicate that the firm has inadequate capital. Our assessment for both firms may be that each should receive an unsatisfactory capital rating.\n\nIn my opinion (and I acknowledge that there are some who would reasonably disagree with me) between the two firms, the firm that faces a potential capital shortfall should be the graver concern. Yet, the essential message to both firms and a likely consequence of the ratingâthe risk of falling out of well-managed statusâis identical. To me, this outcome makes no sense. Why should the firm that is objectively weaker face the same consequences as the firm that is objectively stronger?\n\nAlthough the law dictates the most material consequences of an unsatisfactory management rating, we have the authority to define that rating and its calibration, as well as to define any additional supervisory consequences that are not prescribed in the law. I believe it is well worth our while to consider this calibration. Accordingly, I have directed Board staff to look into the following issues:\n\nFirst, the placement of the qualitative elements of our ratings frameworks. There is somewhat more discretion in applying these elements relative to the quantitative regulatory requirements. These elements traditionally have been spread across all the ratings components, including capital and liquidity. Is this the best placement?\n\nSecond, ways of being clearer to the public about how we, as supervisors, weight the qualitative and quantitative elements of our ratings. How could we best go about communicating this weighting? Are the relative weights that we apply correct?\n\nThird, the conclusions, if any, we can draw about the effectiveness of our new LFI ratings framework relative to our RFI ratings framework. For example, has the lack of a composite rating in the LFI ratings framework been beneficial from a supervisory communications standpoint, as intended?\n\nIf our ratings are poorly calibrated, we run the risk of being less effective in our supervision. We also could be providing aggregate ratings that are misleading. Although I believe our examiners do rate banks accurately and dispassionately, based on our written standards, a closer look would help identify any instances where that's not the case and what improvements and changes might be needed.\n\nI believe the Federal Reserve has a duty to assess our supervisory practices with the same vigor as we have assessed our regulations. Providing ratings that are based on well-calibrated, consistent, and predictable standards can only be to the benefit of everyone. Even if we were to make no changes to our ratings frameworks, going through the process of assessing this calibration will surely provide a valuable learning experience. It would also increase our conviction in the legitimacy of our ratings frameworks and our confidence as a prudential supervisor.\n\nThank you. I look forward to the discussion that follows.\n\n1. During CCAR, supervisors make a \"qualitative assessment\" of a firm's capital planning process. Formerly, firms with a deficient capital planning process were subject to an objection by the Federal Reserve of the firm's capital plan, which resulted in limitations on the firm's capital distributions. The Board removed this requirement in 2019 because of the progress firms had made in improving their capital planning practices. See 84 Fed. Reg. 8953 (March 13, 2019). Return to text\n\n2.

    "text": "July 11, 2021\n\nVice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles\n\nAt the Venice International Conference on Climate Change, Venice, Italy\n\nIntroduction Thank you for inviting me today. It is an honor to be here and, after more than a year of remote conversations, it is truly wonderful to see so many people in person.\n\nAs Chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), I have the privilege of collaborating with the Italian G20 Presidency, the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, and with the FSB membership on the most pressing issues affecting financial stability. 1 Among those issues, one of increasing focus is understanding and monitoring climate-related financial risks. Given the global nature of climate change, this demands a coordinated international effort.\n\nThe FSB published last Wednesday a Climate Roadmap that presents a comprehensive and coordinated plan to address climate-related financial risks. The FSB's roadmap dovetails with the ongoing work of the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG) to develop a broader sustainable finance roadmap.\n\nToday, in my role as Chair of the FSB, I would like to focus on the two foundational components of the FSB roadmap: disclosures and data. Globally consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosures, as well as a broader set of high-quality, relevant data, together, can provide the basis to assess climate-related financial risks and the impact on financial stability.\n\nDisclosure The FSB was an early leader in bringing attention to the importance of reliable, entity-level disclosures to assess and manage climate-related financial risks and opportunities. In 2015, the FSB submitted a proposal to the G20 to create an industry-led disclosure task force on climate-related risks. 2 The work of this FSB-sponsored Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD, has led to greater recognition of the importance of climate-related financial risk and of comparable and reliable disclosure. The early development of industry-led recommendations and a usable framework by users and producers of this information was critical. The four core elements of the TCFD recommendations have provided a widely accepted framework for disclosuresâcovering governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The task force has continued to provide significant support to those seeking to disclose and has encouraged steadily increasing uptake. These initial steps greatly helped to define appropriate parameters, drive towards consistency, and give the public sector a running start in developing their own approaches.\n\nNow it is time to build on that work. It will be useful to establish a globally consistent baseline standard for climate-related disclosures. Globally consistent and comparable entity-level disclosures by non-financial companies, banks, insurers, and asset managers are increasingly important to market participants and financial authorities as a means of providing information needed to assess and manage risks.\n\nThe G20 Presidency, in developing its 2021 work program, asked the FSB to encourage more consistency in disclosure practices. As a start, the FSB surveyed what financial authorities across our membership were doing to promote disclosures. Almost all our members have already set requirements, guidance, or expectations or plan to do so. We found some heterogeneity in the approaches they were taking. Some members prefer mandated disclosure while others would make it voluntary. There is also variation in the desired scope of disclosures. However, there is a trend towards an important baseline that focuses on one-way materialityâor the financial risk that climate change could have on a particular entityâbased on the TCFD recommendations. The majority of our membership are already using the TCFD recommendations as a baseline for their own requirements or guidance.\n\nThe International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS), in consultation with other international organizations, will develop a set of standards, starting initially with climate and building upon these TCFD recommendations. As reflected in our December 2020 statement, the FSB supports IFRS's advancement of an International Sustainability Standards Board to take this work quickly forward. 3 This work holds the promise of providing baseline standards that could inform or be built upon by national authorities as they develop their approaches to climate-related financial disclosure or broader sustainability disclosure.\n\nThe initial focus of the IFRS will be on climate standards, while allowing for interoperability with individual jurisdictions' frameworks, that may go beyond climate-related impacts. Consistency in one-way disclosures would provide a needed avenue for accurate and appropriate risk assessment and comparability to assess investment decisions. Simultaneously, the IFRS standards are intended to provide flexibility for national authorities to build on the baseline. The \"interoperability\" feature will allow jurisdictions to address broader or jurisdiction-specific concerns in a manner consistent with their legal and regulatory frameworks, and indeed to go further in scope or faster if they wish. Given the importance of this work, we encourage the IFRS to press forward as quickly as possible. In the interim, the FSB continues to encourage jurisdictions that are implementing frameworks to base them on the TCFD recommendations to avoid unnecessary fragmentation.\n\nData The need for high quality, reliable data doesn't stop at firms' disclosures, however. International initiatives are needed to improve data quality and address data gaps, and ultimately to establish a basis of comprehensive, consistent, and comparable data for global monitoring and assessing climate-related financial risks. We published a separate report on this topic last week.\n\nOur data needs include data on the underlying drivers of physical and transition risk and financial institutions' exposures. The challenges here are considerable. To understand the financial risks, better information is needed on the underlying physical risks, including the sorts of extreme weather events that pose greatest risks to the balance sheets of households, firms, and financial institutions. Comparable data is also needed on the nature of jurisdictions' climate-change targets and progress in meeting them. All this information needs to be related to financial risksâincluding financial institutions' exposures to non-financial counterparties.\n\nThis is not an easy task. The current lack of usable data is a reflection of difficulties in transforming existing information on the drivers of climate risk into reliable metrics that quantify financial risks. The key here is to find metrics that are forward-looking, recognizing that the nature and magnitude of future climate-related risks may differ from those in the past.\n\nImproved financial risk data can also help achieve the financial stability mandates of financial authorities. For example, the FSB is exploring how to assess the degree to which climate-related risks might be transferred or amplified by different financial sectors, including the interdependence of banks and insurance firms. Climate-related risks vary across jurisdictions, and we need to look at how risks might be amplified by feedback loops with the real economy. Such analysis will contribute to a more comprehensive and global understanding of how to assess climate change and potential effects on the financial system, but those efforts are hampered by a variety of data limitations.\n\nThe FSB is working with international bodies, such as the International Monetary Fund, and other international groupings, such as the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), to assess climate data gaps and to identify steps to address them, with a special emphasis on ensuring cross-sectoral and international consistency. For example, the FSB plans to coordinate work with the NGFS on the issues surrounding scenario analyses, which some jurisdictions are using or contemplating, and the financial metrics that would be useful for such an analysis, both at the level of the firm and the overall system. Examining scenario analysis presents many challenges: A very long time horizonâwhich requires dynamic balance-sheet analysisâand the need to capture the interplay between the macro-economy and drivers of climate-related risks are two such challenges that would need to be overcome.\n\nConclusion Today, the FSB is well-positioned to lead in the next phases of the work required to assess and address climate-related financial risk. The FSB's mandate, its diverse membership, and its connection to the G20 make it the ideal forum to forge a consensus on the appropriate path forward. The FSB, as laid out in its roadmap, has taken on a critical role in coordinating and carrying forward work that will make the global financial system more resilient to the threats posed by climate change. The roadmap establishes a strategic vision for addressing climate-related financial risks, which sets out how we will coordinate with other standard-setting bodies and international organizations in order to progress towards our goal. Our Climate Roadmap leverages the FSB's strength as a coordinating body, provides some structure to the vast amount of work on climate-related financial risks currently going on internationally, and clarifies interdependencies between workstreams and between issues.\n\nThe Climate Roadmap sets the course and promotes consistency through, among other things, building consensus around common principles, best practices, and cross-jurisdictional alignment. These include the two broad objectives that I have focused on todayâestablishing consistent, comparable, and reliable information through a global baseline standard for disclosures and through improving the availability and quality of data. The roadmap also includes work on analytical tools and policy approaches developed for identifying and managing climate-related financial risks. We have a long road ahead of us, but every journey begins with the first steps. The FSB will continue to leverage its strengths to coordinate and contribute to understanding and addressing the challenges to the financial system that arise from these risks.\n\n1.

    "text": "June 28, 2021\n\nVice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles\n\nAt the 113th Annual Utah Bankers Association Convention, Sun Valley, Idaho\n\nI have been reflecting recently, and in connection with this speech, on America's centuries-long enthusiasm for novelty. In the main, it has served us and the world well, by making America the home of so many of the scientific and practical innovations that have transformed life in the 21st century from that of the 19th. But, especially when coupled with an equally American susceptibility to boosterism and the fear of missing out, it has also sometimes led to a mass suspension of our critical thinking and to occasionally impetuous, deluded crazes or fads.\n\nSometimes the consequences are in hindsight merely puzzling or embarrassing, like that year in the 1980s when millions of Americans suddenly started wearing parachute pants. But the consequences can also be more serious.\n\nWhich brings us to my topic today: central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. In recent months, public interest in a \"digital dollar\" has reached fever pitch. A wide range of experts and commenters have suggested that the Federal Reserve should issueâand in fact may need to issueâa CBDC. But before we get carried away with the novelty, I think we need to subject the promises of a CBDC to a careful critical analysis. In offering my views on this and other issues related to CBDCs, I am speaking for myself as a member of the Board of Governors, and not for the Board itself or any other Fed policymakers. And, indeed, you will all have seen Chair Powell's recent announcement that we are preparing a comprehensive discussion paper on this issue that will be the first step in a thorough public process to conduct just this sort of critical analysis, which I do not want to prejudge. But I do want to give some sense of the issues I think we will need to grapple with in this process, how I will be thinking about them, and the high bar that I think any proposal to create a U.S. CBDC must clear.\n\nSo, let's begin with a basic question: what problem would a CBDC solve? To answer, we first need to define the term CBDC and assess the current state of the U.S. payment system.\n\nWhat Do We Mean by \"CBDC\"? The Bank for International Settlements has defined a CBDC as \"a digital payment instrument, denominated in the national unit of account, that is a direct liability of the central bank.\" 1\n\nMy first observation is that the general public already transacts mostly in digital dollarsâby sending and receiving electronic balances in our commercial bank accounts. These digital dollars are not a CBDC, because they are liabilities of commercial banks rather than the Federal Reserve. Importantly, however, digital dollars at commercial banks are federally insured up to $250,000, which means that for deposits up to that amountâwhich means for essentially all retail deposits in the United Statesâthey are as sound as a central bank liability.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also provides digital dollars directly to commercial banks and certain other financial institutions. Federal law allows these financial institutions to maintain accounts withâand receive payments services fromâthe Federal Reserve. Balances in Federal Reserve accounts serve a vital financial stability function by providing a safe and liquid settlement asset for the U.S. economy.\n\nTo summarize then, the dollar is already highly digitized. The Federal Reserve provides a digital dollar to commercial banks, and commercial banks provide digital dollars and other financial services to consumers and businesses. This arrangement serves the nation and the economy well: the Federal Reserve functions in the public interest by promoting the health of the U.S. economy and the stability of the broader financial system, while commercial banks compete to attract and effectively serve customers.\n\nSo, given the existing digitization of the U.S. dollar, how would a CBDC differ from the digital dollars we use today? The key distinction is that, when most commentators speculate about a Federal Reserve CBDC, they assume that it would be available to the general public directly from the central bank. A CBDC of this nature could take different forms. One is an account-based model, in which the Federal Reserve would provide individual accounts directly to the general public. Like the accounts that the Federal Reserve currently provides to financial institutions, an accountholder would send and receive funds by debit or credit to their Federal Reserve account.\n\nA different CBDC model could involve a CBDC that is not maintained in Federal Reserve accounts. This form of CBDC would be closer to a digital equivalent of cash. Like cash, it would represent a claim against the Federal Reserve, but it could potentially be transferred from person to person (like a banknote) or through intermediaries.\n\nI am skeptical that the Federal Reserve has legal authority to pursue either of these CBDC models without legislation. Nevertheless, the recent clamor over CBDCs makes it appropriate to explore the benefits, costs, and practicalities of implementing one in the United States if such legislative authority were granted. Let's start with a look at the current U.S. payment system that a Fed CBDC would fit into.\n\nCurrent State of the U.S. Payment System The Federal Reserve and private-sector interbank payment services already offer an array of options that facilitate efficient, electronic U.S. dollar payments. A few statistics related to the main large-value payment systems for U.S. dollars are illustrative. The Federal Reserve's large-value payment service (the Fedwire Funds Service) processes nearly $4 trillion in payments every day . 2 These payments settle instantly in a bank's account at the Federal Reserve. A private-sector entity (The Clearing House) operates a large-value payment system that settles nearly $2 trillion in payments every day. 3 These payments do not settle in Federal Reserve accounts, but they are underpinned by balances on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nSmaller-value payments often settle more slowly than large-value payments, but a variety of efforts to speed up settlement have been completed or are underway. For example, The Clearing House has developed an instant payments service that focuses on smaller-value payments. Similarly, the automated clearinghouse (or ACH) networkâa batch-based payment network that first developed in the long-ago 20th centuryânow enables same-day settlement of ACH payments. And the Federal Reserve is developing an instant payment serviceâFedNowâ âthat will soon provide recipients of small-value payments with immediate access to their funds in commercial bank accounts.\n\nThe payment system is not perfectâsome types of payments should move more quickly and efficiently. Payments across international borders, for example, remain a key area of concern because they often involve high costs, low speed, and insufficient transparency. The Financial Stability Board, an international group that I chair, produced a roadmap last year that is intended to address these concerns. 4 Additionally, private-sector stablecoins (which I will discuss in more detail in a moment) may facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border payments.\n\nIn addition, some types of payments have not fully digitized or are subject to ongoing contention between businesses with competing economic interests. For example, paper checks remain widely used for certain types of payments (although the interbank check collection process is now almost entirely electronic). 5 Debit and credit card payments offer a convenient digital platform for consumers and retailers, but there has been considerable controversy between banks and retailers over who will capture the economics surrounding the fees associated with card transactions.\n\nFinally, many more Americans could benefit from digital payments by increasing their use of banking services, which can be promoted by wider use of low-cost, basic bank accounts.\n\nIn summary, the U.S. payment system is very good, and although it is not perfect, work is already underway to significantly improve it.\n\nPolicy Considerations Yet, proponents of a Federal Reserve CBDC believe that it would solve a number of significant problems. They suggest, for example, that a Federal Reserve CBDC may be necessary to defend the critical role the U.S. dollar plays in the global economy. Others say that a CBDC would overcome longstanding economic inequalities in American society. As we begin our Fed analysis of these issues, I will have to be convinced that a CBDC is a particularly good tool to address either of these issues, about which I am skeptical, and I will especially have to be convinced that the potential benefits of developing a Federal Reserve CBDC outweigh the potential risks.\n\nLet's examine some of the arguments raised by CBDC supporters. The first argument is that the Federal Reserve should develop a CBDC to defend the U.S. dollar against threats that would be posed by foreign CBDCs, on the one hand, and the continued spread of private digital currencies, on the other.\n\nTaking the threat from foreign CBDC's first, this argument presumes that at least some foreign currenciesâall of which are already highly digitized in our current international banking system in the same way the dollar is and yet which do not pose a significant challenge to the international role of the dollarâwill suddenly pose a much greater challenge to the dollar if that digitization is accomplished through a direct central bank digital currency instead of through the current digital payments system. In this view, the U.S. dollar will lose its place in the global economy if the Federal Reserve does not offer a similar product.\n\nI think it's inevitable that, as the global economy and financial system continue to evolve, some foreign currencies (including some foreign CBDCs) will be used more in international transactions than they currently are. It seems unlikely, however, that the dollar's status as a global reserve currency, or the dollar's role as the dominant currency in international financial transactions, will be threatened by a foreign CBDC. The dollar's role in the global economy rests on a number of foundations, including the strength and size of the U.S. economy; extensive trade linkages between the United States and the rest of the world; deep financial markets, including for U.S. Treasury securities; the stable value of the dollar over time; the ease of converting U.S. dollars into foreign currencies; the rule of law and strong property rights in the United States; and last but not least, credible U.S. monetary policy. None of these are likely to be threatened by a foreign currency, and certainly not because that foreign currency is a CBDC.\n\nCBDC supporters also suggest that private digital currencies pose a threat to the U.S. dollar. Private digital currencies come in multiple flavors, but for this purpose I will divide them into two categories: stablecoins and non-stablecoins, or cryptoassets, such as bitcoin. Let's begin with stablecoins. The value of a stablecoin is tied to one or more other assets, such as a sovereign currency. 6 There are multiple existing and potential stablecoins that are or would be tied in value to the U.S. dollar.\n\nSome commentators argue that the United States must develop a CBDC to compete with U.S. dollar stablecoins. Stablecoins are an important development that raise difficult questions. For example, how would widespread adoption of stablecoins affect monetary policy or financial stability? How might stablecoins affect the commercial banking system? Do stablecoins represent a fundamental threat to the government's role in money creation?\n\nIn my judgment, we do not need to fear stablecoins. The Federal Reserve has traditionally supported responsible private-sector innovation. Consistent with this tradition, I believe that we must take strong account of the potential benefits of stablecoins, including the possibility that a U.S. dollar stablecoin might support the role of the dollar in the global economy. For example, a global U.S. dollar stablecoin network could encourage use of the dollar by making cross-border payments faster and cheaper, and it potentially could be deployed much faster and with fewer downsides than a CBDC. And the concern that stablecoins represent the unprecedented creation of private money and thus challenge our monetary sovereignty is puzzling, given that our existing system involvesâindeed depends onâprivate firms creating money every day.\n\nWe do have a legitimate and strong regulatory interest in how stablecoins are constructed and managed, particularly with respect to financial stability concerns: the pool of assets that acts as the anchor for a stablecoin's value couldâif use of the stablecoin became widespread enoughâcreate stability risk if it is invested in multiple currency denominations; if it is a fractional rather than full reserve; if the stablecoin holder does not have a clear claim on the underlying asset; or if the pool is invested in instruments other than the most liquid possible, principally central bank reserves and short-term sovereign bonds. All of these factors create \"run risk\" âthe possibility that some triggering event could cause a large number of stablecoin holders to exchange their coins all at once for other assets and that the stablecoin system would not be able to meet such demands while maintaining a reasonably stable value. But these concerns are eminently addressableâindeed, some stablecoins have already been structured to address them. When our concerns have been addressed, we should be saying yes to these products, rather than straining to find ways to say no. Indeed, the combination of imminent improvements in the existing payments system such as various instant payments initiatives combined with the cross-border efficiency of properly structured stablecoins could well make superfluous any effort to develop a CBDC.\n\nIn contrast to stablecoins, cryptoassets like bitcoin are not tied to the value of an asset like a sovereign currency. Rather, they seek to create value in the coin through other means, usually some intrinsic mechanism to ensure scarcity, like bitcoin's mining process, or some characteristic of the coin that cannot be matched by the traditional payment system, such as inviolable anonymity. Some commentators assert that the United States must develop a CBDC to counter the appeal of cryptocurrencies. This seems mistaken. The mechanisms used to create such cryptoassets' value also ensure that this value will be highly volatileârather similar to the fluctuating value of gold, which, like bitcoin, draws a significant part of its value from its scarcity, and like bitcoin, does not play a significant role in today's payments or monetary system. Unlike gold, however, which has industrial uses and aesthetic attributes quite apart from its vestigial financial role, bitcoin's principal additional attractions are its novelty and its anonymity. The anonymity will make it appropriately the target for increasingly comprehensive scrutiny from law enforcement and the novelty is a rapidly wasting asset. Gold will always glitter, but novelty, by definition, fades. Bitcoin and its ilk will, accordingly, almost certainly remain a risky and speculative investment rather than a revolutionary means of payment, and they are therefore highly unlikely to affect the role of the U.S. dollar or require a response with a CBDC.\n\nA second broad argument raised by proponents of CBDCs is that a Federal Reserve CBDC would improve access to digital payments for people who currently do not keep bank accounts because of their expense, a lack of trust in banks, or other reasons. This is a worthwhile goal. However, I believe we can promote financial inclusion more efficiently by taking steps to make cheap, basic commercial bank accounts more available to people for whom the current cost is burdensome, such as the Bank On accounts developed in collaboration between the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund and many local coalitions. 7 Between 2011 and 2019, the percentage of households that are unbanked dropped from 8.2 percent to an estimated 5.4 percent. 8 Banks and regulators are working to shrink this percentage further still. I am far from convinced that a CBDC is the best, or even an effective, method to increase financial inclusion. 9\n\nLast, some believe that a Federal Reserve CBDC would spur and facilitate private-sector innovation. This is an interesting issue that merits further study. I am puzzled, however, as to how a Federal Reserve CBDC could promote innovation in a way that a private-sector stablecoin or other new payment mechanism could not. It seems to me that there has been considerable private-sector innovation in the payments industry without a CBDC, and it is conceivable that a Fed CBDC, or even plans for one, might deter private-sector innovation by effectively \"occupying the field.\"\n\nIn brief, the potential benefits of a Federal Reserve CBDC are unclear. Conversely, a Federal Reserve CBDC could pose significant and concrete risks. First, a Federal Reserve CBDC could create considerable challenges for the structure of our banking system, which currently relies on deposits to support the credit needs of households and businesses. An arrangement where the Federal Reserve replaces commercial banks as the dominant provider of money to the general public could constrict the availability of credit, fundamentally alter the economy, and expose the public to a host of unanticipated, and undesirable, consequences. 10\n\nAmong other potential problems, a dominant CBDC could undermine the consumer and other economic benefits that accrue when commercial banks compete to attract customers.\n\nA Federal Reserve CBDC could also present an appealing target for cyberattacks and other security threats. Bad actors might try to steal CBDC, compromise the CBDC network, or target non-public information about holders of CBDC. The architecture of a Federal Reserve CBDC would need to be extremely resistant to such threatsâand would need to remain resistant as bad actors employ ever-more sophisticated methods and tactics. Designing appropriate defenses for CBDC could be particularly difficult because, compared to the Federal Reserve's existing payment systems, there could be far more entry points to a CBDC networkâdepending on design choices, anyone in the world could potentially access the network. 11\n\nCritically, we also would need to ensure that a CBDC does not facilitate illicit activity. The Bank Secrecy Act currently requires that commercial banks take steps to guard against money laundering. 12 Policymakers will need to consider whether a similar anti-money-laundering regime would be feasible for a Federal Reserve CBDC, but it may be challenging to design a CBDC that respects individuals' privacy while appropriately minimizing the risk of money laundering. At one extreme, we could design a CBDC that would require CBDC holders to provide the Federal Reserve detailed information about themselves and their transactions; this approach would minimize money-laundering risks but would raise significant privacy concerns. At the other extreme, we could design a CBDC that would allow parties to transact on a fully anonymized basis; this approach would address privacy concerns but would raise significant money-laundering risks.\n\nA final risk is that developing a Federal Reserve CBDC could be expensive and difficult for the Federal Reserve to manage. A Federal Reserve CBDC could, in essence, set up the Federal Reserve as a retail bank to the general public. That would mean introducing large-scale, resource-intensive central bank infrastructure. We will need to consider whether the potential use cases for a CBDC justify such costs and expansion of the Federal Reserve's responsibilities into unfamiliar activities, together with the risk of politicization of the Fed's mandate that would come with such an expansion.\n\nTo conclude, I emphasize three points. First, the U.S. dollar payment system is very good, and it is getting better. Second, the potential benefits of a Federal Reserve CBDC are unclear. Third, developing a CBDC could, I believe, pose considerable risks.\n\nSo, our work is cut out for us as we proceed to rigorously evaluate the case for developing a Federal Reserve CBDC. Even if other central banks issue successful CBDCs, we cannot assume that the Federal Reserve should issue a CBDC. The process that Chair Powell recently announced is a genuinely open process without a foregone conclusion, although obviously I think the bar to establishing a U.S. CBDC is a high one. The upcoming discussion paper that constitutes the first step in this process will importantly ask for input from the public. I look forward to reviewing public input on the discussion paper, which will inform the Federal Reserve's ultimate evaluation of a potential CBDC.\n\n1.

The Federal Reserve also needs to consider whether private-sector stablecoins could disintermediate deposits out of the banking system, but in general, the risk of disintermediation should be lower for stablecoins compared to a CBDC. Importantly, if a stablecoin is backed by short-term securities, the stablecoin provider must take the funds received in return for the issuance of stablecoins and purchase short-term securities for the stablecoin \"anchor\" pool. The seller of those securities will then take the funds received and put them back into the banking system. Return to text\n\n11.

    "text": "May 26, 2021\n\nVice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles\n\nAt the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast)\n\nThank you, David, and thank you to Brookings and the Hutchins Center for the opportunity to lead things off and be part of this very distinguished panel. Today, I will explain why I expect the U.S. economy to continue growing strongly over the remainder of this year and what the implications of that outlook are for monetary policy. 1\n\nAfter the shutdowns and other measures taken in response to the COVID-19 outbreak last spring caused the swiftest and deepest recession in U.S. history, the economy has made a powerful recovery. Households and businesses adapted, supported by the flexibility and inherent strength of our market-based economy, by the continued resilience of our banking system, and by significant fiscal and monetary policy support. Highly accommodative monetary policy by the Federal Reserve has fostered strong growth in interest rateâsensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and durable goods, offsetting some of the historic weakness in the service sector last year. With the service sector reopening while other household and business spending remains strong, I expect rapid growth to continue for some time before slowing to a still robust pace next year.\n\nInflation is running significantly above the Federal Reserve's longer-run goal of 2 percent primarily as a result of three factors: the surge in demand as more services come back on line while goods spending remains robust, the emergence of bottlenecks in some supply chains, and the very low inflation readings recorded last spring dropping out of the calculation of 12-month inflation. For reasons I will detail in a moment, I expect that a significant portion of that recent boost to inflation will be transitory, and that it will not interfere with the rapid growth driving progress toward the Fed's maximum-employment goal.\n\nWe've come a long way since last spring, but reopenings over the past year have been uneven, so it will still be some time before we repair all the economic damage. Supply bottlenecks will likely hinder the quick expansion of production in some industries in the next few months and raise some costsâin some cases significantly. The progress in reopening has been slower in countries that are among our largest trading partners, weighing on U.S. growth by reducing demand for U.S. exports. But even with those impediments, I believe the strong recovery will keep rolling forward. Let me walk through the evidence for that optimistic view.\n\nFirst, I see increasing recognition by the private and public sectors that a broad reopening can proceed safely. i The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped most social-distancing recommendations for vaccinated people. 2 Although local COVID-19 restrictions on schooling and economic activity continue in some areas, most schools are teaching in person at least part time and more than half of states have dropped all capacity constraints on restaurants, bars, and retail establishments. More than a dozen more states are planning to do so over the coming weeks.\n\nWith these reopenings, consumer spending, which is two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP), will remain robust, supported by personal income that has, thanks to significant fiscal support, now surpassed the trend it was on before the COVID event. April's retail sales results were flat, but that came after enormous gains in March that were boosted by the latest round of stimulus checks. Looking beyond the headline numbers, sales were up 13 percent in March and 3 percent in April at restaurants and bars, one of the sectors hardest hit by the COVID-19 event. April and March were the third- and fourth-best months for vehicle sales to consumers in U.S. history, if you filter out sales to car rental companies, a sector just beginning to recover.\n\nYou might expect this bounce will subside after consumption regains the strong trend it was on pre-COVID-19, but one reason I think it will continue is the still high rate at which people have been adding to their savings. Even as personal consumption expenditures rose at a huge 10 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2021, the saving rate averaged 21 percent over those three months. Again, a lot of that reflected the most recent round of stimulus payments, but as employment grows and people return to normal life and work, the accumulated stock of savings will support spending for many months to come.\n\nBusiness investment took a big hit in the first half of 2020 but has come back strongly and is now running above pre-pandemic levels. Current indicators of business spending are pointing to continued elevated levels of investment in the months ahead. Supply bottlenecks have depleted inventories for many goods and rebuilding those inventories will be an important supplement for business spending and factory output.\n\nI see two potential headwinds for the economy: the uneven global recovery and the aforementioned supply bottlenecks. Strong U.S. demand is boosting imports, but weaker demand outside the United States, where recovery is slower, is restraining exports, and that problem may not resolve for some time. Supply bottlenecks are more prevalent now, especially in the auto and housing industries, with shortages of inputs leading to slower production that reduces employment growth.\n\nAlthough I expect employment to rise significantly in coming months, the picture is more mixed for the labor market than it is for spending. The unemployment rate remains at 6.1 percent, compared with 3.5 percent pre-COVID-19, and there are 8 million fewer jobs. Despite recent gains amid reopenings, employment in the travel, leisure, and food services sectors remains well below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nMy optimism here reflects the apparent recovery in overall labor demandâby many metrics, job openings are above 2019 levels, including for workers without a college degree, a group especially affected last year. In the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data for March, private-sector job openings as a percentage of total employment increased to 5.6 percent, which is above the previous record for that series set in November 2018.\n\nJob growth of 266,000 in April was a disappointing slowdown from recent months, but good news lurked beneath the headlines: For those who were working, average hours increased; the number of people working part time because they couldn't find full-time jobs decreased significantly; and wage growth was very strong.\n\nThe underlying strength in hours and wages lends support to widespread reports that worker shortages are impeding hiring. Labor force participation remains about 3â1/2 million people lower than before COVID-19. Among the many factors driving this shortage, as indicated by the Federal Reserve's report Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2020, is parents who need to care for their children because of remote school and aftercare. 3 We have also seen a wave of retirements by older workers in the past year. And, although the evidence is mixed, we have received plenty of anecdotal reports about the influence of generous unemployment benefits and large cash payments on the willingness of workers to return to work. But those benefits are slated to expire over the summer, and I hope that a fuller reopening of schools in the fall will ease the pressure on parents. The spike in retirements may well moderate in a stronger economy, as we saw in the year or two before the pandemic. So, while labor shortages could weigh on job creation in coming months, I don't yet perceive this development as significantly slowing the U.S. economy beyond the next few months.\n\nNow let's turn to the other half of the Federal Reserve's economic goals, inflation. As I mentioned last week during congressional testimony, I agree with the widespread view among my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and most private forecasters that the recent rise in inflation to well above 2 percent is driven by temporary factors. I expect inflation to begin subsiding at some point over the next several months and to be running close to 2 percent again at some point during 2022. Market-implied inflation expectations have risen only to the levels that prevailed in the early 2010s, after which inflation never ran consistently above 2 percent, and most survey measures are sending similar signals. Therefore, I consider these recent increases in inflation expectations a welcome development, reversing the large declines seen last spring and perhaps edging up in response to the message in the FOMC's new policy framework. That said, my optimistic outlook for growth and employment places me among those who see the risks to inflation over the medium term as weighted to the upside, relative to my baseline forecast. Broadly speaking, there are three reasons for this.\n\nFirst, there are wage pressures. A moment ago, I celebrated the upturn in wages in April, but it may be a sign that the torrid growth of the economy and labor supply shortages have begun pushing up wages faster than occurred with the moderate economic growth over much of the past decade. Wages are a large component of business costs that could pass through to prices more readily than increases in the cost of other inputs. It seems like a paradox that there could be labor supply problems and wage pressures at 6 percent unemployment, but it is also a fact. Some of this surprising outcome reflects temporarily lower labor force participation coming out of the enormous economic shock last spring, but some of the Fed's business contacts have said that shortages of skilled laborersâparticularly in manufacturing, transportation, and constructionâpredated COVID-19 and are likely to persist.\n\nAnother factor that I referred to earlierâfiscal policyâcarries potential costs as well as obvious benefits. Even as the huge amount of stimulus money in people's pockets has been boosting income and spending in eye-popping ways, much of that stimulus was saved. A larger-than-expected or faster release of those accumulated savings while the economy is already growing rapidly could result in output exceeding potential output by more than it has in decades. It is reasonable to ask if the strength of spending stemming from this unprecedented fiscal stimulus will put significant upward pressure on inflation as households and businesses emerge further from the COVID event. But, at least to date, the latest round of stimulus seems to be supporting spending and growth without causing an inordinate rise in interest rates or inflation expectations.\n\nThat outcome aligns with the advice of those in the economics profession who have produced research in recent years that leaves them much more comfortable with high deficits and debt, at least in countries with low interest rates, than they used to be. 4 In 2006, when I was serving as Under Secretary of the Treasury, we were subject to harsh criticism for running a deficit of not quite $250 billion, with total debt held by the public at 35 percent of GDP. 5 By contrast, in 2021, the deficit is currently projected to be $3.4 trillion, and total debt held by the public at the end of fiscal year 2020 was 100 percent of GDP. 6\n\nFurther fiscal policy actions are, of course, the purview of the Congress and the Administration. History tells us that once the dreadnought of government spending gathers speed, it is difficult and slow to turn around. Surely the deficits being run to offset the COVID-related shocks have made it even more critical to address the sustainability of government debt in the years ahead.\n\nAnd, finally, recent monthly readings on import prices, producer prices, and consumer prices have all come in above consensus expectations. These upside surprises cannot be attributed to base effects. It is true that many of the factors driving the April consumer price index report and other inflation surprises continue to be supply bottlenecks, and it is reasonable to conclude that these will ease over time. But clearing some of those supply disruptions will require additional investment and the time to expand production capacity. If these shortages persist into 2022, people may adjust their expectations higher for future inflation, which could make above-target inflation more persistent than we currently expect.\n\nI don't want to overstate my concernâI am not worried about a return to the 1970s. We designed our new monetary policy framework for the very different world we live in now, which involves an equilibrium for the economy with slow workforce growth, lower potential growth, lower underlying inflation, and, therefore, lower interest rates. One of those differences is that the kinds of \"wage-price spirals\" that characterized inflation dynamics in the 1970s have not been present for a long time. It's quite possible that this situation now prevails because inflation is never high enough for long enough to enter decisionmaking in a material way.\n\nSo, what are the implications for monetary policy? I am fully committed to the FOMC's new monetary policy framework and the two pieces of related guidance that we have put in place for asset purchases and the federal funds rate to implement that framework. The conditions required to change the pace of asset purchases and those required to increase the federal funds rate are sequential: The latter requires improvement in the economy that clears a much higher bar. Let me address each of those in turn.\n\nThe guidance on asset purchases, introduced in December, commits us to increasing our holdings of securities at least at the current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals. My personal view is that the rise in inflationâeven after discounting temporary factorsâand inflation expectations since December will prove sufficient to satisfy the standard for inflation in the guidance around asset purchases later this year, but improvement in the labor market has been slower than I would have liked. For instance, the unemployment rate has decreased only 0.6 percentage points to 6.1 percent, and the labor force participation rate is still nearly the same as it was at the time of the December meeting. Therefore, we need to remain patient in the face of what seem to be transitory shocks to prices and wages so long as inflation expectations continue to fluctuate around levels that are consistent with our longer-run inflation goal.\n\nFor me, it is a question of risk management. The best analysis we currently have is that the rise in inflation to well above our target will be temporary. But those of us on the FOMC are economists and lawyers, not prophets, seers and revelators. We could be wrong; and what happens then? Part of the calculus in balancing the risks of either overshooting or undershooting our 2 percent goal is that the Fed has the tools to address inflation that runs too high, while it is more difficult to raise inflation that falls below target. If we're wrong, we know how to bring inflation down. But if our assessment is correct that inflation is temporary, it would be unwise for us to take actions that might slow the recovery prematurely by trying to stay ahead of inflation, when our best estimate is that we are not far behind.\n\nIf my expectations about economic growth, employment, and inflation over the coming months are borne out, however, and especially if they come in stronger than I expect, then, as noted in the minutes of the last FOMC meeting, it will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings. In particular, we may need additional public communications about the conditions that constitute substantial further progress since December toward our broad and inclusive definition of maximum employment. This standard presents inherent communications challenges because it cannot be summarized by a single labor market indicator, such as the unemployment rate thresholds used in the Committee's interest rate forward guidance between late 2012 and late 2013.\n\nIn contrast, the time for discussing a change in the federal funds rate remains in the future. i The guidance for the federal funds rate commits to maintain the current rate until labor market conditions are consistent with our goal of maximum employment and inflation not only has reached 2 percent, but also is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In the FOMC's most recent Summary of Economic Projections, no participantsâeven those with optimistic growth forecasts such as I've outlined todayâthought it appropriate that liftoff occur before 2022. Perhaps even more important than the timing of liftoff will be the expected trajectory of rate increases afterward, and you can see that even among participants with an earlier expected liftoff, those paths are quite shallow. Thus, I expect that monetary policy will remain highly accommodative for some time.\n\nLet me conclude with a few thoughts on financial stability. As the Fed's most recent Financial Stability Report notes, the bright outlook, ample supply of credit, and accommodative fiscal and monetary policy have pushed some asset valuations to very high levels that could be subject to sharp reversals if expectations are not met. Likewise, business debt is high relative to past experience, which is a good reason to carefully weigh the risks. But the strong economy reassures me here: Earnings are growing, many businesses have ample stockpiles of cash, expected bond defaults are below their long-run medians, and the pace of credit rating downgrades has slowed to a trickle.\n\nWhen I think about financial stability, I think most directly about resilience to shocks, and it would be hard to imagine a better test of that resilience than what occurred in the spring of 2020. Banks met extraordinary demands for credit last spring from nonfinancial businesses and households while simultaneously providing forbearance on millions of existing loans and building substantial loss reserves, all without significant strains to their overall health. The largest banks at the core of the financial system are better capitalized than they have been in decades, and these institutions are sitting on large amounts of highly liquid assets while relying on relatively low levels of short-term funding. The banking sector is strong.\n\nI also see a resilient household sector. Household credit is primarily owed by borrowers with prime credit scores, rising home prices have most homeowners flush with equity, and, as I noted earlier, households are sitting on a large stock of savings.\n\nIt is true that there are structural vulnerabilities in the nonbank financial sector, particularly money funds and hedge funds, and these are being scrutinized by U.S. and international authorities, including the Financial Stability Board under my chairmanship. 7\n\nBut I believe these risks are manageable, and I come down on the side of the research that concludes these and other concerns are best addressed by targeted financial regulation and supervision rather than the blunt tool of monetary policy. 8 At a crucial moment in our recovery from the COVID-19 event, the utility of using monetary policy to try to address financial stability concerns would be greatly outweighed by the costs to employment and growth.\n\nBefore ending, I'd like to reemphasize that I am quite optimistic about the path of the economy. While prices will run above our 2 percent target this year, I believe most of this increase will be transitory. After an exceedingly difficult year, we are poised to enter a robust and durable expansion.\n\nThank you again for the invitation to be here today, and I look forward to our discussion.\n\n1.
