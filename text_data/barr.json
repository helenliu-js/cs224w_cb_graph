Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nvia prerecorded video\n2025 Northeast / Mid-Atlantic Small Business Credit Symposium\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, New York\nMay 15, 2025\n\nGood afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to be part of the Small\nBusiness Credit Symposium.1 Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and\nyet they face significant challenges. As a researcher and public official, I have spent\nconsiderable time working on these issues, and today, I would like to address three\ncritical challenges that small businesses face: access to capital, skills development, and\nnetwork building. Then, given my role as a member of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, I’ll offer my perspective on the impact of economic conditions and the\noutlook on small businesses and provide some details on the vital role that small\nbusinesses play in our economy.\nThe first challenge facing small businesses that I’ll highlight is access to capital\nand credit. Small businesses access credit from diverse sources, including banks of all\nsizes, credit unions, online lenders and other nonbank financing companies.\nNevertheless, entrepreneurs and small business owners face a significant gap, relative to\nlarger businesses, in accessing capital. According to the Federal Reserve’s Small\nBusiness Credit Survey (SBCS), credit availability is a challenge faced by over a quarter\nof small businesses.2 In addition, many small businesses worry about the cost of credit\nand confusing terms and conditions in some credit offers. And still others are\ndiscouraged from even applying for credit and so are unable to start or grow their\nbusinesses. Minority entrepreneurs and those located in low- and moderate-income areas\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 2025 Report on Employer Firms: Findings from the 2024 Small Business Credit Survey,” Small Business\nCredit Survey, Federal Reserve Banks, March 2025. 2025 Report on Employer Firms: Findings from the\n2024 Small Business Credit Survey. Other financial challenges include rising costs of goods, services,\nand/or wages; paying operating expenses; uneven cash flow; weak sales; and making payments on\noutstanding debt.\n\n- 2 -\noften have an even harder time than other businesses in accessing credit in safe and\naffordable ways.3\nThere are many ways to help address these gaps. For example, in Detroit, I was\nfortunate enough to work with colleagues to help set up a loan loss fund serving small\nbusinesses in Detroit, Michigan. The loan loss fund helps banks to reach deeper into the\nsmall business market by mitigating downside risks to lending. Community\nDevelopment Financial Institutions (CDFIs) can also play important roles in expanding\naccess to small business credit, especially in underserved areas. Fintech providers can\nuse lower cost structures and technological innovations to serve small business owners as\nwell. Federal and state governments have a role to play as well, such as through SBA\nprograms, the CDFI Fund, and the State Small Business Credit Initiative.\nIn addition to the credit gap, many small businesses often face a knowledge and\nskills gap. Many entrepreneurs and small business owners start their firms without the\nrange of financial and management skills needed to run a successful business.4 And it’s\nnot always easy for entrepreneurs to identify or develop the specific skills and knowledge\nthey need to grow and sustain their businesses. Bridging this knowledge gap may require\na variety of approaches. For instance, many organizations, both private and public, have\ndeveloped information and training to help small business owners establish and grow\ntheir businesses. Online learning platforms, payment platforms, small business\n3 Michael S. Barr, “Minority and Women Entrepreneurs: Building Capital, Networks, and Skills,”\nBrookings Institute, March 2015,\nhttps://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/legacy/files/downloads_and_links/minority_women_entrepreneurs\n_building_skills_barr_final.pdf.\n4 According to Intuit/QuickBooks, only half (54 percent) of small business owners say they had a good\nunderstanding of financial management before starting a business. “20 Small Business Financial Literacy\nStatistics to Know in 2025,” QuickBooks Blog, April 2, 2025, https://quickbooks.intuit.com/r/small-\nbusiness-data/financial-literacy-statistics/.\n\n- 3 -\ndevelopment centers (SBDCs), chambers of commerce, and community colleges, for\nexample, develop and provide information tailored to the various needs of small business\nowners and entrepreneurs.5 Focusing on practical skills, such as financial management\nand operations planning, can help build the capacity for greater knowledge and skill\nacquisition.\nIn my own experience with this challenge, I had the privilege of working with\ncolleagues to launch the Detroit Neighborhood Entrepreneurs Project, which brings\nfaculty-supervised student teams to collaborate with local businesses on their legal,\nfinancial, design, marketing, business strategy, and technology challenges. The\ninterdisciplinary program helps to bridge the skills and resource gaps that small\nbusinesses owners face, while students learn important new skills themselves from both\nfaculty and the small businesses that they serve.\nThe third challenge facing small business owners and entrepreneurs is the need to\ncultivate strategic connections and build robust professional networks that support their\ngrowth and success. Business and professional networks often provide entrepreneurs and\nsmall business owners with access to critical resources and knowledge. While\nestablished entrepreneurs have actively cultivated these connections and all that they can\noffer, emerging entrepreneurs and new small business owners often don’t know where to\nstart. Accessing networks of experienced entrepreneurs can help early-stage\nentrepreneurs and small business owners gain perspectives that will be vital for growing\n5 SBDCs are cooperative efforts involving the Small Business Administration (SBA), a college or\nuniversity, and often other private or public partners. There are more than 1,000 SBDCs operating in all 50\nstates, the District of Columbia, and many U.S. territories. The centers offer free counseling and training\nfor small businesses on topics such as business planning, financial management, marketing, and access to\ncapital. “America’s SBDCs,” America’s SBDCs, https://americassbdc.org/.\n\n- 4 -\ntheir firms. Business associations and member organizations that connect owners and\nstaff at companies of all sizes can facilitate knowledge sharing. Even more importantly,\nthese business networks can help to expand market access. Many years ago, for example,\nI helped to establish BusinessLINC, which brought together established businesses and\nbudding entrepreneurs.\nThose are a few of the challenges I have observed over the years, and some\nthoughts on how to address them. With the time remaining, let me turn to my current\nvantage point and the question of why small businesses are so vital to a healthy and\ngrowing economy. In part, this is because small businesses, to a great extent, are the\nU.S. economy. Businesses with 500 or fewer employees account for almost half of all\nprivate sector employment, nearly 40 percent of the sales revenue of businesses, and\nnearly 40 percent of what is paid to private sector workers.6 But this actually understates\nthe impact of small businesses, because they are especially important for economic\ngrowth. We know that the overwhelming number of new businesses are small\nbusinesses, and we also know that new businesses are a particularly potent source of\ninnovation and productivity growth.7 One of the reasons that the U.S. economy has done\nso well the past few years is because of an acceleration in productivity growth, which,\ntogether with immigration increasing the labor force, allowed our economy to grow\nresiliently while inflation was falling. It is no coincidence that this productivity surge\n6 “Frequently Asked Questions,” Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy, July 2024,\nhttps://advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Small-\nBusiness_2024-508.pdf.\n7 See Titan Alon, David Berger, Robert Dent, and Benjamin Pugsley, “Older and Slower: The Startup\nDeficit’s Lasting Effects on Productivity Growth,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 93 (January\n2018): 68–85; and Ryan Decker, John Haltiwanger, Ron Jarmin, and Javier Miranda, “The Role of\nEntrepreneurship in US Job Creation and Economic Dynamism,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol.\n28 (Summer 2014), 3–24.\n\n- 5 -\noccurred while the creation of new businesses was also surging.8 For instance, small\nbusinesses are responsible for 16 times as many patents per employee as larger\nbusinesses. Small businesses play an important role in innovation and economic growth.9\nIn my view, the economy is on solid footing, with solid growth, low and stable\nunemployment, and inflation continuing to come down towards our 2 percent target. But\nthe outlook has been clouded by trade policies that have led to an increase in uncertainty,\ncontributing to declines in measures of consumer and business sentiment. Potential\ndisruptions to supply chains and distribution networks are particularly acute for small\nbusinesses, which are less diversified, less able to access credit, and hence more\nvulnerable to adverse shocks. Small businesses play a vital role in production networks,\noften providing specialized inputs that can’t easily be sourced elsewhere, and business\nfailures could further disrupt supply chains. As we saw during the pandemic, such\ndisruptions can have large and lasting effects on prices, as well as output. If these\ndisruptions were to occur, we’d likely see lower growth and higher inflation ahead.\nThat’s the macro view. At the level of individuals and households, small\nbusinesses are a vital basis for financial security and economic mobility. Outside of\nstockownership and retirement savings, home ownership is responsible for 45 percent of\nhousehold non-financial wealth, with business equity right behind at 34 percent.10 Those\nwho are self-employed, as most small business owners are, have an average of four times\n8 See the Census Bureau’s Business Formation Statistics, based on Internal Revenue Service applications\nfor new Employer Identification Numbers.\n9 U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, “Innovation and Research,” news release,\nSeptember 22, 2021 to November 4, 2022,\nhttps://www.sbc.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/innovationresearch#:~:text=Innovation%20&%20Research,fo\nr%20three%20years%20in%202022.\n10 “Small Business Facts: The Importance of Business Ownership to Wealth,” Small Business\nAdministration Office of Advocacy, August 2021, https://advocacy.sba.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2021/08/Small-Business-Facts-Business-Owner-Wealth.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nas much wealth as those who are employed by others, and twice as much as retirees.\nSuccessful entrepreneurship also correlates strongly with upward mobility, with studies\nshowing business owners more likely to move into higher income brackets than their\nnon-entrepreneurial counterparts.11\nThese opportunities matter a great deal to individuals, families and communities,\nand they also matter in promoting a strong economy with stable prices and low\nunemployment, key to the Fed’s mission. I look forward to hearing more about the\ninsights from today’s event and working with all of you to encourage entrepreneurship\nand small business ownership, which is so vital to our economy.\n11 Ross Levine and Yona Rubinstein, “Smart and Illicit: Who Becomes an Entrepreneur and Do They Earn\nMore?”, Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 137(1) (2022): 191-241; JPMorgan Chase & Co and Gallup,\n“Employing Others is Linked to Wealth and Well Being,” April 11, 2024,\nhttps://news.gallup.com/poll/643268/employing-others-linked-wealth-wellbeing.aspx; and\nSigne-Mary McKernan and Hal Salzman, “Self-Employment and Economic Mobility,” April 2008,\nhttps://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/31196/1001164-self-employment-and-economic-\nmobility.pdf.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference, cohosted by\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and\nthe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission\nNew York, New York\nSeptember 26, 2024\n\nThank you, and thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1\nIt is great to be here again, particularly because this year marks the 10th annual\nconference on the Treasury market, a milestone that is worth celebrating. I want to\nacknowledge the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for its leadership in this area,\nincluding the dedication and excellence it has brought to hosting this conference over the\npast decade, in collaboration with the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market\nSurveillance, led by the Treasury Department. The Treasury market is the means by\nwhich our government meets its financing needs in service to the American people, and it\nis also the bedrock of the financial system. Promoting the resilience of the Treasury\nmarket and ensuring it can continue to fulfill these roles requires the collaboration of\nagencies and individuals across the government along with the private sector.\nAs others have pointed out today, we have made important progress since last\nyear’s conference. The Securities and Exchange Commission has finalized a rule on\ncentral clearing of Treasury transactions, the Treasury Department has instituted a\nprogram for buying back less-liquid Treasury securities, and the Office of Financial\nResearch is preparing for its permanent collection of data on non-centrally-cleared\nbilateral repurchase agreement (repo) transactions, which will support our understanding\nof this market segment as it evolves.\nI will share some thoughts with you on how I see the work of the Federal Reserve\nin supporting Treasury market resilience. Our capital and liquidity regulations, our\nsupervision of the firms over which we have authority, and our liquidity facilities play\nimportant roles in supporting market resilience and financial stability. Earlier this month,\n1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nI gave a speech where I reiterated the crucial role of capital in serving these objectives,\nand the need to balance resilience and efficiency in designing our rules. In that speech, I\nalso outlined the elements of a capital re-proposal that I believe will have broad\nconsensus at the Federal Reserve Board. The adjustments are in response to a robust\npublic comment process, and some of them are designed to address interactions and\nmarket functioning concerns raised by commentators.\nIn terms of rulemaking, today I will focus on some additional aspects of our\nregulatory framework—namely, enhancements to our liquidity regulations. I will share\nsome perspective on how our liquidity regulations work together and are supportive of\nmarket functioning and the smooth implementation of monetary policy.\nThe Intersection of Monetary Policy Tools and Supervision and Regulation\nWe consider how all of the Fed’s tools work together to support our objectives.\nIn previous speeches, I have talked about the role of the discount window and the\nstanding repo facility (SRF) in supporting both monetary policy implementation and\nfinancial stability, noting how important it is that eligible institutions be ready to use\nthese facilities.2 Today I want to dig into this topic a bit more, including how these tools\nsupport monetary policy implementation through appropriate incorporation into liquidity\nregulations and supervisory practices.\nAfter the banking stress in March 2023, we saw a substantial improvement among\nbanks of all sizes in their level of readiness to tap the discount window both in taking the\nnecessary steps for set-up and in their pledging of collateral. Since that time, over\n2 See Michael S. Barr (2023), “The 2023 U.S. Treasury Market Conference,” speech delivered at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, November 16,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20231116a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\n$1 trillion in additional collateral has been pledged to the discount window, and\nadditional banks have established access to the SRF. Both of these facilities are potential\nvenues for monetizing assets and raising liquidity to address volatility in private funding\nmarket rates or gaps in the availability of private-market funding.\nWe had been hearing that some were confused about how banks could incorporate\nready access to the discount window and the SRF into their contingency funding plans\nand internal liquidity stress tests. Supervisors have a role in assessing the viability of\nlarge banks’ plans to meet stressed outflows in their stress scenarios, and we have been\nasked whether the discount window, the SRF, and also Federal Home Loan Bank\nadvances can play a role in those scenarios. The answer to this question is “yes.”\nWe provided clarity to the public in August on permissible assumptions for how\nfirms can incorporate the discount window and the SRF into their internal liquidity stress-\ntest scenarios. There are a couple of principles that underlie our response in the\nfrequently asked questions we posted on the Board’s website.3 One principle is that our\ntools are readily available to firms. This means that we see it as acceptable and beneficial\nfor firms to incorporate our facilities to meet liquidity needs in both planning and\npractice. If firms plan to use our facilities, we expect them to demonstrate ex ante that\nthey are fully capable of doing so, including through test transactions. An additional\nprinciple underlying our approach is that, while firms should be ready to use a range of\nfunding sources, firms need to hold sufficient highly liquid assets to meet their potential\nliquidity needs. That is, they need to self-insure against their own liquidity risks. A third\n3 See “Subparts D and O—Enhanced Prudential Standards” in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (2024), “Frequently Asked Questions about Regulation YY,” webpage,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/legalinterpretations/reg-yy-frequently-asked-questions.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nprinciple is that firms should be ready and able to use private channels to turn these assets\ninto cash, in addition to any public channels they may plan to use.\nI want to dig a bit deeper into the benefits to both individual firms and the\nfinancial system when firms incorporate Fed facilities into their stress preparedness\nplanning. Again, a design feature of our liquidity regulations is that large banks must\nself-insure against major liquidity risks. Our regulations also provide flexibility in terms\nof the portfolio composition such banks use to do so. This flexibility allows them to\nadjust their portfolios based on market conditions and firm needs. A key component of\nthis flexibility is that reserves and certain high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), such as\nTreasury securities, are equivalent in terms of being treated as the highest quality of\nliquid assets. This feature is important because, while it allows firms to manage their\nliquidity buffers more flexibly, it also allows for greater flexibility in our monetary policy\nimplementation and it supports market functioning. We have heard over the years,\nhowever, that the degree of substitutability among these assets has been limited by\nconcerns about capacity in stress for the market to turn securities into reserves\nimmediately; these concerns are valid. This constraint can be addressed in part by the\nappropriate incorporation of Federal Reserve facilities into monetization plans in firms’\ninternal liquidity stress tests.\nWhen firms understand that they will not be fully constrained by the capacity of\nprivate markets or their individual credit lines to monetize HQLA immediately in stress,\nthey can reduce their demand for reserves in favor of Treasury securities, all else being\nequal, for their stress planning purposes. This dynamic improves the substitutability of\n\n- 5 -\nholding reserves and holding Treasury securities either outright or through repo\ntransactions.\nWhen banks exhibit a high degree of substitutability of demand for these assets,\nmoney market functioning improves. Let me explain with an example. If a bank sees\nholding reserves and investing in Treasury repo as near substitutes in its liquidity\nportfolio, it should lend into Treasury repo markets when repo rates rise above the\ninterest rate earned on reserves. When banks can nimbly adjust portfolios in response to\nprice incentives, the efficiency of reserves redistribution through the system improves,\nand market functioning is enhanced.\nIn aggregate, this activity can prevent rates from rising further, all else being\nequal. The point at which banks, in aggregate, have a relatively immutable demand for\nreserves, and are unwilling to lend them out, is evident when a small decrease in the\nsupply of reserves results in a sharp increase in the cost to borrow them. Our monetary\npolicy tools are well positioned to help us avoid this outcome. But, of course, greater\nwillingness of banks to reallocate across close substitutes should help avoid the\nemergence of sudden pressures in money markets by reducing money market frictions.\nIn 2021, the Federal Reserve launched the SRF, which, along with the discount\nwindow, should help cap upward pressure in repo markets that could spill over into the\nfederal funds market. Use of these facilities also increases the supply of reserves in the\nsystem. The enhanced clarity for firms that Fed facilities are a fully acceptable venue to\nget same-day liquidity for their HQLA should help reassure firms about holding reserves\nand their close substitutes, such as Treasury securities, in their liquidity portfolios.\n\n- 6 -\nOf course, as I stated earlier, for the largest banks, there is a requirement that they\nhold highly liquid assets to address their own liquidity risks. They must also be ready to\nuse private markets to monetize these assets. It is also critical that banks recognize and\nmanage the interest rate and liquidity risk of their securities portfolios to ensure those\nsecurities held for liquidity purposes can be monetized in stress without creating other\nadverse effects on a firm’s safety and soundness. In 2022 and 2023, certain large banks\ndid not effectively manage the risks of rising rates, and suffered significant fair value\nlosses on their securities holdings, including those in held-to-maturity (HTM)\nportfolios. These losses affected their ability to respond to liquidity stress, as monetizing\nthe assets could result in realizing losses. When the banking stress hit in March 2023,\nthese securities could not be sold to meet stressed outflows because large unrealized\nlosses inhibited their sale without significant capital implications. This is further\ncomplicated in the case of HTM securities, which cannot be sold without risking\nrevaluing a firm’s entire HTM portfolio. Selling HTM securities to generate liquidity\nwould therefore have had a particularly large effect on these firms’ capital levels, likely\nincreasing the stress on these firms. Further, some firms were unable to rely on private\nchannels such as repo markets for monetization because they were not prepared, they\nwere not regular participants in the market, and market participants were unwilling to\nlend because of counterparty credit concerns. This combination of factors meant that\nHTM securities that had been identified by banks as available to serve as a liquidity\nbuffer of assets in stress could not effectively serve that function.\n\n- 7 -\nImprovements to Our Liquidity Regulations\nAs I have mentioned in previous speeches, to address the lessons about liquidity\nlearned in the spring of 2023, we are exploring targeted adjustments to our current\nliquidity framework.4 Many firms have taken steps to improve their liquidity resilience,\nand the regulatory adjustments we are considering would ensure that large banks\nmaintain better liquidity risk–management practices going forward. Improvements to our\nliquidity regulations will also complement the other components of our supervisory and\nregulatory regime by improving banks’ ability to respond to funding shocks.\nSpecifically, we are exploring a requirement that larger banks maintain a\nminimum amount of readily available liquidity with a pool of reserves and pre-positioned\ncollateral at the discount window, based on a fraction of their uninsured deposits.\nCommunity banks would not be covered, and we would take a tiered approach to the\nrequirements. The collateral pre-positioned at the window could include both Treasury\nsecurities and the full range of assets eligible for pledging at the discount window. It is\nvital that uninsured depositors have confidence that their funds will be readily available\nfor withdrawal, if needed, and this confidence would be enhanced by a requirement that\nlarger banks have readily available liquidity to meet requests for withdrawal of these\ndeposits. This requirement would be a complement to existing liquidity regulations such\n4 See Michael S. Barr (2024), “On Building a Resilient Regulatory Framework,” speech delivered at\nCentral Banking in the Post-Pandemic Financial System, 28th Annual Financial Markets Conference, the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Fernandina Beach, Fla., May 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240520a.htm#fn8.\n\n- 8 -\nas those that require the internal liquidity stress tests (ILST) I described earlier as well as\nmeeting the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).5\nIncorporating the discount window into a readiness requirement would also\nreemphasize that supervisors and examiners view use of the discount window as\nappropriate under both normal and stressed market conditions.\nIn addition, as I have discussed previously, we identified significant gaps in\ninterest rate risk management in the March 2023 banking stress, including in portfolios of\nhighly liquid securities. Relatedly, we saw that banks faced constraints in monetizing\nHTM assets with large unrealized losses in private markets because they were unable to\nrepo these securities or sell these securities without realizing significant losses. To\naddress these gaps, we are considering a partial limit on the extent of reliance on HTM\nassets in larger banks’ liquidity buffers, such as those held under the LCR and ILST\nrequirements. These adjustments would address the known challenges of banks being\nable to use these assets in stress conditions.\nFinally, we are reviewing the treatment of a handful of types of deposits in the\ncurrent liquidity framework. Observed behavior of different deposit types during times\nof stress suggests the need to recalibrate deposit outflow assumptions in our rules for\ncertain types of depositors. We are also revisiting the scope of application of our current\nliquidity framework for large banks.\n5 The LCR and ILST are two separate, but complementary, liquidity requirements. The LCR is a\nstandardized liquidity measure across banks, meaning the outflow assumptions are the same for each bank.\nThe ILST is a nonstandardized liquidity measure across banks, meaning each bank determines its own\noutflow assumptions, subject to supervisory input.\n\n- 9 -\nThese enhancements to our liquidity regulations will help bolster firms’ ability to\nmanage liquidity shocks, and they will also be well integrated with our monetary policy\ntools and framework.\nModernizing Our Tools to Meet Current and Future Needs\nTurning back to the discount window, I also want to note that the discount\nwindow has served its role well in recent years, and that we are also engaging in ongoing\nwork to improve its operations. Given the crucial role of the discount window in\nproviding ready access to liquidity in a wide variety of market conditions, we\ncontinuously work to assess and improve its functionality while engaging with current\nand potential users of the window.\nAmong the steps we have taken recently include that we now have an online\nportal, Discount Window Direct, that allows firms to request and prepay discount\nwindow loans in a more streamlined manner than was previously possible. We also\nrecently published a request for information on discount window operations and daylight\ncredit asking about key components of these functions. Feedback from the public will\nhelp us prioritize areas for improvement, so I strongly encourage anyone with an interest\nin this topic to weigh in during the comment period. Your feedback will help us ensure\nthat the discount window continues to improve in its role of providing ready access to\nfunding under a variety of market conditions.\nThank you.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nGeorgetown University Law Center\nWashington, D.C.\nFebruary 20, 2025\n\nBanks play an indispensable role in an economy that works for everyone.1 They enable\nhouseholds to borrow to buy a home, save for the future, and deal with the ups and downs of\nmanaging finances. Banks provide the credit for businesses to smooth out income and expenses,\nsupply capital to seize new opportunities and create jobs, and facilitate the flow of payments that\nare the lifeblood of our economy. And banks borrow from households and businesses as well,\nsuch as through federally insured deposits. Because of these vital roles, we need to make sure\nthat banks are resilient and serve as a source of strength to the economy in both good times and\nwhen the financial system comes under stress. In our market economy, like any business, banks\ncompete with each other and pursue profits by balancing risk-taking with safety and soundness.\nBut because of the key role banks play in the economy, and the fact that banks do not fully\ninternalize the costs of their own failure, regulation and supervision must ensure that banks do\nnot take on excessive risks that can cause widespread harm to households and businesses.\nBank failures are as old as banking, and we’ve seen repeated waves of bank failures over\nthe centuries. America learned that hard lesson nearly 100 years ago, when bank failures played\na central role in the Great Depression. In response, the United States—and many other countries\naround the globe—set up a system of deposit insurance and enabled emergency lending in times\nof stress. To balance the moral hazard of the federal safety net, Congress established a\nframework of regulation and supervision to make it more likely that banks internalize the costs to\nsociety of their risk-taking.\nBut finance is always evolving, and the buildup of new risks led to the banking crisis of\nthe 1980s, and then to the Global Financial Crisis, with devastating consequences. Weaknesses\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board\nor the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nthat were revealed in regulation and supervision led to unprecedented and unpopular bailouts,\nand shuttered American businesses, devastated local communities with foreclosures, and millions\nof individuals lost their jobs and their livelihoods. Government responded in the Dodd-Frank\nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and in regulatory reforms by\nsignificantly strengthening bank oversight to curb excessive risk-taking. The message from the\nAmerican people was clear: risk-taking must be balanced with the overarching need to maintain\na resilient banking system that can continue to play its crucial role for households and businesses\nin good times and in bad.\nAnother, perennial lesson from the history of bank regulation and supervision is that the\njob is never done, and that the constant evolution of finance means risks will also evolve. As\nVice Chair for Supervision, I have recognized the need to approach this mission with humility,\naware that I don’t have all the answers or perfect foresight of where things can go wrong. Both\nregulators and banks are limited in our ability to comprehensively identify and measure risks.\nOur financial system is complex, interconnected, and evolving. We cannot fully appreciate how\na specific vulnerability can interact with other vulnerabilities to amplify and propagate risk in the\nface of shocks, let alone accurately anticipate shocks in time to avoid them.\nWhen I became Vice Chair for Supervision in July 2022, the Global Financial Crisis was\nalmost 15 years past, and much had been done to strengthen the resilience of the system to reflect\nlessons learned. But in March 2023, we experienced the second largest bank failure in history,\nSilicon Valley Bank (SVB), and the subsequent failures of Signature Bank and First Republic\nBank. SVB’s failure triggered stress throughout the system and required the issuance of a\n\n- 3 -\nsystemic risk exemption and the creation of an emergency bank lending program.2 We have\nmade some progress toward addressing the gaps that led to the failures. But there will be\nheadwinds that we must guard against in the coming years, as well as ongoing vulnerabilities and\nareas of risk that require continued vigilance.\nEarlier this year, I announced I would step down as Vice Chair for Supervision but\nremain a member of the Board of Governors. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as\nvice chair for supervision, and to work with colleagues to help maintain the stability and strength\nof the U.S. financial system so that it can meet the needs of households and businesses. I’ve\ndetermined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as\ngovernor. In this role, I’ll continue to participate in monetary policy deliberations and vote on\nmatters before the Board, including those related to supervision and regulation.\nWhile it was a tough decision to make, I believe it was the right decision for the\ninstitution and, more importantly, for the public, whom we serve. The risk of a dispute over my\nposition would be a distraction from our important mission. I feel strongly—as Chair Powell has\nsaid publicly many times—that the independence of the Federal Reserve is critical to our ability\nto meet our statutory mandates and serve the American public. Put simply, our mission is too\nimportant to let such a dispute distract from doing our job for the American people.\nSince my term for Vice Chair for Supervision will end later this month, I’d like to use one\nof my last opportunities as Vice Chair to discuss seven specific risks ahead: (1) maintaining and\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Department of the Treasury, and Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation, “Joint Statement by Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC,” press release, March 12, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312b.htm; and Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Announces It Will Make Available Additional Funding to Eligible\nDepository Institutions to Help Assure Banks Have the Ability to Meet the Needs of All Their Depositors,” press\nrelease, March 12, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nfinishing post-financial crisis reforms; (2) maintaining the credibility of the stress test; (3)\nmaintaining credible, consistent supervision; (4) encouraging responsible innovation; (5)\naddressing cyber and third-party risk; (6) risks in the nonbank sector; and (7) climate risk. Each\nwill continue to be a risk in either the near- or long-term.\nMaintaining and Finishing Post-Financial Crisis Reforms\nThere is always push back on financial regulation. I felt that even in the wake of the\nGlobal Financial Crisis, as I helped to draft the legislative response to that crisis, the Dodd-Frank\nAct.3 And I felt that over the last few years as we worked to finish the job of post-crisis financial\nreform and take up evolving threats revealed from the latest bank stress. It is important to get the\nbalance right, but it is also important to stand up for the American people.\nI urge regulators to finish the job of implementing the final plank of the Global Financial\nCrisis reforms—and not to dismantle the hard-fought resilience that banks have built up in the\nprocess. Of course, there are always ways to increase efficiency and reform prior methods\nwithout costs to resiliency, and I support those efforts. But as I’ve spoken about many times,\ncapital is critical to absorb losses and enable banks to continue operations through times of\nstress, and capital requirements should be aligned with the risks that banks take.4 The Basel III\nendgame reforms include many improvements to how we measure credit, trading, operational,\n3 See, e.g., U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Remarks by Assistant Secretary Michael Barr” (speech at the\nFinancial Times Global Finance Forum, New York, NY, December 2, 2010), https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-\nreleases/tg986.\n4 See, e.g., speeches by Michael S.

All major\njurisdictions except the United States have finalized rules that would implement these standards\nfor their internationally active banks.\nThe Federal Reserve played a central role in developing these standards in the many\nyears before my arrival as Vice Chair. The Board sought comment on a proposal in July 2023 to\nimplement the Basel III reforms, and we received a wide range of comments on the proposal.5\nOn the basis of those comments, I took steps last fall to outline broad and material changes that\nwould better balance the benefits and costs of capital in light of comments received and would\nresult in a capital framework that appropriately reflects the risks of banks.6 These reforms had\nbroad consensus on the Board and the support of the heads of the Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nWhen the U.S. provides leadership in international forums like Basel and then follows\nthrough, we set a powerful example and establish a standard that other jurisdictions also uphold.\nImplementing international standards enables U.S. firms to compete on a level playing field\nacross the globe and makes the system safer. When we don’t follow through on our\ncommitments, for whatever reason, concerns about a level playing field rise in other\njurisdictions, in an international “race to the bottom” on standards. This harms us all and makes\nU.S. banks less competitive. And unless the U.S. implements these standards, other jurisdictions\nwill force U.S. banks operating abroad to meet their standards instead.\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Agencies Request Comment on Proposed Rules to Strengthen\nCapital Requirements for Large Banks,” press release, July 27, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230727a.htm.\n6 by Michael S.

In that event, we\nlearned that bank runs and bank failures can happen fast, much faster than before. Before SVB,\nthe largest bank to fail did so over a period of several weeks. The deposit losses experienced by\nSVB were much greater in both relative and absolute terms, and they occurred in less than 24\nhours.7\nOver the past two years, the Federal Reserve has worked with banks to improve their\nability to borrow from the discount window, and the financial system’s collective readiness has\nimproved significantly compared to pre-SVB, including with a substantial increase of $1 trillion\nin collateral pledged across the system.8 The Federal Reserve has also worked to improve the\nfunctioning of the discount window, through a concerted effort to gather public input and identify\nareas for modernization. These efforts have improved the ability of banks to weather stress, both\nindividually and collectively, which enhances financial stability.\nHowever, there is still more work to do. For instance, banks, even the largest banks, are\nnot currently required to establish a minimum level of readiness at the window, and, as a result,\nthere are outlier firms that are not prepared for stress. This needs to change. Without a\nrequirement there is also a significant risk of backtracking on the substantial progress in\nreadiness we have made since March 2023.\nAnother important lesson from SVB is a classic one: balance sheet vulnerabilities among\na group of institutions can be a source of contagion for the financial system and thus a key\nstability risk. While we did much to improve the resilience of global systemically important\n7 See “Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S. Barr memo” in Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nReview of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank (Washington, April 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf.\n8 See “Discount Window Readiness,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/discount-window-\nreadiness.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nbanks (G-SIBs) in the past decade, March 2023 showed that significant systemic risks can\ndevelop and spread from stress anywhere in the system, including in large and regional banks\nthat are not G-SIBs.9\nThe resilience of these firms has improved as they have recognized their vulnerabilities,\nand we have worked through supervisory channels to encourage risk-management practices that\nput them on a firmer footing. But we also need to put in place more durable solutions to address\nrisks. For one, the level of capital held by large banks needs to align with the underlying risks on\ntheir balance sheets. One important step would be to finalize the requirement that all large firms\nreflect unrealized losses on available for sale securities in their capital, which is a reform with\nbroad agreement. This will help them manage interest rate risk before it gets to extreme levels, a\nsignificant problem revealed in the banking stress of two years ago.\nAnother lesson from the spring of 2023 is that large and regional banks—as well as G-\nSIBs—should ensure that they can actually monetize the securities on which they rely for their\nliquidity. Why does this matter? Banks need to be able to turn a portion of their assets into cash\nwith a speed sufficient to meet outflows when uninsured depositors or other short-term creditors\ndemand it. Regulation needs to reflect realistic assumptions about monetization.\nWe should also consider updating some assumptions about deposit outflows in our\nliquidity requirements so that they better align with observed stress behavior. During the stress\nin 2023, we saw uninsured deposits from high-net worth individuals and certain entities, such as\nventure capital firms, behave more like highly sophisticated financial counterparties than\n9 For an earlier perspective, see Hearing on Prudential Oversight before the Senate Committee on Banking,\nHousing and Urban Affairs, July 23, 2015 (statement by Michael S. Barr),\nhttps://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/BarrTestimony72315.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\nnonfinancial companies or ordinary retail depositors, which is how they are generally treated in\nregulations.10 This mis-measured risk of deposit outflows means banks may not have sufficient\nliquidity to manage a stress period.\nIn a related vein, banks have stepped up their use of reciprocal deposit arrangements—\narrangements where deposits are spread across many banks within a network—as a way to\nmanage the risk of deposit amounts over $250,000.11 While this arrangement spreads risk across\nthe banking system, it is a strategy that has not been tested in a large-scale stress event. It is only\nlogical to wonder how the attenuation of relationships between customers and banks under\nreciprocal arrangements will affect the behavior of depositors worried about a bank run. We also\nneed to be attentive to operational risks in these arrangements, as well as the risk-management\ncapacity of these companies to manage these relationships under stress.\nA final lesson from the bank stress two years ago is that we need to do more to ensure\nthat all banks that come under stress can be resolved in an orderly fashion. One way to do this\nwould be to require all large banks—including those that are not G-SIBS—to issue certain\namounts of long-term debt. This would have helped reassure depositors worried about the\nstability of bank funding and aided in the eventual resolution of at least some of the banks that\ncame under stress in 2023. The banking agencies have proposed a rule on long-term debt\n10 12 CFR 249. 32-33.

For instance, risks remain in the commercial real estate market, particularly within\nthe office segment, as borrowers may find it difficult to refinance maturing loans. And interest\nrate risk, especially for those with high levels of uninsured deposits, remains a key area of focus.\nMaintain the Credibility of the Stress Test\nWe face a challenging environment with the Federal Reserve’s annual stress tests. The\nstress tests helped the financial sector emerge from the Global Financial Crisis and rebuild its\ncredibility. The annual stress tests are still important to the financial sector’s credibility today.\nThe stress tests help banks, market participants, and supervisors understand the banks’\nvulnerabilities to shocks and to guard against those shocks by holding sufficient capital.\nIn December, the Board announced that, due to the evolving legal landscape, we would\nbe undertaking significant changes to the stress tests to reduce capital volatility and improve\ntransparency.13 While I recognize that we need to increase transparency to reflect changes in the\n12 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Agencies Request Comment on Proposed Rule to Require\nLarge Banks to Maintain Long-Term Debt to Improve Financial Stability and Resolution,” press release, August 29,\n2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230829a.htm.\n13 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Due to Evolving Legal Landscape and Changes in the\nFramework of Administrative Law, Federal Reserve Board Will Soon Seek Public Comment on Significant Changes\nto Improve Transparency of Bank Stress Tests and Reduce Volatility of Resulting Capital Requirements,” press\nrelease, December 23, 2024, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20241223a.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nlegal environment in which we operate, there are good reasons why I and many of my colleagues\nand predecessors have been averse to such full disclosures since the inception of the stress test\nfifteen years ago. There are several risks that we will need to guard against.\nFirst, we need to guard against the risk that the process results in reduced capital\nrequirements. As they did during the Basel III process, banks are likely to argue against various\naspects of the Fed’s models that result in higher capital requirements, and not to highlight the\nareas in which the models underestimate risks. We should take those comments on the Fed’s\nmodels seriously and adjust the models as appropriate, but we should be careful not to\novercorrect and lower bank capital requirements in ways that underestimate aggregate risk. The\nAdministrative Procedure Act should be a vehicle for transparency and public input into agency\naction, not used to weaken regulatory requirements that preserve the safety and stability of our\nfinancial system.\nSecond, we need to guard against the risk that banks lower their capital requirements\nbecause of increased transparency. Increased disclosure of details about the Fed’s stress models\ncould enable banks to optimize stress test results by adjusting their balance sheet based on their\nknowledge of where the models underprice risk, in order to reduce their capital requirements\nwithout materially reducing risks. Gaming the test in this way would be a bad outcome for risk\nmanagement and our economy.\nThird, banks are likely to change their behavior in other ways that increase risk. We\nshould be aware of the risk that full transparency into the models and scenarios used by\nregulators could discourage banks from investing in their own risk management if the test\nbecomes too predictable. Full transparency may also encourage concentration across the system\nin assets that receive comparably lighter treatment in the test. And banks are likely to reduce\n\n- 11 -\ntheir management buffers over required levels, which will bring greater risks of breaching the\nminimums and regulatory buffers when a significant risk event eventually happens.\nThe fourth risk, and perhaps the greatest one, is that over time, given the difficulty of\nnavigating the notice and comment rulemaking process on an ongoing basis to update the models\nwe use, the dynamism and accuracy of the stress test will fade.14 And as the events of two years\nago show, it is hard to predict where risks will emerge in the financial system; an inherent\nchallenge of preserving the relevancy of stress testing is coming up with a set of adverse\nscenarios that are novel enough, and dynamic enough, to reflect the risks that banks may face\nfrom unanticipated developments. I believe that the Fed should commit to investing in a\ncredible, effective process to maintain the dynamism of the binding stress test by regularly\nupdating its models and scenario variables to reflect changes in the environment and changes to\nbank behavior. This will require resources and a strong commitment up front and over time, but\nit will be necessary to maintain a credible stress test.\nOne effort we’ve already undertaken should help: to maintain the dynamism of the stress\ntest, we launched exploratory stress scenarios to consider a wider range of possible conditions.15\nThe Fed used this approach during the pandemic, and we’ve now made it a regular part of our\nannual stress test exercise.16 The exploratory scenarios are not used to set binding capital\nrequirements and are only reported on an aggregate level, but they help the Fed better understand\n14 That model sclerosis contributed to the failure of the supervisory stress test used for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nbefore the Global Financial Crisis, with devastating results. Scott Frame, Krisopher Gerardi, and Paul Willen, “The\nFailure of Supervisory Stress Testing: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and OFHEO,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nWorking Paper No. 15-4 (October 2015).\n15 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Exploratory Analysis of Risks to the Banking System\n(Washington: June 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/exploratory-analysis-results-\n20240626.pdf.\n16 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Assessment of Bank Capital during the Recent Coronavirus\nEvent (Washington: June 2020), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2020-sensitivity-analysis-\n20200625.pdf.\n\n- 12 -\nrisks posed to individual banks and to the banking system as a whole that are not captured in\nbinding scenarios. I hope and trust that the Fed will continue this important analytical work.\nAs an additional backstop to help ensure banks have sufficient capital to withstand losses,\nthe Fed should preserve its discretion to set individually binding capital requirements on firms\nbased on supervisory judgment under the International Lending Supervision Act. Jurisdictions\naround the world undertake a similar process under a so-called Basel “Pillar 2” approach, and the\nUnited States would benefit from using such a framework as well. That is all the more important\ngiven the changes the Fed is undertaking for the binding stress tests.\nMaintaining Credible, Consistent Supervision\nAnother area warranting continued vigilance is supervision. There will undoubtedly be\ncalls to revamp supervision to reduce burden. And I am all for making sure supervision is the\nmost effective and efficient it can be. Supervisors need to focus on the most urgent and\nimportant risks, and not burden firms with unnecessary or distracting matters. But we need to be\ncareful to preserve and enhance the ability of supervisors to act with speed, force, and agility as\nappropriate to the risk.\nSupervisors have emphasized proactive supervisory engagement, which helps banks\naddress issues before they grow so large as to threaten the bank or broader financial stability.\nEarlier intervention means that firms are likely to have more options to fix their problems, with\nlittle impact on bank profitability.17\nWe should continue work to improve the effectiveness of our supervision and use data-\ndriven analysis to improve our scoping and prioritization of supervisory issues. I support this\n17 Beverly Hirtle and Anna Kovner, “Bank Supervision,” Annual Review of Financial Economics 14 (2022): 39–56.\n\n- 13 -\nwork to the extent that it makes our supervision more effective and focused on the right issues.\nBut the Board should resist initiatives that impede effective supervision by discouraging\nexaminers to flag issues early, or initiatives that increase unnecessary process around issuing\nfindings in a manner that impedes the speed and agility of supervision when it is needed. More\ngenerally, supervision is another area in which “efficiency and competitiveness” should not be\nused as an excuse for lax oversight that significantly impairs the safety and soundness of\nindividual institutions and undermines broader financial stability.\nWe should take caution from our experience with SVB. While some have claimed that\nthe examiners at SVB did not focus on the right issues, it’s important to highlight that the Office\nof Inspector General (OIG) concluded that the Fed allocated an insufficient number of examiner\nresources to SVB while in the RBO portfolio, and that the examiners assigned to SVB as it was\ngrowing did not have sufficient expertise in supervising large, complex institutions.18 Once it\nwas in the large bank portfolio, examiners highlighted the risk from interest rate risk and\nuninsured depositors, but did not act with sufficient force to get the bank to change course in a\ntimely way. We’ve made important changes since then, but we need to be sure we get the staff\nresources in place, and provide support to examiners on the front line, so that they can act with\nthe speed, force, and agility warranted by the facts.\nEncouraging Responsible Innovation\nAnother set of risks involve those related to the role of innovative technology in the\nfinancial sector. Innovation, when done responsibly, brings tremendous benefits to consumers,\nfinancial institutions, and the economy at large. For instance, blockchain technology underlying\n18 Office of Inspector General, Material Loss Review of Silicon Valley Bank (Washington: September 25, 2023),\nhttps://oig.federalreserve.gov/reports/board-material-loss-review-silicon-valley-bank-sep2023.pdf.\n\n- 14 -\ncrypto-assets has the potential to make financial services better, cheaper, and faster. Responsible\nuse of this technology could make banking more efficient and accessible to more consumers.\nWith any new technology, there are new risks. To achieve the benefits in a durable\nmanner over time, we must ensure that the associated risks are managed appropriately. With\ncrypto-assets, investors do not currently have the structural protections they have relied on for\nmany decades in other financial markets. It is important that those guardrails are put in place to\navoid issues such as the misuse of client funds, misrepresentations, obfuscation about availability\nof deposit insurance, and fraud. We should also recognize that some of the attractive attributes of\ncrypto-assets—the pseudonymous actors that are parties to transactions, the ease and speed of\ntransfer, and the general irrevocability of transactions—also make crypto-assets attractive for use\nin money laundering and terrorist financing. It is encouraging to see innovators develop tools\nand processes to better manage these risks, while harnessing the benefits of the technology. But\nregulation and supervision also have an essential role to play.\nResponsible innovation is in everyone’s interest. In the past few years, we stood up the\nNovel Activities Supervision Program, which dedicates resources to understanding how\ntechnology is transforming banking and supports banks’ ability to innovate while ensuring that\nbanks clearly understand and manage the risks associated with innovative activities.19 I hope and\ntrust that approach will continue.\nAddressing Cyber and Third-Party Risk\nCyber risk from both foreign powers and non-state actors has become a major concern for\nbanks, and regulators will need to ensure that these risks are being properly managed. The\n19 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/novel-activities-supervision-program.htm.\n\n- 15 -\noperational disruption propagated through a third-party security company last summer was a\nwake-up call for banks and regulators about vulnerabilities in a system where security is\noutsourced. Disruption of one of these critical systems may compromise a bank’s ability to\nexecute important functions and adversely affect individual firm safety and soundness as well as\nthe broader financial system. Given the significant concentration in the IT industry, we should\nexpect operational failures at single IT entities to have potentially far-reaching effects, no matter\ntheir original cause. And advances in artificial intelligence are likely to give bad actors new\ntools for fraud and infiltration, while also providing banks with new tools to combat these\nattacks. Both banks and the Federal Reserve need to continue to invest in cyber resiliency.\nRisks in the Nonbank Sector\nLet me speak next to the perennial concerns of intermediation by financial firms outside\nthe bank regulatory perimeter. An increasingly varied and evolving collection of nonbank\nclients, including hedge funds, private credit, and insurance companies, is playing a significant\nrole in the global economy and presenting new risks.\nBeginning with hedge funds, bank exposures to hedge funds have risen over the past\nseveral years, and concurrently, hedge fund leverage remains near historic highs.20 Archegos’s\nfailure revealed the risks presented by hedge funds and the degree of interconnectedness between\nbanks and hedge funds. And the exploratory analysis as part of last year’s stress test showed that\n20 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (Washington: November 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20241122.pdf.\n\n- 16 -\nbanks have material exposures to hedge funds under certain market conditions, and that the\nhedge fund counterparty exposures can vary significant based on the specific set of shocks.21\nOne area that has grown substantially is the Treasury cash-futures basis trade.22 The\nbasis trade helps provide liquidity and price discovery in normal times, as hedge funds trade with\nasset managers and other financial institutions to align returns to holding Treasury securities and\nrelated futures. But the trade involves high levels of leverage, which can contribute to a rapid\nunwinding in positions and exacerbate market stress, as we saw in the spring of 2020. In\nprinciple, margining practices and participants’ risk-management activities should limit these\nrisks, but individual firms do not account for the spillovers their actions can have on market\nfunctioning. These externalities suggest a role for regulation, and the central clearing mandate\nfor Treasury market trading is an important step in supporting the resilience of this market. At\nthe same time, we need to continue to consider how we can support the collection of minimum\nmargin across trading venues and in bilateral trades to avoid loopholes and risks, and continue to\nmonitor banks’ credit risk management practices with these hedge fund counterparties.\nAnother area that has experienced rapid growth in recent years is private credit, which is\nnow comparable in size to the high-yield bond market and leveraged loan market.23 Traditional\nprivate credit arrangements rely on limited leverage and generally have long-term funding,\nmaking them less vulnerable to the deleveraging spiral associated with high leverage and short-\nterm funding. Nonetheless, risks may be growing. The connections between private credit and\n21 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Exploratory Analysis of Risks to the Banking System\n(Washington: June 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/exploratory-analysis-results-\n20240626.pdf.\n22 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (Washington: November 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20241122.pdf.\n23 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (Washington: November 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20241122.pdf.\n\n- 17 -\nbanks have been expanding, and private credit remains opaque, with limited information relative\nto asset classes of similar size.24 Moreover, the rapid growth and opacity of the sector raise the\nrisk that recent private credit arrangements may be assuming new risks. Retail investors can now\ngain exposure to the asset class through mutual or exchange traded funds, which could present\nthe age-old consumer and financial stability risks we see when opaque, illiquid assets are\nconverted to liquid ones.25\nWe also need to monitor risks in the insurance industry. Households planning for\nretirement often rely on life insurance companies to provide them a steady stream of income. In\nprinciple, life insurance companies are the ultimate patient investor and thus the natural vehicle\nto finance long-maturity and risky projects. Indeed, while venture capital funding gets a lot of\nthe attention, mobilized retirement savings through life insurance companies have supported\nlong-term investments in capital-intensive projects. However, life insurance companies, just like\nother financial institutions, can overpromise and be tempted to take on greater risk than their\nliability holders or regulators appreciate. Given the complexity of some investment vehicles, the\ninstitutions themselves may not fully appreciate all of the risks. The life insurance sector has\nbeen changing. Even as the life insurance industry has been increasing its holdings of assets\noriginated by private equity firms, private equity firms have been acquiring life insurers directly.\nMoreover, private-equity-affiliated insurers rely more heavily on nontraditional liabilities, which\nmay prove flighty in a stress event. This is something to watch carefully.

The Federal Reserve has a responsibility to recognize emerging risks to the safety and\nsoundness of banks, to the ability of households and businesses to access financial services, and\nto financial stability. Costly natural disasters could present just such risks.\nThe recent wildfires in California should be a wake-up call that we need to focus on how\ninsurance markets will need to adjust to more frequent and severe weather events. The loss of\nlife and hardship borne by many households is tragic, and the economic losses associated with\nthe wildfires, while uncertain, are likely to be among the largest losses from a natural disaster on\nrecord. The wildfires should remind us of the problems in property and casualty insurance\nmarkets—just as the severe flooding caused by Hurricane Helene reminded us of significant gaps\nin flood insurance coverage.\nOften the structure and regulation of insurance markets prevents risk from being\nappropriately priced, limiting the ability of market signals to influence development and\nadaptation in high-risk areas and contributing to the buildup of risks. And there is a broader\nquestion of the extent to which private capital will be sufficient to cover increasing natural\ndisaster risk.\nThe Federal Reserve has an important but narrow role to play with respect to climate\nchange, and that is to focus on risks from climate change to bank safety and soundness and\nfinancial stability. The pilot climate scenario analysis conducted by the Federal Reserve was an\n\n- 19 -\nimportant step forward in assessing the capacity of the largest banks, as well as in building our\nown capacity, to perform the kind of analysis that is increasingly crucial as risks arising from\nmore severe weather events become a driver of financial risk for specific firms and the broader\neconomy.26 Guidance for the largest banks also plays an important role in reminding banks of\nbasic principles in prudent risk management as it applies to these types of climate-related risks.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the United States has the benefit of a strong, vigorous economy, the\ndeepest and most liquid markets in the world, and a critical place in the world economy through\nthe role of the U.S. dollar. The Federal Reserve has an essential role in maintaining the strength\nand resilience of the U.S. economy, including through its vigilance about the risks I discussed\ntoday. A strong and resilient banking system benefits the American people. We need to be\nhumble about our ability to predict shocks to the financial system, and how they will propagate\nthrough vulnerabilities in the system. That is why it is so important to have strong regulation and\nsupervision as shock absorbers to protect households and businesses from risks emanating from\nthe financial system.\nIn closing, I want to speak directly to the staff of the Federal Reserve and express my\ndeep gratitude. Your rigorous analysis and deep expertise are fundamental to our ability to\npromote a strong and stable financial system that serves the American people.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n2:00 p.m. EDT\nSeptember 7, 2022\nMaking the Financial System Safer and Fairer\nRemarks by\nMichael S. Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Brookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\nSeptember 7, 2022\n\nThank you, David, and thank you to the Brookings Institution for the invitation to speak\nto you today.1 On July 19, I had the honor of being sworn in as the Vice Chair for Supervision\nof the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. This job was created after the Global\nFinancial Crisis to lead the Fed’s work overseeing the safety and soundness of banks and in\nsupport of its financial stability mandate. In the 12 years since then, great progress has been\nmade in strengthening the banking system, and in strengthening oversight. I look forward to\nbuilding on that work by helping to make the financial system safer and fairer, in support of an\neconomy that serves the needs of households and businesses.\nOn behalf of those who may wonder what “building on that work” means, I will speak\nabout some of my near-term goals and how I will approach achieving them. Starting with that\nword “building,” which to me means more than just “maintaining.” Success in financial\nregulation and supervision does not mean standing still because finance does not stand still. The\nregulatory and supervisory framework adopted after the crisis recognizes that innovation and\nchange are constant in finance, that our understanding of existing and emerging risks can and\nshould deepen over time, and that regulation and supervision must evolve to be effective. Many\nissues at the forefront of banking regulation today were not prominent five years ago, and some\nof them scarcely even existed. “Building” means staying ahead of changes, evaluating how\nbanks are managing risks, and making the financial system safer and fairer for households and\nbusinesses.\nWhen I say that one of my top goals is to make the financial system safer, it is because\nkeeping it safe involves an active and never-ending effort to analyze risks and make necessary\n1 I am grateful to Laura Lipscomb of the Federal Reserve Board for her assistance in preparing this text.\nThe views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or\nthe Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nadjustments. There is no responsible alternative to this approach because the stakes are far too\nhigh to do otherwise. The Global Financial Crisis caused a terrible recession and brought the\nUnited States to the brink of an economic collapse that could have been worse than the Great\nDepression of the 1930s. A significant cause was excessive risk-taking by banks and inadequate\nregulation and supervision by the Fed and other bank regulators. A hard-won lesson from the\ncrisis is that the savings of every retiree, the job of every worker, the payroll of every business,\nand the well-being of every individual depend on a safe and stable financial system.\nIn addition to making the financial system safer, I am also committed to making it fairer.\nFairness is fundamental to financial oversight, and I am committed to using the tools of\nregulation, supervision, and enforcement so that businesses and households have access to the\nservices they need, the information necessary to make their financial decisions, and protection\nfrom unfair treatment. Safety and fairness may seem like distinct goals, but they are intertwined.\nFinancial instability unfairly harms those who are economically vulnerable, so making the\nfinancial system safer is making it fairer.\nCapital\nNothing is more basic to the safety and soundness of banks and the stability of the\nfinancial system than capital. Capital enables firms to serve as a source of strength to the\neconomy by continuing to lend through good times and bad. To continue to perform these\nfunctions, banks must have a sufficient level of capital to ensure that they can absorb losses and\ncontinue operations during times of stress in the financial system when losses may be\nsignificant.2\n2 The financial crisis showed that pre-crisis bank capital requirements and levels were far short of this\nstandard. Since then, capital requirements have increased substantially and banks have accordingly\nincreased their capital and greatly improved their ability to understand their risks and plan for their capital\n\n- 3 -\nAn important principle of the capital framework is that it must evolve through a\ncontinuous process of incorporating new risks that may emerge. While history is a guide to\nidentifying the range of stresses that a bank may face, capital policy must also be forward-\nlooking and responsive to changes in macroeconomic conditions, market structure, and financial\nactivities.\nA second principle is that the capital framework should be risk focused. Different\nactivities pose different potential for loss, and the capital regime should calibrate requirements to\naccount for the risks of specific activities. At the same time, simpler, non-risk-based approaches\ncan serve as important backstops, given the complexity of risk-based approaches and evidence\nthat these approaches can be gamed. As such, leverage ratios also serve an important role in this\nframework.\nA third principle is that requirements should be tiered. As firms increase in systemic\nimportance, the social cost of their failure grows. Regulations should be designed to require\nfirms to internalize the costs that their potential failure would impose on the broader financial\nsystem and thus on businesses and households. This means that firms face higher costs through\nmore stringent regulations as they grow in complexity, size, and interconnectedness. And\nrightly, that community banks face simpler regulations.\nWe are looking holistically at our capital tools to understand how they are supporting the\nresilience of the financial system, individually and in combination. When calibrating\nrequirements, we will work to minimize unintended consequences, limit opportunities for\ngaming, and avoid excess compliance costs that do not result in risk reduction. Taking a holistic\nview will help us consider adjustments, if any, to the supplementary leverage ratio,\nneeds, in concert with a greatly improved regulatory framework for capital that more accurately assesses\nrisks to individual institutions in a complex, dynamic, and interconnected financial system.\n\n- 4 -\ncountercyclical capital buffer, and stress testing. Within this context, I am also committed to\nimplementing enhanced regulatory capital requirements that align with the final set of “Basel III”\nstandards or the so-called the “Basel endgame.” This process will involve working with other\nfederal banking agencies and soliciting public input, and I’ll have more to say about this later\nthis fall.\nResolution\nSufficient capital in the financial system helps support the resiliency of individual banks,\nbut it is still important to ensure that, if a large firm gets into trouble, it can be resolved without a\ncostly bailout. The Dodd-Frank Act established the framework necessary to end bank bailouts.\nIt provides the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) with the authority to resolve any\nfirm whose failure would pose substantial risks to our financial system, in a way that will protect\nthe economy while ensuring that large financial firms—not taxpayers—bear any costs. In\naddition, the Fed and FDIC require large banks to develop living wills to demonstrate that they\ncan be resolved in an orderly way.\nMany gains have been made from this process. While recognizing these gains, we need\nto continue to analyze whether firms are taking all appropriate steps to limit the costs to society\nof their potential failure. As such, we will continue to work with the FDIC to rigorously review\nfirms’ plans, making clear when firms do not meet our expectations and when remediation is\nnecessary. In addition, beyond globally systemically important banks, or G-SIBs, we will be\nlooking at the resolvability of some of the other largest banks as they grow and as their\nsignificance in the financial system increases. As we consider future policy actions in this area,\nthe Fed will work with our colleagues at other banking regulatory agencies and seek public\ncomment.\n\n- 5 -\nBank Merger Policy Review\nMergers are a feature of vibrant industries, but the advantages that firms seek to gain\nthrough mergers must be weighed against the risks that mergers can pose to competition,\nconsumers, and financial stability. Another priority of mine is to evaluate our approach to\nreviewing banks’ proposed acquisitions.3 The Board is required to consider a range of factors\nwhen reviewing proposed mergers. A merged institution may be able to provide more\ncompetitive products and services, but it could also have the potential to reduce competition and\naccess to financial services in a geographic area by raising prices, narrowing the range of\nservices offered, and reducing the supply of small business or community development loans that\nrely on local knowledge. Assessing these risks is a crucial component of reviewing proposed\nmergers. In addition, we review the potential effects on the convenience and needs of the\ncommunities to be served by the merged entity, particularly low-income communities.4 Under\nthe Dodd-Frank Act, we are also required to consider financial stability risks. These risks may\nbe difficult to assess, but this consideration is critical. I am working with Federal Reserve staff\nto assess how we are performing merger analysis and where we can do better.\nStablecoins as Private Money\n3 The relevant statutes with respect to proposed acquisitions include the Bank Holding Company Act\n(BHCA), Bank Merger Act (BMA), Dodd-Frank Act, and the Home Owners’ Loan Act.\n4 The Board must take into consideration the convenience and needs of the community to be served by the\nresulting institution. See 12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(2): https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2020-\ntitle12/pdf/USCODE-2020-title12-chap17-sec1842.pdf 12 U.S.C. § 1828(c)(5)(B):\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2020-title12/pdf/USCODE-2020-title12-chap16-\nsec1828.pdf12 U.S.C. § 1467a(e)(2): https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2020-\ntitle12/pdf/USCODE-2020-title12-chap12-sec1467a.pdf12 U.S.C. § 2903(a):\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2020-title12/pdf/USCODE-2020-title12-chap30-\nsec2903.pdf. In addition, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires the Board to assess a\ndepository institution’s record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low-\nand moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods, in evaluating proposals under the BMA or section 3 of the\nBHCA. See 12 U.S.C. § 2903(a).\n\n- 6 -\nAnother priority for me as Vice Chair is the regulation and oversight of new forms of\nprivate money created through stablecoins. Stablecoins, like other unregulated private money,\ncould pose financial stability risks.5 History shows that in the absence of appropriate regulation,\nprivate money is subject to destabilizing runs, financial instability, and the potential for\nwidespread economic harm. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, before the advent of\nprudential bank regulation and deposit insurance and before action was taken to ensure private\nmoney creation by banks was appropriately regulated, repeated crises did substantial damage to\nthe U.S. economy. I believe Congress should work expeditiously to pass much-needed\nlegislation to bring stablecoins, particularly those designed to serve as a means of payment,\ninside the prudential regulatory perimeter. I look forward to continued partnership with other\nregulatory agencies and Congress to address the risks of stablecoins.\nFinancial Risks from Climate Change\nBefore I move away from the discussion of making banks safer, let me say a few words\nabout the potential risks to banks posed by climate change. As our nation, and the world, grapple\nwith how to respond to climate change, banks are increasingly focused on the risks that climate\nchange brings to their balance sheets. The Federal Reserve is working to understand how\nclimate change may pose risks to individual banks and to the financial system. The Federal\nReserve’s mandate in this area is important, but narrow, focused on our supervisory\nresponsibilities and our role in promoting a safe and stable financial system. In the near-term,\nwe intend to work with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the FDIC to\nprovide guidance to large banks on how we expect them to identify, measure, monitor, and\n5 See the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, Report on Stablecoins (Washington: PWG, FDIC, and OCC,\nNovember 2021) https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nmanage the financial risks of climate change. In addition, we are considering how to develop\nand implement climate risk scenario analyses. In that regard, next year we plan to launch a pilot\nmicro-prudential scenario analysis exercise to better assess the long-term, climate-related\nfinancial risks facing the largest institutions.\nInnovation, Access, and Consumer Protection\nThese are a few of my near-term priorities to help make the financial system safer. I’ll\nhave more to say about these, and other priorities for safety and soundness, in the coming weeks\nand months. Let me turn now more directly to my other major objective as Vice Chair, which is\nto make the financial system fairer. In the past, I have described the three essential elements of\nfairness in the financial system as a three-legged stool because all three are necessary for any\naspect of fairness to work. The three are (1) financial capability, (2) financial access, and (3)\nconsumer protection. In terms of financial capability, an important component is transparency in\nthe cost of services, which means making sure consumers have the information they need to\nmake good decisions. Along with other bank regulatory agencies, the Federal Reserve has a role\nto play in ensuring banks disclose the costs and explain the conditions on the services they\nprovide. More broadly, though, it means basing policy on a deeper understanding of human\ndecision-making, and the contexts in which households and businesses make those choices.6\nUnder financial inclusion, one example would be promoting access to low-cost and safe banking\nservices for low- and moderate-income (LMI) consumers, such as through local Bank On\ninitiatives.7 And consumer protection involves using supervision and regulation to fully\n6 See Michael S. Barr, No Slack: The Financial Lives of Low-Income Americans (Washington: Brookings\nPress, 2012).\n7 Deposit products also play a critical role in providing an entry point to the banking system for low- and\nmoderate-income individuals, including those who are considered unbanked. Having a bank account\nprovides the means to receive, transact, and safely save funds. It is also a pathway for a bank customer to\n\n- 8 -\nimplement laws to promote fair lending, consumer protection, and transparency in the consumer\nfinancial services marketplace.\nLet me say a bit about where innovation fits into this goal of making the financial system\nfairer. We should welcome financial innovation as a positive force that can increase access and\nlower costs for individuals and businesses. That said, innovation can also introduce new risks\nfor consumers. We have already seen occasions when uses of new technologies and data can\nraise serious concerns about violations of fair lending laws.8\nAs innovative financial products develop and grow rapidly, excitement can outrun the\nproper assessment of risk. As we have seen with the growth of crypto assets, in a rapidly rising\nand volatile market, participants may come to believe that they understand new products only to\nlearn that they don’t, and then suffer significant losses. Crypto-asset related activity, both\noutside and inside supervised banks, requires oversight so that people are fully aware of the risks\nthey face.\nWe plan to work with other bank regulatory agencies to ensure that crypto activity inside\nbanks is well regulated, based on the principle of same risk, same activity, same regulation,\nregardless of the technology used for the activity. I plan to make sure that the crypto activity of\nbanks that we supervise is subject to the necessary safeguards that protect the safety of the\nbanking system as well as bank customers. Banks engaged in crypto-related activities need to\nhave appropriate measures in place to manage novel risks associated with those activities and to\nensure compliance with all relevant laws, including those related to money laundering.\nestablish an ongoing relationship with a bank. Moreover, a bank account provides the cash flow data that\nsome financial companies use to underwrite credit. One important way the Fed encourages greater access to\ndeposit products is by giving banks credit under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) for offering low-\ncost deposit accounts to low- or moderate-income individuals. In addition, several Reserve Banks also\nparticipate in the Bank On initiative, a nationwide effort (with 90 local coalitions) to move the unbanked\ninto the banking system by promoting access to safe, standardized low-cost transactional accounts.\n8 United States v. Meta Platforms, Inc., No. 1:22-cv-05187 (S.D. New York, June 21, 2022).\n\n- 9 -\nAt a more basic level, we need to focus on access to fast, efficient digital payments. This\nis a matter both of efficiency and of fairness. Low-income households can ill afford to wait days\nfor their income checks to clear, nor can small businesses. A three-day payment delay is an\nannoyance to someone with savings and ample credit, but it is a costly burden, and sometimes a\nserious problem for others. And overdraft and insufficient funds fees hit LMI households hard. I\nhave been working on issues of financial inclusion for a significant portion of my career as a\npublic official and as an academic. I am so pleased with the progress made toward instant\npayments under the leadership of Vice Chair Brainard and Chair Powell, and I am looking\nforward to doing whatever I can to support this work, including the launch of the FedNow\nService. The Federal Reserve has a responsibility to facilitate payments that work well for\neveryone, and we are committed to doing so.\nCommunity Reinvestment\nRounding out my discussion of access to financial services, I will end my remarks today\nby touching on the importance of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The CRA, first\npassed in 1977, encourages insured depository institutions to meet the credit needs of the\ncommunities in which they are chartered, including LMI neighborhoods, consistent with the safe\nand sound operation of such institutions.9 The CRA was designed to address past abuses of\nfinancial institutions, such as redlining. The CRA sends the unequivocal message that there is no\nplace for discrimination in the financial system, and that every community and every borrower\ndeserve to be treated fairly. Earlier this year the OCC, the Fed, and the FDIC jointly invited\ncomment on a proposal designed to strengthen and modernize CRA regulations to achieve the\n9 “What is the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)?” Board of Governors, last modified August 24, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/cra_about.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nobjectives of the law. I strongly support the goals of the proposal and look forward to\ncontributing to the important work underway, again led by Vice Chair Brainard.\nSo, to wrap up, I have tried to lay out my approach and a bit of my near-term agenda, as\nVice Chair for Supervision, for making the financial system safer and fairer for households and\nbusinesses. As I said at the outset, I believe these goals are related and mutually reinforcing, so\nthat progress in one area will advance efforts in the other. I have discussed a number of specific\nissues to illustrate these principles, but I’ll have more to say about these ideas, and other\nimportant reforms, in the coming weeks and months. Thank you.",

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(via pre-recorded video)\nat\nOpportunity Finance Network Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 22, 2025\n\nLet me thank the Opportunity Finance Network for the invitation to be part of this\ngathering.1 Unfortunately, I could not join you in person, but I’m pleased to be able to\noffer a few words to celebrate the legacy of Community Development Financial\nInstitutions (CDFIs)—a legacy rooted in opportunity, innovation, and commitment to\ncommunities that have too often been overlooked.\nI’m deeply grateful to so many of you who are carrying forward that mission—\nbuilding on the work of pioneering leaders who saw finance not just as a set of markets,\nbut as a means for broad-based economic inclusion.\nI’ve had the privilege of being a part of the CDFI story myself. Early on, while at\nthe Treasury Department, I worked with colleagues to help stand up the CDFI Fund,\nstrengthen the Community Reinvestment Act, and launch the New Markets Tax Credit.\nWhen I returned to Treasury years later, I got a chance once again to work with the\ntalented staff of the CDFI Fund, people whose dedication to expanding economic\nopportunity was truly inspiring. And over the last three decades, and now at the Federal\nReserve, I’ve seen firsthand how CDFIs around the country help small businesses to\nthrive and communities to prosper.\nCDFIs emerged as a creative solution to a fundamental challenge: how to get\ncredit flowing into places where mainstream finance has not always reached. Through\nflexible underwriting, tailored lending, and deep community development relationships,\nCDFIs meet credit needs through good times and bad. CDFIs help fuel the revitalization\nof neighborhoods, small businesses, and local economies.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nWhen I travel around the country as a Fed Governor, I often meet with local\ncommunity leaders, including local CDFIs. I’ve seen CDFIs serving rural areas, such as\nthe Mississippi Delta, where CDFIs have stepped in as traditional bank branches have\nclosed. I’ve heard small businesses in urban areas such as Atlanta praise the work of\nCDFIs helping them get access to capital, skills development, and business opportunities\nthat were otherwise unavailable. I’ve seen countless examples of CDFIs helping to build\naffordable housing, daycare centers, and revitalize neighborhoods, in communities from\nHartford, Connecticut to Dallas, Texas.\nCDFIs operate all over the nation, including in Indian Country. The Federal\nReserve’s Center for Indian Country Development has done remarkable work\ndocumenting the power of CDFIs in Native communities. Some of the solutions they’ve\ndesigned include seasonal payment structures for fishermen and loggers, accepting tribal\ndistribution payments as collateral, or creating land buy-back loans. One Native CDFI\nleader described their work as “blending culture with finance”—and I think that captures\nbeautifully what makes the CDFI model so powerful.\nAnd when economic downturns come—as they inevitably do—CDFIs are often\nthe first to step up. During the foreclosure crisis, they maintained lending and provided\ncritical support to homeowners who otherwise could not or would not be served. When\nthe COVID-19 pandemic hit, CDFIs once again acted as first responders, rapidly\ndelivering relief to small businesses.\nCDFIs have earned their strong track record through performance and results —\ndelivering impact in rural areas, urban neighborhoods, and tribal communities across the\ncountry. Demand for their services continues to grow.\n\n- 3 -\nThe story of the CDFI movement is one of persistence, creativity, and\npartnership—qualities that will serve us well in the years ahead. Together, we can build\non this strong foundation to ensure that opportunity reaches every community and that\nthe legacy of inclusive finance continues for generations to come.\nThank you for your leadership, your commitment, and for the work you do every\nday to make that vision a reality.",

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Aspen Institute\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 24, 2025\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1 The United States has an enviable\nentrepreneurial culture and a strong track record of building new companies. Yet, new and small\nbusiness owners often navigate significant challenges from establishment to growth. These\nchallenges typically include limitations in accessing capital, in developing robust business and\nprofessional networks for peer support and opportunities, and in building the comprehensive\nskills, resources, and social connections that contribute greatly to business resiliency and\nsustainability. Women and minority entrepreneurs may face even greater obstacles. While\nbusiness formation is, of course, primarily a matter for the private sector, public policy can and\nshould encourage increased rates of entrepreneurship and business formation—and the capital,\nnetworks, and skills essential for success for all business owners.\nToday, I want to highlight the vital role that small businesses play in driving the U.S.\neconomy, consider the challenges in accessing credit that some small business owners face, and\noffer some practical solutions to help small businesses thrive.\nSmall Businesses and Their Role in the Economy\nSmall businesses are the heart of the U.S. economy. They produce nearly half of the\ncountry’s gross domestic product and employ just under half of all private sector workers.2\nSmall businesses have created more than 60 percent of net new jobs since 1995, and\nbusiness applications have remained consistently elevated at around 5 million annually since\nmid-2020.3 In recent years, women-owned businesses and minority-owned businesses were two\nof the fastest-growing segments of businesses. The number of small businesses owned by\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy, “Frequently Asked Questions About Small Business,\n2024.” July 2024, https://advocacy.sba.gov/2024/07/23/frequently-asked-questions-about-small-business-2024.\n3 Id.

Research suggests that entrepreneurship often correlates\nwith enhanced job satisfaction and improved economic mobility for business owners—though\noutcomes naturally vary based on multiple factors including market conditions, industry, and\nindividual circumstances.6\nAs we recognize the value of small businesses, it’s also important to recognize that\nsurviving as a small business is not easy. About one in six new businesses fail during their first\nyear and almost 50% fail by their fifth year.7 When a small business struggles or fails, the\nrepercussions often extend beyond the enterprise itself.

Today, let me focus on credit access and\nthe need for more transparency in lending terms.\nAccess to Credit for Small Businesses\nMany small businesses need credit to launch and grow their business. Small businesses\naccess financing from diverse sources, including banks of all sizes, credit unions, online lenders,\nand other nonbank financing companies. Despite this range of sources, the Federal Reserve’s\nSmall Business Credit Survey (SBCS) identified credit availability as a challenge faced by over a\nquarter of small businesses.8 In addition, many small businesses face problems with the credit\nthey do obtain.\nWhile access to credit poses challenges for many small businesses, these hurdles can be\neven more pronounced for women and minority business owners.

Other financial challenges include rising costs of goods, services, and/or wages; paying operating\nexpenses; uneven cash flow; weak sales; and making payments on outstanding debt.\n9 U.S. Department of Commerce, “Women Owned Business in the 21st Century,” October 2010,\nhttps://www.commerce.gov/sites/default/files/migrated/reports/women-owned-businesses.pdf. This report found that\n\n- 4 -\nminority-owned businesses often encounter distinct obstacles when seeking financing. Minority\nbusiness owners often have lower credit scores compared to non-minority business owners,\nwhich can lead to lower approval rates for loans.10\nBanks, nonbanks, and online lenders have the potential to fill these financing needs. But\nto be effective, they need to understand consumer preferences and behavior to provide credit\nproducts that meet these needs in a safe and fair way.\nAddressing the Need for Financial Transparency\nA significant challenge facing small businesses is the absence of policies providing\nessential tools and protection for small business borrowers. Despite the fact that many small\nbusinesses function more like households than Fortune 500 companies, they generally fall\noutside regulatory disclosure requirements intended to ensure transparency in pricing, facilitate\ncomparison shopping, and protect the financial interest of borrowers.\nConsider the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), implemented in Regulation Z, which does not\nextend protection to small business borrowers.11 This exclusion stems partly from the\nassumption that small business owners possess financial sophistication or can access professional\nassistance when needed. This regulatory gap matters because business financing offers may\nwomen start with less capital than men and are less likely to take on additional debt to expand their businesses. They\nare more likely than men to indicate that they do not need any financing to start their businesses.\nSusan Coleman and Alicia Robb, “A Comparison of New Firm Financing by Gender: Evidence from the Kauffman\nFirm Survey Data,” May 5, 2009, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11187-009-9205-7. This report found\nthat, consistent with previous studies, women start their businesses with significantly lower levels of financial\ncapital than men. Findings also reveal that women rely heavily on personal rather than external sources of debt and\nequity for both start-up capital and follow-on investments.\n10 Fairlie, Robert, Alicia Robb, and David T. Robinson. “Black and White: Access to Capital Among Minority-\nOwned Startups.” NBER Working Paper No. 28154. November 2020.\nhttps://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28154/w28154.pdf.\n11 While Regulation Z sets forth requirements for consumer credit advertising – and includes provisions to state\ncharges as an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and, among other things, full repayment terms when referencing\npayments, and certain other credit terms that may apply – Regulation Z does not apply to business credit. Because of\nthis, lenders offering small business credit and lending products, often have more flexibility when it comes to\ndisclosures of their products’ costs and features than do lenders offering credit products for personal or household\nuse.\n\n- 5 -\npresent pricing structures that differ substantially from the standardized disclosures that small\nbusiness owners are accustomed to seeing on consumer credit disclosures.\nResearch from focus groups conducted by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal\nReserve Bank of Cleveland revealed that many small business owners struggle with\nunderstanding the specialized terminology used by certain nonbank lenders.12 For instance,\ninstead of providing familiar metrics like an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) or an interest rate,\nsome nonbank providers present a factor rate—a fundamentally different metric that cannot be\ndirectly compared to an APR or interest rate. The research identified a lender’s website that\nadvertised a “factor rate of 1.15” which translated to an undisclosed estimated APR of\napproximately 70 percent. Further complicating matters, some lenders may disclose an interest\nrate without including an APR, meaning that various fees and additional costs may not be\nreflected in the stated rate that borrowers often use to evaluate their financing options.\nWhile complexity sometimes serves a business purpose, in many cases, it obfuscates the\ncosts and can lead to poor financial decisions by small business owners. More broadly, product\ndesign by banks and nonbanks should help to counter, not lean into, biases that can lead to poor\nfinancial decision-making. For instance, present bias describes our natural tendency to prioritize\nimmediate benefits over long-term considerations. This might lead business owners to focus\nmore on quick access to funds or low initial payments rather than evaluating the complete long-\nterm cost structure. Similarly, status quo bias suggests that once a small business borrower\nestablishes a lending relationship, they may be less inclined to explore alternatives, even when\nmore favorable options become available. The perceived complexity or uncertainty of\n12 Barbara Lipman and Ann Marie Weirsch, “Alternative Lending through the Eyes of “Mom-and-Pop” Small-\nBusiness Owners” (2016), https://www.clevelandfed.org/people/profiles/w/wiersch-ann-marie/sr-20150825-\nalternative-lending-through-the-eyes-of-mom-and-pop-small-business-owners.\n\n- 6 -\nrefinancing or switching lenders can reinforce this tendency to maintain existing arrangements.\nUnderstanding psychological factors and cognitive biases can help small business borrowers\nmake more informed financial decisions by recognizing how the presentation of lending terms\nmight affect their evaluation process.\nIn light of these realities, banks, small business advocates, and industry stakeholders\nshould support policies that help small businesses better understand risks, and to drive the market\ntowards products that are designed to overcome, not exacerbate, these problems. Potential\npolicies would include enhancing transparency in loan terms, thus enabling business owners to\nmake more informed financial decisions. Additional borrower safeguards worth consideration\ninclude ensuring that loan products are sustainably repayable and don’t lead businesses into\ncostly reborrowing cycles, as well as ensuring fair treatment both during the loan origination\nprocess and throughout any restructuring efforts or collection proceedings.\nSome states are moving forward with policies that protect small businesses. California\nand New York, for example, now require many lenders to offer clear disclosure of the APR and\nestimated monthly payments.13 This requirement gives borrowers the opportunity to understand\nthe financing being offered in a clear, concise manner, enabling informed comparisons across\ndifferent product options. Several other states passed versions of disclosure laws for small\nbusiness financing transactions, with some variability over the range of financing transactions\ncovered and the types of disclosures required.14\n13 California Code of Regulations, Title 10, Chapter 3, Subchapter 3, https://dfpi.ca.gov/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/337/2022/06/PRO-01-18-Commercial-Financing-Disclosure-Regulation-Final-Text.pdf; New\nYork State Department of Financial Services, 23 NYCRR 600,\nhttps://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2023/01/rf_finservices_23nycrr600_text.pdf.\n14 See, e.g., Virginia, Utah, and Florida. For more details on the regulations across states, see\nhttps://onyxiq.com/commercial-financing-disclosure-laws/.\n\n- 7 -\nThe Role of Community-Based Programs\nI want to recognize the important role that community-based programs can play in\nsupporting entrepreneurs. These programs provide accessible tools, technical assistance, and\neducational resources that help entrepreneurs reach their full potential. Local organizations such\nas small business development centers, educational institutions, and community development\nfinancial institutions are connecting small business owners with personalized consulting,\ntechnical assistance and education, and entrepreneurial skills development.\nThe most successful of these types of programs deliver practical technical assistance and\neducation while fostering collaboration within local entrepreneurial ecosystems. These include\nuniversity- or community college-based initiatives connecting business owners with volunteer\nconsultants, resource hubs offering workshops, or rural development centers providing\nspecialized support. By emphasizing both skill-building and community connections, these\nprograms help small businesses and entrepreneurs overcome barriers to success.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, small businesses are engines of innovation, job creation, and economic\nmobility in our society. Great work has been done to understand what it takes to help small\nbusinesses thrive and grow, including access to sound and affordable credit, skills-building, and\nbusiness networks. I encourage us to build on this work by enhancing financial transparency,\nimplementing supportive policies, and leveraging community-based programs to enhance\nbusiness opportunities. These collective efforts to support entrepreneurs and small business\nowners not only benefit individual enterprises but also contribute to a healthy and dynamic\neconomy that works for all.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nCentral Banking in the Post-Pandemic Financial System\n28th Annual Financial Markets Conference\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\nFernandina Beach, Florida\nMay 20, 2024\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak today. As many of you know, I have two\nroles at the Federal Reserve—my role as a governor of the Board and member of the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC), where I participate in developing and setting\nmonetary policy, and my role as the Vice Chair for Supervision, where I oversee our\nsupervision and regulation of the banking sector. In keeping with the interdisciplinary\nspirit of this conference, I’ll touch upon these different roles, and how they both promote\na healthy economy.\nTo start, I will share a couple of observations about the current stance of monetary\npolicy. Then, I’ll discuss the conceptual framework that underpins the key components\nof prudential bank regulations.1 As part of this discussion, I will also offer some\nobservations about adjustments to our regulatory framework that we are exploring,\nincluding as a result of lessons learned from the bank stress in the spring of 2023.\nCurrent Stance of Monetary Policy\nStarting with recent economic developments, I see the performance of our\neconomy as strong. Labor demand is being met with rising supply from both improved\nlabor force participation and immigration. We have solid growth and low\nunemployment. The unemployment rate has been below 4 percent for 27 months, the\nlongest stretch of unemployment that low in more than 50 years.\nI am strongly committed to meeting the mandate that Congress has given us to\nachieve maximum employment and price stability. We are doing very well on the\nemployment component of our mandate, and we have also made tremendous progress\nover the past two years on the inflation component. Inflation has fallen from its peak of\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\n7.1 percent to 2.7 percent today. But we are not yet all the way to our target of 2 percent.\nAs noted in the FOMC’s statement following our meeting earlier this month, inflation\nreadings in the first quarter of this year were disappointing. These results did not provide\nme with the increased confidence that I was hoping to find to support easing monetary\npolicy by reducing the federal funds rate. This means that we will need to allow our\nrestrictive policy some further time to continue to do its work. I think we are in a good\nposition to hold steady and closely watch how conditions evolve. I remain vigilant to the\nrisks to achieving both components of our mandate. I believe that the current approach is\na prudent way to manage those risks.\nEvaluating risks is also fundamental to my other role as Vice Chair for\nSupervision. In the same way that the public depends on monetary policy to support a\nhealthy economy, the public also depends on a strong and stable financial system, so I\nwould like a spend the remainder of my time discussing the prudential regulatory\nframework the Fed uses to oversee banks and promote financial stability.\nConceptual Framework Underpinning Our Regulatory Structure\nThe prudential regulatory framework for the banking system is crucial to\nsupporting an economy that works for everyone. As I have spoken about many times\nbefore, banks play a critical role in the economy in taking deposits and providing credit to\nhouseholds and businesses, but distress in the banking system can impose widespread\ncosts on society. The government and taxpayers support the banking system through\ndeposit insurance and other forms of government support. The system relies on banks\nhaving the capacity to remain resilient and continue lending to households and businesses\nthrough times of stress.\n\n- 3 -\nI will focus on three key components that underlie the resilience of the banking\nsystem: capital, liquidity, and resolution resources. Each component plays a distinct role\nin fostering a safe and stable banking system by promoting the resilience of banks and\nlimiting the impact of their distress or failure on the broader economy. The three\nelements work together: capital absorbs the impact of unanticipated losses; liquidity\nenables a bank to meet funding withdrawals and provides time to right itself from a bout\nof stress; and resolution resources facilitate an orderly wind down of a failing bank,\nwhich promotes financial stability and limits damage to the economy.\nCapital is a core source of resilience, and common equity is the core of capital.\nCommon equity provides the greatest degree of loss absorbency, and it is the first line of\ndefense against the risk of bank runs. Sufficient capital makes a bank resilient both to\ncyclical economic downturns and unexpected shocks like we saw in March 2023. Capital\ncan absorb losses no matter the source, so it is an effective defense against a wide range\nof risks that banks face. We use different models to set capital requirements because no\none approach can fully capture the range of risks. These models include a leverage ratio,\nstatic risk-based capital rules, and a forward-looking stress test.\nLiquidity regulation complements capital regulation by ensuring that a bank has\nadequate resources to meet potential outflows. Liquidity can also support an orderly\nresolution. Requiring banks to hold high-quality liquid assets that are commensurate with\nthe size and likelihood of sudden funding outflows is a form of self-insurance against\nunanticipated funding shocks. While no amount of liquidity can fully guarantee that a\n\n- 4 -\nbank will survive a run, in combination with ample capital, liquidity resources can help\nstabilize an individual bank and limit the potential for stress to spread.2\nA third element of the prudential regulatory structure that I will describe is\nresolution resources, in the form of long-term debt and resolution planning. Unlike the\nother elements of the regulatory structure that enable banks to manage through stressful\ntimes and continue operating, long-term debt requirements in the United States are\nintended to provide resources that can be drawn down in the resolution of a failed bank.\nIn concert with requirements that large banks develop “living wills,” or strategies for\norderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, long-term debt\nprovides loss-absorption resources after a bank fails, which can be used to capitalize a\nbridge bank, provide time for an orderly bidding process, or for the preparation for sale of\nthe failed bank’s assets and liabilities. Moreover, long-term debt can reduce the\nlikelihood of a run by increasing market confidence that there will be sufficient resources\nfor an orderly wind down.\nThese three elements of our regulatory regime are tiered so that larger firms that\npose a greater risk to financial stability are subject to stronger requirements. This tiering\nruns through all of our regulation and supervision and reflects the diversity of banks that\nsupport our economy. For example, a small community bank is subject only to a simple\nleverage capital ratio and no liquidity or resolution requirements, consistent with its small\nsystemic footprint. On the other hand, a global systemically important bank (G-SIB)—\n2 Numerous academic studies argue that capital and liquidity requirements work together to support\nbanking system stability (see, for instance, Hugonnier and Morellec (2017), Kara and Ozsoy (2020),\nKashyap et al. (2024), Van den Heuvel (2020), and Walther (2016)).\n\n- 5 -\nthe largest and most complex bank—is subject to multiple measures of capital adequacy,\nlong-term debt requirements, and liquidity rules.\nPeriodic Adjustments\nPrudential regulation was substantially enhanced after the global financial crisis,\nproviding the foundation for a strong, stable, and prosperous U.S. banking system.\nCapital regulation was thoroughly redesigned, and the Federal Reserve now conducts an\nannual stress test of large banks. Quantitative liquidity requirements were put in place\nand have greatly strengthened the liquidity positions of large banks. Capital, liquidity,\nlong-term debt, and resolution planning have reduced the likelihood that banks\nexperience distress and have limited the harm that the distress or failure of one of the\nlargest, most systemically important banks would do to the U.S. economy.\nBut the work to reform capital requirements after the global financial crisis is not\ndone yet. The Basel endgame proposal represents the final step in addressing the\nregulatory weaknesses revealed by that crisis. It is targeted at ensuring that the risk\nweights that underpin the capital regime accurately measure a bank’s risks. The Federal\nReserve has received a large number of comments on the proposal, and we are focused on\ncarefully working through those comments. We also undertook a special data collection\nfrom large banks to better estimate the impact of the rule on banks’ capital requirements.\nI expect we will make broad and material changes to the proposal on the basis of the\ncomments we received.\nBasel endgame will finish the work of responding to the global financial crisis,\nbut the financial system is dynamic and continues to evolve. Regulators must ensure that\nthe rules adequately keep pace with these developments.\n\n- 6 -\nThe Events Last Spring\nLast spring, the distress and failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature\nBank, and First Republic imparted important lessons about the functioning of all three\nparts of the regulatory framework. SVB was a highly vulnerable bank, and its\nvulnerabilities left the bank exposed to the specific combination of rising interest rates\nand slowing activity in the technology sector that materialized in 2022 and early 2023.\nOnce the public appreciated the bank’s risks, the bank was viewed as insolvent. SVB\nfaced a run of uninsured depositors that was unprecedented in its speed and severity.3\nThere were signs of distress at other banking organizations, particularly those with a\nheavy reliance on uninsured deposits. Signature Bank experienced a deposit run that\nresulted in the bank’s failure that same weekend.4 First Republic also had significant\nunrealized losses on loans and securities, and it failed a few months later.5 Depositors at\nthese banks withdrew funding at rates that greatly exceeded the assumptions made in our\ncurrent, standardized liquidity requirements, although these firms weren’t even subject to\nthose requirements.\nIn addition to facing historically fast deposit outflows, SVB and Signature Bank\nfaced impediments to monetizing their assets, including even highly liquid assets. This\nwas especially true for securities that had lost value and if sold would require the firm to\nrecognize those losses. Securities can be monetized through repo markets, but firms may\n3 SVB lost $40 billion in deposits in a single day, with management expecting $100 billion more in\noutflows the next day. Together, these outflows represented about 85 percent of the bank’s deposits. In\ncontrast, both the failure of Wachovia and Washington Mutual in 2008 involved less severe outflows that\nevolved over more than a week (the failure of Wachovia in 2008 included about $10 billion in outflows\nover 8 days while the failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 included outflows of $19 billion over 16 days).\n4 Signature Bank received in one day more than 1,600 withdrawal requests totaling approximately $18.6\nbillion, representing 20 percent of its deposits.\n5 First Republic lost around 20 percent of its deposits in a single day.\n\n- 7 -\nbe limited by their counterparty relationships in these markets and the typical tendency of\ncounterparties to reduce exposures when there are signs of stress. Both SVB and\nSignature Bank learned about these limitations the hard way.6 Of course, there is one\nsource of liquidity that solvent banks can rely on to provide funding against a broad range\nof assets: the Federal Reserve’s discount window. Yet while the discount window can be\nan important source of liquidity, firms need to be prepared to access it.\nUltimately, SVB and Signature Bank were resolved after the Board and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) recommended to the Treasury Department\nthat it invoke the systemic risk exception, allowing the FDIC to guarantee these banks’\ndeposits. The systemic risk exception is an extraordinary tool that is rarely used; its two\nprior uses since its creation in 1991 occurred during the global financial crisis.7 The\nFederal Reserve also used its emergency authorities, together with a backstop from the\nTreasury Department, to establish the Bank Term Funding Program. These actions were\nable to limit the contagion in the banking sector. However, additional regional banks still\nsaw deposit outflows and came under stress. We’re working to address the lessons\nlearned from these events in three areas.\n6 SVB fell short in attempts to raise financing against securities due, in part, to limited established access\nto private markets. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Review of the Federal\nReserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank (Washington: Board of Governors, April\n2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf. Similarly, Signature\nBank experienced deposit outflows well in excess of its established repo lines. See also Cotton &\nCompany Assurance and Advisory, LLC, Material Loss Review of Signature Bank of New York (Arlington:\nOIG FDIC, October 2023), https://www.fdicoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2023-10/EVAL-24-02.pdf.\n7 See Congressional Research Service, Bank Failures: the FDIC’s Systemic Risk Exception (Washington:\nCRS, April 2024), https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12378. Before 2023 there were five\nplanned uses of the systemic risk exception (SRE) for Wachovia, Citigroup, Bank of America, the FDIC’s\nTemporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, and the Public Private Investment Program (PPIP). The SRE\nwas ultimately not used for Wachovia, Bank of America, or the PPIP.\n\n- 8 -\nCapital\nOn capital, I’ve already mentioned our Basel 3 endgame proposal and its role in\ncompleting the post global financial crisis regulatory reform agenda. With respect to the\nacute problems we saw last year, the proposal would also extend the requirement to\nreflect the impact of unrealized losses on capital to all large banks. Currently, only the\nlargest banks are required to reflect those losses on their capital. This would better reflect\ninterest rate risk in capital, a problem that played a major role in both SVB’s and First\nRepublic’s failures.\nLiquidity\nTo address the lessons about liquidity learned last spring, we are exploring\ntargeted adjustments to our current liquidity framework.8 Over the last year, many firms\nhave taken steps to improve their liquidity resilience, and the regulatory adjustments we\nare considering would ensure that all large banks maintain better liquidity risk\nmanagement practices going forward.9 They would also complement the capital\nrequirements by improving banks’ ability to respond to funding shocks.\nFirst, we are exploring a requirement that banks over a certain size maintain a\nminimum amount of readily available liquidity with a pool of reserves and pre-positioned\ncollateral at the discount window, based on a fraction of their uninsured deposits.\n8 I have discussed the importance of prudent liquidity risk management in a number of previous speeches.\nSee, for example, Michael S. Barr, “The Importance of Effective Liquidity Risk Management” (speech at\nthe ECB Forum on Banking Supervision, Frankfurt, Germany, December 1, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20231201a.htm. See also Michael S. Barr, “The\nIntersection of Monetary Policy, Market Functioning, and Liquidity Risk Management” (speech at the 40th\nAnnual National Association for Business Economics (NABE) Economic Policy Conference, Washington,\nDC, February 14, 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240214a.htm.\n9 The steps banks have taken include updating their contingency funding plans, reducing their reliance on\nHTM assets for liquidity purposes, adjusting the composition of their high-quality liquid asset portfolios,\nand enhancing their ability to tap different sources of liquidity.\n\n- 9 -\nUninsured deposits often represent cash needed to meet near-term needs—like paying\nbills or making payroll—and we have seen depositors act quickly to withdraw these\nfunds if their availability is in doubt. It is vital that uninsured depositors have confidence\nthat their funds will be readily available, if needed, and this confidence would be\nenhanced by a requirement that large banks have readily available liquidity to meet\nrequests for these deposits.\nIncorporating the discount window into a readiness requirement would also re-\nemphasize that supervisors and examiners view use of the discount window as\nappropriate and unexceptional under both normal and stressed market conditions. Given\nthe important role of the discount window, we’re also actively working to improve its\nfunctionality. As part of these efforts, we are seeking feedback from banks, and this\nfeedback will help us to further prioritize operational improvements.\nSecond, we are considering a restriction on the extent of reliance on held to\nmaturity (HTM) assets in large banks’ liquidity buffers, such as those held under the\nliquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the internal liquidity stress test (ILST) requirements,\nto address the known challenges with their monetization in stress conditions.10\nThird, we are reviewing the treatment of a handful of types of deposits in the\ncurrent liquidity framework. Observed deposit withdrawals from high-net-worth\nindividuals and companies associated with venture capital or crypto-asset-related\nbusinesses suggest the need to re-calibrate deposit outflow assumptions in our rules for\nthese types of depositors. As we saw during the stress of a year ago, these types of\n10 The LCR and ILST are two separate, but complementary, liquidity requirements. The LCR is a\nstandardized liquidity measure across banks, meaning the outflow assumptions are the same for each bank.\nThe ILST is a non-standardized liquidity measure across banks, meaning each bank determines its own\noutflow assumptions, subject to regulatory input.\n\n- 10 -\ndeposits can flee banks much more quickly than previously anticipated. Finally, we are\nrevisiting the details of the application of our current liquidity framework for large banks.\nLong-Term Debt Requirements\nThe bank failures and broader stress last spring show that we have more work to\ndo so that large banks that fail can be resolved without negative spillovers. These events\nalso underscore the important role loss-absorbing resources could play in managing the\nfailure of a large bank, even one not designated as systemically important. Unlike\ncapital, which is likely to be depleted by the time a bank fails, long-term debt is available\nupon failure to absorb losses, providing better protection for depositors, and limiting the\npotential cost of the resolution to the Deposit Insurance Fund. Long-term debt can\nfurther support the orderly resolution of a failed bank by enhancing the attractiveness of\nthe bank or its businesses to buyers and maintaining the value of the bank’s franchise.\nThis, in turn, would likely limit the extent to which the FDIC would have to rely on the\nDeposit Insurance Fund to support the resolution.\nLong-term debt also complements our liquidity framework. An adequate amount\nof long-term debt can reduce the likelihood of depositors running, facilitate resolution\noptions that would not be otherwise available, and reduce the possibility that emergency\nauthorities would need to be deployed to stem contagion in the banking system. Long-\nterm debt can also improve the stability of a bank’s funding profile by reducing the\nbank’s need to rely on less stable forms of funding.\nLast August, the bank regulatory agencies invited comment on a proposal to\nrequire large banks to issue and maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt. The\ncomment period for the proposal closed earlier this year, and we are reviewing the\n\n- 11 -\ncomments received. Many commenters agreed that having long-term debt would\nimprove the resolvability of large banks. Commenters also provided feedback on\npotential adjustments to the proposal, all of which we are carefully considering.\nConclusion\nCapital, liquidity, and resolution resources are three legs of the stool of the post-\nfinancial crisis regulatory framework. The recent stress from last March has only\nunderscored the importance of each leg of this stool, how each reinforces the others, and\nhow weaknesses in one could render the others less effective.\nAs a result, we are carefully considering changes to capital, liquidity, and\nresolution requirements to increase the resilience of large banks. We are attentive to the\ninteractions across these proposals as well as the potential burden but ensuring that each\nof these three components is properly calibrated will help to ensure that banks remain\nstrong and able to maintain their crucial role providing credit to U.S. households and\nbusiness under a wide range of conditions.",

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2025 D.C. Fintech Week\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 16, 2025\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.\nPayments innovation is accelerating.1 Stablecoins, artificial intelligence (AI),\nreal-time payments, and richer payment metadata offer significant improvements to the\ncost, speed, and functionality of payments. Better payments functionality can help\nfinancial institutions and businesses manage liquidity more efficiently at lower cost. It\ncan also mean that people receive their paychecks more promptly and manage their\npayments more effectively. Payments innovation is especially important for lower-\nincome individuals who are often underserved by the financial system and lack financial\nslack.\nFor the bulk of my remarks today, I will focus on the benefits and risks of\nstablecoins. Congress has recently passed legislation that provides some clarity to issuers\nof stablecoins about how they can fit into the regulatory and supervisory framework.\nWhile there is a lot of work to do on the part of the government to fill in the specifics\nduring the rule-writing process, increased certainty could lead to more rapid development\nof stablecoins and related products and services for businesses and households.\nPotential Benefits of Stablecoins\nI will start with some of the potential benefits of stablecoins. The primary benefit\ncomes from the ledger itself, which can operate globally and encode functionality and\nconditionality directly into assets and transactions. This functionality unlocks a range of\nnew financial use cases that were previously impractical when transactions required\nupdating a series of ledgers spread across individual financial institutions.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nThe global nature of stablecoins is fundamental to their usefulness in parts of the\npayment system that have high friction, such as cross-border payments. Some of these\nfrictions are necessary and important, such as those associated with complying with\nrelevant laws and regulations on money laundering and terrorist financing. But removing\nor mitigating other frictions may reduce costs and facilitate more efficient transactions.\nWhile today stablecoins are mostly used to facilitate crypto-trading activities, and\nsecondarily as a dollar-denominated store of value in some foreign jurisdictions, I want to\nprovide some examples where stablecoins may be useful for additional functions in cross-\nborder payments.\nRemittances\nStablecoins can be used to reduce the costs of remittances, since it tends to be\nmore expensive to send remittances to jurisdictions with less-developed domestic\npayment systems.2 As of a few years ago, stablecoins had only a limited ability to reduce\ncosts because there were meaningful fees associated with on-ramping into stablecoins\nand off-ramping out to local currencies. However, stablecoin acceptance networks have\narisen in some corridors that help reduce these fees and offer the potential to reduce the\ncost and increase the speed of remittances for those least able to bear these costs.\nTrade finance\nStablecoins have the potential to also improve the speed of managing the\npaperwork and processes inherent in global trade and trade finance, perhaps with the use\nof smart contracts. In these applications, a digitally native form of payment could\n2 See Viktors Stebunovs (2025), “Clean Money, High Costs?” International Finance Discussion Papers\n1422 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/IFDP.2025.1422.\n\n- 3 -\npotentially be used to streamline the tracking and validation process that occurs between\nfinancial institutions, shipping companies, and customs warehouses and the companies\nthat engage in trade. Small businesses might see lower costs and greater access.\nMultinational firms’ cash management\nAnd for larger firms that have entities across the globe, stablecoins may help with\ntreasury management. Stablecoins offer the promise of near-real-time global payments,\nhelping multinational firms manage their cash efficiently between their related entities\nwhile still making payments through local internal entities in different countries, reducing\ncosts and improving liquidity.\nRisks to Achieving the Benefits of New Payment Technologies\nI have mentioned just a few of the potential ways in which stablecoins can\nprovide benefits to households and business. Continued investment in technology can\nalso support compliance with important legal restrictions that prevent the use of the\nfinancial system for nefarious purposes. This investment will be a key area necessary for\nsupporting stablecoins in achieving their potential benefits. Let me start with money\nlaundering and terrorist financing.\nThe potential for technology to support anti-money-laundering compliance\nOne unique feature of stablecoins is their role as bearer instruments, similar to\nold-fashioned traveler’s checks, but mostly operating on global permissionless networks\nthat can include plenty of users with bad intentions. That creates particular challenges for\npreventing money laundering and terrorist finance, since bad actors can purchase\nstablecoins in secondary markets that may not have customer identification requirements.\nThe U.S. puts a heavy premium on ensuring that all financial institutions comply with\n\n- 4 -\nrules that seek to prevent criminals and terrorists from using our financial system.\nFinancial companies, particularly banks, that take shortcuts on anti-money-laundering\ncompliance sooner or later come to regret these shortcuts.\nCompliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering requirements can\nbe very data intensive and costly, requiring significant staffing to identify and then\naddress or resolve flagged issues. Permissioned networks with only trusted nodes doing\nthe know your customer work can reduce the risks. Moreover, new technologies, used\nwith care, can potentially reduce frictions on legitimate payments and speed up the\nidentification of problem payments. AI may be well suited to flag payments that are\noutliers relative to typical patterns, potentially reducing the volume of false positives and\nunnecessary filings.3 There may also be ways to improve the explainability of payments\nif they travel through the payment cycle with more data elements, such as those in the\nISO 20022 standards recently implemented on Fedwire. There are also technologies that\ncan aid with stablecoin compliance, such as trusted identity tokens in wallets that satisfy\nCustomer Identification Program requirements and smart contracts that freeze stablecoins\nin problematic wallets. This suite of tools can also be used for preventing other types of\ncrime, such as fraud.\n3 See Jeffrey S. Allen and Max S.S. Hatfield (2025), “Can LLMs Improve Sanctions Screening in the\nFinancial System? Evidence from a Fuzzy Matching Assessment,” Finance and Economics Discussion\nSeries 2025-092 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2025.092; U.S. Department of the Treasury (2024), “Treasury Announces\nEnhanced Fraud Detection Processes, Including Machine Learning AI, Prevented and Recovered Over $4\nBillion in Fiscal Year 2024,” press release, October 17, https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-\nreleases/jy2650.\n\n- 5 -\nA Rocky History of Private Money Creation\nA second key area is financial stability. Let me take a step back and explain why\nI am focused on the financial stability risk of stablecoins. Caution is warranted because\nof the long and painful history of private money created with insufficient safeguards.\nThe fragility of private money is inherent in the way that it is created. Financial\ninstitutions issue liquid liabilities to the public that are redeemable on demand and at par,\nbut issuers risk being ultimately unable to liquidate their assets promptly at par when\nfacing run dynamics and market stress. Maturity and liquidity transformation can have\nsocial benefits by meeting the needs of the public for money-like assets and supporting\nthe supply of credit to the real economy. However, for this social benefit to be durable,\nmaturity transformation necessarily requires safeguards that address run risk.4\nLooking at the long history of runs from private money is a helpful reminder of\nhow these runs can happen and what’s at stake when they do. For example, in the 1800s,\nduring the so-called Free Banking Era, the United States had competing forms of private\nmoney in the form of bank notes. The value of these notes was tied to the\ncreditworthiness, location, and credibility of the issuing bank, although some of the notes\nwere backed by bonds issued by the state governments as well as other high-quality\nassets.5 Despite these protections, the quality of the guarantees backing the bank notes\n4 The need for joint capital and liquidity regulation to address excessive run risk at financial institutions is\nestablished in Anil Kashyap, Dimitrios P Tsomocos, and Alexandros P. Vardoulakis (2024), “Optimal\nBank Regulation in the Presence of Credit and Run Risk,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 132 (March),\npp. 772–823. How the public provision of safe assets can suppress the demand for private money-like\nassets and, thus, reduce financial fragility is examined in Mark Carlson, Burcu Duygan-Bump, Fabio\nNatalucci, Bill Nelson, Marcelo Ochoa, Jeremy Stein, and Skander Van den Heuvel (2016), “The Demand\nfor Short-Term, Safe Assets and Financial Stability: Some Evidence and Implications for Central Bank\nPolicies,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 12 (December), pp. 307–33.\n5 See, for example, Gary Gorton (1996), “Reputation Formation in Early Bank Note Markets,” Journal of\nPolitical Economy, vol. 104 (April), pp. 346–97.\n\n- 6 -\nwas not beyond question, and they often traded below par. Concerns about the health of\nissuing banks, or of the states themselves in this era, resulted in regular bank runs and, in\na number of instances, widespread financial panics. This stability of the system was\nimproved over time, such as through legal changes that effectively required bank notes to\nbe backed only by U.S. government securities. Nevertheless, regular episodes of runs\ncontinued to materialize until the Panic of 1907, which prominently featured a run on\ntrust companies that offered deposit products backed by assets less liquid than the assets\nheld by banks of the era. This episode led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System.\nThe historical examples point out that issuing liquid liabilities redeemable at par\nbut backed by assets, even high-quality ones, about which creditors might have questions\nmakes private money vulnerable to run risk. These same dynamics occurred even in\nmuch more modern times. The most notable example is when the Reserve Primary Fund\nbroke the buck on September 16, 2008, one day after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers,\nas the assets backing the fund came into question.6 Pressures on money market funds\nalso occurred during the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, when\ninstitutional prime funds suffered outflows of about 30 percent of their assets under\nmanagement within a period of two weeks.7\nThese experiences show the vulnerability of private money-like assets to runs, and\nhow these runs can threaten not only the financial sector, but also the broader economy.\n6 See, for example, Lawrence Schmidt, Allan Timmermann, and Russ Wermers (2016), “Runs on Money\nMarket Mutual Funds,” American Economic Review, vol. 106 (September), pp. 2625–57.\n7 See, for example, Lei Li, Yi Li, Marco Macchiavelli, and Xing Zhou (2021), “Liquidity Restrictions,\nRuns, and Central Bank Interventions: Evidence from Money Market Funds,” Review of Financial Studies,\nvol. 34 (November), pp. 5402–37.\n\n- 7 -\nIssues in the Unregulated Stablecoin Market\nThe mostly unregulated stablecoin market has also experienced run dynamics in\nrecent times. While people purchasing something called a “stablecoin” might reasonably\nassume that they can rely on redemption at par on demand, unregulated stablecoins are\ncurrently backed by a range of non–cash reserve assets that can make them vulnerable,\nespecially under stressed conditions.8 Three key features—redemption on demand, at\npar, and backed by noncash assets—render stablecoins susceptible to runs similar to\nfragile banks or money market funds.9\nBecause stablecoins are not backed by deposit insurance and stablecoin issuers do\nnot have access to central bank liquidity, the quality and liquidity of their reserve assets is\ncritical to their long-run viability. At the same time, stablecoin issuers traditionally retain\nprofits from investing reserve assets and therefore have a high incentive to maximize the\nreturn on their reserve assets by extending the risk spectrum as far out as possible.\nStretching the boundaries of permissible reserve assets can increase profits in good times\nbut risks a crack in confidence during inevitable bouts of market stress. The incentive to\nreach for yield can grow especially in lower-interest-rate environments. Stablecoins will\nonly be stable if they can be reliably and promptly redeemed at par in a range of\nconditions, including during stress in the market that can put pressure on the value of\neven otherwise liquid government debt, and during episodes of strain on the individual\nissuer or its related entities.\n8 See Yuegi Yang, Muyao Shen, and Jason Leopold (2023), “Biggest Crypto Stablecoin Tether Was Once\nBacked by Chinese Securities,” Bloomberg, June 16; [Scott Chipolina ] (2023), “Crypto Group Circle\nAdmits $3.3bn Exposure to Failed Silicon Valley Bank,” Financial Times, March 11.\n9 See, for example, Gary B. Gorton, Elizabeth C. Klee, Chase P. Ross, Sharon Y. Ross, and Alexandros P.\nVardoulakis (2025), “Leverage and Stablecoin Pegs,” Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis.\n\n- 8 -\nPermissible Stablecoin Reserves under the New Legal Framework\nTo address these vulnerabilities in the largely unregulated stablecoin market,\nCongress passed the bipartisan GENIUS Act. The act’s primary tool to mitigate the risk\nof runs is limiting permissible reserve assets to an itemized list of highly liquid assets.10\nThis is a significant improvement in an area where reserve assets for stablecoins have\nbeen highly varied. Tight control over reserve assets, coupled with supervision, capital\nand liquidity requirements, and other measures, could enhance the stability of stablecoins\nand make them a more viable payment instruments over the long term.\nBut success in accomplishing these goals will depend on the details of regulatory\nimplementation. The GENIUS Act provides a helpful statutory framework, but it will be\nup to both the federal banking agencies and the states to coordinate and develop a\ncomprehensive set of rules that can fill in important gaps and ensure that there are robust\nguardrails to protect users of stablecoins and mitigate broader risks to the financial\nsystem. Regulators have a lot of work to do to implement the act, and I will outline\nseveral areas that will require close attention.\nFor example, some of the enumerated reserve assets backing stablecoins are not\nimmune to stress. Permissible reserve assets include uninsured deposits, which were a\nkey risk factor during the March 2023 banking stress.11 While the GENIUS Act permits\nregulators to limit the concentration of reserve assets in uninsured deposits, it will matter\nhow these rules are written.12\n10 See 12 U.S.C.§ 5903(a)(1)(A).\n11 See 12 U.S.C. § 5903(a)(1)(A)(ii); Michael S. Barr (2023), “The Importance of Effective Liquidity Risk\nManagement,” speech delivered at the ECB Forum on Banking Supervision, Frankfurt, Germany,\nDecember 1, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20231201a.htm.\n12 See 12 U.S.C. § 5903(a)(1)(A)(ii), (a)(4)(A)(iii).\n\n- 9 -\nAdditionally, in connection with overnight repo, the act permits any medium of\nexchange authorized or adopted by a foreign government to be held as a reserve asset—a\ncategory that could include potentially volatile assets.13 For example, until quite\nrecently, El Salvador treated Bitcoin as legal tender, and it still specifically permits\nBitcoin to be used for transactions on a voluntary basis. As a result, an issuer could argue\nthat Bitcoin repo could qualify as an eligible reserve asset for a stablecoin. In a case of\nstress experienced by the issuer or counterparty, or if Bitcoin were to drop sharply in\nvalue, a stablecoin issuer could be stuck holding the Bitcoin that had declined in value,\npotentially compromising the one-to-one backing of the stablecoin liabilities. To the\nextent possible, regulations should be put in place to eliminate or minimize such risks.14\nIn addition to the potential vulnerabilities of some permitted reserves, other\naspects of the GENIUS Act might permit risks to develop unless carefully regulated. The\nact permits four federal agencies and agencies in each state and territory to serve as the\nprimary regulator and supervisor of stablecoin issuers.15 As a result, there might be a\ngreat deal of heterogeneity in the regulatory frameworks that apply to permitted issuers,\ndespite controls in the act intended to provide that the frameworks are substantially\nsimilar. The resulting array of charter choice options, unless carefully managed, may\nprovide incentives for regulatory arbitrage.\nFor example, the act permits federal and state regulators to authorize stablecoin\nissuers to engage in a broad range of “digital asset service provider” and “incidental”\n13 See 12 U.S.C. § 5903(a)(1)(A)(iv) (permitting “money” received under repurchase agreements with an\novernight maturity to be held as a reserve asset); 12 U.S.C. § 5901(18) (defining money to include “a\nmedium of exchange currently authorized or adopted by a domestic or foreign government”).\n14 See, for example, 12 U.S.C. § 5903(a)(4)(A)(iii).\n15 See 12 U.S.C. § 5901(25) (defining “primary Federal payment stablecoin regulator”); 12 U.S.C.\n§ 5901(30) (defining “State payment stablecoin regulator”).\n\n- 10 -\nactivities other than stablecoin issuance, including potentially acting as a crypto-asset\nexchange or broker-dealer.16 Issuers are likely to seek to stretch these activities\nlimitations. In fact, issuers may argue that they are permitted under the act to perform the\nfull range of activities conducted by FTX, provided they make the relevant\nrepresentations and conduct appropriate accounting. Unless state and federal agencies\ncarefully coordinate, this could result in some state or federal regulators permitting a\nrange of activities that might expose stablecoin issuers to increased risk.\nThe potentially broad set of permissible activities could raise heightened concerns\nin cases where stablecoin issuers are subsidiaries or affiliates of banks.17 In such cases,\nthe risks of expanded activities could affect the banking organization and the banking\nsystem more broadly. These risks are especially elevated because the GENIUS Act\ncarves stablecoin issuers that are part of banking organizations out of bank and bank\nholding company consolidated capital requirements—even if they conduct a broad range\nof activities that pose risks that are greater than and different from those associated with\nstablecoin issuance.18 Stablecoin issuers are only subject to the capital requirements\nimplemented under the act, which could end up being too narrow to cover the risks of\n16 See 12 U.S.C. § 5903(a)(7)(B) (setting out a rule of construction permitting primary regulators to\nauthorize stablecoin issuers to engage in digital asset service provider and “incidental” activities); 12\nU.S.C. § 5901(7)(A) (listing “digital asset service provider” activities).\n17 Among other things, an expanded scope of activities could create issues in the insolvency context. While\nthe GENIUS Act amends the Bankruptcy Code to segregate stablecoin reserve assets for the benefit of\nstablecoin holders, many issuers are likely to be subject to resolution by the federal or state regulators that\ncharter such institutions. Particularly where issuers are engaged in a broad range of activities, it is not clear\nhow stablecoin reserves will be segregated from the issuer’s other assets under those insolvency\nframeworks. See 12 U.S.C. 5910(a)(1) (the only provision of the GENIUS Act’s insolvency provisions that\napplies to insolvency frameworks other than the Bankruptcy Code). Federal and state regulators\nadministering resolution regimes could provide more clarity through rulemaking.\n18 See 12 U.S.C. § 5903(a)(4)(B)(iii).\n\n- 11 -\nexpanded activities.19 Thus, appropriate capital requirements are another area where\ncoordination among federal and state regulators is key—and it may be facilitated by the\nGENIUS Act’s framework for assessing that state requirements are “substantially\nsimilar” to federal requirements.20\nRelatedly, the act enables stablecoin issuers—including those that may conduct an\nexpanded range of activities—to be chartered by regulators as uninsured national or state-\nchartered trust banks.21 This authorization and related decisions by regulators may result\nin trust banks that engage in a broader range of non-fiduciary, non-custodial, principal\nactivities. Let us not forget a lesson hard-learned in the Panic of 1907—a lighter-weight\nregulatory framework for trust-chartered entities conducting bank-like activities can\ncreate opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and vulnerabilities for the financial system.\nOverall, these and other gaps may have implications for the safety and soundness of\nstablecoin issuers.\nConsumer Protection Issues\nThe act also has gaps relating to consumer protection. For example, it does not\napply to all instruments that are commonly referred to as “stablecoins,” and certain\ndollar-denominated, tokenized products can continue to be offered and sold without being\nsubject to the regulatory framework under the act.22 This risks creating confusion and\ncould result in consumers relying on payment instruments that they believe are regulated,\n19 See 12 U.S.C. § 5903(a)(4)(A)(i)(II) (providing, among other things, that capital requirements for\nstablecoin issuers shall “not exceed requirements that are sufficient to ensure the ongoing operations” of the\nissuer).\n20 See 12 U.S.C. § 5903(c).\n21 See 12 U.S.C. § 5901(11)(B), (31)(A).\n22 The act limits only the issuance, offer, and sale of “payment stablecoins.” See 12 U.S.C. § 5901(22)\n(defining “payment stablecoin”); 12 U.S.C. § 5902(a)–(b) (prohibitions on issuing, offering, or selling\n“payment stablecoins”). The act does not affect the issuance, offer, or sale of instruments that fall outside\nthe “payment stablecoin.”\n\n- 12 -\nbut for which there are no prudential protections of any kind. To mitigate this risk,\nfederal and state regulators should work together to prevent misrepresentations, including\nthrough their authority to prohibit unfair and deceptive acts and practices.23\nThe act also lacks sufficient protections to prevent the mixing of bank-like\nactivities and commerce, which could lead to an increase of economic concentration and\ncreate competitive distortions—potentially to the detriment of consumers.24 And, finally,\nthe act does not provide consumers with the fraud protections applicable to traditional\npayment instruments—including protection for unauthorized transfers.\nAlternative adaptations of payment technologies: Tokenized deposits\nI have talked extensively about how the potential benefits of stablecoins can only\nbe achieved if stablecoins can be reliably redeemed at par under a wide range of\nconditions. Importantly, the technology that supports stablecoins can also be used for\nother products—for example, tokenized deposits.\nThe benefits of tokenized deposits include that they are part of a regulatory\nframework that has been tested over time. Banks face robust regulatory and supervisory\nregimes proportional to their size and complexity. This supervision and regulation is\npaired with deposit insurance, providing confidence that deposits held in sizes relevant\nfor most retail purposes will be available on demand at par. The resolution regime is\norderly, which provides additional confidence about the stability of the instruments in a\nwide range of circumstances and reduces contagion. Moreover, banks have ready access\n23 See, for example, 12 U.S.C. § 5903(e)(3), which makes it “unlawful to market a product in the United\nStates as a payment stablecoin unless the product is issued pursuant to the [act].”\n24 See 12 U.S.C. § 5903(a)(12) (preventing only majority ownership of stablecoin issuers by a public,\nnonfinancial company, and providing for possible exceptions to that requirement); 12 U.S.C. § 5903(a)(8)\n(preventing tying only with respect to paid products and services offered by a payment stablecoin issuer\nand its subsidiaries, and not with respect to products and services offered by a payment stablecoin issuer’s\naffiliates, including their parent companies).\n\n- 13 -\nto the discount window, where they can readily monetize assets on their balance sheets at\na pre-specified interest rate under a range of market conditions, including the most dire. I\ndon’t want to say this system is perfect—it definitely is not—but it is far more robust\nthan what we have developed so far for stablecoins. Thus, it may make sense for both\nmarket participants and regulators to consider how tokenized deposits will fit into this\necosystem.\nAs I said at the outset, stablecoins have the potential to improve the efficiency of\nthe payment system, particularly in cross-border applications. For stablecoins to reach\ntheir potential, additional work is needed to create guardrails that protect households and\nbusinesses, and the financial system as a whole. While the GENIUS Act made important\nprogress in creating a framework for stablecoins, a great deal will depend on how federal\nand state regulators implement it. If the regulatory framework provides strong guardrails\nand consumer protections, both the innovation represented by stablecoins as payment\ninstruments, and the resulting competition in the payments space, could help foster\npayments improvements that benefit households and businesses.\nThank you.",

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nFinancial Inclusion Conference\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\nJuly 15, 2025\nRevised: July 15, 2025\nGovernor Barr's remarks on financial inclusion were updated on July 15, 2025, to add\nand remove language inadvertently omitted and included in the published version.\n\nThank you, Eric; thank you to the Fed staff who have organized this second\nannual financial inclusion conference; and thank you all for being here.1\nI have long believed that financial inclusion is a crucial component of a safe and\nfair financial system. Working to improve financial inclusion has been an important part\nof my career, starting in 1995 when I joined the Treasury Department and worked with\ncolleagues to build Community Development Financial Institutions, strengthen the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act, and launch the New Markets initiative. At the University\nof Michigan, financial inclusion was key to programs I worked on to support minority\nentrepreneurship.\nWith the support of both the public and private sectors, there have been many\nimprovements and advancements in financial inclusion over the last three decades,\nevidenced by the decline in the rate of people who are unbanked and the increasing reach\nand success of programs such as the Bank On initiative that better meet the needs of low-\nincome customers. I welcome this progress, but there is so much more to do to deepen\nand widen financial inclusion to many millions of people in America who could benefit\nfrom it. Better access to affordable financial services, geared to the needs of underserved\nfamilies and entrepreneurs can help them to build more secure lives, stronger\ncommunities, and a stronger American economy.\nFinancial inclusion contributes to the Federal Reserve’s mission of promoting a\nhealthy and growing economy and a safe and stable financial system. Consumers are\ntwo-thirds of economic activity, so access to credit for low-and-moderate income\nhouseholds and small businesses helps the economy to grow. In addition, the Fed has an\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nimportant role in implementing a series of laws passed by Congress related to access to\ncredit, such as the Community Reinvestment Act. As we learned during the Global\nFinancial Crisis, household finances are crucial to a strong and stable financial system.\nIn my remarks today, I would like to go through several ways that the public and\nprivate sectors are helping to increase financial inclusion. Those efforts include greater\naccess to bank accounts and financial services, faster payments services, responsible\nsmall-dollar lending methods, and the use of alternative data to promote credit access.\nThese efforts have shown promise in expanding financial inclusion.\nBank Account Access Is the Foundation to Financial Inclusion\nFinancial inclusion begins with access to basic bank account services. While\nfinancial services are evolving rapidly—with new forms of financial intermediation,\npayment services, and even deposit-like money claims—it is still the case that access to a\nbank account is the foundation for helping families and businesses get the financial\nservices they need. Bank accounts provide access to direct deposit of paychecks, benefit\npayments and tax refunds. Bank accounts provide connections to peer-to-peer payment\nsystems, and for the vast majority of retail and wholesale payments. Bank accounts are\nalso often the entry point for access to credit for households and businesses.\nAccording to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s 2023 National Survey\nof Unbanked and Underbanked Households, the number of Americans without bank\naccounts is at the lowest it has been since the survey began in 2009. Yet, there remain\ngroups that struggle with low account access, including those who are disabled, those\nwithout a high school diploma, and minority groups, among others. Households that\ninclude someone of working age with a disability are three times as likely to be unbanked\n\n- 3 -\nas working-age households without a disability. Meanwhile, Hispanic and African\nAmerican households and American Indian and Alaskan Native households are five and\nsix times as likely, respectively, to be unbanked as White households.2 The unbanked\ncite account opening costs, unpredictable or high fees, and high minimum balance\nrequirements as among the top reasons for not obtaining bank accounts.3\nExpansion of Banking Access\nOne private-sector program that has helped to address barriers to account access is\nthe Bank On program, supported by the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund (CFEF).\nBank On is led by coalitions of regional financial institutions, community groups, and\nlocal governments working together to bring households into the financial system. CFEF\ncertifies that Bank On accounts meet standards including low minimum deposits for\naccount opening; low maintenance, overdraft, or other unexpected fees; and free branch\nATM, online, and mobile banking.\nOver 46,000 bank branches nationwide offer a certified Bank On account. An\nimportant way that the program has spread and taken root in communities is through the\ncoalition model, which involves establishing relationships with local and state\ngovernments, public officials, and community organizations. These partners, engaged\nwith and trusted by their communities, have helped overcome apprehension about bank\naccounts and helped drive the outreach needed for any business to find new customers.\nThe Federal Reserve System has long been a partner of the Bank On Initiative. In 2006,\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco was a partner in creating the first coalition.\n2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 2023 National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households\n(FDIC, November 2024), https://www.fdic.gov/household-survey/2023-fdic-national-survey-unbanked-\nand-underbanked-households-report.\n3 FDIC, 2023 National Survey.\n\n- 4 -\nAt the St. Louis Fed, the publicly available Bank On National Data Hub (BOND) was\ncreated in 2017 to help identify the availability of certified accounts. Bank On coalitions\nacross the country continue to partner on engagement, outreach, and data collection with\ntheir regional Reserve Banks, to offer safe and affordable bank accounts.\nFaster Payments\nFinancial inclusion also requires timely access to funds. People living paycheck to\npaycheck incur the greatest costs of waiting for these funds. One of the primary benefits\nof a bank account over time is facilitating payments. Technological advances have\ndriven improvement in this area, sometimes only incrementally, but the more recent\nadvent of real-time payments—especially new services for instant or immediate\npayments—has the potential to make a big leap forward in service to households and\nbusinesses. Cash-strapped households and businesses need access to their funds right\naway, and they need reliable ways to pay expenses when they are due (and when they\nhave the funds to pay them).\nLow-income households may need quick access to make just-in-time transactions,\nsuch as same-day utility bill payment through their bank or to quickly receive funds from\na family member to cover an emergency expense like an unanticipated car repair. While\nthe benefits of getting instantaneous access to paychecks are obvious, the value of\ncontrolling precisely when and in what order payments settle may be less appreciated.\nWith real-time payments, households and businesses can have better control over\npayment flows, helping them, for example, to avoid unexpected and unwelcome overdraft\nand nonsufficient funds fees.\n\n- 5 -\nMany other countries are seeking methods to improve the speed of payments. In\nIndia, for example, the implementation of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which is\nthe country’s digital instant funds transfer system, has allowed consumers to see some of\nthese benefits in action. UPI is available for free on a customer’s mobile device and can\nbe used for merchant payments, bill payments, and money transfers, among other things.\nSince its implementation, the Reserve Bank of India has noted an increase in financial\ninclusion, particularly in rural areas where bank branch access is difficult.4\nWe have seen the benefits of technological advancement and innovation here in\nthe U.S. as well. Today, technologies to improve the speed of payments are being\nimplemented across platforms and products, providing consumers various ways to move\nmoney quickly and easily. The Federal Reserve, as a part of its mission to foster a safe,\nefficient, and widely accessible payments infrastructure, is playing a role as well. As we\nhave in the past, and in collaboration with the private sector, we have worked to innovate\nthe payment system using the latest technology to better meet the needs of businesses and\nhouseholds. In 2023, we launched FedNow, an interbank payment system for banks and\ncredit unions of all sizes to instantly and securely transfer money for their customers, any\ntime of the day, on any day of the year.5 We are encouraged by innovative private-sector\nengagement with the new platform and instant payment services generally. We are\nalready seeing early adopters rolling out new services that can benefit consumers. One\nexample is the ability for gig-economy workers to gain instant access to earned wages,\n4 Mohammad Imdadul Haque, Abdul Azeez N.P., and S.M.

The Federal Reserve is committed to\nworking with the more than 9,000 banks and credit unions across the country to support the widespread\navailability of this service for their customers over time.\n\n- 6 -\nwhich can make a big difference in household cash flow management. We expect these\ntypes of innovations will continue to expand in the coming years and be delivered in new\ncontexts, ultimately bringing broad benefits to liquidity-constrained households and small\nbusinesses that need to tightly manage payment inflows and outflows.\nSmall-Dollar Lending\nAccess to small-dollar loans from banks can help consumers smooth through the\nups and downs of income and expenses. I think many people would be surprised how\nwidely this help is needed. According to the Fed’s 2024 Survey of Household\nEconomics and Decisionmaking, when asked how they would respond if confronted with\nan unexpected $400 expense, nearly 20 percent of adults said they would have paid at\nleast in part by selling something; using a payday loan, deposit advance, or overdraft; or\nwould not be able to pay for the expense. When looking at households with incomes of\nunder $25,000, this number increases to 46 percent.6 Access to reasonably priced credit\nto cover these sorts of expenses is therefore a common need, especially among those with\nlower incomes. These households have no financial slack.\nIn contrast to the more costly and riskier sources of credit that I mentioned, we are\nseeing bank-offered products that are helping to increase access to safer, lower-cost\nforms of small-dollar lending. The Fed and other bank regulators took a helpful step in\nthis regard in 2020 by issuing guidance. According to that guidance, responsible small-\ndollar loan programs must treat customers fairly, have effectively managed risks, and be\nunderwritten based on prudent policies. That means, first, that products are offered in a\n6 Federal Reserve Board staff analysis of survey results, published in the Economic Well-Being of U.S.\nHouseholds in 2024 (Federal Reserve Board, May 2025),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2024-report-economic-well-being-us-households-\n202505.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nway that most customers successfully repay their small-dollar loans in accordance with\noriginal loan terms, which is a key indicator of affordability, eligibility, and appropriate\nunderwriting. Second, it means repayment terms, pricing, and safeguards minimize\nadverse customer outcomes, including cycles of debt due to rollovers or reborrowing.\nAnd finally, it means repayment outcomes and program structures enhance a borrower’s\nfinancial capabilities by contributing positively to their record of servicing debts.\nMost banks that have offered small-dollar loan products since 2020 follow these\nprinciples, and it has had a positive impact on the loan terms they offer. Loan terms have\nbetter matched customer needs and rates have come down. Small-dollar loans that have\nthe potential to disrupt the market for costly alternative financial services are bank\nproducts that provide a straightforward application process, clear loan terms, certainty\nabout approval, strong likelihood of repayment, and quick disbursement of funds.7\nAlternative Financial Data\nAnother channel for improving financial inclusion is the use of alternative\nfinancial data to supplement the traditional measures that banks have relied on to judge\nthe creditworthiness of borrowers with limited or no traditional borrowing history. For\nexample, lenders can evaluate cash flow—steady income and bill payments—as a\nmeasure of the likelihood of loan repayment. Alternative data can help lenders take a\n“second look” for consumers who would otherwise not qualify based on the more\ntraditional credit-score-based underwriting models. In addition to making less expensive\nand more suitable loans available, alternative data often allows faster loan decisions.\n7 The Pew Charitable Trusts, “From Payday to Small Installment Loans,” Brief (August 2016),\nhttps://www.pew.org/~/media/assets/2016/08/from_payday_to_small_installment_loans.\n\n- 8 -\nThis is an important consideration for low- and moderate-income borrowers, who tend to\nhave little savings, and struggle with meeting an unexpected expense.8 Technological\nadvances such as application programming interfaces (APIs), a set of specifications that\ncan allow software to communicate with each other, can also help lenders access\npermissioned consumer financial data that can be used for underwriting. APIs also\nfacilitate automated application, decisionmaking, and fund delivery.\nLet me conclude by returning to where I started, which is the crucial role of\naccess to safe, transparent, and low-cost bank accounts as the gateway to financial\ninclusion. We have made great progress, but I am certain that there are still many people\nwhose finances and lives could improve with a bank account suited to their needs and\neconomic circumstances. I applaud the work of financial inclusion leaders in doing what\nthey can to make bank accounts available and better tailored to the needs of low- and\nmoderate-income households. In thinking about how to better design financial products\nand services, we can build on many years of behavioral financial research and practice.\nThank you.\n8 The Pew Charitable Trusts, “Consumers want from their small-dollar-loans: Access/Certainty of approval,\nAffordability, and Speed,” Issue Brief (May 2023), https://www.pew.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-\nbriefs/2023/05/affordable-credit-poised-to-save-consumers-billions.",

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nSingapore Fintech Festival\nSingapore\nNovember 11, 2025\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1 It is an honor and a\npleasure to be here with you in Singapore, a crossroads for global trade and finance, to\ndiscuss the transformational nature of artificial intelligence (AI). Like other central\nbanks around the world, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore, we at the\nFederal Reserve have been exploring the use of AI in our operations for quite some time\nas well as considering the implications of AI’s adoption for the financial sector and the\nbroader economy.\nAt the Fed, we’ve been interested in the effects of AI on the economy and its role\nin the financial system for decades. Remarkably, in 1997, Governor Susan Phillips\ndelivered a speech noting the use of AI in consumer loan underwriting.2 In the past year,\nno fewer than seven speeches by Fed Governors have had “AI” in the title.\nToday I’ll discuss the opportunities presented by AI relevant for central bankers\nas well as the risks it may pose that policymakers should consider. I will leave you with\nthree main takeaways.\nThe State of AI Innovation and Deployment\nMy first main point is that while AI is a big deal that will transform economies,\nthere are a range of outcomes for how it could do so.\nAI—algorithms that mimic human thought, communication, and choices—has\nbeen with us for decades, but AI entered a new era with the launch of ChatGPT in late\n2022. Generative AI (GenAI) captured our imagination with convincing conversations in\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Susan M. Phillips (1997), “Risk Management,” speech delivered at the Asset/Liability and Treasury\nManagement Conference of the Bank Administration Institute, Chicago, November 4,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/1997/19971104.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nwhich it is possible to go deep on a wide range of topics. Earlier forms of AI were often\nthe bailiwick of digitally native companies, but GenAI is spreading rapidly through the\neconomy. As of 2024, three in four large companies were using GenAI, though some\nreport it has yet to improve their bottom line.3 Smaller companies have been slower to\nadopt GenAI, with adoption rates reported in the high single digits, albeit with a high\ndegree of heterogeneity among sectors. Also, one could surmise, based on other surveys\nof individuals, that work-related use is more widespread among employees than their\nCEOs realize.4\nA recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that firms\nplan to retrain their workforces to take advantage of AI to enhance productivity, with\nwidespread layoffs limited.5 But survey respondents also report that AI has led firms to\nscale back hiring, a development that may be contributing to the recent low levels of job\ncreation in the U.S. economy, a concern for many workers and particularly for newer\nentrants to the job market.\n3 See Aditya Challapally, Chris Pease, Ramesh Raskar, and Pradyumna Chari (2025), “The GenAI Divide:\nState of AI in Business 2025,” MIT NANDA Report, July,\nhttps://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf. There are a range\nadditional surveys with various results; see, for example, Richard Horton, Jan Michalski, Stacey Winters,\nDouglas Gunn, and Jennifer Holland (2025), “AI ROI: The Paradox of Rising Investment and Elusive\nReturns,” October 22, https://www.deloitte.com/uk/en/issues/generative-ai/ai-roi-the-paradox-of-rising-\ninvestment-and-elusive-returns.html.\n4 On adoption by large firms, see McKinsey & Company (2025), “The State of AI: Agents, Innovation,\nand Transformation,” November 5, https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-\nstate-of-ai. On adoption by smaller firms, see the Business Trends and Outlook Survey from the U.S.\nCensus Bureau, which is available on its website at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/btos.html.\nOn adoption by individuals, see Alexander Bick, Adam Blandin, and David J. Deming (2024), “The Rapid\nAdoption of Generative AI,” Working Paper Series 32966 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, September; revised February 2025), https://www.nber.org/papers/w32966.\n5 See Ben Hyman, Jaison R. Abel, Natalia Emanuel, Nick Montalbano, and Richard Deitz (2025), “Are\nBusinesses Scaling Back Hiring Due to AI?” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Liberty Street Economics\n(blog), September 4, https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/09/are-businesses-scaling-back-\nhiring-due-to-ai. Other surveys have shown similar results; see, for example, Jeremy Korst, Stefano\nPuntoni, and Prasanna Tambe (2025), “Accountable Acceleration: Gen AI Fast-Tracks Into the\nEnterprise,” 2025 Report, October 29, https://ai.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-\nWharton-GBK-AI-Adoption-Report_Full-Report.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nTaking a step back, as I have noted in the past, I see two basic scenarios for how\nAI can transform the economy.6 In the first scenario, there is incremental adoption of\nGenAI that augments existing tasks and jobs. In the second scenario, a revolution occurs.\nGenAI transforms the nature of work and leisure, boosting the efficiency of research and\ndevelopment, remaking industries, and creating firms with new—perhaps radically\nnew—business models.\nRight now, it is difficult to predict which scenario (or perhaps one or more\nintermediate scenarios) will come to pass.\nWe can already see incremental change as GenAI is increasingly integrated with\nstandard workplace software. With its natural language interface, GenAI is inherently\nuser friendly, so few workers need special skills or unusually onerous training to use it.\nAt the same time, some start-ups have a more revolutionary flavor because they are\ncentered on AI from the outset. One indicator of how the labor market is evolving\ntoward deeper integration with AI is the skills mentioned in job postings. While overall\nthe share of job listings that mention AI-related skills is small—about 5 percent—in the\ninformation sector, it is about 20 percent. The financial sector, where firms are always\nlooking for a technological edge, is not far behind, with 1 in 10 job postings mentioning\nAI.7 So we can see that the skills needed in some key sectors are already changing. The\nspeed of that change is likely to increase. If the AI changes happen gradually, workers\n6 See Michael S. Barr (2025), “Artificial Intelligence: Hypothetical Scenarios for the Future,” speech\ndelivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, New York, February 18,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm.\n7 Job-posting statistics are based on the classification by Lightcast and are calculated using the\nmethodology developed in Daron Acemoglu, David Autor, Jonathon Hazell, and Pascual Restrepo,\n“Artificial Intelligence and Jobs: Evidence from Online Vacancies,” Journal of Labor Economics, vol. 40\n(April), pp. S293–340. Data are available by subscription from Lightcast at https://lightcast.io.\n\n- 4 -\nand firms will have time to adjust, but if they happen rapidly, there may be significant\ndislocations in the short term.\nA massive wave of data center investment has begun, pointing to signs of\nconfidence among leading AI companies that the use of AI at scale throughout the\neconomy is just around the corner. If they’re right and AI is useful enough to keep what\nis currently projected to be $3 trillion of new data center capacity utilized effectively, we\ncan expect significant changes in economies. Investment in capital generally raises labor\nproductivity and offers the potential for higher output growth without pressure on\ninflation over the longer term. As I have discussed in previous remarks, if these changes\nare significant, they can also affect the conduct of monetary policy.8 Of course, it may be\nthe case instead that investment exceeds short-term demand, in which case there may be\nlosses and adjustments to the AI sector.\nAI and the Financial Sector\nThe second key point I would like to make is that the financial sector is adopting\nAI quickly, and while there are many benefits to this adoption, the risks will need to be\nmanaged carefully.\nSo far, AI adoption in the financial sector appears to be most concentrated in\nareas that can enhance operational efficiency, including applications that involve text\nanalysis, classification, and information search inside the firm, as well as customer-facing\nfunctions. These incremental improvements to common business functions are a key\nreason to be hopeful about AI raising labor productivity in that sector.\n8 See Michael S. Barr (2025), “Artificial Intelligence and the Labor Market: A Scenario-Based Approach,”\nspeech delivered at the Reykjavík Economic Conference 2025, Central Bank of Iceland, Reykjavík,\nIceland, May 9, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nAt the same time, there is significant investment in experimentation with AI for\ncore functions for financial services. Data-driven financial-sector-specific tasks,\nincluding credit decision support, fraud detection, and trading are using AI-specific tools.\nEnsuring that AI is used appropriately for these functions faces appreciable challenges.\nFirst, the amount of organizational change needed by financial services firms to\nutilize GenAI may be substantial. History suggests progress may be slow. Adoption of\nmachine learning, an AI technology that preceded GenAI, was concentrated in firms that\nwere highly digitized from their founding—and even in those cases, adoption was a long\nprocess.9 Fintech firms organized to exploit AI from their founding can play a key role\nin driving efficiency forward in the sector, providing services to the incumbent firms.10\nBut productivity may even decrease in the short term, as heavy investments in business-\nprocess improvements take time to play out to productivity gains.\nA second challenge is the practical constraints of rushing into AI for core business\nactivities in the financial sector, as firms need to ensure that the resulting processes and\noutcomes are consistent with relevant laws and appropriate risk management. Large\ninstitutions are exploring the use of GenAI, including agentic AI, in their financial\nmodels—but doing so requires care. To successfully leverage the potential of GenAI on\na sustainable basis, decisions based on those models must be well controlled, numerically\nand legally precise, explainable, and replicable. AI developers still struggle to some\nextent with all of those criteria. We need to reduce the risk that AI reinforces biases in\n9 See Timothy Bresnahan (2024), “What Innovation Paths for AI to Become a GPT?” Journal of\nEconomics & Management Strategy, vol. 33 (Summer), pp. 305–16.\n10 See Michael S. Barr (2025), “AI, Fintechs, and Banks,” speech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nSan Francisco, San Francisco, April 4,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250404a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nconsumer lending. And we also need to guard against the risks that could result from the\nuse of AI in financial markets. For example, profit maximization by AI-powered trading\nalgorithms may result in tacit collusion, market manipulation, or trading strategies that\nresult in significant market volatility or even systemic risk.11\nWe will need innovation that is responsive to these risks to see additional\nadvances in the use of AI for a broad array of core financial services functions.\nAI and Central Banking\nA third and final point I would like to leave you with is that central banks,\nincluding the Fed, need to keep up with AI by increasing our speed of adoption for our\nown operations.\nThe nature of central banking work is inherently careful, considered, and\nmeasured when evaluating anything new. This is particularly true for any new\ntechnologies.12 But it seems clear already that the many advantages offered by AI could\nassist central banks in at least some of their operations, and the speed at which this\ntechnology is moving makes it appropriate to proactively engage in using AI for our own\noperations. That is why the Federal Reserve is using AI, where appropriate, to increase\nstaff efficiency and effectiveness. My view is that GenAI is a transformative technology\nthat central banks need to remain engaged with to ensure an ability to execute as\ntechnology evolves.\n11 The most recent Financial Stability Report is available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20251107.pdf.\n12 A report from the Bank of International Settlements notes that central bankers have the prospect of\nimproving data quality, enhancing operations, and improving decisionmaking with the use of AI and\nprovides a framework for considering questions of governance and risk management when doing so; see\nBank of International Settlements (2025), “Governance of AI Adoption at Central Banks,” January,\nhttps://www.bis.org/publ/othp90.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nAs we push ahead on efficiency gains, it is important that we leverage the right\ntools for the task at hand, recognizing that GenAI is not always the best choice. Some of\nthe challenges that we face can be addressed by robotic process automation or traditional\nAI methods. These are the same kinds of questions that every business and organization\nconsidering AI should be weighing.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we have focused on ensuring we can leverage AI\ncapabilities by establishing an AI program and governance framework for the use of AI\ntechnologies.13 We are taking an enterprise-wide approach of learning-by-doing and\nbroadly adopting high-value uses of GenAI, such as writing, coding, and research\nactivities. We have taken a “hands on keys” approach to having staff engage with it. We\nare identifying the business processes that can be improved and transformed with the\ntechnology.\nOne internal application of GenAI I am particularly excited about that helps us\nachieve all these goals is technology modernization. We are applying GenAI-enabled\ntools within clear guardrails to translate legacy code, generate unit tests, and accelerate\ncloud migration. So far, the result of this usage is faster delivery, improved quality, and\nenhanced developer experience. And it will likely mean better outcomes in support of\nthe American people.\nGiven AI’s current and prospective role in economic activity, we are devoting the\nnecessary resources to understanding it, including by analyzing not only AI’s economic\nand financial implications, but also exploring how AI can enhance our financial stability\n13 See the “Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Compliance Plan for OMB Memorandum\nM-25-21,” which is available on the Federal Reserve’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/compliance-plan-for-OMB-memorandum-m-25-21.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nwork, strengthen supervisory and regulatory capabilities, and ensure the smooth\nfunctioning of our payment systems.\nThese are just some of the ways that the Fed, like other organizations, is using AI\nto make us more productive and capable. These efforts may also help us understand the\neffect of AI on the economy, the banking system, and the payment system. That task will\nbe a major job for central banks in the years ahead. AI has the potential to fundamentally\nchange the economy and society. And as central bankers, we need to keep up.\nThank you.",

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Brookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\nJuly 16, 2025\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1 I am here to discuss one of\nthe most important resources that policymakers have: the lessons of history. In\ndischarging my responsibilities at the Federal Reserve, I have been thinking a lot about\nhistory. Its study provides the opportunity to step out of the particular circumstances of\ntoday to inform our understanding of the core issues at the heart of financial regulation.\nWhile we must be attentive to new and even unprecedented challenges, experience shows\nthat understanding the lessons of history gives policymakers a great advantage. Many of\nthe decisions we face today have, in some form, been confronted by previous generations\nof policymakers.\nIn these remarks, I want to discuss a particular pattern in the history of the\nfinancial system, which is the relationship between regulatory weakening and the\neconomic and financial cycle of booms and busts. My intent is not to re-hash well-\nexamined facts or to go over past historical episodes chapter and verse. Rather, I aim to\noffer a perspective on this historical throughline that focuses on the regulatory cycle.\nIt’s widely accepted that the economy and financial system experience cyclical\nbooms and busts. Booms have historically been characterized by a multitude of good\nthings. These can include fast economic growth, workers who had been sidelined\nentering the workforce and improving their lives, and financial innovations that often\nmake credit or investments more readily available. At the same time, some of the\ncharacteristics of a boom economy, such as rapid increases in credit and in financial\nmarket activity, as well as greater risk-taking and leverage, can sow the seeds of busts. In\nbusts, economic activity and lending contract and asset prices decline. This can lead to\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues.\n\n- 2 -\nrapid deleveraging and dislocation throughout the financial system, which worsen the\ndownturn, causing job losses and business closures, homes lost and lives upended.\nThere are usually multiple causes that drive booms and make busts so terrible,\nsome unique to each individual episode. But one factor that is common to many past\ncycles of boom and bust is weakening financial regulation. Weakening regulation often\ndrives risk-taking and increases bank fragility during the boom, making the ensuing bust\nmore painful. Indeed, economic research suggests that weaker regulation leads to more\nbank failures, setting the stage for worse recessions.2 Moreover, because the financial\nsystem evolves so rapidly, regulation must also continuously adjust. Much regulatory\nweakening occurs simply when regulators fail to keep pace, while at other times, there is\na deliberate action to lower regulatory burden that ends up miscalculating the risk\ninvolved. Let me be clear here that, when I refer to regulatory weakening, I mean not\nonly direct deregulatory actions by regulators or legislators, but also failure of the\nregulatory framework to keep up with changing circumstances.\nIn principle, financial regulation should incentivize banks to engage in\nresponsible risk-taking and build up resources in good times, so that they can deal with\ntimes of financial stress and continue their vital role in the economy in bad times. The\nprosperity that accompanies a healthy economy should allow banks to invest in improved\nrisk management and strong financial resources. However, a healthy economy can also\nreduce the effectiveness of regulatory constraints on bank risk-taking. This can occur for\na host of reasons, including behavioral biases, political pressure, market dynamics, and\n2 For example, see Paul H. Kupiec and Carlos D. Ramirez (2013), “Bank Failures and the Cost of Systemic\nRisk: Evidence from 1900 to 1930,” Journal of Financial Intermediation, vol. 22 (3), pp. 285–307; and\nKris James Mitchener (2005), “Bank Supervision, Regulation, and Instability during the Great Depression,”\nThe Journal of Economic History, vol. 65 (1), pp. 152–85.\n\n- 3 -\nthe tendency for innovation to move more quickly than regulators. These dynamics can\nresult in regulatory weakening during boom times. When actively pursued, this\nweakening often appears justified at the time and may be implemented by well-meaning\npolicymakers who simply miscalculate the long-run effects of their actions.\nMy purpose in these remarks is to recount several boom-and-bust episodes in\nAmerican history and identify some lessons that can guide policymakers entrusted with\nthe responsibility of promoting a strong and stable banking system. This history\ndemonstrates the connection between regulatory weakening and cycles of boom and bust.\nI don’t mean to suggest that more regulation is always better or that repealing and\nreforming regulations isn’t sometimes appropriate to remove obsolete rules and relieve\nunnecessary burden. But, if we can at least agree that regulation should seek to limit\ndevastating financial crises, then the history that I will describe today offers some lessons\nfor anyone thinking about regulatory policy.\nThere are, of course, lots of examples to choose from, both in the United States\nand abroad, but I’ll focus on the Great Depression, the Savings and Loan (S&L) crisis,\nand the Global Financial Crisis. I will then discuss some possible reasons that similar\nepisodes could recur and conclude with some thoughts on the lessons we can learn.\nThe Great Depression\nLet’s start with the biggest and most widely studied bust in U.S. history, the Great\nDepression. Scholars continue to debate its causes, which were multiple and complex.\nOne compelling argument focuses on the failure of regulation to keep pace with the\ninnovations of the Roaring Twenties. As I said, I view such regulatory stagnation as a\nform of weakening. This weakened regulatory environment played a role in setting the\n\n- 4 -\nstage for and then exacerbating the bust. Weakened regulation that had failed to keep up\nwith the times left banks unable to weather shocks to the economy. The banking sector’s\ncollapse was a significant factor in making the Great Depression the most severe\neconomic crisis that this country has ever experienced.3\nThe Roaring Twenties expansion was powered by the post-war recovery and\ntechnological advances in transportation, manufacturing, and communications. Stock\nmarkets grew quickly to help finance this innovation, while residential and commercial\nreal estate investment surged and swelling demand for consumer durables led in turn to\nincreased demand for financing.4 As credit needs escalated, there was intensifying\ncompetition among banks; savings and loan institutions (S&Ls); and rapidly growing\nnonbank finance companies, trust companies, and other financial vehicles.\nThe 1920s were also characterized by high levels of financial speculation, both\ninside and outside the banking sector. Banks engaged in speculation through nonbank\naffiliates and supported speculation by lending. At the same time, many banks were\nrelatively thinly capitalized and overly concentrated, especially given the lack of federal\ndeposit insurance at the time. In addition, many states had prohibitions on branching that\nprevented banks from diversifying their portfolios and inhibited local competition,\n3 Ben Bernanke (1983), “Nonmonetary Effects of the Financial Crisis in the Propagation of the Great\nDepression,” American Economic Review, vol. 73 (3), pp. 257–76.\n4 See Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr. (2003), “Does Financial Liberalization Increase the Likelihood of a Systemic\nBanking Crisis? Evidence from the Past Three Decades and the Great Depression,” in Benton E. Gup, ed.,\nToo Big to Fail: Policies and Practices in Government Bailouts (Santa Barbara: Greenwood Publishing\nGroup), pp. 77–105; and Barry Eichengreen and Kris Mitchener (2003), “The Great Depression as a Credit\nBoom Gone Wrong,” BIS Working Papers No. 137 (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for International\nSettlements, September) https://www.bis.org/publ/work137.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nkeeping many struggling banks alive.5 The stock market boomed, margin lending grew\ndramatically, and insider trading and market manipulation were rampant.\nAs the financialization of the economy increased, the regulatory framework failed\nto keep up. Outdated branching restrictions remained, failing to reflect the size and\ndynamism of the modern economy. Banks gained permission to engage in new activities,\nsuch as real estate lending and certain activities in the securities markets; however,\ncapital requirements and other rules were not adjusted to reflect potential increased risks\nfrom these new activities.6 The cumulative effect of these events was a significantly\nweakened regulatory environment and a substantial buildup in risk, without a\ncommensurate increase in resources to allow the sector to withstand the risks posed.\nLooking back, we know that, when the economic shock hit, the banking system\nmagnified that shock. The boom of the Roaring Twenties started to go bust in 1929,\nwhen the fast growth of the past decade turned to contraction, followed by a series of\nfinancial and banking crises. In all, approximately 9,000 of the nation’s 23,000 banks\nfailed, resulting in major losses to depositors, given the lack of federal deposit insurance,\nand a significant contraction in credit that deepened and lengthened the economic\n5 National banks received authorization to engage in branching, subject to state law, in 1927 but interstate\nbranching remained prohibited.\n6 Before 1900, national banks were prohibited from underwriting, dealing, or investing in securities.\nHowever, federal authorities loosened these restrictions by allowing national banks to establish bond\ndepartments that could underwrite, sell, and invest in debt securities. Although restrictions on dealing in\nstock remained, national banks were able to circumvent these restrictions by organizing affiliates that\nengaged in the full range of activities with regard to both stocks and bonds. Federal regulatory authorities\ndid not interfere with these affiliate activities. Scholars continue to debate the extent to which this\nunderwriting activity was risky for the banks. See Wilmarth Jr., “Does Financial Liberalization Increase\nthe Likelihood of a Systemic Banking Crisis?” (see note 4); and Eugene Nelson White (1986), “Before the\nGlass-Steagall Act: An Analysis of the Investment Banking Activities of National Banks,” Explorations in\nEconomic History, vol. 23 (1), pp. 33–55.\n\n- 6 -\ndownturn.7 Notably, banks in states that had more robust regulatory frameworks—for\nexample, those that applied higher capital requirements—had lower rates of failure.8\nIn response to the financial collapse in the Great Depression, Congress adopted\nreforms aimed at addressing risks that had driven those panics. Among these steps,\nCongress established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and federal deposit\ninsurance to reduce the risk of bank runs and protect retail depositors. Congress\nincreased regulatory oversight of banks and separated commercial and investment\nbanking. Congress also enacted strong securities laws and created the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC). Overall, these steps helped stabilize the financial sector\nand ushered in a long period of quiescence in banking.\nThe Savings & Loan Crisis\nMy second example today is the S&L crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s, which\ndid substantial harm to millions of Americans and the financial system and was\nextremely expensive to resolve. In this episode, in contrast to the Great Depression,\naffirmative deregulation led to excessive risk-taking by S&Ls, as well as banks, during a\nboom period. As circumstances soured, revealing weaknesses, Congress attempted to\nbolster the S&L sector by loosening the regulatory framework further. This failed to\nresolve the underlying stress and instead further fueled the buildup in risk-taking,\nworsening the losses in the subsequent bust.\n7 See Federal Reserve History (2013), “Bank Holiday of 1933,” webpage,\nhttps://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/bank-holiday-of-1933; Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System (1934), 20th Annual Report, 1933 (Washington: Board of Governors); and Social Security\nAdministration (n.d.), “Social Security History,” webpage, https://www.ssa.gov/history/bank.html; and\nDavid C. Wheelock (n.d.), “The Great Depression: An Overview,” Federal Reserve Education,\nhttps://www.federalreserveeducation.org/resources/lessons/lesson--great-depression-introduction-essay-\nwheelock.pdf.\n8 See Mitchener, “Bank Supervision, Regulation, and Instability” (see note 2).\n\n- 7 -\nLet me first set the stage. The years leading up to the S&L crisis were\ncharacterized by dramatic growth in business credit, in the course of the economic\nexpansion that began in 1982. At the beginning of this period, the S&L sector primarily\nserved the residential real estate market because of restrictions on S&L activities. These\nrestrictions eased over the 1980s, allowing S&Ls to get significantly larger and engage in\nnew kinds of lending; however, these changes were not accompanied by sufficient\nregulatory enhancements to account for increased risks. This expansion in S&L activity\nalso presented new competition with commercial banks, which had themselves built up\nsignificant risks as they expanded into new activities.9\nAt the same time, both S&Ls and banks were increasingly under pressure due to\nboth high inflation and high interest rates, which disrupted their funding models.10\nCompetition for customer funds increased dramatically, especially because of the rise of\nmoney market mutual funds, which had grown rapidly. When Congress removed\noutdated deposit rate caps to allow banks and S&Ls to more effectively compete for\nfunds, it did so without implementing adequate safeguards against these institutions\ntaking on excessive risk. This led many S&Ls to engage in increasingly risky projects to\ncompensate for escalating funding costs. Banks also increased their deposit rates and\ntook on more risk.\nAs vulnerabilities at S&Ls became evident, Congress, federal regulators, and the\nstates attempted to bolster both sectors with the hope of allowing them to outgrow those\n9 Federal regulators, as well as many state legislatures and state banking authorities, expanded the scope of\npermissible activities for banks during this period.\n10 For example, S&Ls made long-term, fixed rate residential mortgage loans, funded with short-term retail\nliabilities. As rates increased, S&Ls’ existing mortgage portfolios decreased in value, because of their\nfixed rates. At the same time, S&Ls were forced to pay higher rates on their liabilities. This situation\nthreatened their continued viability.\n\n- 8 -\nweaknesses. For instance, Congress and the states reduced restrictions on S&Ls’ ability\nto invest in commercial and consumer loans.11 These changes contributed to the boom in\ncommercial real estate lending, which became a key source of vulnerability. In addition,\nCongress and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the federal S&L regulator at the time,\nweakened capital requirements and the enforcement of those requirements for the S&L\nsector.12 This allowed institutions to become weaker and poorly capitalized entities to\nstay afloat, leaving S&Ls as a whole badly positioned to weather adverse conditions.\nThe bust, when it came, was severe. S&L losses continued to mount throughout\nthe 1980s. Many banks also experienced severe stress. These difficulties were amplified\nby an eventual decline in real estate values and problems in the agricultural and energy\nsectors. In 1980, there were just under 4,000 S&Ls. By 1989, that number had fallen to\nbelow 3,000, with over 500 of the remaining institutions insolvent as judged by book\nvalue. And over 1,600 banks failed between 1980 and 1994. Regulatory weakening had\npropped up tottering institutions, allowing zombie institutions to persist, accumulating\nmuch greater losses than they otherwise would have. The process of cleaning up the\nsector began in earnest in the late 1980s and continued into the mid-1990s, with a final\n11 Many states simultaneously relaxed their own activities restrictions for state charters to allow for real\nestate investment.\n12 For instance, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board reduced net worth requirements for federally insured\nS&Ls to allow troubled S&Ls to avoid closure and hopefully recover once interest rates declined.\n\n- 9 -\ncost of $160 billion, roughly 5 percent of gross domestic product at the time.13 And the\ncost of resolving insured banks that failed during this period was $36 billion.14\nCongress implemented significant reforms in response to the S&L crisis,\nincluding stricter capital and accounting requirements, limits on insured depository\ninstitutions’ investment powers, and expansions of regulators’ enforcement authority.\nThese changes paved the way for stability in the banking sector for some time.\nThe Global Financial Crisis\nI’ll turn now to my final example, the Global Financial Crisis, which had\ndevastating effects for the millions of people who lost their livelihoods, their homes, and\ntheir businesses.\nIn the decade leading up to the crisis, America experienced rapid credit growth\nand a housing boom. There was optimism about the benefits of financial innovation,\nsuch as securitization of home loans, and belief in the power of market discipline as a\nform of self-regulation. Home prices and mortgage debt accelerated in tandem, driven by\na mutually reinforcing cycle of optimism, with home prices roughly doubling between\n1997 and 2006, and even larger increases in mortgage debt.15 Amid this boom, lending\nstandards dropped, driven by investor demand for mortgage-backed securities, which\n13 This figure refers to the cost of resolving S&Ls that failed during the crisis. See Alane Moysich (1997),\n“The Savings and Loan Crisis and Its Relationship to Banking,” in History of the Eighties--Lessons for the\nFuture, vol. 1: An Examination of the Banking Crises of the 1980s and Early 1990s (Washington: Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation), pp. 167–88, https://www.fdic.gov/resources/publications/history-\neighties/volume-1/history-80s-volume-1-part1-04.pdf; and U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (2025),\nGross Domestic Product, via FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, June 26,\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP (accessed July 15, 2025, 1982:Q4 used as gross domestic product\nreference point).\n14 This figure reflects costs associated with bank failures from 1980 through 1994.\n15 See Federal Housing Finance Agency (2025), All-Transactions House Price Index for the United States,\nvia FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, May 27, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USSTHPI\n(accessed July 15, 2025); and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2019), Mortgage Debt\nOutstanding, All holders, via FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, December 12,\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MDOAH (accessed July 15, 2025).\n\n- 10 -\nwere increasingly opaque and risky in their design but still highly rated by the rating\nagencies. There was substantial growth in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives\nmarket, including new forms of credit derivatives. Money market funds boomed,\nbecoming increasingly linked to the off-balance sheet business of banks.16 These\ndevelopments led to the emergence of large, short-funded, and interconnected financial\nentities—both banks and nonbanks.\nThe regulatory environment failed to keep up with these changes in activity and\nthe increasing complexity of financial institutions and markets, and regulatory weakening\nheightened vulnerabilities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, enacted in 1999, permitted the\ncreation of financial holding companies that could engage in the full range of financial\nactivities; however, the act did not put in place a regulatory framework commensurate\nwith the full range of financial risks and permitted nonbank firms such as investment\nbanks and insurance conglomerates to compete with banks wholly outside its framework.\nThe Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 exempted OTC derivatives\ntransactions from virtually all regulation and oversight by the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission and SEC.\nIn the lead-up to the crisis, regulators cut oversight further. A striking image from\nthe time featured the head of one financial regulatory agency wielding a chainsaw to\n16 For example, many banks created asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) programs as conduits that\nallowed them to fund bank assets without bringing them on balance sheet, thereby avoiding regulatory\ncapital treatment. However, this approach created significant risks because the primary holders of ABCP\nwere money market mutual funds, which are ultra-sensitive to payment delays and themselves subject to\nrun risk. Money market funds also similarly funded other parts of banks’ balance sheets in the lead-up to\nthe crisis. In addition, other private cash-like instruments, such as auction rate securities, repurchase\nagreements based on ABCP, and other short-term debt instruments that were treated like money created\nnew vulnerabilities as they grew and subsequently collapsed.\n\n- 11 -\ndemonstrate his commitment to slashing regulations.17 The competitive landscape and\nregulatory lacuna led to a race to the bottom in standards for underwriting and issuing\nmortgage loans and securities, and transactions became increasingly funded by opaque\nand unstable short-term wholesale funding. Consumers were left unprotected as the\nsubprime crisis grew. In addition, the largest investment banks, which were overseen by\nthe SEC, increased their leverage with heavy reliance on short-term funding, leaving\nthem increasingly vulnerable to any losses. These are just a few examples of the\nwidespread failures in financial regulation and supervision that occurred in both the\nbanking and nonbanking sectors in the lead-up to the crisis.\nThe resulting recession and financial crisis saw the deepest and longest\ncontraction in economic activity since the second world war, the collapse of large\nfinancial institutions, significant government support to keep the financial system afloat,\nand a prolonged period of slow growth.\nIn response to this crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, a reform package\nthat, among other things, strengthened bank capital, addressed off-balance sheet\nexposures, and provided for stress testing. Consumer protections were strengthened, and\na new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was established. Supervisors ramped up\nforward-looking supervision. In addition, banking regulators adopted capital and\nliquidity reforms, which substantially improved the resiliency of the banking sector.\nStudying the role that regulatory weakening played in the crisis provides a powerful\nreminder of the importance of preserving these regulatory gains.\n17 Binyamin Appelbaum and Ellen Nakashima (2008), “Banking Regulator Played Advocate over\nEnforcer,” Washington Post, November 23.\n\n- 12 -\nLessons for Policymakers\nReviewing these three examples together, it is striking to see the pattern of\nregulatory weakening during a boom, including the failure of the regulatory environment\nto keep pace with the evolving financial sector, and how this weakening lays the\nfoundation for a subsequent bust. Why do we continue to see these cycles?\nSome reasons are psychological, others political. Humans have short memories,\nespecially for experiences we might like to forget. The further we get from a crisis, the\nmore its causes fade from memory and the less likely a recurrence seems. We become\nmore likely to view regulations as unduly burdensome and place less value on the\nprotection they offer from downside risk. The financial sector itself lobbies hard to\nweaken regulation, which is often effective when the last crisis seems far away.\nCredit cycles, financial innovation, and the evolving needs of the economy are\nalso significant contributors. As the economy changes, so do financing needs. This\nmakes it harder to recognize when things are running too hot. In addition, regulators are\nunderstandably cautious about restraining innovations that have societal benefits, which\nmay hinder their ability to reduce associated risks. Longstanding regulations can be\nsubject to regulatory arbitrage, making them less effective as activities migrate outside\nthe regulated system. These dynamics make the financial sector unstable, feeding the\nboom-and-bust cycle.\nHow can we do better?\nThe first lesson is to approach the financial system with a through-the-cycle\nperspective and avoid thinking “this time is different.” In each of the booms I have\ncovered, there was a heady confidence that market discipline would control risk-taking,\n\n- 13 -\nthat downside risks were so implausible as not to merit attention, and that easing\nregulation was justified. With such confidence, insufficient thought was given to how\nregulatory weakening might create new vulnerabilities. A bit of humility would have\nhelped. While it is true that regulation must evolve with the economy and financial\nsystem, we need to recognize that relaxing rules can create vulnerabilities. Changes in\nthe markets themselves can also weaken the effectiveness of regulations.\nThe second lesson is that policymakers should resist the pressure to loosen\nregulations or to refrain from imposing regulation on new activities during the boom\ntimes. With past economic downturns in the rearview mirror, regulations start to be seen\nas a limitation on growth, rather than necessary protection against vulnerabilities. As\nbecame evident in past episodes, vigilant supervision and prudent rules on risk-taking are\nimportant to prevent future crises. While there is a tradeoff, it is important to have\nappropriate protections in place to reduce the risks and costs of the resulting busts.\nThird, regulation cannot be static. If regulation fails to keep up with evolution of\nthe financial sector, it can create new risks or hinder growth.\nTo conclude, an important lesson we can draw from U.S. financial crises is the\nrole that ill-advised weakening of the bank regulatory framework played in those crises.\nIt is well within our ability, and is our duty as regulators, to learn from these episodes to\navoid making the same mistakes. In doing so, we can help to ensure that the financial\nsystem is prepared to weather downturns and continue to serve households and\nbusinesses.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n“Fair Housing at 55—Advancing a Blueprint for Equity”\nNational Fair Housing Alliance 2023 National Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nJuly 18, 2023\n\nThank you for the invitation to join you in commemorating 55 years since the Fair\nHousing Act became law.1 Along with the Voting Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act was\nan essential step in making good on the promise of the Civil Rights Act, and of the vision\nof Dr. Martin Luther King, to build a fair and equal society. Let me also acknowledge\nthe work of the National Fair Housing Alliance (NFHA), its members, and their partner\norganizations in pursuit of this goal.\nAs with other aspects of America’s journey toward equality, today we can\nrecognize the progress made in fair housing while also acknowledging how much farther\nwe have to go and recommitting ourselves to reaching that destination. We need to do\nthat because everyone deserves a fair and equal opportunity. And as we saw in the global\nfinancial crisis, failure to pay attention to discriminatory and predatory practices can have\na devastating effect on our economy.\nFair Lending Supervision and Enforcement\nI’ll start with a few words on the Federal Reserve’s role in eradicating\ndiscrimination in lending. As we are here to commemorate, Congress acted in 1968 to\nmake discrimination in housing illegal with the Fair Housing Act, and it passed the Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act (ECOA) in 1974 to bar lending discrimination.\nThese landmark laws—now 55 and 40 years old—are the foundation of the\nFederal Reserve’s work in this area, we use our supervisory and enforcement authority to\nensure these laws are followed. Fair lending violations can come in the form of disparate\ntreatment, which is when a lender treats a credit applicant differently on the basis of a\n1 The views I express here are my own and not those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nprohibited factor, as well as disparate impact, when a lender applies a racially neutral\npolicy or practice that disproportionately excludes or burdens certain persons on a\nprohibited basis. We believe that the disparate impact test is an important tool to ensure\nthat lending decisions are fair.\nCongress provided regulators with supervisory and enforcement tools to help\nensure that supervised firms resolve consumer protection weaknesses as well as the more\npervasive risk-management issues that often lead to those weaknesses. We evaluate fair\nlending at each consumer compliance exam and engage a specialized team of lawyers,\neconomists, and analysts to help ensure we evaluate fair lending issues thoroughly and\nconsistently across firms. In these examinations, we evaluate the potential for\ndiscriminatory conduct based on the lending activities of the institution and the risk that\ndiscriminatory conduct may occur with respect to each of these activities.2 Our\nexaminations look at outcomes—what was a firm’s lending record on mortgages? Were\nthere disparities in pricing? What was the extent of customer complaints? We also look\nunder the hood, considering a firm’s marketing and outreach, the discretion and financial\nincentives granted to loan officers, and a firm’s branching strategy.\nIf we determine that a bank has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination,\nwe refer the matter to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Federal Reserve referrals have\nresulted in DOJ actions in critical areas, such as redlining and mortgage-pricing\n2 See the Interagency Fair Lending Examination Procedures (August 2009), available at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/caletters/2009/0906/09-06_attachment.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\ndiscrimination.3 Last fall, the DOJ took action against a bank for mortgage pricing\ndiscrimination based on a Federal Reserve referral.4\nBeyond referring matters to the DOJ, we have a broad array of tools to address\nconsumer compliance violations and deficiencies, including supervisory findings and\nmemoranda of understanding that require the bank to take corrective action and remediate\nconsumer harm. We also conduct outreach efforts that actively promote sound\ncompliance management practices and programs, including regular outreach by our\nReserve Banks to state member banks and our public webinar series.5\nFair Lending Implications of Innovation\nAs our financial system evolves, it is critical that we adapt our application of the\nFair Housing Act and ECOA to deal with technological change and other developments.\nThe digital economy has produced alternative data sources, some of which can\nprovide a window into the creditworthiness of an individual who does not have a standard\ncredit history. And new artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning have\nthe potential to leverage these data at scale and at low cost to expand credit to people who\n3 See, e.g., the DOJ consent orders with Midwest BankCentre at\nhttps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2013/04/15/mbcsettle.pdf ; SunTrust Mortgage at\nhttps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2012/09/17/suntrustsettle.pdf; and Countrywide\nFinancial Corporation at\nhttps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2012/01/27/countrywidesettle.pdf, and\nhttp://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reaches-335-million-settlement-resolve-allegations-\nlending-discrimination.\n4 See the DOJ consent order with Evolve Bank and Trust at https://www.justice.gov/d9/case-\ndocuments/attachments/2022/10/17/settle_evolve-final-10-19.pdf.\n5 The Board annually sponsors an interagency webinar on fair lending supervision. During the 2022\nwebinar, over 6,000 financial institutions registered, the majority of which were community banks. These\nwebinars are archived and free to the public. See “Consumer Compliance Outlook Live” at\nhttps://www.consumercomplianceoutlook.org/outlook-live/archives/.\n\n- 4 -\notherwise can’t access it. While these technologies have enormous potential, they also\ncarry risks of violating fair lending laws and perpetuating the very disparities that they\nhave the potential to address. Use of machine learning or other artificial intelligence may\nperpetuate or even amplify bias or inaccuracies inherent in the data used to train the\nsystem or make incorrect predictions if that data set is incomplete or nonrepresentative.6\nThere are also risks that the data points used could be correlated with a protected class\nand lack a sufficient nexus to creditworthiness.\nFor instance, digital redlining in marketing—the use of criteria to exclude\nmajority-minority communities or minority applications—is one risk, and it has already\nbeen the subject of several settlements, including one several years ago involving the\nNFHA and Facebook.7 Digital redlining may result if advertisers select their audiences\nbased on a characteristic that is correlated with protected characteristics.8 New\ntechnologies can also result in “reverse redlining,” or steering in the advertisement of\nmore expensive or otherwise inferior products to minority communities.\n6 See Request for Information and Comment on Financial Institutions’ Use of Artificial Intelligence,\nIncluding Machine Learning 86 Fed. Reg. 16,837 (March 31, 2021),\nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/03/31/2021-06607/request-for-information-and-comment-\non-financial-institutions-use-of-artificial-intelligence.\n7 National Fair Housing Alliance, et. al, Summary of Settlements Between Civil Rights Advocates and\nFacebook (March 19, 2019), available at https://nationalfairhousing.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2022/01/3.18.2019-Joint-Statement-FINAL-1.pdf.\n8 The Federal Reserve has highlighted some potential fair lending risks associated with digital marketing\nactivities in Consumer Compliance Outlook Live webinars and ways banks can mitigate them. For\ninstance, in 2021, the Federal Reserve presentation at the annual interagency fair lending webinar covered\nfair lending risks relating to use of alternative data and machine learning in credit marketing. One of the\nrisk mitigation strategies discussed during the webinar was taking steps to ensure that institutions review\nuse of all criteria or filters in internet-based marketing and outreach activities to understand whether a\nthird-party advertising platform utilizes filters that could exclude majority-minority communities or\nminority applicants. See “Fintech & Fair Lending Risk,” Federal Reserve presentation at 2021 Fair\nLending Interagency Webinar (December 2021), available at\nhttps://www.consumercomplianceoutlook.org/Outlook-Live/2021/2021-Fair-Lending-Interagency-\nwebinar/.\n\n- 5 -\nThese risks are amplified when a model is opaque and lacks a sufficient degree of\nexplainability—the degree to which the bank can understand how data, variables, and\nother features inform the credit decisions.\nWhile banks are still in the early days of adopting artificial intelligence and other\nmachine learning technologies, we are working to ensure that our supervision keeps pace.\nThrough our supervisory process, we evaluate whether firms have proper risk\nmanagement and controls, including with respect to those new technologies.9\nCRA Final Rule\nFollowing the Fair Housing Act and ECOA, Congress recognized that more\nneeded to be done to address redlining and other systemic inequities in access to credit,\ninvestment, and banking services and it passed the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)\nin 1977 to do that.\nI have spent much of my career thinking and writing about aspects of fair lending\nand the role of the CRA, and I’m honored for the opportunity to now lead the Federal\nReserve’s efforts to update the rule. As you are well aware, the Federal Reserve is\nworking in partnership with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to release a final rule for the CRA. The\nproposal would adapt the regulations to address changes in the banking sector, including\ninternet and mobile banking, and update the approach to assessment areas. It also would\nprovide more clarity, consistency, and transparency for CRA evaluations and eligible\n9 For instance, the banking agencies’ model risk-management guidance outlines key steps to confirm that a\nmodel is fit for its purpose, reliable, and stable—including independent validation.

The agencies are benefitting from the thoughtful comment letters we received\non the proposal, and all three agencies are hard at work finalizing the rule. Once\nfinalized, it is my hope and belief that this new CRA final rule, in parallel with the\nexisting protections of the Fair Housing Act and ECOA, will support bank lending,\ninvesting, and services that meet the needs of all communities, including those that\ncontinue to be underserved.\nSpecial Purpose Credit Programs\nAnd to that end, let me highlight one way that public interest and trade groups and\nbanks can come together to bring credit to where it counts. Special Purpose Credit\nPrograms (SPCPs) are one method to address discrimination and bias in mortgage credit\ntransactions, and many large financial institutions have publicly stated that they initiated\nor expanded special purpose credit programs in the past year. As you know, SPCPs\nsupport the creation of lending products to promote access to credit for economically\ndisadvantaged groups of people and can be designed to benefit those who are members of\nprotected classes under Fair Lending laws. In 2022, federal agencies, including the\nFederal Reserve, issued a statement to remind creditors of the process for creating these\nprograms.10 I know that NFHA worked with the Mortgage Bankers Association on an\nonline toolkit for banks to create SPCPs, and that many large banks have adopted this\napproach.11\n10 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, et al., “Interagency Statement on Special Purpose\nCredit Programs Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B,” CA letter 22-2 (February 22,\n2022), https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/caltr2202.htm.\n11 National Fair Housing Alliance, Special Purpose Credit Program Toolkit, available at\nhttps://spcptoolkit.com/.\n\n- 7 -\nPolicy Developments to Address Appraisal Discrimination and Bias in Housing\nMortgage Credit Transactions\nLet me touch on two recent initiatives we’ve taken to address appraisal\ndiscrimination and bias in housing mortgage credit transactions. On June 1 of this year,\nseveral agencies invited public comment on a proposed rule designed to ensure the\ncredibility and integrity of automated valuation models.12 On June 8, the agencies also\ninvited public comment on guidance that would highlight risks associated with deficient\nhome appraisals. The guidance describes how financial institutions may incorporate\n“reconsiderations of value” into their processes and controls around home appraisals.13\nDeficient collateral valuations can contain inaccuracies because of errors, omissions, or\ndiscrimination that affects the value of the appraisal, and a reconsideration of value may\nhelp to properly value the real estate. I am fully supportive of both these proposals\nbecause homeownership is an important way for families to build wealth, and we should\ngive them every opportunity to share in those benefits.\nConclusion\nIn closing, promoting fair and equitable treatment to all consumers is the right\nthing to do, and this is also just good business. Ensuring that potential borrowers are\ntreated equally can mean developing previously underserved communities, creating more\n12 Quality Control Standards for Automated Valuation Models, 88 Fed.

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nBrookings Institution\nWashington, D.C.\nSeptember 10, 2024\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak today.1 Since I joined the Federal Reserve\nBoard as Vice Chair for Supervision, I have spoken many times about the importance of\nbank capital to the safety and soundness of banks and the stability of the financial\nsystem.2 It is critical that banks have the capacity to continue lending to households and\nbusinesses through times of stress. Bank capital is a key component of this resilience.\nAnd bank capital rules help to ensure that banks are holding capital commensurate with\nthe risks of their activities and the risks that they pose to the U.S. financial system. But\ncapital has costs too. As compared to debt, capital is a more expensive source of funding\nto the bank.3 Thus, higher capital requirements can raise the cost of funding to a bank,\nand the bank can pass higher costs on to households, businesses, and clients engaged in a\nrange of financial activities. These activities are critical to a well-functioning economy\nthat works for everyone. That’s why it is important to get the balance between resiliency\nand efficiency right.\n1 The views I express here are my own, and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Michael S. Barr, \"Why Bank Capital Matters\" (speech at the American Enterprise Institute,\nWashington, DC, December 1, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20221201a.htm and Michael S. Barr, \" Holistic\nCapital Review\" (speech at the Bipartisan Policy Center, Washington, DC, July 10, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/barr20230710a.pdf.\n3 Under standard corporate finance theory, a firm should be indifferent between debt and equity, but in\npractice, as compared to debt, equity is a more expensive source of funding to a bank given the structure of\nour laws and markets, the presence of deposit insurance and other government support, and other factors.\nSee, e.g., Franco Modigliani and Merton H.

Volcker, Too Big to\nFail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts (Washington: Brookings Institution Press, 2009).\n\n- 2 -\nToday, I’ll return to these themes in the context of two rules of great public\ninterest: The Basel III endgame proposal and the proposal to adjust the capital surcharge\nfor global systemically important banks (G-SIB).4\nThe path forward\nA little over a year ago, the Board sought comment on those two proposed rules,\nwhich would modify risk-based capital requirements for large banks. We received a\ngreat number of comments on the provisions in the proposal, as well as on the\njustifications and analysis that underlie those provisions.\nSince that time, we have been hard at work analyzing the comments and the data\nwe collected to evaluate the combined impact of these proposals. We have spoken with a\nwide range of stakeholders, including banks, academics, public interest groups,\nconsumers, businesses, other regulators, Congress, and others. As you would expect in a\nproject as technical and consequential as this one, I have had many productive meetings\nwith Board colleagues and our fellow federal bank regulatory agencies, the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(OCC).\nThis process has led us to conclude that broad and material changes to the\nproposals are warranted. As I said, there are benefits and costs to increasing capital\nrequirements. The changes we intend to make will bring these two important objectives\ninto better balance, in light of the feedback we have received. The changes to the\n4 The G-SIB surcharge is an additional layer of capital just for the G-SIBs, and it is measured on several\nfactors of each G-SIB, specific to their individual risks.\n\n- 3 -\nendgame proposal have been a joint effort with my counterparts at the FDIC and the\nOCC.\nI intend to recommend that the Board re-propose the Basel endgame and G-SIB\nsurcharge rules. This will provide the public the opportunity to fully review a number of\nkey broad and material changes to the original proposals and provide comment. We will\naccept public comments on any aspect of the Basel endgame and G-SIB surcharge\nproposals.\nThe changes in the endgame re-proposal will cover all major areas of the rule:\ncredit risk; operational risk; and market risk. Banks with assets between $100 and $250\nbillion would no longer be subject to the endgame changes, other than the requirement to\nrecognize unrealized gains and losses of their securities in regulatory capital.5 These\nchanges reflect the feedback we have received from the public, improve the tiering of the\nproposal, and better reflect risks. I will also recommend changes to the G-SIB surcharge\nproposal to better align the capital surcharge for a G-SIB with its systemic risk profile.\nTaken together, the re-proposals would increase aggregate common equity tier 1\ncapital requirements for the G-SIBs, which are the largest and most complex banks, by\n9 percent. For other large banks that are not G-SIBs, the impact from the re-proposal\nwould mainly result from the inclusion of unrealized gain and losses on their securities in\nregulatory capital, estimated to be equivalent to a 3 to 4 percent increase in capital\nrequirements over the long run. The remainder of the re-proposal would increase capital\nrequirements for non-GSIB firms still subject to the rule by 0.5 percent.\n5 To the extent that such a firm has large trading operations, it would also be subject to the revised market\nrisk framework.\n\n- 4 -\nWhile these proposed changes affect some of the most important aspects of the\nproposals, the agencies have not made final decisions on any aspect of the re-proposals,\nincluding those that are not explicitly addressed in the re-proposal. The public should not\nview any omission of a potential change in these re-proposals as an indication that the\nagencies will finalize a provision as proposed. We continue to consider comments\nalready received on the 2023 proposal, and we will consider those comments together\nwith any comments submitted on the re-proposals as part of any final rulemakings. This\nis an interim step. Let me reiterate that we are open to comments on any aspect of the\nproposals. Now, I will turn to the changes.\nCredit risk\nI will begin with an overview of the changes I will recommend to the capital\nrequirements for credit risk, which protect against the risk that a bank’s loans will not be\nfully repaid. These changes include reducing the risk-weights for residential real estate\nand retail exposures, extending the scope of the reduced risk weight for certain low-risk\ncorporate debt, and eliminating the minimum haircut for securities financing transactions.\nFirst, I intend to recommend that the Board lower the proposed risk-weighting for\nloans secured by residential real estate and loans to retail customers. The original\nproposal introduced more risk-sensitive approaches for residential real estate and retail\nexposures, but calibrated them to be higher than the Basel standard to promote domestic\ncompetitive equity. The agencies received significant comments on the proposed\ncalibrations. Some commenters argued that the elevated risk weights would overstate the\nrisk for these loans given their loss history. Others argued that the risk weighting would\naffect home affordability and homeownership opportunities, particularly for first-time\n\n- 5 -\nhomebuyers, minority communities, and low- and moderate-income borrowers, and could\nreduce the availability and affordability of retail credit.\nI will recommend that we reduce the calibration for residential real estate\nexposures so that it is in line with the calibration developed in the Basel process. With\nthis change, all-in capital requirements, including for operational and credit risk, will be\nlower on average than they are currently for mortgages up to 90 percent loan-to-value\nratio, and about the same as they are now for mortgages up to 100 percent loan-to-value.\nWith respect to loans to retail customers, I intend to recommend that we adopt the Basel\nstandard, with two exceptions – first, we would lower the capital requirements for credit\ncard exposures where the borrower uses only a small portion of the commitment line, and\nsecond, we would lower the capital requirement for charge cards with no pre-set credit\nlimits.\nThe second proposed change related to credit risk would extend the reduced risk\nweight for low-risk corporate exposures to certain regulated entities that a bank judges to\nbe investment grade and that are not publicly traded. The original proposal provided this\npreferential treatment only to investment-grade corporates that were publicly traded\nbecause the financial disclosure requirements for these entities facilitate market\nparticipants’ assessments of their financial condition, which in turn provide additional\ninformation for banking organizations to use when assessing these entities’ credit risk.\nThere were many comments that the preferential treatment should be extended further,\nincluding to regulated entities that are also subject to substantial regulatory discipline and\nsubstantial transparency requirements. Consistent with our objective of increasing risk\nsensitivity in capital requirements, I plan to recommend to the Board that we extend the\n\n- 6 -\nreduced corporate risk weight to regulated entities – including regulated financial\ninstitutions that are not banks, such as pension funds, certain mutual funds, and foreign\nequivalents – that are investment-grade but not publicly traded.\nThird, I intend to recommend that the Board not adopt the capital treatment\nassociated with minimum haircut floors for securities financing transactions. The\nproposal included heightened capital requirements for repo-style transactions and eligible\nmargin loans that did not meet minimum margin requirements. While consistent with the\nBasel standard, several other major jurisdictions have not adopted this approach. Not\nadopting the minimum haircut floors will allow time to seek greater international\nconsensus on this important topic before deciding on whether and how to implement such\nan approach in the United States.\nEquity Exposures\nLet me speak to the treatment of tax credit equity financing exposures. I plan to\nrecommend that we significantly lower the risk weight for tax credit equity funding\nstructures, given the lower inherent risk in these structures compared to many other\nequity investments. The revised lower risk weight for these exposures of 100 percent\nwould reflect this lower risk and be consistent with the approach we take for other tax\ncredit investments, such as the low-income housing tax credits.\nOperational risk\nNext, let me speak about three changes I intend to recommend for the proposed\ncapital treatment of operational risk, which is the risk of losses from inadequate or failed\nprocesses, such as from fraud or cyberattacks. First, I plan to recommend that we no\nlonger adjust a firm’s operational risk charge based on its operational loss history. This\n\n- 7 -\nchange will reduce fluctuations in a bank’s operational risk capital requirements over\ntime.\nSecond, I plan to recommend to the Board that we calculate fee income on a net\nbasis in calculating its contribution to the operational risk capital requirement. The\noriginal proposal would have measured the contribution of fee-based activities based on\ngross revenues, instead of net income, which is revenues minus expenses. Moving to net\nincome for fee-based activities—specifically, by netting noninterest income and expenses\n(except for operational losses)—would produce more consistency in how operational risk\nis measured across bank activities, as interest and trading income and expenses are\nalready measured on a net basis under the proposal. This change would also produce\nmore consistent operational risk capital requirements across banks because the approach\nis less sensitive to the differences in accounting practices across banks.\nThird, I plan to recommend to the Board that we reduce operational risk capital\nrequirements for investment management activities to reflect the smaller historical\noperational losses for these activities relative to income. The agencies received\ncomments suggesting that some fee-based business lines have incurred meaningfully\nlower operational losses than other business lines. We have found evidence that\ninvestment management has historically experienced noticeably low operational losses\nrelative to income produced.\nMarket risk and derivatives\nNow, I’ll speak to the capital treatment for a bank’s trading activities and its\nderivatives activities. The endgame proposal included a number of important\nimprovements relative to the current market risk capital framework, including to\n\n- 8 -\nincorporate lessons learned from the 2007-09 financial crisis that have not been\nsufficiently addressed in the current framework. It would permit firms to use internal\nmodels to capture the complex dynamics of most market risks but would put certain\nconstraints on banks’ models and provide fallbacks in areas where modeling practices are\nnot adequate.\nWe received numerous comments on ways to improve this part of the proposal. I\nplan to recommend that we make changes to facilitate banks’ ability to use internal\nmodels for market risk. For example, the re-proposal will introduce a multiyear\nimplementation period for the profit and loss attribution tests that are used to confirm that\nmodels are working as intended. This extended transition period would allow banks to\ngain experience with the tests and provide time to improve their systems and processes\nand address any potential gaps in data and model performance. In addition, the re-\nproposal would contain a few additional adjustments to improve incentives for a firm to\nmodel its exposures.\nMoreover, we will clarify that uniform mortgage-backed securities positions\nwould be treated as having a single obligor, regardless of whether they were issued by\nFreddie Mac or Fannie Mae. This change will enable firms to recognize hedging across\nthese securities.\nWith respect to derivatives activities, I plan to recommend that the Board adjust\nthe capital treatment for client-cleared derivatives activities by reducing the capital\nrequired for the client-facing leg of a client-cleared derivative. This change would better\nreflect the risks of these transactions, which are highly collateralized and subject to\n\n- 9 -\nnetting and daily margin requirements. This also would avoid disincentives to client\nclearing, which I’ll return to later.\nTiering\nLet me turn to tiering. The largest, most complex firms should be subject to the\nmost stringent requirements, in light of the costs that their potential failure would impose\non the broader financial system and thus on businesses and households. Under the re-\nproposal, G-SIBs and other internationally active banks would be subject to the most\nstringent set of requirements, including the new credit risk and operational risk\nrequirements, and the revised frameworks for market risk and CVA frameworks.\nCapital requirements for large banks that are not G-SIBs can be simpler while still\nsupporting resilience. I am recommending a number of changes to better reflect this\nprinciple. For firms with assets between $250 and $700 billion that are not G-SIBs or\ninternationally active, the re-proposal would apply the new credit risk and operational\nrisk requirements; however, it would apply the frameworks for market risk and CVA\nframeworks only to firms that engage in significant trading activity. Further, the re-\nproposal would revert to the simpler definition of capital – the numerator in the capital\nratio – for these firms that is currently in place, with the exception of applying the\nrequirement to reflect unrealized losses and gains on certain securities and other aspects\nof accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The re-proposal would maintain\nthis element to better reflect interest rate risk in capital, a problem that played a major\nrole in last March’s bank failures.\nFor large banks with assets between $100 and $250 billion, the re-proposal would\nnot apply the credit risk and operational risk frameworks of the expanded risk-based\n\n- 10 -\napproach to these banking organizations, maintaining a simpler capital framework for\nthese less complex firms. For these firms, the re-proposal would also revert to the\nsimpler definition of capital for these firms that is currently in place, with the exception\nof applying the requirement to reflect unrealized losses and gains on certain securities\nand other aspects of AOCI.\nG-SIB surcharge proposal\nAs I noted, last July, we sought comment on proposed revisions to the G-SIB\nsurcharge, to better reflect the systemic risk of each G-SIB. In particular, the proposal\nwould make adjustments to limit “window dressing” by requiring banks to report\nindicators as average values instead of on a point-in-time basis. It would also reduce\n“cliff effects” by calculating a G-SIB’s capital surcharge in 0.1 percent increments\ninstead of 0.5 percent increments. And the proposal would adjust how we measure some\nsystemic indicators to better align them with risk.6\nThe goal of the 2023 proposal was to improve the risk sensitivity of the G-SIB\nsurcharge. Commenters provided helpful feedback regarding the proposal’s potential\nimpact on certain types of activities, such as client clearing of derivatives. We are still\nconsidering these comments, but let me speak to areas where I will recommend making\nchanges to the original proposal.\nFirst, I’ll speak to the treatment of cleared derivatives. The proposal would have\nincreased the extent to which client-cleared derivatives contribute to a bank’s G-SIB\n6 With regard to the adjustments to address window dressing and cliff effects, these will have a one-time\nimpact on banks that carefully manage their operations to lower surcharge buckets, but should improve the\nefficiency and risk-sensitivity of the measure over time.\n\n- 11 -\nsurcharge, to promote consistency of the measure. However, commenters argued that the\nmeasure might result in higher costs and more volatility for derivative end users and\nmight reduce incentives to provide clients’ access to central clearing. While it is\nimportant for our capital rules to be risk-sensitive, it is also important that we consider\nthe impact of our rules in the broader market context. Central clearing of derivatives is a\ncritical tool that can help improve transparency and reduce systemic risk. To avoid\ndisincentives for client clearing, I intend to recommend to the Board that we not adopt the\nproposed changes to capital requirements associated with client clearing.\nSecond, let me speak to changes in the surcharge proposal that I will recommend\nto keep the measures we use up-to-date. The U.S. G-SIB surcharge was set nearly nine\nyears ago, and the growth in the economy since 2015 has meant that G-SIBs’ measures of\nsystemic risk have increased, even for firms whose share of domestic or global economic\nactivity has not increased. The Board noted the potential for this effect in the original\n2015 G-SIB rule. While it did not provide a mechanism to automatically adjust for\neconomic growth at that time, the Board stated that it would periodically reevaluate the\nframework.\nAs part of the G-SIB re-proposal, I intend to recommend that we improve the\ncalculation of the capital surcharges for G-SIBs by reflecting changes in the global\nbanking system since the Board adopted the G-SIB surcharge in 2015. In addition, for\nthe future, I intend to recommend that we account for effects from inflation and economic\n\n- 12 -\ngrowth in the measurement of a G-SIB’s systemic risk profile. As a result, a G-SIB’s\nsurcharge would not change based simply on growth in the economy.7\nConclusion\nThe journey to improve capital requirements since the Global Financial Crisis has\nbeen a long one, and Basel III endgame is an important element of this effort. These re-\nproposals bring us closer to completing the task.\nThe broad and material changes to both proposals that I’ve outlined today would\nbetter balance the benefits and costs of capital in light of comments received, and result\nin a capital framework that appropriately reflects the risks of bank activities and is tiered\nto the banking sector. They also bring the proposals broadly in line with what other\nmajor jurisdictions are doing. And what does this all mean? A safer and fairer banking\nsystem. My goal, throughout my nearly 30 years in this field, has always been to help\nensure that the banking system can support households and businesses of all types, during\ngood times and bad.\nIn addition to the re-proposals outlined today, we are looking carefully at how our\nstress test complements the risk-based capital rules to help ensure our overall framework\nsupports a resilient and effective banking sector. We are attentive to the interactions\nacross all components of our capital framework as well as the combined burden and\n7 The re-proposal would update the method 2 coefficients to reflect changes from 2015 until the present\nusing a methodology that is consistent with the Board’s original calibration in 2015. Specifically, the\nsupplemental proposal would update the method 2 coefficients for each of the systemic indicators for the\nsize, interconnectedness, complexity, and cross-jurisdictional activity categories from 2015 until the\npresent using the most recent available two-year average of aggregate global indicator amounts and the\ncorresponding three-year average of euro/U.S. dollar exchange rates. Going forward, it would also include\na mechanism to annually adjust the method 2 coefficients for each of the systemic indicators for the size,\ninterconnectedness, complexity, and cross-jurisdictional activity categories based on U.S. inflation and real\neconomic growth. This mechanism would use a three-year moving average of annual nominal U.S. gross\ndomestic product (GDP) growth to adjust these coefficients on an annual basis.\n\n- 13 -\nbenefits, and we take these issues seriously. In all of our work, we will continue to seek\nan approach that helps to ensure financial system resiliency and supports the flow of\ncredit to households and businesses. It is most imperative that we get this right.\nThank you.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nvia prerecorded video\nto\nNational Community Reinvestment Coalition\nJust Economy Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch 29, 2023\n\nGood morning. Thank you to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition\n(NCRC) for the invitation to speak with you today. I regret that I cannot be there in\nperson, but I can imagine the energy and excitement in a room full of so many dedicated\ncommunity development professionals. I appreciate all the work that NCRC members\nand partner organizations do to advance economic opportunities for people and\ncommunities throughout the country, and the role you play in helping to inform public\npolicy. For these brief remarks, I was asked to share my thoughts on the Community\nReinvestment Act (CRA), a topic of great interest to all of you and to me as well.\nAs you are well aware, the Federal Reserve is working in partnership with the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) to release a final rule for the CRA. The CRA is one of the seminal\nlaws enacted to address systemic inequities in access to credit and one of the best tools\nthat we, as regulators, have to help ensure banks meet their affirmative obligation to serve\nthe credit needs of the communities in which they do business, including low- and\nmoderate-income communities.\nCRA has been an area of focus for me for over 25 years. As many of you know, I\nhave had the opportunity to research and write about the CRA and its impact long before\njoining the Federal Reserve Board. Therefore, I was pleased to be asked by Chair Powell\nto lead the Fed’s efforts, taking the baton from Vice Chair Brainard, as the agencies work\ntogether to finalize much-needed updates to the CRA.\nThe three agencies have been inclusive and analytical in their approach to CRA\nreform. Extensive stakeholder engagement and policy deliberations directly informed\n\n- 2 -\nour proposal last year. What I will lay out as priorities for CRA reform align with the\npriorities you have heard previously from the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC.\nFirst, a successful reform of CRA must advance the core purpose of the statute.\nThe law was intended to address inequities in access to credit and promote community\nengagement and financial inclusion in low- and moderate-income communities.\nSecond, the new CRA rule should address the significant changes in the banking\nsector since the regulations were last substantially revised more than a quarter century\nago. This involves evaluation of online and mobile banking, branchless banking, and\nhybrid models.\nThird, the new CRA rule should provide greater clarity, consistency, and\ntransparency so that everyone—the public, community groups, and banks—understands\nwhat counts for CRA consideration and how a bank’s rating is determined. As you saw\nin the proposal, the agencies are working to develop a metrics-based approach to CRA\nevaluations for retail lending and community development financing to bring greater\nclarity and consistency to CRA examinations, while still ensuring that there is an\nopportunity to consider qualitative factors to encourage activities that are particularly\nimpactful or responsive.\nAnd fourth, the new CRA rule should align evaluations and data collection to\nbank size and type. One of the strengths of the banking sector is its diversity of\ninstitutions, so a modern CRA must accommodate banks of different sizes and business\nmodels and ensure that smaller banks do not have the same requirements as large banks\nwith much greater capacity.\n\n- 3 -\nI know that many of you are eagerly awaiting the new CRA rule. Let me assure\nyou that all three agencies are diligently working together to craft a final rule in light of\nthe extensive public comments we received on our proposal. Once finalized, it is my\nhope and belief that this new CRA final rule will support more impactful bank lending,\ninvesting, and services in today’s banking environment for the communities you\nfaithfully serve.\nI hope you have an excellent conference, and I look forward to interacting with\nmany of you in person so I can learn from you what works to create economic\nopportunities for families and communities.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nAlliance for Innovative Regulation\nWashington, D.C.\nFebruary 27, 2025\n\nThanks to the Alliance for Innovative Regulation for organizing this event and for\nbringing together banks, fintechs, and regulators to collaborate and foster responsible\ninnovation.1\nInnovation, when done responsibly, brings tremendous benefits to consumers, financial\ninstitutions, and the economy at large. Innovation can make financial products and services\nbetter, cheaper, and safer. It can make banking accessible to more consumers, advancing\nfinancial inclusion. It can modernize our financial infrastructures, creating efficiencies and\nproviding new tools for banks to manage risk.\nInnovation also comes with risks that need to be managed responsibly. Responsible\ninnovation is in everyone’s interest. Consumers want the benefits of innovation through\nproducts and services they can trust. Banks have an interest in managing the complexities of\ninnovation responsibly, ensuring that they recognize new and evolving risks to safety and\nsoundness, follow relevant laws, and protect and serve their customers. Fintechs often play a key\nrole in offering products and services that allow banks to meet these needs. And regulators and\nsupervisors should develop regulatory and supervisory frameworks that allow banks to clearly\nunderstand and manage the risks associated with innovative activities. To achieve that,\nregulators should provide ongoing transparency and clarity on our approach.\nToday, I’d like to share how the Federal Reserve’s Novel Activities Supervision\nProgram, launched in the summer of 2023, plays an important role in supporting responsible\ninnovation at our supervised institutions.2 Prior to this program, the Federal Reserve established\ntemporary working groups and task forces to better understand evolving technologies to inform\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Creation of Novel Activities Supervision Program,” SR\nletter 23-7 (August 8, 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2307.htm.\n\n- 2 -\nsupervision. Ultimately, though, we determined we needed a dedicated supervisory function for\nnovel activities. There were a number of factors driving that decision that guided how we\ndesigned the Program.\nFirst, we understood that the pace of innovation was rapid. And we knew there would, of\ncourse, be benefits and risks stemming from innovation in the financial system. So we tasked the\nNovel Program with monitoring and understanding how these innovations and associated novel\nactivities are used in banking and what benefits and risks they would pose. We gave them the\nmandate to keep up with the expertise related to use of new technologies and to employ new\ntools and data analytics in supervision. We invested time and research in understanding new\ntechnologies and businesses because we understood the importance of allowing innovation in the\nsector and avoiding excessively rigid stances on risk that don’t take into account the potential to\nmake advancements in the sector and economy that benefit all of society.\nSecond, we recognized that many financial institutions across the country are exploring\nand using many of the same technologies and similar novel business models. We felt it was\nimportant to create a coordinated approach to supervising novel activities across the Federal\nReserve System. We initially identified two dozen firms, including firms of all sizes, for\nsupervision by the Novel Activities Program. Firms are added or removed from the Program\nbased on their engagement in novel activities. The supervisory program is designed to build a\nbroad-based perspective of novel activities, the benefits and risks, and how those risks are\nmanaged. In this way, the Novel Program helps to enable similar supervision of similar risks, in\na manner that reflects our current understanding of those activities in a variety of contexts.\nThird, while the technologies and products used by banks may be similar, their\napplication and thus the benefits and risks may vary across business models. We understand the\n\n- 3 -\nimportance of tiering supervision to the type, extent, and level of risk posed by the novel\nactivities and varied business models of supervised institutions and not imposing undue burden\non firms. The Novel Activities Program employs a risk-based approach to supervision—\nmeaning that the intensity of supervision is commensurate with the risk and scale of the activity.\nThere is no one-size-fits-all model. Experts from the Novel team join the traditional supervisory\nteams that banks are used to working with on a regular basis, so there is no disruption or change\nin how we engage with banks. The Program is dynamic. As a bank changes its activities in this\nspace, the rigor of the supervision similarly changes.3\nThe Novel Activities Program serves as a central point of expertise on new and\ninnovative activities, supporting coordinated and risk-based supervision, and facilitating\ncollaboration and communication between supervisors and stakeholders, all of whom contribute\nto supporting responsible innovation.\nNext, let me speak to two important principles in our Novel Program—clarity and\ncollaboration.\nClarity\nStarting with clarity: for banks beginning to explore new technologies, supervisors should\nengage early in the process to understand the technology and the risks and provide a clear sense\nof their expectations along the way. Engagement allows for banks and their supervisors to share\nperspectives on effective risk management practices and the application of new technologies.\nEarly and open dialogue creates opportunities for supervisors to provide feedback to banks on\n3 As of today, there are 22 Federal Reserve supervised firms in the Novel Activities Supervision Program.\n\n- 4 -\nnecessary risk management frameworks early on in their innovation process and to have an open\ndialogue that builds trust as products go to market.\nAs novel activities become more developed, we can issue guidance, resources, and other\ntypes of communications to further disseminate information, gather input, and provide clarity on\neffective risk management for novel activities. For example, in May 2024, the Federal Reserve,\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nreleased a guide to assist community banks in developing and implementing third-party risk\nmanagement practices, which could be a useful resource for banks seeking to engage in novel,\ntechnology-based partnerships.4 A few months later, the agencies issued a joint statement on\narrangements with third parties to deliver bank deposit products and services, which discusses\nthe risks these arrangements can present, offers examples of practices to manage those risks, and\nreminds banks of existing requirements and supervisory expectations.5 There is no-one-size-fits-\nall approach in how we engage and communicate guidance to our firms, but it is essential that\nengagement happen to provide clarity to both sides.\nI have said it before many times and want to reiterate it here: the Federal Reserve neither\nprohibits nor discourages banking organizations from providing banking services to customers of\nany specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation. It is up to banks to choose their\nown customers, and not supervisors. That has been and will continue to be our practice. In fact,\nbanks supervised by the Federal Reserve provide material and important services to the crypto-\nindustry. For example, banks supervised by the Fed operate real-time, 24/7 payment platforms\n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Third-Party Risk Management: A Guide for Community\nBanks,” SR letter 24-2 / CA letter 24-1 (May 7, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2402.pdf.\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Joint Statement on Banks’ Arrangements with Third Parties\nto Deliver Bank Deposit Products and Services,” SR letter 24-5 (July 25, 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2405.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nthat serve as a primary mechanism for companies to exchange dollars to settle crypto-asset\ntransactions. We monitor that activity from both a safety and soundness and financial stability\nlens, but we do not tell banks to serve or not serve those customers.\nCollaboration\nTurning to collaboration, the private sector is at the forefront of innovation and that\nongoing engagement and collaboration with industry gives supervisors insight into the evolving\nnature of novel innovations and developments. Insights gathered from supervision, analysis, and\nmonitoring activities, and industry engagement, can identify real improvements to how financial\nservices are delivered to households and businesses and how risks are managed by banks.\nCollaboration can also reveal areas where we can provide regulatory clarity for banks looking to\nengage in new activities.\nI want to emphasize the importance of hearing from the public through tools like requests\nfor information, or RFIs. The bank regulatory agencies published an interagency RFI on bank-\nfintech arrangements last July.6 The purpose of the RFI was to build on the agencies’\nunderstanding of these arrangements by soliciting updated input on the nature of bank-fintech\narrangements. This included effective risk management practices regarding those arrangements,\nand the implications of such arrangements for bank risk management, safety and soundness, and\ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. We were also interested in understanding\nwhether enhancements to existing supervisory guidance would be considered helpful in\naddressing the risks associated with these types of arrangements. We received over 100\ncomments. Respondents shared their insights on many topics, including the risks and benefits of\nthese arrangements and how the agencies can bring additional clarity to our supervisory\n6 Request for Information on Bank-Fintech Arrangements Involving Banking Products and Services Distributed to\nConsumers and Businesses, 89 Fed.

Some in the banking sector commented that the Novel Activities Program is an\nexample of how cross-team collaboration might deepen an agency’s understanding of technology\nand innovation. The Federal Reserve and the other agencies are carefully considering the\nfeedback we received as we consider how we can continue to support responsible innovation.\nWe will continue to invest time and resources learning more about innovative\ntechnologies such as distributed ledger technology and bank-fintech partnerships to understand\nhow they may benefit the institutions we supervise and their customers. Moreover, interagency\ncoordination and knowledge-sharing with federal and state regulators and the private sector\ncontinue to be critical sources of discussion, engagement, and knowledge-building.\nIn Closing\nIn closing, thank you for this opportunity to outline the Fed’s Novel Activities Program,\nwhich I believe has already improved the clarity and consistency of our supervision related to\ninnovative technologies and fostered collaboration as banks and supervisors seek to better\nunderstand the risks associated with these activities. I believe this approach will support\ninnovation that benefits consumers while supporting safety and soundness. Thank you.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nThe Annual Columbia Law School Banking Conference\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 16, 2024\n\nThank you to Columbia University and the organizers for the opportunity to speak\ntoday.1 It has been nearly a year since the sudden failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)\nand ensuing turmoil in the banking system, events which prompted important questions\nabout how banks manage risks and how we at the Federal Reserve supervise that risk-\ntaking. It is a fitting time to share some reflections on the importance of the day-to-day\nwork of bank supervision and the steps we are taking to improve the speed, force, and\nagility of supervision.\nReview of Silicon Valley Bank\nLet me begin by summarizing my review of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.\nThis was the first major bank failure since the Global Financial Crisis, and it necessitated\na deep, unflinching review of what went wrong. So, following the failure, Chair Powell\nand I determined that it would be appropriate for me to lead a review on the conditions\nthat led to SVB’s failure.\nExperienced and well-respected staff from around the Federal Reserve System\nwho were not involved in SVB’s supervision conducted the review. The review found\nthat, first and foremost, the bank’s management failed to manage the bank’s risks, and its\nboard failed to oversee management.2 But the review also found that Federal Reserve\nsupervisors did not identify issues quickly enough, and when we did identify risks, we\nwere too slow to act with sufficient force to change management behavior.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board.\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and\nRegulation of Silicon Valley Bank (Washington: Board of Governors, April 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf.\n\n- 2 -\nThe SVB report identified the need to improve the speed, force, and agility of\nsupervision to align with the risks, size, and complexity of supervised banks. To do this,\nthe report identified several areas of focus, including intensifying supervision at the right\npace, encouraging timely supervisory action and escalation, and improving agility of\nsupervision. We are taking many steps to strengthen supervision, some of which have\nimmediate influence on our work and some which will bear fruit over the long term.\nThe Goal of Supervision\nLet me start by explaining the goals and benefits of supervision. The mission of\nbank supervision is to promote a safe, sound, and efficient banking system to support a\nstrong economy.3 As I have spoken about many times before, banks play a critical role in\nthe economy by providing deposit products, credit, and other financial services to\nindividuals and businesses. The nature of banking—and the interconnectedness of the\nsystem—pose vulnerabilities to individual banks and to the banking system. Deposit\ninsurance and other forms of governmental support help to protect depositors, banks, and\nthe broader economy, but also add to moral hazard, in that banks do not internalize the\nfull costs of their risks. Regulation and supervision help to make it more likely that\nbanks manage their risks prudently given the costs that their failure can pose on society,\nand that banks have the capacity to support the economy through good times and bad.\nThrough regulation, the Federal Reserve Board sets the minimum requirements\nfor banks.4 These regulations require banks to have systems to manage their risks, and to\n3 For more on bank supervision, please see the Federal Reserve’s website at:\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/understanding-federal-reserve-supervision.htm\n4 In this speech, references to “banks” includes banks, as well as their holding companies. Bank holding\ncompanies constitute the largest segment of institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve, but the Federal\n\n- 3 -\nmaintain capital and liquidity in light of those risks. Regulations are tiered depending on\nbank risks, with the larger, more complex banks subject to more stringent requirements.\nWe need to get regulation right, so that the baseline level of resilience in the system is\nstrong enough. The requirements set in regulation, however, may not be sufficient for\nbanks with activities or profiles that are different from or are riskier than a typical bank.\nSupervision helps to fill in these gaps.\nSupervisors do not manage banks. Instead, a supervisor’s job is to evaluate a\nbank’s material risks in light of its operations, and to help make sure that the bank has\nsufficient governance and controls, capital, and liquidity to operate their firm, both in\nnormal times, and in stressful ones. Supervisors focus on the unique risks of the bank\nand also bring perspectives of risk across similar firms in the banking system. These two\ncomplementary perspectives help supervisors to identify and prioritize key areas of risk\nand to focus management’s attention on addressing the most important issues.\nThe goal of supervision is not to prevent all bank failures. In a market economy,\npoorly run firms should go out of business. Similarly, the goal of supervision is not to\ntell a bank that its business model may not work; the market will do that. The goal is to\nhelp bank managers and boards focus their attention on weaknesses in their risk\nmeasurement and management practices, compliance with law, and the sufficiency of the\nbank’s capital and liquidity resources given its risk profile. Proactive supervisory action\nReserve also supervises state member banks, savings and loan holding companies, foreign banks operating\nin the United States, and other entities. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) also supervise national banks and state nonmember banks,\nrespectively. State banking agencies also supervise state-chartered banks.\n\n- 4 -\nhelps firms address issues before they grow so large as to threaten the bank, and earlier\nintervention means that firms may have more options to fix their problems.\nSupervision can also help to mitigate systemic risk. A bank’s failure can lead to\nbroader instability in the banking system by imposing direct credit losses on other banks,\nand if the failing bank is forced to sell assets in a fire sale, depressing prices and leading\nto additional losses at banks holding those same types of assets. Bank risks can cascade\nthrough the financial system because of these types of interconnectedness. Contagion\nfrom a failing bank can also happen when it is not clear to market participants and\ndepositors whether other banks have similar risks that have not yet fully come to light.\nInadequate capital, insufficient liquidity, weak risk management practices, and even\ncybersecurity failures can not only harm individual banks, but also threaten the stability\nof the system as a whole. Through supervision, we attempt to focus the most attention\nand apply heightened standards to firms with the greatest potential to pose systemic risk.\nBut knowing in advance which firms may pose systemic risk is not an exact science.\nThe Benefits of Supervision\nThere is strong evidence that supervision has significant benefits for individual\nbanks, as well as the entire banking system. Economic research on supervision’s impact\nshows that more intensively supervised banks are safer and no less profitable than their\npeers.5 Supervisory enforcement actions have been shown to result in reduced risk\nthrough decreased leverage and safer loan portfolios.6 Of course, there are costs of\n5 Beverly Hirtle and Anna Kovner, “Bank Supervision,” Annual Review of Financial Economics 14 (2022):\n39–56.\n6 Allen N. Berger, Jin Cai, Raluca A. Roman, and John Sedunov, “Supervisory Enforcement Actions\nAgainst Banks and Systemic Risk,” Journal of Banking and Finance 140 (July 2022).\n\n- 5 -\nsupervision on a bank, and supervision is most effective when its intensity is\nproportionate to the risks the bank poses to the financial system.\nMore broadly, more intensively supervised banks have less volatile income and\nlower loan losses, especially during periods of stress, precisely when the risk of\ncontagion is heightened.7 Since weakness in the banking system can amplify economic\ndownturns, actions that promote stronger banks during such times bring benefits that\nextend well beyond individual banks and the banking system. American households and\nbusinesses depend on banks, and on bank supervisors, to help to ensure banks are\noperating safely and soundly.\nTaken up a level, a systemwide perspective—often referred to a “macroprudential\nperspective”—is critical for understanding risks to financial stability and thus to the\nbanking system’s ability to provide critical lending, payments, and intermediation\nservices to consumers and businesses. It is an important complement to the\n“microprudential” supervision of individual banks.\nSpeed, Force, and Agility of Supervision\nSince SVB’s failure, we have focused on improving the speed, force, and agility\nof supervision, as appropriate to the situation. This means that supervisors take timely\naction as risks build up; that supervisors deploy supervisory tools and escalation\neffectively; and that supervisors are able to take account of changes in market, economic,\nand financial conditions, both to reprioritize examination activity as well as to draw\nsupervisory conclusions based on new and different patterns of risks.\n7 Beverly Hirtle, Anna Kovner, and Matt Plosser, “The Impact of Supervision on Bank Performance,”\nJournal of Finance 75, no. 5 (2020): 2,765–2,808.\n\n- 6 -\nIn all cases, supervisory action must be appropriate to the situation. Because\nsupervision is often uniquely specific to an individual institution, the necessary response\nshould depend on the nature and extent of the risk, size and complexity of the institution;\nits role in the financial system; and the potential for fire sales, cascades, or contagion.\nAnd of course, our findings must be grounded in fact, credible, and consistent with the\nlaw. Supervision should also strive to be efficient in the sense of getting the desired\nsupervisory intensity at the lowest cost to supervisors and banks, to the extent practicable\nand consistent with the overarching objectives of a resilient banking system.\nThe past year has been busy for Federal Reserve supervisors. The banking system\nis sound and resilient, and supervisors have been on the frontlines to help ensure it\nremains that way. Supervisors have brought their understanding of individual banks’\noperations and strategy and an understanding of local conditions to assess bank risk. We\nalso have focused on the macro-prudential, systemic perspectives, to form an\nunderstanding of the condition of the banking system broadly. And supervisors have\nworked closely with banks to improve the resilience of banks so that they can effectively\nserve their customers and provide credit to the economy.\nLet me now walk through our efforts over the past year.\nIntensifying Supervision at the Right Pace\nAs noted in the SVB report, supervision should intensify at the right pace as a\nbank grows in size and complexity. Much of the build-up of risk at SVB occurred while\nthe firm was supervised within the regional bank program, which covered firms with\n\n- 7 -\nassets between $10 billion and $100 billion.8 Based on this experience, for large and\nmore complex regional banking organizations, including firms that are growing rapidly,\nwe are assessing such a firm’s condition, strategy, and risk management more frequently,\nand deepening our supervisory interactions the firm. At the same time, smaller and less\ncomplex firms will see little difference from the current state.\nIn addition, we have been working to introduce more coordination between the\nregional bank and large bank supervisory programs. As a regional bank grows in size\nand complexity, the firm’s management should be investing in the firm’s ability to\nmanage its risk, so that the firm’s capabilities are growing commensurately with the\nfirm’s risk. If this happens, application of standards for larger banks should not require\nsignificant changes in a firm’s risk management capabilities because the bank should\nhave been making these investments along the way. So for regional banks that are\napproaching the $100 billion threshold, we are working to improve coordination between\nsupervisory teams and to share the range of practices at large banking organizations just\nover the $100 billion threshold. The goal is that the transition to heightened supervision\nfor fast-growing banks is more of a gradual slope and not a cliff. For large banking\norganizations, we are planning to conduct more horizontal, or cross-firm supervisory\nexaminations, to put our assessment of an individual bank in context and improve the\nconsistency in how we look across banks.\n8 Prior to SVB’s collapse, firms with assets of less than $100 billion were supervised using approaches\ndeveloped for community banking organizations, and supervisory engagement with the firm was limited to\nan annual examination and targeted examinations as needed.\n\n- 8 -\nTimely Supervisory Action and Escalation\nAs noted in the SVB report, once issues are identified, they should be addressed\nmore quickly, both by banks and supervisors. Over the past year, supervisors have taken\nmany steps to better ensure that banks are appropriately managing their risks, including\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk, and are prepared were they to experience stress.9\nSVB failed in part because of its mismanagement of interest rate and liquidity\nrisks. While SVB was an outlier in many ways, its failure focused attention on other\nbanks in the system with large unrealized losses and high concentrations of uninsured\ndeposits. Examiners have been conducting additional targeted examinations for firms\nwith large unrealized losses or other vulnerabilities. During these exams, we engage\nextensively with the banks to understand the firm’s financial and operational health. And\nwe work closely with our state regulatory partners; they provide important insights into\nthe banks and the banking environment, and we value their continued partnership.\nWhere there are weaknesses in how firms are managing these risks, examiners are\nrequiring firms to take steps to address these weaknesses and encouraging them to bolster\ntheir capital position, reduce their liquidity risk, or mitigate their interest rate risk, as\nappropriate. For a small number of banks with a risk profile that could result in funding\npressures for the firm, supervisors are continuously monitoring these firms.\n9 See, e.g., Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report,\n(Washington: Board of Governors, November 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/202311-supervision-and-regulation-report.pdf; and Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report (Washington: Board of\nGovernors, May 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/202305-supervision-and-\nregulation-report.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nLet me turn to supervision of a specific risk: commercial real estate (CRE). The\nreduced demand for office space and higher interest rates have put pressure on some CRE\nvaluations, particularly in the office sector. Supervisors have been closely focused on\nbanks’ CRE lending in several ways: how banks are measuring their risk and monitoring\nthe risk, what steps they have taken to mitigate the risk of losses on CRE loans, how they\nare reporting their risk to their directors and senior management, and whether they are\nprovisioning appropriately and have sufficient capital to buffer against potential future\nCRE loan losses.\nStepping back, because of the heightened risk environment and heightened\nsupervisory attention, the Federal Reserve has issued more supervisory findings and\ndowngraded firms’ supervisory ratings at a higher rate in the past year. In addition, we\nhave increased our issuance of enforcement actions. These actions do not represent a\nchange in policy; they reflect the impact of the changing economic, interest rate, and\nfinancial environment on a bank’s financial resources. We want and expect supervisors\nto help banks focus adequate attention on the areas that matter most for the particular\nbank, whether that is interest rate risk, CRE, or cybersecurity vulnerabilities, to name a\nfew.\nAs noted in the SVB report, we continue to evaluate whether we should\ntemporarily require additional capital or liquidity beyond regulatory requirements where\nthe firm has trouble in managing its risks. Higher capital or liquidity requirements can\nserve as an important safeguard until risk controls improve, and they can focus\nmanagement’s attention on the most critical issues. Other supervisors use these types of\n\n- 10 -\ntools, and we can draw from these experiences as we consider what may be appropriate\nfor our supervised banks.10\nImproving the Agility of Supervision\nAnother area of focus has been to improve the agility of supervision. Supervisors\nmust be able to make judgments on a forward-looking basis built on imperfect\ninformation, while remaining fair, evidence-based, and consistent. In the case of SVB,\nsupervisors delayed action to gather more evidence even as weaknesses were growing.\nThis delay meant SVB’s problems persisted past the time when it had options to address\nthem, and those problems got worse.\nDrawing from this experience, we have been looking to enhance our supervisory\nprograms so that we correctly balance a strong process with the need to act based on\nimperfect information, and tools that speed up and strengthen the consequences for\nsupervisory findings. As I mentioned previously, supervisors do not manage firms; they\ncommunicate to firms where there are weaknesses in firm practices and escalate those\nconcerns where appropriate. So here, supervisors should be issuing supervisory findings\nin a timely way, focusing on the important issues, aligning findings with the severity of\nthe issue, and communicating findings to firms clearly. Once supervisory findings are\ncommunicated, supervisors should appropriately assess supervised institutions’\nremediation of findings, and when the firm fails to adequately address issues, escalate\nfindings in a timely way to more stringent actions. As part of this effort, we are working\n10 Regulators in Europe and the UK impose additional capital and liquidity buffer requirements on firms\nthrough their Pillar 2 framework. In addition, the OCC’s framework enables the OCC to impose higher\nindividual minimum capital requirements (IMCRs) via an enforcement action. See 12 C.F.R. 3.403.\n\n- 11 -\non our enforcement processes to provide consistency and the appropriate speed, force,\nand agility in the recommendation, development, and escalation of enforcement actions.\nIn addition, we are working to improve our processes for identifying potential\ndevelopments or trends in risk that could negatively affect individual banking firms or the\nbanking system, and better connecting this analysis to supervision. Where risks are\nemerging, this analysis may help to bolster the basis for forward-looking supervisory\nassessments. Where risks are underappreciated, the analysis may help to challenge\nsupervisors’ assessments and foster meaningful action.\nIt is also critical that we look beyond the risks we see today to keep the banking\nsystem strong and resilient into the future. Supervisors should be encouraged to consider\na range of potential shocks and vulnerabilities, so that they think through the implications\nof unlikely “tail” events with severe consequences. Most people are skilled at pattern\ndetection, but often have trouble contemplating the consequences of events outside of our\nhistorical experience. It is important to find ways to break these strictures and think more\ncritically about scenarios that could lead to acute distress at firms. This requires us to\nhave the right tools, expertise, and supervisory approaches for a given firm and\nenvironment.\nConclusion\nThe Federal Reserve’s bank supervisory function is integral to a safe and sound\nbanking system. And just as the banking system changes, the Fed’s supervision must\nchange and adapt with it. We need to continuously explore new models of financial risk.\nWe should bring together multiple perspectives to challenge supervisory judgments and\nbuild organizational frameworks that institutionalize this practice. And we must\n\n- 12 -\nappropriately adjust supervision when we see changes at a firm or in the financial sector,\nespecially in these times of great innovation and technological change.\nBut we also must be humble about our challenges; the failure of Silicon Valley\nBank one year ago revealed our own failures. It showed that in some cases, such as when\nbanks grow rapidly or take on new risks, that supervision can lack the speed, force and\nagility required to keep up with those changes. Since that time, we have been hard at\nwork to address those issues. And while this work will take time, I am committed to\ngetting the job done properly. Supervisors around the Federal Reserve System have\nstepped up to the challenge, and I am grateful for their continued good work.\nThank you, and I’m happy to answer questions.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n3:00 a.m. EST (9:00 a.m. local time)\nDecember 1, 2023\nThe Importance of Effective Liquidity Risk Management\nRemarks by\nMichael S. Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nECB Forum on Banking Supervision\nFrankfurt, Germany\nDecember 1, 2023\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak today.1 I’m delighted to be here to\ncelebrate the retirement of Andrea Enria, my dear friend and colleague, who has done so\nmuch to strengthen the supervision and regulation of European banks throughout his\ncareer. In my remarks, I would like to provide perspective on some of the lessons learned\nfrom the banking stress experienced in the United States last spring for both banks and\ntheir supervisors. In particular, I will focus on how banks manage liquidity risk, the role\nof the central bank’s discount window lending in this process, and the importance of\nrobust liquidity planning for good times and bad.\nLast March, several large U.S. banks faced acute liquidity pressures when\nuninsured depositors looked at the banks’ balance sheets and judged that the banks would\nbe insolvent if they needed to liquidate their securities portfolios to meet potential\noutflows. The banks’ poor interest rate and liquidity risk management triggered a crisis\nof confidence in their uninsured depositors, resulting in liquidity crises at these banks. In\nshort, they faced old-fashioned bank runs, the speed of which was anything but old\nfashioned. Despite their compliance with our capital rules, these banks lacked enough\ncapital to reassure uninsured depositors that they had sufficient resources to weather this\nliquidity storm.\nIn addition to our domestic strains, Credit Suisse came under renewed pressure\nin March 2023 after a long period of liquidity pressures that had been acute since the fall\nof 2022. Of course, Credit Suisse had been a troubled bank for some time, with doubts\nabout its future viability after the Archegos and Greensill scandals had tarnished its\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard and the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nreputation. These concerns became reality when the firm was forced to announce that its\ninternal controls over financial reporting were ineffective and had been for several years.\nCredit Suisse was acquired by UBS in a deal that involved triggering of Credit Suisse’s\ncontingent convertible capital instruments, a severe dilution of shareholders, and the\nremoval of senior bank management, as well as emergency liquidity support and\nextraordinary loss sharing from the Swiss government.\nWhile there is more that regulators and supervisors can do to help to ensure\nbanks’ interest rate risk management and capital bases are sufficiently calibrated to the\nrisks of their business models, today I will focus most of my comments on liquidity risk\nmanagement and operational readiness for firms in the United States to utilize the Federal\nReserve’s discount window. This is not a new topic, as I have spoken about lessons from\nMarch and the importance of bank’s preparedness to tap Fed facilities previously.2\nToday I will revisit those themes and provide some additional observations about the\nMarch stress events, including the importance of discount window preparedness relative\nto some specific liquidity risk factors such as uninsured deposits.\nA striking feature of recent U.S. experience with bank stress was that Silicon\nValley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank struggled to cope with unprecedented deposit\noutflows arising from a loss of confidence of their uninsured depositors. While\nultimately the amount of their outflows made it not possible for these banks to continue\noperating, these banks started from a state in which they were not sufficiently equipped to\n2 Michael S. Barr, “The 2023 U.S. Treasury Market Conference” (speech at the ninth annual U.S. Treasury\nMarket Conference, New York, NY, November 16, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20231116a.htm; Michael S. Barr, “Monetary Policy\nand Financial Stability” (speech at the Forecasters Club of New York, New York, NY, October 2, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20231002a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nmanage liquidity risk—including by being adequately prepared to tap the Federal\nReserve’s discount window. Banks that experienced spillovers during this period also\nstruggled with insufficiently robust liquidity risk management. It is crucial that banks\nhave a diversified range of liquidity options that they are able to access in a variety of\nconditions. And in the case of banks that are eligible to borrow from the Federal\nReserve, discount window borrowing should be an important part of this mix.\nThere are a few major reasons for this conclusion. First, the discount window\nprovides funding at a predictable interest rate, namely the primary credit rate, which does\nnot fluctuate daily, unlike interest rates on private sector liquidity sources. More\nspecifically, the discount window is always available as a standing facility, with the\nprimary credit rate currently set at the top of the federal funds rate target range. This\nrate—along with that of the standing repo facility (SRF), also set at this level—should\nserve as a backstop rate to short-term market interest rates and provide eligible firms with\ncertainty about the highest rate they will face to gain liquidity against eligible assets at\nany given time. The discount window provides ready access to funding that can help\nbanks manage their liquidity risks. The ability to access funding at a predictable rate\nthrough the discount window should figure importantly into banks’ liquidity risk\nmanagement plans under a range of scenarios.\nThe discount window is also an important tool for monetary policy. The primary\ncredit rate, set at the top of the target range, is a component for how we can achieve rate\ncontrol under a range of conditions. To achieve our monetary policy aims, the discount\nwindow needs to be readily usable: if banks do not feel free to use the discount window\nwhen private sources of funding are more expensive, the discount window will not be an\n\n- 4 -\neffective part of our monetary policy implementation toolkit. Banks have previously said\nthat they are afraid of receiving negative feedback from their supervisors in the event that\ntheir sole grounds for tapping the discount window is that it is the most convenient or\ncheapest form of funding immediately available to them. In light of this, we at the\nFederal Reserve have been underlining the point to banks, supervisors, analysts, rating\nagencies, other market observers, and the public, through numerous channels, that using\nthe discount window is not an action to be viewed negatively. Banks need to be ready\nand willing to use the discount window in good times and bad.\nThe discount window is also an important tool of financial stability, because the\nFederal Reserve can provide liquidity in an array of circumstances, including those when\nother sources are impaired. Liquidity provision through the discount window is not\nreliant on the smooth functioning of private-sector funding markets. This is in contrast to\nmost other options available to banks, including access to the Federal Home Loan Banks\n(FHLBs). Moreover, banks that have pre-pledged collateral at the discount window and\ntested its operations are not dependent on other market infrastructure and payments\nsystems to borrow against this collateral.3 These features mean that discount window\npreparedness provides additional diversification benefits that can meaningfully enhance\neffective liquidity risk management.\n3 One significant example of the importance of discount window availability when critical infrastructure\nbecame unavailable includes the experience during September 11, 2001. See James J. McAndrews and\nSimon M. Potter, “Liquidity Effects of the Events of September 11, 2001,” Economic Policy Review, vol. 8\n(November 2002): 59–79,\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/02v08n2/0211mcanpdf.pdf. The 2003 East\ncoast blackout was another example. See Mark Carlson and Jonathan D. Rose, “Stigma and the Discount\nWindow,” FEDS Notes, December 19, 2017, https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-\nnotes/stigma-and-the-discount-window-20171219.html.\n\n- 5 -\nThe experience of last March warrants reviewing to gain better insights into how\nwell banks are positioned to borrow through the discount window. In doing so, I will\ndiscuss some observations from March in greater depth and note some potential lessons\nto be drawn from that experience. I will also briefly note some observations about our\nwork on cross-border collaboration with our international counterparts.\nLessons Learned: Uninsured Deposits and the Speed of Deposit Loss\nThe speed of the bank runs in the spring of 2023 was unprecedented. The failure\nof Washington Mutual in 2008, the largest bank failure seen in the United States before\nthis year, was the culmination of stresses that occurred over several weeks. The deposit\nlosses experienced by SVB were much greater in both relative and absolute terms, and\nthey occurred in less than 24 hours.4 Digital banking and social media were factors in the\nrapid escalation of SVB’s problems, though they were not the underlying source of\nvulnerability. SVB’s concentrated and highly networked depositor base of venture\ncapital firms, portfolio companies, tech and crypto companies, and high-net-worth\nindividuals communicated quickly with one another and, in effect, coordinated the\nmassive and rapid run.5 And more fundamentally, as I said, SVB failed because of a\n4 Jonathan Rose, “Understanding the Speed and Size of Bank Runs in Historical Comparison,” Economic\nSynopses 2023, No. 12 (St. Louis: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, May 26, 2023),\nhttps://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2023/05/26/understanding-the-speed-and-\nsize-of-bank-runs-in-historical-comparison.\n5 As noted in my Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank, on\nMarch 9, Silicon Valley Bank lost over $40 billion in deposits, and management expected to lose over $100\nbillion more on March 10. This deposit outflow represented roughly 85 percent of the bank’s deposit base.\nBy comparison, estimates suggest that the failure of Wachovia in 2008 included about $10 billion in\noutflows over 8 days, while the failure of Washington Mutual in 2008 included $19 billion over 16 days.\nSee page 4 of the report. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Review of the Federal\nReserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank (Washington: Board of Governors, April\n2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2023-April-SVB-Evolution-of-Silicon-Valley-\nBank.htm.\n\n- 6 -\ntextbook case of mismanagement of interest rate and liquidity risk. This mismanagement\nmade depositors lose confidence in the bank’s solvency, so they ran.\nThe March stress also showed that contagion is possible among large regional\nbanking organizations whose size and scope are well below those of banks that have been\ndesignated as globally systemically important. Liquidity stress at SVB quickly led other\nbanks that were perceived to have weaknesses to experience outflows as well.6 Those\nbanks that came under greater pressure tended to have large unrealized losses in their\nsecurities portfolios, to rely heavily on uninsured deposits, and to have a deposit and\nclient base focused on the technology and crypto sectors, venture capital, or high-net-\nworth clients. But the contagion extended beyond such banks and threatened to cause\ndisruption more broadly to regional and community banks with traditional business\nmodels and to the banking system as a whole. The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC), and the U.S. Department of the Treasury stepped in\nquickly to stop that contagion, and the strategy worked: deposit flows returned to normal,\nand stress in the banking system slowly abated.\nThis experience has changed everyone’s perception of the possible speed of bank\nruns. What occurred in two or three weeks or, in some cases, many months in previous\nepisodes may, in the modern era, now occur in hours. These issues are top of mind as we\nreview and consider future adjustments to the way in which we should supervise and\nregulate liquidity risk.\n6 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (Washington: Board of\nGovernors, May 2023), section 4, https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2023-may-financial-\nstability-report-funding-risks.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nMonetization Issues\nWe also saw during this period that firms were not as well positioned to monetize\n(that is, to borrow against or be ready to sell) their assets as they should have been. Many\nunderestimated the size and speed with which liquidity needs could appear. Banks of all\nsizes are expected to maintain contingency funding plans (CFPs) to meet potential\nstressed liquidity outflows.7 In response to the Global Financial Crisis, regulators also\nnow require large banks to maintain a multi-week buffer of high-quality liquid assets\n(HQLA) that can be easily converted to reserves even during times of stress.8\nThese HQLA buffers are essential to ensuring funding resilience at large firms.\nThe March stress episode, however, highlighted the fact that, in practice, there can be\noperational impediments to a bank’s ability to monetize its liquidity buffers in large\nvolumes and in a rapid time frame in acute stress. In a world in which a bank run took\nplace over a matter of weeks, it was reasonable to assume that a sufficient volume of the\nmost liquid securities could be monetized to meet the demand for reserves associated\nwith deposit withdrawals.\nBut times have changed, and I see several flaws in our previous assumptions.\nFirst, it may be difficult for a firm to conduct significant asset sales in a short time frame\nwithout becoming the subject of adverse attention or, if the firm is large, without\naffecting market prices with fire sale effects and potentially leading to broader contagion.\n7 12 C.F.R. § 252.34(f) and 12 C.F.R. § 252.156(e) require that banking organizations with more than $100\nbillion in total assets develop CFPs and demonstrate operational readiness to implement them. The\n“Interagency Policy Statement on Funding and Liquidity Risk Management” establishes an expectation that\nall firms develop CFPs and periodically test their ability to operationalize elements of these plans. See\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Interagency Policy Statement on Funding and\nLiquidity Risk Management,” SR letter 10-6 (March 17, 2010),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/2010/sr1006a1.pdf.\n8 12 C.F.R. § 249.22(a) Operational requirements for eligible HQLA.\n\n- 8 -\nSecond, the March stress underlined the possibility that private repo markets may not be\na viable financing channel for banks that need to rapidly ramp up access, especially for\nbanks that may not regularly transact in these markets, even if such repo markets can be a\nviable source of liquidity for banks that regularly tap such markets and have more gradual\nfunding stresses. Sharp shifts in calls on private repo market capacity, particularly by\nfirms experiencing stress, may not be easily met.\nIn addition, it proved especially difficult to monetize assets in those cases in\nwhich firms held substantial amounts of longer-dated securities, with significant amounts\nof unrealized losses, as we saw in the experience of SVB. The experience showed that\nwhen these securities are sold and losses are realized, it understandably may send a\nnegative signal to the market about the bank’s viability. A compounding factor in these\nsituations is that if the securities that a bank needs to sell are in held-to-maturity\nportfolios, the sales under acute stress can have a severe effect on the bank’s balance\nsheet, as I discussed in a previous speech.9\nDiscount Window Preparedness for Times of Stress\nWhile, as discussed, the discount window provides ready access to funding to\nhelp banks manage liquidity risks in normal conditions, it is also incredibly important that\nit be available to banks dealing with idiosyncratic or market-wide stress events. When\nother forms of funding or related market infrastructure are not immediately available,\nreadiness to borrow via the discount window—including with prepositioned collateral—\nis even more crucial. In contrast to private-sector liquidity sources, the Fed can provide\n9 Speech by Vice Chair for Supervision Michael S. Barr, “The 2023 U.S. Treasury Market Conference”\n(November 16, 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20231116a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nimmediate liquidity against a wide range of collateral to one or a number of depository\ninstitutions simultaneously. This function provides additional time for a more orderly\nmonetization. An update on contingent liquidity readiness that the bank regulatory\nagencies published in July also makes clear that all of the agencies understand the\nimportance of a bank’s readiness to make use of the discount window.10\nThe banks that failed because of the stress event that began in March had access\nto, and utilized, the Federal Reserve’s discount window, and their failures were the result\nnot of lack of access to the discount window but of basic mismanagement of interest rate\nand liquidity risk that left them effectively insolvent in the eyes of uninsured depositors\nand unable to stem bank runs. That said, they also faced internal operational challenges\nin quickly identifying and moving collateral that would have provided them additional\nborrowing capacity at the discount window. While this additional borrowing capacity\nwould not have ultimately saved these banks given the speed and the severity of their\ndeposit outflows, the lessons from managing their stress events can help others facing\nless acute events. Greater operational readiness can provide for greater optionality when\na bank hits a bout of turbulence. Ready access to sufficient liquidity provides breathing\nroom for a bank to determine and execute its path forward.\nThere are two key aspects of discount window readiness: preparedness to access\nthe discount window and prepositioning adequate amounts of collateral. In terms of\npreparedness, the majority of banks that are eligible to borrow from the discount window\n10 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National\nCredit Union Administration, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, “Agencies Update Guidance\non Liquidity Risks and Contingency Planning,” press release, July 28, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230728a.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nhave the legal agreements in place. This is the first step. However, many of these banks\nhad not recently tested their discount window access prior to the stress event. Engaging\nin testing through actual transactions at regular intervals is a key component of\noperational readiness. In the case of some banks, the amount of collateral prepositioned\nwas also a tiny fraction of potentially flight-prone liabilities going into the stress event.\nThis lack of pre-pledging is a concern for several reasons, including that certain collateral\ntypes can require more time to pledge. Less liquid collateral can take longer to be\nassessed and valued at the discount window, meaning that banks should not expect they\ncan gain immediate liquidity against these assets. But these are the very assets that would\nbe best pledged to the discount window, so that more liquid assets are held for other uses.\nThe Intersection of Discount Window Readiness and Existing Liquidity Regulations\nThe existing standards that require banks to hold HQLA buffers for self-\ninsurance are an essential element of the regulatory framework. Requirements applying\nto large banks, like the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio, have\nmeaningfully increased the resiliency of the banking system to liquidity stress and\npositioned large banks to deal better with a 30-day stress period. This type of self-\ninsurance is critical to bank resilience and to the robustness of the financial system;\nhowever, these requirements may not, on their own, be sufficient to stem a rapid run.\nThe speed of bank runs and the impediments to rapidly raising liquidity in private\nmarkets that may be needed in hours rather than days suggest it may be necessary to\nreexamine our requirements, including with respect to self-insurance standards and to\ndiscount window preparedness. The lessons from March also indicate that some forms of\n\n- 11 -\ndeposits, such as those from venture capital firms, high-net-worth individuals, crypto\nfirms, and others, may be more prone to faster runs than previously assumed.\nAs I have emphasized today, and in two previous speeches, the discount window\nis a tool that banks can and should use to help them respond to a wide array of conditions\nand provide additional time for orderly monetization of liquidity buffers in private\nmarkets, but only if banks are prepared to use it. Given these dynamics, we are currently\nstudying what the lessons from March, and the variability in discount window\npreparedness across eligible banks, mean for the safety and soundness of individual\nbanks and for the stability of the financial system more broadly. Since March, some\nbanks have been assessing their operational readiness to tap the discount window,\nparticularly relative to their runnable liabilities, such as uninsured deposits, and have\nbeen taking measures to test and pre-pledge assets where possible. Banks have also been\nreassessing their assumptions on the liquidity value of hold-to-maturity securities, given\nthe experiences of March.\nInternational Coordination and Cooperation\nLet me wrap up by sharing some thoughts with you on international spillovers to\nliquidity stress events. Episodes of financial stress have, in some instances, gone hand in\nhand with stress in U.S. dollar funding markets. Foreign banks, which have more limited\naccess to dollar deposits than U.S. banks and rely more heavily on dollar wholesale\nfunding for their operations, are particularly vulnerable to dollar liquidity strains. Of\ncourse, these banks have an important role in providing credit to the U.S. economy, and\nstrains that they experience can affect U.S. businesses and households. In addition, dollar\n\n- 12 -\nfunding markets are global, and so strains in one segment can have broader repercussions\nfor market functioning.\nForeign banks that have branches in the United States have access to the discount\nwindow. Outside the United States, some of these firms also have access to dollar\nliquidity from their own central banks. The Federal Reserve maintains swap lines with\nforeign central banks and also maintains the Foreign and International Monetary\nAuthorities (FIMA) repo facility to provide dollar liquidity to foreign official\ncounterparts. These facilities have proven effective in damping pressures in U.S. dollar\nfunding markets when adverse pressures have emerged, pressures that could exacerbate\nstrains in broader U.S. domestic financial markets. Indeed, during the Global Financial\nCrisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, the peak outstanding amounts for the swap lines\nwere a little above and a little below $500 billion, respectively, making them among the\nmost used of our liquidity facilities. As with all backstop facilities, however, it is not just\ntheir use that helps the smooth functioning of markets, but banks and central banks\nknowing that liquidity will be available when needed that helps to prevent liquidity\nhoarding and precautionary sales that can contribute to stresses. In part for this reason,\nthe Federal Open Market Committee decided to make the swap lines and FIMA repo\nstanding facilities, after initially setting the operations up only as temporary.11\n11 For additional information please see the following: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\n“Federal Reserve and Other Central Banks Convert Temporary Bilateral Liquidity Swap Arrangements to\nStanding Arrangements,” press release, October 31, 2013,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20131031a.htm; Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System, “Statement Regarding Repurchase Agreement,” press release, July 28, 2021,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728b.htm.\n\n- 13 -\nThese observations underscore the importance of our ongoing communication\nand collaboration with our counterparts—both other central banks and regulatory\nauthorities—in order to ensure that we have a comprehensive understanding of evolving\nfinancial market dynamics and cross-border linkages that can affect our respective\nfinancial markets and financial institutions and also so that we can work to address gaps\nbefore pressures emerge. In my experience, these cross-border collaborations have been\nessential in enhancing the resilience of individual banks and the robustness of the\nfinancial system. I am grateful to my colleagues for their collaboration, and again wish\nto express my admiration for Andreas Enria on his retirement.\nThank you.",

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2025 Fall New Markets Tax Credit Conference\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nOctober 23, 2025\n\nThank you for asking me to be part of this celebration of 25 years of the New\nMarkets Tax Credit (NMTC) and also the historic achievement of its permanent\nextension.1 I consider the credit a great achievement for communities all across the\nUnited States. I’m honored to be here with you celebrating its legacy of bringing jobs\nand opportunity to lower-income communities—a lasting impact that benefits all\nAmericans.\nBefore I talk about the NMTC itself, let’s go back and remember some history of\nhow it came about. In the 1990s, there was a lot of partisan conflict about federal anti-\npoverty programs. President Clinton believed there should be some common ground on\nsome ways to fight poverty, and the New Markets Initiative was one of them. At the\ntime, America was trying to create jobs by opening up markets abroad for U.S. exporters,\nand what became the NMTC was dedicated to the idea that there were also promising\nnew markets to invest in right here at home, in underinvested communities.\nI still remember fondly one trip I took with the President to highlight the\npossibilities for investment in underserved communities. At one stop in Clarksdale,\nMississippi, in a sweltering furniture factory we heard from entrepreneurs looking for\nnew capital, from community development financial institutions looking for new sources\nof capital to help entrepreneurs, and from community lenders looking to grow their local\neconomy. Their enthusiasm was infectious.\nOne reason the NMTC has succeeded is that, from the beginning, it had very\nbroad support. Lower-income communities in both rural and urban areas had the vision\nto support economic development but lacked the investment. The comprehensive\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\ngeographical reach helped the NMTC to have broad bipartisan support. Republicans and\nDemocrats both supported using the tax code to create economic incentives, especially\nthose that incentivize investment intended to create jobs. When the bill passed, a\nRepublican lawmaker who voted for it called the NMTC “the most effective anti-poverty\npackage coming out the federal government…in a generation.”2 That person was then\nRepresentative Jim Talent, who is with us today. While the NMTC quickly proved\neffective at attracting investment to communities, its biggest challenge was being created\nas a temporary program—requiring a major effort every few years to secure\nreauthorization. But now, the NMTC has been permanently enacted. I believe that will\nusher in a new era of stability for the NMTC and thus growth for investments in low-\nincome communities.\nA second reason for the NMTC’s support, I believe, was its design as a public–\nprivate partnership. Communities are more than the sum of their different parts. They\nare the product of all these parts working together, and the key to successful community\ndevelopment is designing programs that involve and mobilize every part of a community.\nIn my experience, the backbone of many successful community development initiatives is\nthe combination of government, groups representing the people of the community, and\nthe businesses that provide most of the jobs and livelihoods in any community. When\neveryone has a stake in the outcome, that is when good things start happening.\nThe NMTC is such a public–private partnership. It starts from the ground up—\nlocal community development groups and business leaders with a history of commitment\n2 T. Draut, D. Callahan, D. and C. Hawkes, Crossing Divides: New Common Ground on Poverty and\nEconomic Security (New York: Demos, 2002), 34,\nhttps://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/Crossing_Divides.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nto the community are the spur. To work effectively in so many different places with such\na broad range of conditions and needs, it has to be a program that really works.\nThe NMTC succeeds because it is premised on the conviction that there are real\ninvestment opportunities in lower-income communities. The belief that there are smart,\nhard-working, and capable people eager to support a new or expanded enterprise. That\nthere is affordable real estate, in some cases commercial or industrial buildings, and\nextensive infrastructure that have been underutilized. The conviction that there are\ncommunities that will unite to support new businesses as markets themselves for the\ngoods and services these businesses provide.\nThe 39 percent tax incentive at the heart of the NMTC, paid out over seven years,\nplays a critical role in attracting investors to these advantages. It’s often the critical\nfactor that makes those investments work. The NMTC is the foot in the door for\ncommunities trying to get the attention of investors who can start or expand their\nbusinesses anywhere. It is the extra incentive that is needed for investors to look under\nthe hood and recognize all the good reasons why a particular community would be a great\nplace to do business. The NMTC unlocks the undercounted, underappreciated potential\nof so many communities. That’s good for investors, good for communities, and good for\nthe U.S. economy. And let me say also—it is just good. Good for an America that\nbelieves in opportunity and everyone living up to their potential.\nI like to think about what each of those businesses means to the community to\nwhich it was brought by the NMTC. Anyone who has done the hard work of economic\ndevelopment in lower-income communities knows that getting such an investment is a\nhuge achievement. It makes communities stand out and says to others that maybe this\n\n- 4 -\nwould be a good place for more investment. I also like to think about what one of those\nmillion jobs the NMTC helped to create can mean to the individual who gets it and to\ntheir family. Maybe learning a new skill, an entirely new occupation, or even getting a\nsecond chance to use skills they already have that perhaps haven’t been demanded lately\nin the community. Such an opportunity can be life changing.\nOne person whose life was changed by the NMTC and our broader work on\ncommunity development at the Treasury Department was me. I didn’t know exactly what\nI was going to do when I went to work for Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin in 1995. But\nthey needed someone to help the Treasury empower local communities, and I was thrilled\nto say yes. And my work over the next six years really did change my life. In every job I\nhave ever had since, inside and outside government, community development has played\na significant role. As a professor and dean at the University of Michigan, I wrote about\ncommunity development and consumer protection and helped launch an initiative to help\nentrepreneurs in Detroit. When I returned to Washington to help deal with the effects of\nthe Great Financial Crisis, I never forgot, for a moment, how the greatest harm from that\ncatastrophe was inflicted on lower-income families and their communities. When\nCongress was writing the Dodd-Frank Act, I pushed hard to ensure it would create new\nprotections for lower- and middle-income borrowers, and I wrote a book about the\ntenuous finances of lower-income people with no financial slack trying to make their way\nin the economy.\nThe Federal Reserve System, which includes our 12 regional Reserve Banks, has\na community development mission, and I recently took over responsibility for that\nfunction on behalf of the Fed’s Board of Governors. The Fed’s responsibilities in\n\n- 5 -\npromoting a healthy economy and strong and stable financial system require that we\nmonitor conditions throughout the United States, and that includes in low-income\ncommunities. It has given me the opportunity to connect with community leaders and\ncommunity development groups all across the country, hear about their challenges, and\nalso their hopes and plans for the future.\nThis work has reminded me again that America really is its communities and that\ncommunity development is essential to a thriving and prosperous America. Those are\ngoals that the New Markets Tax Credit has helped advance for a quarter-century, and I\nam very pleased that this conference can mark the beginning of another 25 years of the\nNMTC bringing new investment and new opportunity to communities.\nThank you.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nAmerican Enterprise Institute\nWashington, DC\nDecember 1, 2022\n\nIn my first speech as Vice Chair for Supervision in September, I said that the\nFederal Reserve Board would soon engage in a holistic review of capital standards. My\nargument, then and now, is that our review of regulatory policy must be a periodic feature\nof bank oversight. Banking and the financial system continuously evolve, and regulation\nmust adapt to address emerging risks. Bank capital is strong, but in doing our review, we\nshould and are being humble about our ability—or that of bank managers—to predict\nhow a future financial crisis might unfold, how losses might be incurred, and what the\neffect might be on the financial system and our broader economy. That humility, that\nskepticism, will serve us well in crafting a capital framework that is enduring and\neffective. It will help make sure that we do not lose the hard-fought gains in resilience\nover the past decade and that we prepare for the future.\nThat review is still underway, and I have no firm conclusions to announce today.\nRather, I thought it would be helpful at this early stage to offer my views on capital\nregulation and the role that capital standards play in helping to advance the safety and\nsoundness of banks and the stability of the financial system.1\nBy “holistic,” I mean not looking only at each of the individual parts of capital\nstandards, but also at how those parts may interact with each other—as well as other\nregulatory requirements—and what their cumulative effect is on safety and soundness\nand risks to the financial system. This is not an easy task, because finance is a complex\nsystem. And to make the task even harder, we are looking not only at how capital\nstandards are working today, but also how they may work in the future, when conditions\nare different.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not those of the Board of Governors or any of my fellow\nBoard colleagues.\n\n- 2 -\nAs I mentioned, we are approaching the task with humility—not with the illusion\nthat there is an immutable capital framework to be discovered, but rather, with the\nawareness that revisions we conceive of today will reflect our current understanding and\nwill inevitably require updating as our understanding evolves.\nWhy Do Banks Have Capital?\nLet me start by explaining why banks have capital. Banks play a critical role in\nthe economy by connecting those seeking to borrow with those seeking to save. 2 A bank\nlends to its customers, including individuals and businesses, based on its assessment of\nthe customer’s creditworthiness. A bank’s depositors benefit from having bank accounts\nthat allow them to easily make payments to others and to maintain a balance of money in\na safe and liquid form. A healthy banking sector is central to a healthy economy.\nThe nature of banking, however, along with the interconnectedness of the\nfinancial system, can pose vulnerabilities. Even if a bank is fundamentally sound, it can\nsuddenly be threatened with failure if its customers lose confidence and withdraw\ndeposits.3 This inherent vulnerability can pose risks to the entire economy.\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, before the creation of the Federal Reserve\nand the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), banking panics were frequent and\ncostly to the economy.4 Based on this experience—and similar experiences around the\nglobe—many countries employ deposit insurance and other forms of a safety net to\n2 Kashyap, Rajan and Stein (2002) describe the dual role that banks play in the economy, providing\nliquidity to both households and businesses. Fama (1985) notes that banks are special on both the asset and\nliability side of the bank’s balance sheet.\n3 See the bank run literature developed by Diamond and Dybvig (1983) and others.\n4 Jalil (2015) concludes that “major banking panics either caused or amplified nearly half of all business\ncycle downturns between 1825 and 1914.” Bernanke (1983) shows that bank failures did economic harm\nduring the Great Depression.\n\n- 3 -\nprotect depositors and banks.5 But offering this protection, shielding depositors and\nbanks from risk, can have the perverse effect of encouraging risk-taking, creating what is\ncalled “moral hazard.” Supervision and regulation—including capital regulation—\nprovides a critical counterbalance, to ensure that banks, not the taxpayers, internalize the\ncosts to society of that risk-taking.\nThe impact of inadequate supervision and regulation was starkly revealed in the\nGlobal Financial Crisis, as banks and their functional substitutes in the nonbank sector\nborrowed too much to fund their operations.6 While nearly all were “adequately\ncapitalized” in theory, many were undercapitalized in practice, since their capital levels\ndid not reflect future losses that would severely weaken their capital positions. And\nbanks lacked appropriate controls and systems to measure and manage their risks.\nThat crisis also exposed the extent to which banks and broader financial system\nhad become reliant on short-term wholesale funding and prone to destabilizing\ndynamics.7 The sudden shutdown of short-term wholesale funding posed severe liquidity\n5 According to the World Bank, 112 countries had explicit deposit insurance plans in 2013, up from 84\ncountries in 2003. http://blogs.worldbank.org/allaboutfinance/deposit-insurance-database-newly-updated.\nFurthermore, other elements of a government safety net for banks often include measures to support a well-\nfunctioning payments system and a collateralized lender of last resort facility.\n6 For another example, see the widespread failures of savings and loan institutions in the United States in\nthe 1980s, Kane (1989). High leverage and lax supervision were key contributors to this crisis.\n7 Among other things, in the period leading up to the financial crisis, commercial and investment banks, as\nwell as the government-sponsored enterprises, securitized a broad range of assets, including risky\nmortgages. This activity was largely funded by short-term wholesale funding, including overnight repo,\nprovided by both banks and nonbank participants, including money market mutual funds and other\ninstitutional investors. These funding sources quickly pulled back when investors began to question the\nvalue of the underlying assets. This activity was, in part, driven by regulatory arbitrage. Banks that\nsecuritized assets benefitted from lower risk weights, even if they did not transfer the risk of those assets.\nSee Acharya, Schnabl, and Suarez (2013).\n\n- 4 -\nchallenges to large financial intermediaries, both banks and nonbanks, and caused\nsignificant dislocations in financial markets.8\nThe cost to society was enormous, with widespread devastation to households and\nbusinesses. Even with an unprecedentedly large response by government, six million\nindividuals and families lost their homes to foreclosure. The crisis brought on the worst\nand longest recession since the Great Depression. It took six years for employment to\nrecover, during which long-term unemployment ran for long periods at a record high, and\nmore than 10 million people fell into poverty. The crisis left scars on families and\nbusinesses that are evident even today, and it was in part driven by imprudent risk taking\nby banks and nonbank financial institutions. This experience prompted the United States\nand other jurisdictions to revisit how supervision and regulation, including capital\nregulation, could have better contained that risk in both the bank and nonbank sectors.\nThat is why capital levels today are strong. While we have learned from and adapted to\nthe lessons from the Global Financial Crisis, this experience underscores the need for\nhumility and continued vigilance about the risks we may not fully appreciate today.\nWhat Bank Capital Is and Isn’t\nCapital regulation—requiring a bank to operate with what is deemed to be an\nadequate level of equity based on its asset size and its risks—is a useful tool to strengthen\nthe incentives for banks to lend safely and prudently.\nFirst, I’ll begin with what capital is—essentially shareholder equity in the bank.\nPeople sometimes use the shorthand of banks “holding capital” when speaking of capital\n8 See Gorton and Metrick (2012) for a discussion of the role of repo markets during the crisis; He and\nXiong (2012) for a theoretical treatment of the risks posed by short-term wholesale funding; and Barr\n(2012) and Duffie (2019) for retrospectives.\n\n- 5 -\nrequirements; however, it’s helpful to remember that capital is not an asset to be held,\nreserves to be set aside, or money in a vault; rather, it is the way, along with debt, that\nbanks fund loans and other assets. Without adequate capital, banks can’t lend. Higher\nlevels of capital mean that a bank’s managers and shareholders have more “skin in the\ngame”—and have incentives to prudently manage their risks—because they bear more of\nthe risk of the bank’s activities.\nNext, let me speak to how capital and debt work together to fund a firm’s\noperations. In theory, companies should be indifferent to the mix of equity and debt they\nuse to fund themselves, since the creditors of a safer firm will lend to it at lower rates and\nshareholders of a safer firm will accept a lower return on their investment.9 That may not\nfully hold for banks because insured depositors are made risk-insensitive through deposit\ninsurance and other creditors may provide lower cost funding if they believe the\ngovernment may bail out banks in distress.10 Forcing banks to fund more of their\nactivities with equity, instead of debt, could raise the private costs of funding to the bank,\nand cause banks to pass those higher costs of credit to consumers. These considerations\nmust be balanced against the public benefits of higher capital.\nEmpirical research supports the social benefits of strong capital requirements at\nbanks, particularly when economic conditions weaken. While poorly capitalized banks\nmay be forced to shrink during bad times, better capitalized banks have the capacity to\nsupport the economy by continuing to lend to households and businesses through\n9 See Modigliani and Miller (1958).\n10 See Stern and Feldman (2004).\n\n- 6 -\nstressful conditions.11 And to the extent bank capital reduces the frequency or severity of\nfinancial crises, the public is much better off with strong capital.12\nLast, the highest standards should apply to the highest risk firms. Larger, more\ncomplex banks pose the greatest risk and impose greater costs on society when they fail.\nHigher capital requirements help to ensure that larger, more complex banks internalize\nthis greater risk and counterbalance the greater costs to society by making these firms\nmore resilient. Further, matching higher capital standards with higher risk appropriately\nlimits the regulatory burden on smaller, less complex banks whose activities pose less\nrisk to the financial system. This helps to promote a diverse banking sector that provides\nconsumers greater choice and access to banking services.\nInteractions with the Nonbank Sector\nBanks, of course, are part of a broader financial system. The share of credit\nintermediated outside of banks has grown considerably over the past 40 years. In fact,\nnonbank financial intermediaries, broadly defined, fund nearly 60 percent of the credit to\nthe U.S. economy today as compared to approximately 30 percent in 1980.13 Nonbank\nfinancial firms include money market funds, the insurance sector, the government-\nsponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank\nsystem), hedge funds and other investment vehicles, and still other nonbank lenders.\n11 See Bernanke, Lown, and Friedman (1991); Hancock and Wilcox (1993, 1994); Berrospide and Edge\n(2010); Carlson, Shan, and Warusawitharana (2013), and Karmakar and Mok (2015) for papers that\ndocument this relationship for the United States and Košak, Li, Lončarski, and Marinč (2015) and\nGambacorta and Shin (2018) for papers that document this relationship based on cross-country bank-level\nstudies. See also Rice and Rose (2016); Ramcharan et al. (2016); Aiyar, Calomiris, and Wieladek (2014);\nPeek and Rosengren (1997) and Gibson (1995).\n12 See Basel Committee (2010) for an assessment of the long-term economic impact of stronger capital\nrequirements.\n13 Financial Accounts of the United States.\n\n- 7 -\nThere are lots of reasons for these trends, including technological advancements,\nfinancial innovation, regulatory arbitrage, and quirks of history. Bank capital\nrequirements, combined with the lack of strong or sometimes any capital requirements in\nthe nonbank sector, are part of that.14 We should monitor the migration of activities from\nbanks to the nonbank sector carefully, but we shouldn’t lower bank capital requirements\nin a race to the bottom. In times of stress, banks serve as central sources of strength to\nthe economy, and they need capital to do so.\nWe need to worry, a lot, about nonbank risks to financial stability. During the\nGlobal Financial Crisis, many nonbank financial firms had woefully inadequate capital\nand liquidity, engaged in high-risk activities, and were faced with devastating runs that\ncrushed the financial system and caused enormous harm to households and businesses.\nThe collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, the failure of Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac, the implosion of the insurance conglomerate AIG, and many others, laid\nbare the weakness of nonbank intermediation, and the need to regulate risks outside the\nbanking system.15 Many of those risks remain today. In far too many cases, nonbanks\nrely on funding sources that are prone to runs and do not maintain sufficient capital to\ninternalize their risks to society.\nThe answer, however, is not lower capital requirements for banks, but more\nattention to those very risks. Further, as stress in nonbank financial markets is often\n14 See Begenau and Landvoigt (2022); Darst, Refayet, and Vardoulakis (2020); Dempsey (2020); and\nPlantin (2015).\n15 Other examples include money market funds that either broke the buck, froze withdrawals, or received a\ngovernment bailout; the failure of the monoline financial guarantors; the default of AAA-rated\nsecuritization vehicles; and asset-backed commercial paper programs that suffered a run and were unable to\nroll over their debt.\n\n- 8 -\ntransmitted to the banking system, both directly and indirectly, it is critical that banks\nhave enough capital to remain resilient to those stresses.\nCalibration of Bank Capital Requirements\nOne of the threshold questions is how should we think about calibrating bank\ncapital to a socially optimal level? There is not an easy answer to that question. In my\nmind, as I said at the outset, it starts with humility. Bank capital should be sufficient to\nenable the bank to absorb unexpected losses and continue operations through severely\nstressful but plausible events. Yet translating that principle into a quantum of capital\ninvolves an estimate of what future risks will emerge and what losses banks will suffer.\nI’m skeptical that regulators—or bank managers—know the answers to these questions.\nDespite complex regulatory risk-weights, or simple leverage ratios, or the internal models\nused by banks, at bottom bank capital ought to be calibrated based on that humility, that\nskepticism. Capital provides a cushion against unexpected risks and unforeseen losses,\nthose a humble and skeptical person might be careful to not try to predict with too much\nprecision. Those a humble and skeptical person might guard against.\nThat is the spirit in which I am approaching the Fed’s holistic review of capital\nstandards. There is a body of empirical and theoretical research on optimal capital, which\nattempts to determine the level of capital that equalizes the marginal benefits of capital\nwith the marginal costs. While the estimates vary widely, and are highly contingent on\nthe assumptions made, the current U.S. requirements are toward the low end of the range\ndescribed in most of the research literature.16 International comparisons also suggest\n16 Several recent papers present quantitative, macroeconomic models of optimal bank capital regulation,\nincluding Begenau (2020); Begenau and Landvoigt (2022); Clerc et al. (2015); Elenev, Landvoigt, and\nVan Nieuwerburgh (2021); Martinez-Miera and Suarez (2014); Nguyen (2015); and Van den Heuvel\n\n- 9 -\nstrong capital requirements support banks and the U.S. economy. We have strong capital\nlevels today, and generally higher bank capital requirements in the United States after the\nDodd-Frank Act have corresponded with healthy economic growth and have supported\nthe competitiveness of U.S. firms in the global economy.17\nFinally, some banks have asserted that the resilience of the banking system in the\npandemic suggests that bank capital is already high enough. There were some positive\nsigns from a Federal Reserve-conducted sensitivity analysis and subsequent stress test.18\nBanks did their part and lent strongly, based on their strong capital positions and\nwidespread government support. But we didn’t get a real test of resilience because\nCongress, the President, and the Federal Reserve rightly stepped in with massive\nassistance to avert an economic disaster. Furthermore, I’d observe that the recent\nexperience of the pandemic suggests that large, unexpected shocks can occur with little\nnotice. Our inability to predict such events would argue for a higher overall capital level\nthan one based solely on historical experience. So let me return to where I began on this\ntopic: figuring out the right level of capital requires one to be humble and skeptical.\nComponents of Bank Capital Requirements\nLet’s turn to the design of capital requirements. U.S. capital rules contain many\nindividual elements, including risk-based requirements, leverage standards, stress testing,\nand long-term debt requirements for the largest banks.\n(2008). Another strand of the literature builds on the long-term economic impact assessment study by the\nBasel Committee (2010), including Miles et al. (2013) and Firestone et al. (2019).\n17 See, for instance, World Economic Outlook, chapter 2, box 2.3 (October 2018).\n18 https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2020-sensitivity-analysis-20200625.pdf\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2020-dec-stress-test-results-20201218.pdf\n\n- 10 -\nThe risk-based capital requirement is premised on the fact that a firm is likely to\nexperience higher losses from its riskier activities; thus, sizing capital requirements based\non risk will better estimate a firm’s capital needs so that it internalizes the risks of its\nactivities. The Basel III capital reforms, as implemented in the United States, aimed to\naddress many of the shortcomings identified during the Global Financial Crisis. The\ninternational standards were developed to enhance the quantity and quality of regulatory\ncapital, better reflect risks of banks’ activities, impose a heightened capital requirement\non global systemically important firms, and reduce procyclicality and promote\ncountercyclical buffers,19 among others. The last set of comprehensive adjustments to\nthe Basel III Accord, now under consideration in the United States, would further\nstrengthen capital rules by reducing reliance on internal bank models and better reflect\nrisks from a bank’s trading book and operational risks. I am working closely with my\ncounterparts at the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on the U.S.\nversion of the Basel III endgame reforms. Any rule changes that might be proposed in\ncapital standards would be deliberate, adopted through the notice and comment process\nso that we have the benefit of public perspectives, and implemented with appropriate\ntransition periods to achieve the long-term goal of improving the capital regulation.\nRisk-based capital requirements are important tools; however, they are complex,\nunderinclusive under some conditions, and like all capital requirements, can be gamed.\n19 For macroprudential regulation, a key risk is pro-cyclicality in the financial system, whereby leverage\nand asset prices move up together in booms and decline together in busts (see Adrian and Shin, 2010;\nDrehman, Borio and Tsatsaronis, 2011; Geanakoplos, 2010). While varying stress test scenarios with the\ncycle can help to offset some of the financial system’s procyclical tendencies, other regulatory measures,\nsuch as a countercyclical capital buffer, may be better suited to address the specific vulnerabilities arising\nfrom procyclical leverage. The countercyclical capital buffer, or CCyB, is a capital buffer that is designed\nto be used as a macroprudential policy tool that could be increased in good times and reduced in bad ones.\n\n- 11 -\nThus, a non-risk-based leverage measure can provide transparency and a further measure\nof resilience. Of course, one also needs to pay attention to how different capital measures\ninteract with one another, and some have indicated that the leverage requirement for large\nbanks is overly binding and may contribute to lower liquidity in Treasury markets,\nespecially in stressed scenarios. We are exploring the empirical evidence and examining\nwhether adjustments to the leverage ratio might be appropriate in the context of our\nholistic capital review, as well as in the context of broader reforms being undertaken by\nthe Federal Reserve and a range of other agencies.\nIn addition to risk-based capital requirements, the Federal Reserve Board\nimplemented a supervisory stress test that is used to set dynamic and risk-sensitive capital\nrequirements for large banks.20 The stress test adds risk sensitivity to the capital\nrequirements and provides the public with information about the banks’ risks and\nresilience. Moreover, the stress test can achieve a higher degree of risk sensitivity than\nthe standard Basel risk weights. The stress test can also be more dynamic than the capital\nrules because a new test is conducted each year, reflecting a new set of hypothetical\nfinancial and economic conditions and updates to the banks risk profile. Lastly, the stress\ntest can potentially counteract actions by a bank to “optimize” against the capital\nregime—for instance, lowering its risk-weighted assets without reducing its risk.21 In\nthis way, the stress test—along with strong supervision—can serve as a check on\nexcessive bank risk-taking. As I’ll return to in a moment, we are focused on ensuring\n20 The stress test results feed directly into the capital buffer for large firms. The stress capital buffer is\nfloored at 2.5 percent, which aligns with the capital conservation buffer applicable to smaller firms.\n21 Greenwood et al (2017).\n\n- 12 -\nthat stress testing remains forward-looking and effective at requiring banks to have\ncapital to cushion losses from emerging risks.\nA final prudential requirement—a long-term debt requirement—complements the\nregulatory capital regime. Unlike regulatory capital—which helps a firm absorb losses as\nit continues operations through times of stress—long-term debt becomes especially\nrelevant once a firm has already entered bankruptcy or resolution. At the point of\nresolution, equity can be written off and certain long-term debt claims can be written\ndown to absorb losses. The remaining debt claims can be effectively converted to equity\nto provide flexibility to the bankruptcy court or resolution authority in managing the\nfirm’s path through resolution. In particular, this equity can be used to help the firm\ncontinue critical operations as its operations are restructured, wound down, or sold, in\norder to minimize disruptions to the larger financial system. Long-term debt\nrequirements were initially applied to global systemically important banks (GSIBs). The\nBoard and the FDIC are currently considering whether the costs of a resolution of a large,\nnon-GSIB may also justify the imposition of long-term debt requirements on such firms\nas well.22\nRole of Stress Testing in the Forward-Looking Regime\nAs I’ve said before, it is critical that our capital regime is forward-looking. And\nwhile the stress test is the most risk-sensitive and dynamic component of our regulatory\ncapital framework, history has taught us not to become complacent or to shed our\nhumility. In an environment of ever-changing risks, stress tests can quickly lose their\nrelevance if their assumptions and scenarios remain static. Let’s not forget that for some\n22 https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20221014a.htm.\n\n- 13 -\nyears before the financial crisis, the agency regulating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nconducted a regular stress test. Unfortunately, that test used models and scenarios that\nweren’t regularly updated, a key reason why the test failed to detect risks building for\nyears before the Global Financial Crisis, and why capital levels at Fannie and Freddie\nproved to be woefully inadequate.23\nStress tests are not meant to be predictions about the future. Humility suggests\ncaution in that regard. But they should be stressful: poking and prodding at the system so\nwe can attempt to uncover hidden risks that could become manifest under certain\nscenarios. This is particularly important in today’s complex and interconnected financial\nsystem, in which problems can spread and lead to unexpected losses. For instance, we\nrecently saw how exposure to interest rate risk at a set of leveraged pension funds in the\nUnited Kingdom, coupled with unprecedented large movements in rates, caused\nsignificant disruptions to the gilt market. This was not a risk that anyone saw coming,\nbut it spilled over to the U.K. financial markets in a way that required a large-scale\nintervention by the government. Other recent examples, to name a few, include the\nmessy failure of Archegos last year; Russia’s war against Ukraine; tensions in and with\nChina; the implosion of the crypto-asset exchange FTX and the resulting crypto-asset\nmarket dislocations; and volatility in the markets for fixed-income securities, affecting\nmarket liquidity.\nWe are currently evaluating whether the supervisory stress test that is used to set\ncapital requirements for large banks reflects an appropriately wide range of risks. In\naddition, we are considering the potential for stress testing to be a tool to explore\n23 For more details about these historical stress test experiences, see Frame, Gerardi, and Willen (2015) and\nGreenlaw, Kashyap, Shin (2012).\n\n- 14 -\ndifferent sources of financial stress and uncover channels for contagion that lead to\nunanticipated consequences. Using multiple scenarios or adapting the stress test in other\nways to better account for the high degree of interconnectedness between banks and other\nfinancial entities could allow supervisors and banks to identify those conditions and take\naction to address them. And banks should continue to invest in and prioritize\ndevelopment of their own stress testing and scenario design capabilities, regularly run\nscenarios to understand the changing risk environment, and incorporate the results of\nthese stress tests into the bank’s assessment of its risks and capital needs.\nConclusion\nStress testing and all the other aspects of capital regulation that I have discussed\ntoday will be considered as part of our holistic review. We’re starting from a good place\nbecause capital today is strong. I hope to have more to say about that review early in the\nnew year. As I have argued today, capital plays a central role in how a bank manages its\nrisks, and capital regulation is fundamental to bank oversight. History shows the deep\ncosts to society when bank capital is inadequate, and thus how urgent it is for the Federal\nReserve to get capital regulation right. In doing so, we need to be humble about our\nability, or that of bank managers or the market, to fully anticipate the risks that our\nfinancial system might face in the future.\n\n- 15 -\nReferences\nAcharya, V.

I’m grateful for the opportunity to join you today as we discuss the\nupdated Community Reinvestment Act regulations and what they mean for Indian Country.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act—or CRA—requires banking regulators to encourage\nfederally insured banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they do\nbusiness, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. On October 24, the Federal\nReserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced a final rule strengthening and modernizing the\nregulations implementing the CRA. This historic update reflects years of public engagement and\nseveral rounds of rulemaking by the Board, FDIC, and OCC. During this process, the Center for\nIndian Country Development was a key partner in encouraging input from Native community\nmembers and organizations. Indian Country leaders described critical community needs, such as\ndeveloping partnerships with financial institutions, increasing mortgage lending, and bolstering\npartnerships with Native Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to expand\nsmall business lending. I want to thank you for sharing your perspectives. They informed the\nfinal rule in ways that have the potential to positively impact community development in Indian\nCountry for generations to come.\nAs the Federal Reserve’s Vice Chair for Supervision, I oversee supervision of banks and\nbank holding companies. I’ve researched and written about the CRA’s role in expanding access\nto credit and financial inclusion for many years and have had the privilege of working with\ndedicated colleagues across the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC who worked tirelessly on this\nupdate. It’s profoundly rewarding to have completed this historic milestone, and yet I know our\nwork has just begun. We now need to turn our attention to building awareness of the\n\n- 2 -\nopportunities introduced by the new regulations, and to supporting their clear and consistent\nimplementation.\nThe potential impact of the new rule was reinforced for me on a recent visit with tribal\nnations in Montana. In August, I had the opportunity to spend time on the Flathead and\nBlackfeet reservations, where I met with members of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai\nTribes and Blackfeet Nation. Tribal members described the need to address persistent housing\nchallenges and insufficient access to credit in their communities.\nWhile there is a range of housing experiences across Indian Country, many communities\nface an inadequate housing supply, substandard housing conditions, and limited access to credit\nfor home purchases and improvements. Research from the Center for Indian Country\nDevelopment has found that Native Americans pay more for home loans than White borrowers\non average, and the gap widens for Native American borrowers living on reservations.1 In a\ncommunity roundtable, tribal members of diverse ages and income levels shared their personal\nstories of struggling to find affordable housing and secure the financing they need.\nMy conversations with bankers and community leaders raised hopeful avenues for\naddressing these challenges. In a roundtable with community banks, lenders described efforts to\nexpand capital and financial services in Indian Country. Banks are also building their capacity to\nleverage federal housing resources and navigate the complexities of trust land, but these efforts\nare time-consuming. These lenders see an opportunity to simplify the administrative complexity\nof federal housing programs on tribal lands. Native CDFIs may also offer innovative ways to\n1 Helen Banga, Donn Feir, Matthew Gregg, “The Unequal Costs of Native American Homeownership,” Federal\nReserve Bank of Minneapolis, August 3, 2023, https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/cicd-working-paper-\nseries/the-unequal-costs-of-native-american-homeownership.\n\n- 3 -\naddress housing and other credit needs in Indian Country.2 These culturally centered community\ninstitutions are finding new ways to support positive credit outcomes and loan performance, and\nto facilitate mortgage loans in Indian Country.\nThe modernized CRA regulation includes important updates that can benefit Indian\nCountry by encouraging affordable housing and expanding access to credit, investment, and\nbanking services in Native Land Areas. I’m grateful for the work that the Center for Indian\nCountry Development, our fellow regulatory agencies, and organizations serving Indian Country\nare doing to help communities understand the new provisions. The new rule reflects changes to\nthe current CRA framework intended to clarify and recognize community development activities\nin Native communities. I’m hopeful about the new opportunities these updates open, and I’ll\nhighlight a few of those key changes today.\nOne major change is that the updated rule newly defines “Native Land Area” and eligible\nactivities in those areas. In addition, under the new rule, certain investment and community\ndevelopment activities in these areas are given special consideration. This important update will\nrecognize banks providing more banking services, community development financing, and\nvolunteer work in Native communities. Another key change is that banks can now get credit for\nqualifying activities that take place outside of their assessment areas. What this means is that\neven banks whose assessment areas fall outside of Native Land Areas can receive CRA credit for\nactivities serving those areas.\nThe updates related to Native Land Areas provide needed clarity to recognize investment\nin Native communities, but there are of course many Native people who live outside of these\nareas. The final rule also includes provisions that can be used to recognize activities benefiting\n2 Caryn Mohr, “Unpacking the wisdom of Native CDFIs,” Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, August 29, 2023,\nminneapolisfed.org.\n\n- 4 -\nNative individuals and communities outside of designated Native Land Areas. Community\ndevelopment activities that serve individuals and communities outside of the Native Land Areas\nmay qualify for CRA consideration under another community development category. For\nexample, a loan to a nonprofit organization focused on providing housing to low- or moderate-\nincome urban Native individuals could qualify as an affordable housing community development\nactivity. Another example would be loans or investments to facilitate community supportive\nservices for low- or moderate-income individuals, such as childcare, education, workforce\ndevelopment and job training programs, health services programs, and housing services\nprograms.\nAnother important part of the new rule establishes a community development category\nthat includes CRA credit for activities undertaken with CDFIs, including Native CDFIs, which\nare certified by the Treasury Department. With this update, the final rule provides clarity that a\nloan to a Native CDFI—including one serving a Native community outside of a Native Land\nArea—would receive positive CRA consideration. We know from research conducted by the\nCenter for Indian Country Development that Native CDFIs play a key role in addressing capital\nand credit needs in Indian Country.\nThese and other updates to the regulations implementing the CRA open promising new\nopportunities for supporting community development activities in Indian Country. One objective\nof the final rule is that it provides greater transparency and consistency in application of the\nregulations. For example, the new regulations include a list of “impact and responsiveness\nreview factors” designed to standardize the assessment of a bank’s community development\nperformance. This is an important change that will guide structured evaluation of banks’\ncommunity development activities.\n\n- 5 -\nFinally, the definition of “Native Land Area” in the final rule, coupled with data\ncollection and reporting provisions regarding bank community development activities, will\nsupport greater transparency in how Indian Country is served, and provide stakeholders with a\nbetter understanding of the needs and opportunities for community development in these areas.\nIn the years to come, we have an important responsibility to monitor and assess how well\nthe updated CRA regulations meet the needs of Indian Country. In our role as one of the CRA’s\nregulatory agencies, it will be critical that we continue to listen to and learn from your\nexperiences. Native CDFIs and other community-based groups will also continue to play a vital\nrole in these efforts by highlighting where banks should do more for low- and moderate-income\ncommunities.\nThank you again for the opportunity to discuss this landmark CRA update with you. I\nlook forward to working with you and learning from your experiences in the years to come as we\napply this new framework in service of Indian Country.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nHope Economic Mobility Forum at Jackson State University\nJackson, Mississippi\nFebruary 7, 2023\n\nThank you, Bill, and thank you to Hope Enterprise Corporation and Jackson State\nUniversity for inviting me to speak today.1 It’s good to be back in Mississippi. It’s\nBlack History Month, and I feel privileged to be at this great historically Black\nuniversity, speaking on a topic of such vital importance to our country.\nI made my first trip to this state as a government official a quarter century ago, to\nClarksdale, Mississippi. I remember it was a sweltering July day, and we visited a local\ncabinet manufacturer with Bill Bynum, who, in my judgment, is one of the heroes of the\neconomic justice movement. The company had received financing from Hope, which\nwas then known as the Enterprise Corporation of the Delta. On that hot day, President\nClinton called on banks to do more to meet the needs of their communities, to do more\nunder a revamped Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), and to help set up or support\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions, or CDFIs, such as Hope, partnering with\nthe newly created CDFI Fund at Treasury.\nAnd he called on Congress to pass the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) to\nprovide tax credits to individuals and corporations for making equity investments in\nCommunity Development Entities (CDEs) in places such as the Mississippi Delta. This,\nin turn, would help establish and grow local businesses, create jobs, increase local\npurchasing power, and generate more local investment opportunities.\nCongress enacted the NMTC in December 2000 with bipartisan support. Since its\ninception, CDEs like Hope have used the program to support a wide array of job-creating\nbusinesses that increase local access to goods and services as well as to increase the\n1 The views here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. I am grateful to Christine Graham and\nKirsten Noland for their assistance in preparing this text.\n\n- 2 -\navailability of important community infrastructure, such as rural hospitals. To date, the\nNMTC program has awarded over $71 billion of tax credits, which translates, among\nother things, into 857,000 jobs and almost 239 million square feet of commercial real\nestate.2 In addition, the CDFI Fund has awarded more than $5.5 billion in grants and\nguaranteed over $2.1 billion in bonds.3\nThese programs and others like them also enable CDFIs to increase access to\nfinancial services in underserved communities, which can lead to opportunity and greater\neconomic mobility. This morning, we heard insightful discussions about economic\nmobility in the Deep South, including how to create ladders of economic opportunity, and\nthe important role that access to financial services plays in economic mobility.\nDiscrimination, the Racial Wealth Gap, and Disparities in Access\nWe all have an interest in promoting a vibrant economy as well as resilient\nfamilies and communities. In such an economy, people would have access to credit on\nfair and equal terms to build a secure financial foundation. Yet, despite widespread\nacceptance of this vision, we have a way to go in making it a reality, particularly for\nBlack households. I’m going to speak to three drivers of this disparity, and three ways\nthat the financial services community should work together to address them.\n2 Treasury Announces $5 Billion in New Markets Tax Credit Awards to Revitalize Low-Income\nand Distressed Communities.

Federal\nReserve System https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/survey/2022/2022-report-on-firms-owned-by-\npeople-of-color\n\n- 4 -\nCompounding these challenges is the racial wealth gap.9 Federal Reserve data\nfrom 2019 show that White families had about eight times the wealth of Black families.10\nWhite families had a median wealth of approximately $188,000, compared to $24,000 for\nBlack families.11 Lower levels of wealth make it difficult for people of color to finance a\ndown payment for a home, invest in education, or establish a small business—all central\nto the American dream. These low levels of wealth also make it difficult for Black\nfamilies to weather emergencies, such as job loss, or pay for unexpected expenses, which\ncan lead to eviction, repossession of vehicles, and other devastating consequences.\nAnd there are racial disparities in financial services. While there has been\nsignificant progress over the last twenty-five years in expanding access to banking\nservices, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)’s most recent annual survey\nof the unbanked and underbanked found that the unbanked rate for Black households was\n11.3 percent, compared to just 2.1 percent for White households.12 The unbanked rate for\nBlack households in Mississippi was more than double the national average for Black\nhouseholds—23.2 percent.13 Lacking a bank account can present challenges for saving—\nleading to the same insecurities I noted above—and lead to reliance on expensive,\nalternative products. In addition to higher unbanked rates, only 48.8 percent of Black\n9 For example, see Yellen, J. L. (2014). Perspective on Inequality and Opportunity from the\nSurvey of Consumer Finances.

I’ll set out three areas in which\nfinancial institutions and regulators should do their part to address these issues, although\nthe issues are complex and multifaceted, and there are no easy solutions.\nFirst: Eradicate discrimination in lending and other financial services, and protect\nconsumers from other unfair, abusive, or illegal practices. It is incumbent on financial\ninstitutions to devote resources to stamp out these practices, and on regulators to\nreinforce the importance of this goal through supervision and enforcement.\nSecond: Look for opportunities to support a vibrant and thriving economy for the\nbenefit of everyone. This means seeking out opportunities to invest in low- and\nmoderate-income (LMI) communities, small businesses, and community infrastructure.\nThird: Develop products and services that can help people save and build wealth.\nEradicating Discrimination\nI’ll start with our collective responsibility for eradicating discrimination in\nunderwriting, lending, and other aspects of financial services. For most of our country’s\nhistory, the United States government and many state and local governments, as well as\n14 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households. Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC). https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/2021report.pdf.\n15 For state-level data, see the FDIC Custom Data Table Tool.\n\n- 6 -\nmany private individuals, corporations, and organizations, did not merely fail to protect\nminorities from discrimination; they actively reinforced segregation, entrenched\ninequality, and enforced unequal policies—including through brutal violence. 16 17\nThe Civil Rights Movement brought about changes in public opinion and in law.\nDiscrimination in housing and lending became illegal in 1968 and 1974, respectively,\nthrough passage of the Fair Housing Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.\nCongress passed laws, such as the Community Reinvestment Act in 1977, to remediate\nredlining. But history casts a long shadow.\nHow can we—both banks and regulators—understand and address these problems\nwhere they persist? To start, there are some areas where we need better data. For\nexample, small business lending data required by section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act,\nonce implemented, will provide tangible insights into the availability and pricing of credit\nfor minority small businesses. Banks should also actively analyze their own data to\nidentify areas where racial disparities occur. On-the-ground testing, using techniques\nsuch as mystery shopping, may also help to identify discriminatory practices.18 And to\nthe extent that a bank uses AI or other algorithmic systems in making lending decisions,\nthey should review the underlying models, such as their credit scoring and underwriting\nsystems, as well as their marketing and loan servicing activities, just as they should for\nmore traditional models.19\n16 See Rothstein (2017).\n17 See Cook (2014).\n18 Mystery shopping involves two individuals who are identical except for a protected class\nattribute (such as race), and has these individuals apply for credit products. The results are\nexamined for disparate treatment based on that attribute.\n19 See SR Letter 11-7. See also Morse & Pence (2020), which explores the potential of fintech to\nincrease financial inclusion and attendant consumer protection risks.\n\n- 7 -\nRacial bias in the residential real estate market has long been noted as a source of\nconcern.20 In January, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s\nAppraisal Subcommittee held a public hearing on appraisal bias in the residential real\nestate market. I look forward to working with my fellow regulators to help ensure that\nindividuals are treated equally in the appraisal process regardless of race or the racial\ncomposition of neighborhoods.\nMore generally, there is another, glaringly obvious reason for banks to do all they\ncan to eradicate discrimination in lending. It is simply good business. Ensuring that all\nwould-be borrowers are treated equally means more customers, more loans, and better\nreturns for banks.\nThe Federal Reserve and our fellow regulators have a clear responsibility to use\nour supervisory and enforcement tools.21 All firms have a responsibility to operate in a\nmanner consistent with safety and soundness and in compliance with laws and\nregulations, including those related to consumer protection. Congress provided\nregulators with supervisory and enforcement tools to help ensure that supervised firms\nresolve consumer protection weaknesses as well as the more pervasive risk management\nissues that often lead to those weaknesses. We have a close working relationship with the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators and integrate other\nregulators’ consumer-focused reviews—such as examinations for unfair, deceptive, or\n20 See Rothwell and Perry (2022).\n21 The Dodd-Frank Act divided responsibility for supervising banks under consumer protection\nlaws between the prudential regulators and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB),\nwith the CFPB having primary responsibility for certain laws for banks with assets greater than\n$10 billion. Specifically, the Federal Reserve and the CFPB have overlapping authority for state\nmember banks on Unfair, Deceptive, and Abusive Acts and Practices (UDAP/UDAAP) matters.\nThe Federal Reserve also has responsibility for supervision of bank holding companies, including\nannually assessing risk management and compliance.\n\n- 8 -\nabusive acts or practices, as well as fair lending—into our assessments of bank holding\ncompanies, including in the context of applications for mergers and acquisitions. Such\ncollaboration is critical to ensure a level playing field and strong consumer protection\nenforcement.\nSupporting Vibrant Communities\nBut even if we address current discriminatory practices, we are still left with the\nlegacy of discrimination and redlining, which helped perpetuate economically depressed\nBlack neighborhoods.22 Historically, these neighborhoods have not had the benefit of\nrobust credit and financial services, which hindered their growth and left them less\neconomically connected than wealthier neighborhoods. This lack of connectivity can\nhave a large impact on an individual’s economic mobility.23 Before turning to the role of\nregulators, let me first speak a bit about the role of private institutions in supporting these\ncommunities.\nFirst, CDFIs and Minority Depository Institutions or MDIs are critical because\nthey deliver financial products to places and people often left behind by other financial\ninstitutions. Compared to other banks, MDIs originate a greater share of mortgages to\nminority borrowers and borrowers who live in lower- and middle-income census tracts.24\nAnd they played a critical role in disbursing the PPP. Recent legislation bolstered the\nCDFIs with funds from the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP). Hope\nFederal Credit Union estimates that the ECIP funds it received will allow it to double its\n22 See, e.g., Rothstein, R. (2017).\n23 See Chetty, Jackson, Kuchler, Stroebel, Hiller, Oppenheimer & team (2022).\n24 See Friesenhahn & Kwan (2021).\n\n- 9 -\nconsumer, mortgage, small business, and consumer lending portfolios over the next six\nyears, and Hope was able to mobilize $140 million of PPP funds to small businesses.25\nCommunity banks also serve an important role. Through their lending to local\ncommunities and small businesses, they often know their customers personally and\nengage in community-building activities.\nLarge banks also have a key part to play. For example, in 2022, many large\nfinancial institutions initiated or expanded special purpose credit programs, many of\nwhich provide mortgage assistance to benefit Black and Hispanic communities.26 In\naddition to their own lending, they help support MDIs and CDFIs through technical\nassistance and investment. They often share expertise in technology, business support\nsolutions, tax considerations, and bringing programs to scale.\nAnd, as is often true, the impact can be greatest through collective efforts. In\n2015, while I was at the University of Michigan, I helped a former student, James Wahls,\ndesign a program to bring together a local CDFI, philanthropies, and several banks, to\nlaunch the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund in Detroit. The Fund extended credit to small\nbusinesses in Detroit that otherwise might not qualify for bank lending, at the rate of\nmore than $2 million a year.27 And that same approach is now being used by eight\n25 Testimony of William J.

Closer to home,\nHope—together with a large bank and a set of HBCUs—has partnered to form the Deep\nSouth Economic Mobility Collaborative. This program provides capital, educational\nresources, and business support services to small businesses and entrepreneurs in the\nDeep South, especially those from underserved and under resourced communities.\nTurning to the role of regulators, we should do what we can to encourage the\nprivate efforts I mentioned above. For instance, the Fed’s Partnership for Progress helps\nMDIs navigate their unique business challenges, provides MDIs with resources for\ntechnical assistance, and conducts research on the unique challenges faced by LMI\ncommunities.28 We conduct and promote research on CDFIs and engage in thought-\nleadership to explore ways to bring additional capital and liquidity to the CDFI sector.29\nIn addition, regulators should also ensure that our regulations provide appropriate\nincentives for banks to invest in LMI communities and lend to LMI households. The\nCRA helps to address redlining and other systemic inequities in access to credit,\ninvestment, and banking services faced by LMI communities. The last major revisions to\nthe CRA’s regulations were made in 1995, and it is high time that we strengthen and\nmodernize the regulations to reflect the many changes in banking since then. In 2022, the\nFederal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n28 Minority Depository Institutions.

Federal\nReserve Bank of New York https://www.newyorkfed.org/outreach-and-education/community-\ndevelopment/community-development-finance-conference\n\n- 11 -\nrequested comments from the public on a proposal to do just that. Importantly, the\nproposal would encourage banks to expand access in LMI communities to home\nmortgage, small business, and other credit, to make community development\ninvestments, and engage in lending and banking services. The proposal would adapt the\nregulations to address changes in the banking sector, including internet and mobile\nbanking, and update the approach to assessment areas. It also would provide more\nclarity, consistency, and transparency for CRA evaluations and eligible activities. I\nsupport the overall objectives of the proposal, and I am pleased that all three agencies are\nworking together to have unified regulations.30 The agencies are benefitting from the\nthoughtful comment letters we received on the proposal, and all three agencies are hard at\nwork finalizing the rule.\nAnother area where Congress directed the Board to consider the convenience and\nneeds of communities is through our review of bank mergers. As I’ve said before,\nmergers are a feature of vibrant industries, but the advantages that firms seek to gain\nthrough mergers must be weighed against the risks posed, and the costs and benefits to\nthe community. There is likely important work we can do to improve our assessment of\nthe convenience and needs factor for bank mergers.\nWe also have an important role to play in ensuring that our safety and soundness\nregulations do not needlessly impede financial inclusion. For example, banks can make\ninvestments that support LMI communities, called public welfare investments, subject to\ncertain caps. We plan to change our approach to computing the public welfare\n30 Summary of Key Objectives of the Interagency CRA Proposal. Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/files/cra_npr_key_objectives_20220505.\npdf.\n\n- 12 -\ninvestment caps for state member banks using New Markets Tax Credits, and similar\ncredits, which would allow state member banks to make additional investment in LMI\ncommunities. And as ECIP funds are made available, regulators have an important role\nto play in ensuring our examiners are informed and knowledgeable about the work being\nconducted under these new programs.\nResponsive Products\nLast, let me turn to the need to develop products that are responsive to customer\nneeds. As many have said, it’s expensive to be poor. And many poor people lack any\nfinancial slack, such as savings, to tide them over through an emergency. No slack often\nmeans that a small problem can snowball into larger ones. As a result, low- and\nmoderate-income consumers often use alternative financial services, such as payday\nloans, which can help fill needs but are often high-cost and can lead to debt traps. There\nis an opportunity for traditional banks and mission-driven organizations to fill this gap,\nbut to be effective, they need to understand consumer preferences and behavior to\nprovide products and services that meet these needs in a safer and fairer way.\nStarting with customer preference, we know that speed can be key. Income\ndisruption and unexpected expenses are more common in LMI households, and quick\naccess to a loan can make all the difference. With proper safeguards, unsecured small\ndollar credit to consumers with less-than-prime credit scores can be very important in\nhelping people meet this need.31 We have seen banks begin offering small dollar loans to\nsome existing customers by factoring account data into the provision of credit. Now\n31 In May 2020, the Federal Reserve, working with other regulators, issued the Interagency\nLending Principles for Making Responsible Small-Dollar Loans to encourage lending to small\nbusinesses and consumers\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20200520a1.pdf.\n\n- 13 -\nthere is a growing number of additional banks in this space. These products are typically\navailable through the bank’s online interface, which streamlines the process and speeds\nup decisions. Although some of these may be considered high-cost products, they are\nstill less costly than payday loans or the cost of what many banks charge for overdraft\nprotection.\nAs an operator and regulator of payment systems, the Federal Reserve also has a\nrole in faster payments. We’re working to launch FedNow, which, once widely adopted,\nwill better enable banks to offer customers the ability to send and receive money\nimmediately at low cost. We can also make a difference by updating our rules on check\nclearance, so that consumers and small businesses still receiving checks have access to\ntheir funds in a timelier manner. And of course, we need strong consumer protections in\nplace so that consumers don’t have to worry about making payments in a safe way.\nThe Bank On initiative has been hugely successful in both identifying bank\naccount features that meet customer preferences and getting those accounts into the hands\nof consumers. Strongly recommended features include low minimum balances, no\noverdraft fees, robust transaction options, and online bill pay.32 More than 46,000 banks\nand credit union branches across the country currently offer Bank On certified accounts,\nand more than 5.8 million Bank On-certified accounts were open and active in 2021.33\n32 Bank On National Account Services, 2023-2024.

For\ninstance, banks should ensure that their overdraft policies frame financial decisions in a\ntransparent and fair way and avoid unexpected and hefty fees.35 Customers should be\nempowered with timely information on balances so that they can avoid inadvertent\noverdrafts, and best practice builds in a grace period for customers to cure their\noverdrafts. Some banks have eliminated overdraft fees entirely.\nRegulators need to understand both human decision-making and market context in\ndesigning the right rules of the road. Regulators also need to engage with techniques,\nsuch as cash flow underwriting and alternative data, new credit models, and other\ntechnologies that hold out the promise to increase access and reduce bias in credit\nintermediation.36\nDiversity in the workforce of financial institutions also matters for financial\ninclusion. For instance, working with minority loan officers improves credit access for\nminority borrowers, which suggests that underrepresentation of minorities among loan\nofficers adversely impacts minority access to credit.37 And we regulators need to focus\non our own diversity as well.\n34 See Barr, Mullainathan & Shafir (2012).\n35 See, e.g., Consumer Compliance Supervision Bulletin, July 2018.

As I said at the outset, these are complex problems with no easy\nsolutions, but we have an obligation to do our part. One final important role we have to\nplay is encouraging awareness of these issues, and conferences such as these have\ntremendous value in this regard. On that note, once again, I’d like to thank Hope and\nJackson State University for hosting today’s event, and I look forward to your questions.\n\n- 16 -\nReferences\nBarr, M., Mullainathan, S. & Shafir, E.

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nReykjavík Economic Conference 2025\nCentral Bank of Iceland\nReykjavík, Iceland\nMay 9, 2025\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1 In my remarks, I would\nlike to address a key question facing economists, policymakers, and people all over the\nworld: How will artificial intelligence, particularly generative artificial intelligence, or\nGenAI, affect workers and the labor market in the years ahead?\nBefore I turn to that issue, I’d like to touch on a topic that I expect is also of\ninterest: the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy.\nThe U.S. economy entered this quarter in a relatively strong position: The\nunemployment rate has been low and stable, and the disinflationary process has\ncontinued on a gradual, albeit uneven, path towards our 2 percent objective. Private\ndomestic final purchases have been solid. Overall, the economy has been resilient.\nAgainst that backdrop, the outlook has been clouded by trade policies that have\nled to an increase in uncertainty, contributing to declines in measures of consumer and\nbusiness sentiment. I expect tariffs to lead to higher inflation in the United States and\nlower growth both in the United States and abroad starting later this year.\nIn my view, higher tariffs could lead to disruption to global supply chains and\ncreate persistent upward pressure on inflation. Faced with substantial tariffs, businesses\nwill likely change how they source intermediate inputs, and it will take time and\ninvestment for them to reroute their distribution networks. Conversely, global trade\nnetworks may change rapidly, and some suppliers may not be able to adapt quickly\nenough to survive these changes. This concern is particularly acute for small businesses,\nwhich are less diversified, less able to access credit, and hence more vulnerable to\nadverse shocks. Small businesses play a vital role in production networks, often\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nproviding specialized inputs that can’t easily be sourced elsewhere, and business failures\ncould further disrupt supply chains. As we saw during the pandemic, such disruptions\ncan have large and lasting effects on prices, as well as output.\nI am equally concerned that tariffs will lead to higher unemployment as the\neconomy slows. Thus, the FOMC may be in a difficult position if we were to see both\nrising inflation and rising unemployment.\nThe size and scope of the recent tariff increases are without modern precedent, we\ndon’t know their final form, and it is too soon to know how they will affect the economy.\nYet given the economy’s strong starting point and the progress we have made in bringing\ninflation back toward our 2 percent objective, monetary policy is in a good position to\nadjust as conditions unfold. Meanwhile, we will also be closely monitoring how\ntechnologies like artificial intelligence are being integrated into economic activity and\nanalyzing the implications for how the economy will evolve.\nLet me now return to the longer-term question of how AI will affect the labor\nmarket. Debate about machines replacing workers is nothing new, and even artificial\nintelligence is not particularly new either. AI has, in some form, arguably been around\nfor decades. Computer scientists have been developing machine learning algorithms for\nmany years, and these algorithms have been widely used in commercial applications,\nsuch as fraud detection and advertising. Speech and facial recognition are already\nubiquitous. These more long-standing forms of AI are continuing to improve, driving\nprogress in domains ranging from finance to medical diagnosis, and becoming so deeply\nembedded in our daily lives that we scarcely notice them anymore.\n\n- 3 -\nBut GenAI promises to go much further. Unlike traditional machine learning\ntechniques, which often focus on relatively simple prediction and classification tasks, the\nlarge language models that have emerged in recent years can generate new content—\nanything from news articles to computer code to images and video to customer service\ndialogue. Emerging forms of “agentic” AI can undertake complex, multistep tasks—for\nexample, taking a customer through a transaction and then placing an automated order.\nAs AI continues to develop, it will increasingly be combined with physical technologies\nlike autonomous vehicles and advanced robotics, further extending its ability to interact\nwith the real world. And AI may be shaping up to become what the esteemed economist\nZvi Griliches called an “invention of a method of inventing” that speeds up the research\nand development process itself.2\nGrowing evidence indicates that AI will be a “general purpose technology”—such\nas railroads, electricity, or computers—which is characterized by widespread adoption,\ncomplementary progress in many downstream applications, and ongoing improvement in\nthe core technology.3 Past general purpose technologies have dramatically improved\nproductivity. So, against this background, the natural question is, what about AI?\n2 See page 502 in Zvi Griliches (1957), “Hybrid Corn: An Exploration in the Economics of Technological\nChange,” Econometrica, vol. 25 (October), pp. 501–22.

Cockburn, Rebecca Henderson,\nand Scott Stern (2019), “The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Innovation: An Exploratory Analysis,” in\nAjay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb, eds., The Economics of Artificial Intelligence: An Agenda\n(Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 115–48, and Martin Neil Baily, David M. Byrne, Aidan T.\nKane, and Paul E. Soto (forthcoming), “Generative AI at the Crossroads: Light Bulb, Dynamo, or\nMicroscope,” Brookings Institution working paper.\n3 The term “general purpose technology” is typically abbreviated to GPT. To avoid confusion with\nChatGPT, I will continue to use the longer term. For a definition and discussion of past general purpose\ntechnologies, see Timothy F. Bresnahan and Manuel Trajtenberg (1995), “General Purpose Technologies\n‘Engines of Growth’?” Journal of Econometrics, vol. 65 (January), pp. 83–108. For a discussion of\nwhether earlier AI techniques already meet these criteria, see Avi Goldfarb, Bledi Taska, and Florenta\nTeodoridis (2023), “Could Machine Learning Be a General Purpose Technology? A Comparison of\nEmerging Technologies Using Data from Online Job Postings,” Research Policy, vol. 52 (January),\n104653. For a discussion of GenAI specifically, see Tyna Eloundou, Sam Manning, Pamela Mishkin, and\n\n- 4 -\nIn trying to understand how AI might transform work, it’s useful to consider how\nit could be applied in individual occupations, each of which comprises a range of tasks\nthat vary in their susceptibility to automation. Like past waves of information\ntechnology, AI will substitute for human labor in some tasks, complement human labor in\nother tasks, and spur the creation of new tasks that humans will perform, at least\ninitially.4 The net effects of AI on employment, both in the aggregate and across\ndemographic and education groups, will depend on the relative size of these offsetting\neffects.\nA pessimistic view is that AI and robotics could become so capable and cost\neffective as to render most human labor obsolete, culminating in mass unemployment.\nSuch concerns about technological advances are hardly a novel development. At least\nsince the Luddites of the early 19th century tried to disable textile looms, people have\nfeared that machines would bring about steep declines in employment, wages, and human\nwelfare.5\nEconomists have long been skeptical of that view, which suffers from the “lump\nof labor fallacy”—the presumption that there’s a fixed amount of work to be done, so if\nDaniel Rock (2023), “GPTs Are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large\nLanguage Models,” March 17 (revised August 22), https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130. For a contrasting\nview that AI will have only modest effects on productivity over the next 10 years, see Daron Acemoglu\n(2025), “The Simple Macroeconomics of AI,” Economic Policy, vol. 40 (January), pp. 13–58.\n4 See Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo (2019), “Automation and New Tasks: How Technology\nDisplaces and Reinstates Labor,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 33 (Spring), pp. 3–30.\n5 As David Autor writes, “There have been periodic warnings in the last two centuries that automation and\nnew technology were going to wipe out large numbers of middle class jobs. The best-known early example\nis the Luddite movement of the early 19th century, in which a group of English textile artisans protested the\nautomation of textile production by seeking to destroy some of the machines.” See page 3 in David H.\nAutor (2015), “Why Are There Still So Many Jobs? The History and Future of Workplace Automation,”\nJournal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 29 (Summer), pp. 3–30.\n\n- 5 -\nmachines do it, humans will not.6 New technologies do eliminate some existing\noccupations, and not all workers benefit from technological change. But technology also\ncreates new occupations, and the many waves of technological advances over the\ncenturies haven’t rendered humans obsolete. For example, many of the tasks that were\nperformed by humans in the 1950s are now performed by computers and robots, and yet\nthe unemployment rate is similar to what it was back then, while the labor force\nparticipation rate is higher overall.\nHowever, the amazing potential capabilities and breadth of applications\nassociated with AI—many of which are already apparent—make it worth asking whether\nthis time may be different. AI holds enormous promise of faster economic growth,\nadvances in human health, and a higher standard of living. But alongside the kinds of\nlabor market disruptions seen in past episodes of revolutionary technological change, we\nwill need to consider the possibility of more sweeping changes in the way we work.\nA Scenario Approach\nIn a previous speech, I outlined two hypothetical scenarios describing how AI\ncould evolve.7 In the first scenario, we see only incremental adoption that primarily\naugments what humans do today but still leads to significant and widespread productivity\n6 For example, see textbook discussions of automation and unemployment by Paul A. Samuelson (1964),\nEconomics: An Introductory Analysis, 6th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill), pp. 333–37; and James D.\nGwartney and Richard Stroup (1982), Economics: Private and Public Choice, 3rd ed. (New York:\nAcademic Press), pp. 518–19.\n7 See Michael S. Barr (2025), “Artificial Intelligence: Hypothetical Scenarios for the Future,” speech\ndelivered at the Council on Foreign Relations, New York, February 18,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm. See also Anton Korinek and\nDonghyun Suh (2024), “Scenarios for the Transition to AGI,” NBER Working Paper Series 32255\n(Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, March),\nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w32255.\n\n- 6 -\ngains. In the second scenario, we see profound change, in which we extend human\ncapabilities with far-reaching consequences.\nToday, I will apply the same approach to analyze the potential effects of AI on the\nlabor market. Of course, there is tremendous uncertainty about how AI will evolve and\nhow it will affect the economy, as well as society more broadly. Amid this uncertainty, a\nscenario-based approach can give us a framework for thinking about the potential effects\nof AI on employment, real wages, and productivity, as well as for considering the\npossible role that government could play in influencing this transition.\nScenario 1: Incremental Progress\nLet’s start with the “gradual” scenario, in which new AI technologies are adopted\nat a brisk, but not a breathless, pace or advance quickly at first and then plateau—perhaps\nbecause of constraints imposed by computing resources, the exhaustion of novel training\ndata, and rising energy consumption.\nUnder this scenario, AI primarily operates by automating some—but not all—\ntasks within many occupations. We’ve seen some of this task substitution happen\nalready: Computer programmers rely on AI copilots to write code, allowing them to\nfocus on higher-level tasks, while customer support agents can use chatbots to improve\nand expedite their responses.8 Lawyers draw on GenAI to conduct legal research, while\nAI-powered safety features improve the performance of human automobile drivers.\n8 For evidence that GenAI increases the productivity of human programmers, see Sida Peng, Eirini\nKalliamvakou, Peter Cihon, and Mert Demirer (2023), “The Impact of AI on Developer Productivity:\nEvidence from GitHub Copilot,” February 13, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06590. For similar evidence\nregarding customer support agents, see Erik Brynjolfsson, Danielle Li, and Lindsey Raymond (2025),\n“Generative AI at Work,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 140 (May), pp. 889–942.\n\n- 7 -\nUnder this scenario, as foundational models improve, novel use cases are\ndiscovered, and businesses continue to integrate AI into their operations, more and more\noccupations will be affected, and many jobs will use AI tools more intensively. As these\ntechnologies improve, even incremental change may allow AI to become accurate and\ncheap enough to replace some occupations altogether. It’s hard to make predictions at\nthis stage. But a plausible conjecture is that we could see, for example, fewer human\nprogrammers, lawyers, or commercial drivers. At the same time, most current\noccupations would persist in this scenario—albeit in modified and more productive\nforms.\nBeyond existing occupations, general purpose technologies also encourage the\ncreation of new occupations, fueled by new products and novel ways of doing business.\nIt’s difficult to envision the novel jobs that will replace the ones we might lose to an\nincremental AI scenario. But one possibility is that the future could bring us managers of\nAI agents, specialists in human–AI collaboration, ethicists, safety experts, and large\nnumbers of people involved in adopting, maintaining, and educating about AI tools.\nTechnology, and how we use a particular innovation, evolves in unpredictable ways, and\nwe should expect to be surprised.\nUnder this scenario, jobs remain plentiful, real wages are buoyed by productivity\ngains, and employment and labor force participation remain high and could even rise, if\nstrong wage growth entices new labor market entrants and if improvements in health care\nincrease work capacity among older or disabled individuals. If the widespread adoption\nof AI proceeds gradually, then workers will have time to adjust, reducing the disruption\nto the labor market—though, as with previous general purpose technologies, AI would\n\n- 8 -\nlikely imply that some groups of workers experience a painful process of dislocation and\ntransition.\nRetraining could help here. A recent survey carried out by the Federal Reserve\nBank of New York found that many businesses plan to retrain their workers to use AI\nrather than laying them off.9 In some cases, AI may disrupt career ladders by automating\nmany entry-level tasks—such as reviewing legal documents or drafting code—that were\nhistorically performed by early-career workers. But if labor demand changes slowly\nenough, students and workers are more likely to have time to predict which skills will be\nmarketable and to make and recoup human capital investments before their skills become\nobsolete.\nWhat about the effect of AI on inequality? Some research suggests that GenAI\nmay help less-productive workers catch up to their more-productive peers.10 That said,\nthe AI economy will likely put a premium on digital skills, facility with new\ntechnologies, and adaptability. The precedent of the computer revolution suggests that\nhighly educated workers may benefit most, boosting wage inequality—a phenomenon\ncalled “skill-biased technological change.”11 Another possibility is that the labor share of\nincome could decline, if capital owners benefit more than wage earners—for example,\nbecause the gains accruing from AI adoption go to large, highly capitalized firms whose\n9 See Jaison R. Abel, Richard Deitz, Natalia Emanuel, and Benjamin Hyman (2024), “AI and the Labor\nMarket: Will Firms Hire, Fire, or Retrain?” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Liberty Street Economics\n(blog), September 4, https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2024/09/ai-and-the-labor-market-will-\nfirms-hire-fire-or-retrain. Among surveyed businesses in New York and New Jersey, about half of\nbusinesses that planned to use AI within the next six months expected to retrain their current staff to\nuse AI.\n10 See Shakked Noy and Whitney Zhang (2023), “Experimental Evidence on the Productivity Effects of\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence,” Science, July 13, vol. 381 (6654), pp. 187–92.\n11 See Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz (2008), The Race between Education and Technology\n(Cambridge: Harvard University Press).\n\n- 9 -\ntechnical capabilities, consumer networks, and training data allow them to develop state-\nof-the-art AI techniques.\nScenario 2: Transformation\nNow let’s consider an alternative scenario in which AI completely transforms the\neconomy. As I described in my earlier speech, in this transformative scenario, humans\nemploy AI to unleash their imagination and creativity—combined with robust investment\nin research and development—to make rapid breakthroughs that have the potential to\nimprove our lives. With growth propelled by swift technological progress, society’s\nresources would be vastly expanded, AI would spur revolutionary advances in health, and\nmany individuals would enjoy more time for leisure activities.\nIndeed, transformative AI could bring about a state of affairs that John Maynard\nKeynes famously envisioned almost a hundred years ago, one in which there are “ever\nlarger and larger classes and groups of people from whom problems of economic\nnecessity have been practically removed.”12 At the same time, transformative AI could\nimply a much smaller role for human labor—a development that would entail sweeping\nsocial changes and profound challenges for government.\nUnder this scenario, AI would take over a broad range of existing jobs. As\neconomist Anton Korinek writes, “AI systems advance toward mastering all forms of\ncognitive work that can be performed by humans, including new tasks that don’t even\nexist yet.”13 Building on developments we are already starting to see, improved chatbots\n12 See page 372 in John Maynard Keynes (1930), “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,” in\nEssays in Persuasion (New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1963), pp. 358–73.\n13 See page 9 in Anton Korinek (2024), “The Economics of Transformative AI,” Reporter, no. 4\n(Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research), pp. 9–12,\nhttps://www.nber.org/sites/default/files/2025-01/2024number4.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nand AI agents would outperform their human counterparts in activities ranging from\ncustomer support to medical diagnosis. Along similar lines, advanced robotics could\nincreasingly substitute for human workers in manual and production jobs. Widespread\nautomation would bring many benefits. The availability and quality of many services\ncould increase markedly, and many less-desirable jobs—such as those involving tedious\ntasks or dangerous working conditions—could be transferred to machines.\nWhat jobs would exist in this more transformative scenario? As in the more\ngradual scenario—and just as has happened in the past, when earlier general purpose\ntechnologies were adopted—we would see the emergence of new occupations. These\nwould notably include jobs that involve managing the new AI-dominated economy. In\naddition, some existing occupations would likely persist, at least for some time. This\nwould be the case for three key reasons. First, some jobs may prove especially hard to\nautomate. For example, plumbers and mechanics rely on physical dexterity and\nadaptability to situations—attributes that machines may find difficult to replicate, or to\nreplicate cheaply. Second, in some contexts, consumers may insist on a human touch.\nPatients may still want human doctors and therapists, while parents may want human\nteachers and caregivers to look after their children. Third, even when AI has the\ntechnical capability to carry out tasks, some jobs are likely to be protected by laws and\nregulations. For example, legal and political systems would likely continue to insist on\nhuman judges and elected officials. Eventually, however, an increasing share of current\njobs may be automated. The technological frontier is moving quickly, consumers’\npreferences may change as they become more comfortable interacting with AI, and the\nregulatory landscape could evolve to provide broader roles for AI.\n\n- 11 -\nIt’s difficult to say how many jobs will exist under transformative AI. On the one\nhand, it’s possible that—as has happened so often in the past—the economy will find\ninventive new ways to keep most people employed. On the other hand, there are\nconcerns that some workers could experience a large enough decline in their earnings\npotential that paid work may no longer be an available option. Employment and labor\nforce participation could fall; displaced workers may grapple with a loss of daily routines,\nsocial connectedness, and the meaning they derived from employment. The risk of a\nsignificant decline in employment looms large in many people’s concerns about AI, and\nit’s important for policymakers to be attentive to that risk.\nEven if AI ultimately creates as many jobs as it eliminates, we should expect that\nthe transition will be difficult. Existing firms would likely reorganize their production,\nlaying off workers in the process. They could also lose market share to technologically\nsophisticated start-ups, which could scale up with a minimal number of human workers\nmanaging AI subordinates.14 Many displaced workers would have obsolete skills, and\nskill mismatch could lead to a structural increase in unemployment as these workers\nretool for new occupations. It is possible that unemployment might rise only temporarily.\nIt is also possible, however, that more sustained increases could be observed. That would\nbe the case if technology continued to evolve too quickly for many workers to keep up,\nleading to continual churn and ongoing dislocation.\nHow might transformative AI affect income inequality? Both traditionally high-\nwage occupations, such as lawyers and financial professionals, and lower-wage\n14 See Erin Griffith (2025), “A.I.

But the largest wage gains would likely go\nto the highest-skilled workers, as they would be best positioned to implement frontier\ntechnologies and help oversee the AI economy. In addition, if capital owners are the\nmain beneficiaries, the labor share of income could decline precipitously.\nTransformative AI could bring about profound improvements in living standards,\nleisure opportunities, and human health. At the same time, society would confront\nprofound distributional changes and potential challenges. Much would depend on how\nbroadly the economic benefits are shared, how policymakers respond, and how society\nadapts to the rapid pace of change.\nHow Will We Know Which Future We Are Living in?\nThe world looks very different across these two scenarios. As AI spreads\nthroughout the economy, how will we know which world we’re living in, particularly in\nview of the likelihood that AI adoption will proceed at different rates in different\noccupations and industries?\nFirst, we will need to track how many businesses are using AI and how it is\naffecting their operations. Recent surveys give different impressions about AI adoption\nthus far, but they consistently show rapid increases in usage over time.15\nSecond, we will need to monitor AI’s evolving technological capabilities. AI\ndevelopers test their models against human performance in benchmark activities like\n15 For a summary of recent survey evidence on AI adoption, see Leland Crane, Michael Green, and Paul\nSoto (2025), “Measuring AI Uptake in the Workplace,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System, February 5), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3724. Across six firm-level\nsurveys, the share of respondents using some form of AI ranges widely—from 5 to 40 percent—likely in\npart reflecting differences in sample composition, question wording, and the period over which AI usage is\nmeasured. Across 10 individual-level surveys, usage of GenAI generally ranges between 20 and\n40 percent, with much higher rates among computer programmers.\n\n- 13 -\nstandardized tests and visual tasks. Results of these tests will continue to provide\nimportant clues about which activities, and thus which occupations, are at risk of being\nautomated. Along these lines, economists have already developed measures of\noccupations’ exposure to automation. They have based these measures on the\ncharacteristics of the tasks involved in different occupations.16 Of course, as the set of\ntasks that AI can perform expands, these measures can be updated accordingly.\nA third way to judge how AI is changing the economy is that data on job openings\nwill likely be a leading indicator of changes in labor demand. What kinds of jobs are\nemployers creating? What skills do they cite in job ads?17\nAnd, lastly, job growth by occupation and industry is likely to reflect the\nemerging effects of AI. So far, the imprint of AI is difficult to discern in the employment\nstatistics, but that is likely to change. It may be difficult to disentangle the effects of AI\nfrom the other determinants of employment growth, especially in real time. But in the\nevent of truly sweeping changes in the occupational structure, the effects of AI should\nshow up in the data.\nLooking Ahead\nWhat do these two scenarios imply for society? In scenario 1, the issues that\nsociety has to address will be more straightforward. Policymakers will have to decide\n16 For examples of this approach, see Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne (2017), “The Future of\nEmployment: How Susceptible Are Jobs to Computerisation?” Technological Forecasting and Social\nChange, vol. 114 (January), pp. 254–80; Erik Brynjolfsson, Tom Mitchell, and Daniel Rock (2018), “What\nCan Machines Learn, and What Does It Mean for Occupations and the Economy?” AEA Papers and\nProceedings, vol. 108 (May), pp. 43–47; Edward W. Felten, Manav Raj, and Robert Seamans (2018), “A\nMethod to Link Advances in Artificial Intelligence to Occupational Abilities,” AEA Papers and\nProceedings, vol. 108 (May), pp. 54–57; and Eloundou, Manning, Mishkin, and Rock, “GPTs Are GPTs”\n(see note 3).\n17 See Daron Acemoglu, David Autor, Jonathon Hazell, and Pascual Restrepo (2022), “Artificial\nIntelligence and Jobs: Evidence from Online Vacancies,” Journal of Labor Economics, vol. 40 (April), pp.\nS293–340.\n\n- 14 -\nhow to regulate emergent technologies, education and training programs will have to be\ntailored to shifts in labor demand, and some labor market regulations may need to be\nupdated. In scenario 2, the issues that society will need to address will be more profound.\nQuestions will include how to ensure that the economic gains associated with AI are\nbroadly shared across individuals and households, and how to adapt social institutions to\na world in which many more individuals in their prime working years may be working\nless. Fortunately, although this second scenario would entail many difficult challenges, it\nalso implies a world in which society has many more resources to deploy against those\nchallenges.\nThose are some of the big questions that society may need to grapple with in the\nfuture, and most of these questions are not those that will be primarily addressed by\nmonetary policymakers. As a central banker, I can speak more specifically about how\nstructural changes in the economy related to AI could affect monetary policy\nconsiderations—in particular, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate to promote maximum\nemployment and stable prices. Monetary policy considerations could be affected in many\nways; I will limit myself to two prominent possibilities.\nFirst, AI may require monetary policymakers to reassess our estimates of the\nnatural rate of unemployment, which informs our assessment of the cyclical state of the\neconomy and thus the appropriate stance of monetary policy. The natural rate, which we\ncall u*, is the unemployment rate that corresponds to the maximum level of employment\nthat can be maintained without producing undesirably high inflation. Among other\nthings, u* depends on the efficiency with which matches are formed between workers\nand firms, and it could rise if shifts in labor demand across industries and occupations\n\n- 15 -\nlead to skill mismatch and lengthy unemployment spells as workers retrain and switch\ncareers. The natural rate also depends on the demographic composition of the labor\nforce, which AI could affect. If AI shifts the workforce toward groups that have higher\nlabor force attachment but lower unemployment rates (such as college graduates), the\nresult could be downward pressure on u*. It should be stressed that u* is never directly\nobserved and is difficult to discern in real time. But economists use a wide range of\nmodels to estimate the natural rate, and we can use those models to see how u* is\nchanging as AI is adopted more widely.18\nAnother related consideration relevant for monetary policy is how economic\nchanges due to AI will affect the neutral interest rate, or r*, which is the level of the real\ninterest rate consistent with the economy being at its potential and inflation being at our 2\npercent objective. Economic theory suggests that a permanently higher growth rate of\nproductivity, of the kind that might arise under either AI scenario, tends to raise r*.\nWhen that happens, a higher real interest rate would be required to deliver any desired\nmonetary policy stance. A challenge that we face is that it is difficult to work out in real\ntime how r* is evolving. But we can make judgments about developments in the\n18 See Brandyn Bok, Richard K. Crump, Christopher J. Nekarda, and Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau (2023),\n“Estimating Natural Rates of Unemployment: A Primer,” Working Paper Series 2023-25 (San Francisco:\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, August), https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/wp2023-\n25.pdf. One approach for estimating u* is to aggregate across demographic groups that differ in their\naverage unemployment rates over long periods. Another common approach is to estimate state-space\nmodels that incorporate a Phillips curve relationship between unemployment and inflation, as in Thomas\nLaubach (2001), “Measuring the NAIRU: Evidence from Seven Economies,” Review of Economics and\nStatistics, vol. 83 (May), pp. 218–31. In addition, assessments of the natural rate can be informed by\nmodels that yield estimates of matching efficiency, such as Regis Barnichon and Andrew Figura (2015),\n“Labor Market Heterogeneity and the Aggregate Matching Function,” American Economic Journal:\nMacroeconomics, vol. 7 (October), pp. 222–49; and Hie Joo Ahn and Leland D. Crane (2020), “Dynamic\nBeveridge Curve Accounting,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-027 (Washington: Board\nof Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.027.\n\n- 16 -\nbehavior of r* by monitoring the relationship between economic activity and interest\nrates and by using financial market information to estimate longer-run real interest rates.\nConclusion\nI’ll return to the broader point and conclude. AI is poised to transform our\neconomy, likely in profound ways. But the speed and extent of that transformation are\nnot yet clear. AI is likely to boost productivity, increase scientific discovery, and\ntransform the nature of work. How these developments unfold will have important\nimplications for society and for central bankers.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n9:00 a.m. EDT\nSeptember 8, 2023\nThe Federal Reserve’s Role in Supporting Responsible Innovation\nRemarks by\nMichael S. Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nSeventh Annual Fintech Conference\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nSeptember 8, 2023\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak today, in the midst of a wave of\ninnovation in the payments system. There are a range of important players in the\npayments system and the Federal Reserve has important roles as a supervisor as well as a\npayments operator.\nRegardless of who is providing the service, our payments system needs to meet\nfundamental principles. Among those core principles is ensuring that the payments\ninfrastructure supports broad access and promotes financial inclusion. Payments are\nessential for everyday life, and too often, low- and moderate-income households and\nsmall businesses don’t have access to the payments services they need at a reasonable\ncost. Moreover, as the payments system evolves, it needs to provide strong consumer\nprotections. The payments system needs to welcome competition, provide consumers\nwith choices, and support innovation. The payments system should empower consumers\nto have better control over their financial lives, including their identity and financial data.\nAnd more broadly, our payments system should promote efficiency, convenience, speed,\nlow cost, resiliency, privacy, and security. Finally, our payments system must and does\nrely on trust, and this trust must be maintained as the system is updated. This includes\ntrust that the payments system is not used for illicit purposes, that lawful payments will\nalways be honored, and that neither the government nor private actors will act improperly\nbased on use of the payments infrastructure.\nNot that long ago, the Federal Reserve was facilitating payments by moving\nbundles of checks around the country on trucks and trains! And we still have important\nwork to do to ensure that those who rely on checks can get their funds in a timely way\nand that the system is not exposed to fraud.\n\n- 2 -\nBut more recently the focus has been on improving our electronic payments\ninfrastructure. The Fed has long operated the Fedwire Funds Service, used by banks to\nconduct large-value, same-day transactions among themselves. In addition, the\nautomated clearinghouse (ACH) service supports batch payments of more modest value.\nWhile the Fedwire Funds Service and ACH transactions have served the economy well\nfor decades, the economy has changed dramatically over that time. There is a demand for\nfaster payments, and the Fed has recognized that today’s households and businesses\nwould benefit from ready availability of funds 24x7.\nSo, in July, the Fed launched the FedNow Service®, a new service to make\ninstant payments secure and convenient. FedNow enables instant payments to be\nprocessed on any day of the year for a broad array of transactions. The FedNow Service\nis core payments infrastructure available to all depository institutions, including large\nbanks, regional banks, community banks, and credit unions. It is those institutions that\nwill determine whether real-time payments are available to everyone. We have provided\nthe rails. Innovation by private depository institutions will determine whether these\nservices reach a broad range of households and businesses. While current volumes on\nFedNow are small, I expect that participation will grow over time and be a significant\naddition to, and advance on, the existing payments infrastructure.\nI view the FedNow Service as complementary to the private sector instant\npayments services offered today, and as banks build on these rails, customers can get\nbetter service. Individuals could have instant access to their paychecks and be able to\nspend them same day, rather than waiting several days for checks to process. Or\nconsumers could pay bills at the last minute on the due date, potentially avoiding late\n\n- 3 -\nfees. And small businesses would benefit from timely payment as well. The benefits\ncould be far-reaching and will be especially significant for low- and moderate-income\nhouseholds.\nBanks and their service providers are already thinking creatively about how they\ncan leverage these new payments rails to meet customer needs for immediate funds\navailability. Efforts by banks to meet the demands of their customers will support more\nrobust offerings, and I look forward to engaging with banks about how they could be\nadvancing financial inclusion objectives with faster payments services.\nSeparately, we are engaged in efforts to understand the next generation of\npayments technology and how it can be used to support a secure and efficient payments\nsystem. As the pace of innovation increases, the payments landscape continues to evolve\nwith the emergence of new programmable payments platforms, including those built on\ndistributed ledger technology and blockchain technology, and new forms of digital assets,\nsuch as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\nGiven the new capabilities they could enable, we are seeing increased interest in and\nexperimentation with these innovative technologies. This experimentation is happening\nin the private and public sectors, both domestically and internationally. In my view, as\nboth the issuer of U.S. currency and an operator in the payments system, the Federal\nReserve must understand these developments and the tradeoffs they introduce. Our\nengagement with innovation is crucial so that we can continue to support a safe and\nefficient payments system into the future.\nWe continue to speak to a broad range of stakeholders and conduct basic research\nin emerging technologies that might support a CBDC payments backbone, or for other\n\n- 4 -\npurposes in the existing payments system. For example, the Fed’s CBDC research\nprogram is currently focused on system architecture, notably how ledgers that record\nownership of and transactions in digital assets are maintained, secured, and verified, as\nwell as tokenization models—that is, the design of the digital analog to the paper bank\nnote that permits a transfer of value between two parties without direct facilitation by the\nissuing central bank.\nOf course, investigation and research are very different from decision making\nabout next steps in terms of payments system development, and we are a long way from\nthat. The Federal Reserve has made no decision on issuing a CBDC and would only\nproceed with the issuance of a CBDC with clear support from the executive branch and\nauthorizing legislation from Congress. Given the importance of this infrastructure,\ninvestigating the potential opportunities, risks, and tradeoffs for payments innovation is\njust one way the Fed fulfills its role in supporting the responsible innovation that enables\na safe and efficient U.S. payments system.\nNow let me turn my attention to recent actions by the Federal Reserve that are\naimed at promoting responsible innovation in financial services more broadly. Last\nmonth, the Federal Reserve announced that it has created a novel activities supervision\nprogram to focus on the supervision of risks posed by novel, technology-driven activities\nat banks.1 At present, these activities include those involving crypto-assets, distributed\nledger technology, and complex technology-driven bank partnerships with nonbank\nfintechs. That said, this program will grow as new technologies emerge. By dedicating a\n1 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Provides Additional\nInformation on Its Program to Supervise Novel Activities in the Banks It Oversees,” press release, August\n8, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230808a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nteam of supervisory experts to the oversight of novel, technology-driven activities, our\naim is to provide clarity as well as timely and relevant feedback to the institutions we\nsupervise. We want them to continue to work to take advantage of innovations, while\nalso supporting their ongoing safety and soundness.\nOne innovation that crosses both payments provision and bank safety and\nsoundness issues is stablecoins, which can also be described as digital tokens that aim to\nmaintain a stable value relative to a government-issued currency, such as the U.S. dollar.\nWhen an asset is pegged to a government-issued currency, it is a form of private money.\nWhen that asset is also used as a means of payment and a store of value, it borrows the\ntrust of the central bank. So, the Federal Reserve has a strong interest in ensuring that\nany stablecoin offerings operate within an appropriate federal prudential oversight\nframework, so they do not threaten financial stability or payments system integrity.\nTo provide clarity for banks interested in engaging with these assets, we recently\nissued guidance on the process by which a Fed-supervised bank can seek to obtain a\nsupervisory non-objection before issuing, holding, or transacting in “dollar tokens.”2 As\nthe Board of Governors announced in January, before those banks engage in these\nactivities, they are advised to obtain a written supervisory non-objection from the Fed\nverifying that they have appropriate risk management and systems in place to identify\nand control potential risks, such as those related to cybersecurity and compliance with\nanti-money-laundering laws.3\n2 Board of Governors, “Federal Reserve Board Provides Additional Information on Its Program.”\n3 This requirement is consistent with the supervisory nonobjection requirement applicable to national banks\npursuant to interpretive letters issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. (See OCC\nInterpretive Letter No. 1174 (January 4, 2021) and OCC Interpretive Letter No. 1179 (November 18,\n2021).)\n\n- 6 -\nThe guidance only covers the activities of the banks over which we have\nsupervisory authority. But there are big risks when the Federal Reserve does not have\ndirect supervisory and regulatory authority. I remain deeply concerned about stablecoin\nissuance without strong federal oversight. As I mentioned earlier, stablecoins are a form\nof money, and the ultimate source of credibility in money is the central bank. If non-\nfederally regulated stablecoins were to become a widespread means of payment and store\nof value, they could pose significant risks to financial stability, monetary policy, and the\nU.S. payments system. It is important to get the legislative and regulatory framework\nright before significant risks emerge. We appreciate the work Congress has been doing\non this important issue and look forward to further engagement to ensure that there is a\nrobust federal framework for all stablecoins.\nAs everyone in this room knows, innovation never stops. We are continuing to\nexplore new technologies so we can continue to support a robust payments system that\nmeets the needs of the public. We are committed to supporting responsible innovation,\nboth through our provision of payments rails and through timely and relevant supervisory\nfeedback to the institutions we supervise.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to engage in exploring new technologies,\nincluding those that could be used to further advance our provision of payments rails. As\nI mentioned, this work involves continuing to study the next generation of ledger\ntechnology. In conclusion, I want to applaud the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nfor supporting the stakeholders coming together at these conferences, giving us\nopportunities to learn from each other as we engage in this important work.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nAmerican University School of Public Affairs\nGraduation Ceremony\nWashington, D.C.\nMay 10, 2024\n\nCongratulations, Class of 2024! Let me also congratulate your families, friends, teachers,\nmentors, and everyone else who believed in you and supported you on the path that brought you\nhere today. Thank you, President Burwell, Provost Wilkins, and Dean Jacknowitz.\nBefore I came to the Federal Reserve, I led the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at\nthe University of Michigan for five years, so I am used to addressing public policy graduates in\nMay, wearing a robe, and praying it won’t rain for the afterparty. Or in Michigan, hail! It is an\nhonor to be able to join in this celebration of you completing your studies and entering a new and\nexciting stage of your lives. This is particularly special to me, as later in life my mom went back\nto school at American University (AU) to earn her master’s in education. Today, May 10, would\nhave been her birthday—so I can celebrate your path forward and honor her memory.\nI had a chance to speak with a few of your classmates last week, and they gave me a\nwindow into the passion and commitment that you bring to your work. It is easy right now for\nsome to look at the world and be cynical about the possibility of making it a better place. But in\nso many ways, the world is a much better place than it was 50 or 100 years ago, in large part\nthanks to people like you who’ve gone into public policy. In my personal experience, I’ve seen\nmany things get better over the course of my professional lifetime. I can see it now in the work\nthat we do at the Federal Reserve. And most importantly, I can see it in each of you.\nSometimes, it’s easy to look at the government or a large corporation or even the\nnonprofit sector and see some large, distant kind of entity. But the government is made up of\nindividual human beings. You, your friends and your colleagues, your predecessors here at AU,\nand the people who will come after you. Those individuals make a big difference.\nAnd that’s true the moment you leave school. Early on, for example, I worked as a\nspecial assistant for Bob Rubin when he was the Secretary of the Treasury. And one of the first\n\n- 2 -\nthings I noticed when he hosted a meeting was that he didn’t involve just the top people in the\nTreasury Department. He included the people who were closer to the issue, such as a research\nassistant or junior analyst. And he would ask them questions and engage them, and he cared\nwhat they thought about the issue. While they didn’t necessarily have the same judgment or\ncontext as more senior people, they had a lot of knowledge and analytic chops and sometimes a\nnew way of thinking about a problem.\nAnd I’ve carried that approach to my job today. Many of the people in my meetings at\nthe Federal Reserve are quite junior in the organization, but they speak up in a way that can\nchange how I think about a problem. Please know that you can make a difference as a very\njunior person and in a very large organization.\nEven if today marks the conclusion of your time in the classroom, it isn’t the end of your\neducation. The best career advice that I can offer is also the best advice for a happy life—\nwhatever you do, try to put yourself in a position where you are always learning, every day. This\nis something my father—a labor lawyer by day and a poet by night—tried to live by. Seeking\nout a role where you are learning every day will guide you to work that stimulates and motivates\nyou, making you a more knowledgeable and hopefully wiser person, even when the lessons\nimparted are hard ones. As they often are.\nThis striving to always be learning has guided me to fulfilling work and it has told me, at\ntimes, when I needed to take a risk and put myself out there. I was not anyone’s first choice for\nthe job I have now, or the job leading the Ford School, or running point on financial reform at\nTreasury. But I did all of those things. As you will in your lives, when opportunities come along\nthat you never expected.\n\n- 3 -\nWhen I was graduating, I had no idea what I would eventually do in life. And that was\nscary. That is okay. That is normal. You don’t need to know what you want to do for the rest of\nyour life. None of us older people know that either. We’re figuring it out as we go.\nI’ve just mentioned one of the ingredients to doing your best—learning every day and\nbeing open to new opportunities even if they are scary—but another more obvious one is effort.\nIt has become more common nowadays to recognize the costs of working too hard, and that is a\ngood thing. But I hope that this emphasis on work-life balance does not deprive you of the\nsatisfaction, and sometimes, joy, that can come from working incredibly hard toward a goal that\nyou find meaningful. Most things worth doing in life are hard.\nAnd if you do want to get anything done in the world, you need a team. There’s a\nMichigan saying: “the team, the team, the team,” and it’s a good one. You can’t do things alone.\nCertainly, the work that I have found most impactful, whether intellectually or to the world, has\nbeen with other people. The work I'm proudest of, as an academic, is work that I did with a\npsychologist and an economist on behaviorally informed financial regulation. In the process, we\nchanged the way each of us thought about crucial questions we were considering. What an\namazing gift to be able to do that with colleagues.\nAlong with working hard to achieve your goals, being open to new opportunities, and\nworking as a team, I think it is also important to be tough. Partly, this means being resilient\nbecause life is not a continuous march to the top. I’ve failed many times. There will be criticism\nand setbacks, and it is how you respond, constructively, to those developments that will matter\nmuch more than the progress you make when things are going great. I use the word “tough”\nbecause, more than just resilience, sometimes it will be necessary for you to be tough with\n\n- 4 -\nothers. Sometimes you will have to tell colleagues, or even bosses, that they are wrong.\nSometimes, you’ll have to decide whether to take a stand.\nAnd sometimes being tough requires you to be tough with yourself. When you are in jobs\nlike mine, things go wrong all the time. And it’s important to understand that when things go\nwrong, it is your responsibility. It’s not somebody on your team’s fault. Your team is giving\nyou the best inputs they can. So having the ability to not point a finger at other people, and to\npoint it at yourself, and understand that you are accountable and responsible, is an important part\nof being a leader.\nBeing tough doesn’t mean being hard or insensitive. One can be resilient, make tough\ndecisions, and stand up to pressure in ways that treat people with respect—the kind of respect\nthat you hope others will show you. One of the primary ways that we show respect for others is\nto listen. If you are always learning, that means you are always listening, taking on board what\nyou hear from others, even if it is very unwelcome, and perhaps, adjusting your views and\ngaining knowledge from that input. And it means talking in a way that others can hear.\nOne can make tough decisions and hold people to high standards while treating others\nwell. Treating others well, for me, boils down to a simple rule—don’t be a jerk. All of us have\nhad enough experiences with others acting like jerks to understand this advice, but it’s a bit\nharder when applied to yourself. At least for me it is.\nHumility is an attribute that I consider essential to avoid being a jerk. Life often gives\none the opportunity to learn and relearn the lesson of humility—and I am humbled every day.\nHumility is recognizing the limits of knowledge, confidence, and self-regard. It is the line\nbetween what we truly know and understand, and what we don’t really know and cannot grasp.\n\n- 5 -\nHumility means being open to new information, to weighing information in an objective\nway, and being able to take on that input and sometimes change one’s mind. In a practical way,\nit means being open to and seriously considering the views of others, and in that sense, it is often\na vital way to connect with other people.\nLet me leave you today with two words, the most important two words that you will ever\nknow, or ever say. Those words are “thank you.” “Thank you” means the recognition that\nsomeone has done something valuable for you. Gratitude binds us together. So please turn to\nyour parents, your partners, your friends and other family, your teachers and mentors, your\nfellow students, and say, thank you.\nCongratulations, Class of 2024, and thank you, for listening to me today.",

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\n2025 Community Banking Research Conference\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nOctober 8, 2025\n\nThank you for the invitation to speak to you today.1 I value the opportunity to\nspend time with community bankers and fellow federal and state bank regulators. This\nconference, now in its 13th year, is always a great forum for those interactions. All of us\nbenefit from the research presented here, which helps us understand the opportunities for\nbanks to strengthen communities, and the challenges that community banks face. So, I\nwant to thank the researchers presenting. Thank you also to the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) for\nco-sponsoring this gathering, and to the Federal Reserve staff who each year do their part\nto bring it about. More broadly, I very much appreciate the close and longstanding\ncollaboration between the Federal Reserve, the CSBS, and the FDIC.\nThroughout my career, a major focus of my work has been building stronger\ncommunities. To do much of that building, households and small businesses need access\nto credit, and I have known for a long time that community banks and community\nbankers play an indispensable role in the towns, rural areas, and cities they serve.\nStronger community banks mean stronger communities.\nCommunity banks, sometimes the only banking option in a community, offer a\nconsequential difference in customer experience. Even in communities that may also\nhave local branches of larger banks, there is often a considerable, and I think meaningful,\ndifferentiation in the customer satisfaction at a community bank. At branches of larger\nbanks, the customer experience can be subject to layers of authorizations involving phone\ncalls and approvals (or denials) from people who are not part of the community and may\nlack a deep understanding of local industries and conditions. Much of this relates to the\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board and the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nunderstandable need for larger institutions to adopt more standardized and centralized\nprocesses, powered by technology, to boost efficiency and lower costs. It is easier than\never before to apply for an increasing variety of loans online, and this is something that\ncommunity banks are taking advantage of as well. But this is where the benefit that\ncommunity banks provide really shows.\nCommunity bankers are part of their communities. They know and care about\ntheir customers. They have an inherent advantage in understanding the needs and the\nchallenges of local businesses and households. This is not just a matter of being friendly\nand welcoming to customers. Beyond the numbers on a loan application, what\ncommunity bankers understand about their neighbors is “soft information” that can be\nused to make better credit decisions. Relationship banking, especially with local business\nowners, is critical for those businesses—but also for community banks—because it gives\nthem an ongoing edge in the ever-intensifying competition from larger banks and\nnonbank lenders. Knowing your customer is also crucial in preventing crime, such as\nfraud, which remains a top concern for community bankers.\nThe pressure of competition is a very real challenge for community banks, but the\nadvantages I speak of are real as well. I know you heard yesterday from several banks,\nincluding those that are modestly sized and have competed very effectively with much\nlarger banks. Community banks have earned the trust and the business of people in their\ncommunities because of an understanding that the banks’ successes depend on their\ncommunities succeeding. Those common interests are a powerful force that drives\ncustomer retention amid all the competition.\n\nWhat is the future of community banking? I note that the session immediately\nafter my remarks today is “Innovation and Technology in Small Business Lending.”\nIndeed, technology is a big part of this year’s conference, so you won’t be surprised to\nhear me say that I believe it is a big part of what will determine the future of community\nbanking. I know you’ve already gotten the results of this year’s Annual Survey of\nCommunity Banks by CSBS, where “technology and related costs” ranked second as a\nconcern, behind only cybersecurity, which is itself largely about technology. Most\nrespondents said that the adoption of new or emerging technologies was very or\nextremely important, and not a single banker said it wasn’t important at all.\nUntil fairly recently, the big technological disruption in banking came from\nfintech and an onslaught of new lending from nonbanks. This year’s CSBS survey\nreported the largest-ever increase in respondents who saw heightened competition from\nnonbank payment services firms. Larger banks are also competing with community\nbanks online. Increased choice for small businesses and consumers is a good thing, but\ncommunity banks have had to continue to innovate to compete. Community banks often\nturn to third-party service providers to help them offer products and services to compete\nwith larger banks and fintechs. Managing the risks related to these third-party\narrangements has been a considerable job for community banks. The Fed and other\nregulators have offered guidance about this task, to serve as a resource and to make the\nsupervisory implications of third-party risk management as predictable as possible.\nAs with many of the big questions facing community banking, technology\nrepresents risk and opportunity. It allows community banks to reach customers more\neffectively and to offer new products and services, but it also demands investment and\n\nvigilance. One of the challenges for community banks is to adopt technologies or form\npartnerships that allow them to deepen customer relationships but not attenuate or replace\nthem. In interactions with Federal Reserve supervisors about third-party services, banks\ntell us that they hear a lot of sales pitches for algorithmic lending, outsourcing customer\nservice, and the like, when what they are really looking for is an app that can enhance\nrelationship banking: their natural advantage.\nAny discussion about technological advances has to give prominent attention to\nartificial intelligence, and I note that later this morning a paper on the use of AI\ntechnology will be part of an upcoming session. Before I get into what AI might mean\nfor community banking, let me say that AI has been of particular interest to me, and I\nhave spoken about it several times this year, because of the technology’s potential to\ntransform both our economy, and in other fundamental ways, how we live and interact\nwith each other in society.2 While there is high uncertainty about these outcomes, I\nbelieve that the speed at which AI is being implemented means that we should all be\nthinking about the full range of possibilities and be prepared for any one of them to come\nto pass, perhaps sooner than we think.\nAI was included for the first time in the CSBS survey in 2024, when AI for\ncustomer support was an important focus for 31 percent of respondents, a share that\njumped to 47 percent in this year’s survey. Of course, earlier forms of AI have been used\nby larger banks in customer service for many years, and the big development for\n2 See Michael S. Barr, “Artificial Intelligence and the Labor Market: A Scenario-Based Approach,” speech\ndelivered at the Reykjavík Economic Conference 2025, Central Bank of Iceland, Reykjavík, Iceland, May\n9, 2025, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm.\n\ncommunity banks seems to be that newer forms of GenAI could be lowering costs and\nexpanding access enough to make it cost-effective for smaller institutions.\nCustomer service is one obvious area where AI could change community banking,\nbut there are others. Cybersecurity and fraud have been and continue to be leading\nconcerns for community bankers, and AI represents new opportunities for addressing\nthese concerns. It is my understanding that automated fraud detection, in particular,\nhasn’t been cost effective for some community banks, which haven’t been able to\ncompete with larger banks that have the economies of scale to deploy these services. But\nthe huge buildout in AI capacity now underway, along with the explosion in the number\nof firms seeking to get into AI-based services, may have the potential for driving down\ncosts enough to make AI-based fraud detection more feasible for community banks.\nYet, AI represents new risks as well as new opportunities.3 In addition to\ncommunity banks worrying about criminals defrauding them or their customers with\nforgeries on checks or in credit card transactions, they face a new threat from entirely\nforged identities, with so-called “deepfakes.” Deepfakes use GenAI to recreate voices\nand images of real people, allowing fraudsters to hold convincing conversations using\nsimulated voices that sound like the individual they are impersonating, responding in\nways that person might realistically respond. Using only a brief sample of audio and\naccess to information about individuals on the internet, criminals employing GenAI can\nimpersonate a close relative in a crisis or a high-value bank client seeking to complete a\ntransaction at their bank. What was once the stuff of movies is now a reality, and a lot is\n3 See Michael S. Barr, “Deepfakes and the AI Arms Race in Bank Cybersecurity,” speech delivered at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, NY, April 17, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250417a.htm.\n\nat stake. The direct and indirect costs of all cybercrimes have already grown from 1\npercent to 10 percent of global gross domestic product.4 The use of deepfakes in\ncybercrime is growing very quickly. According to one source, there has been a\ntwentyfold increase in deepfake attacks over the last three years.5\nCommunity bankers also need to be aware of the potential for AI to affect\ncustomers’ livelihoods. I tend to be an optimist about the potential for AI to make\nworkers more productive, raise living standards, and create more jobs in new industries,\nbut I am realistic in my expectation that it could cause considerable dislocation of\nworkers and businesses, at least in the short run.6 Communities dependent on a small\nnumber of employers or a single industry that is significantly affected by AI could\nexperience these dislocations. At the same time, the large investments underway in data\ncenters, many of them in remote or rural areas where electricity is less expensive, could\nbring new business for community banks. For example, during the most recent\nCommunity Advisory Council (CAC) meeting, the Federal Reserve Board heard about a\nmajor data center built in Ellendale, North Dakota, a community of less than 1,500\npeople. The CAC member noted that the addition of a major data center had vastly\nincreased the community’s needs for services. At this point it is hard to tell how much AI\n4 International Monetary Fund, Global Financial Stability Report, Chapter 3 (October 2024).

I have spoken about the advent of\nfintech, and the way it is transforming banking and competition between community\nbanks and larger banks—risks and opportunities. I have spoken about technology more\ngenerally, and specifically about how artificial intelligence may change the economy and\nbanking. Many of these uncertainties echo those that most workers and businesses are\nfacing in our fast-evolving economy. One group of people that I believe have dealt very\neffectively with a changing economy are community bankers. Considering the changes\nthat have swept over our banking and financial system over the decades, if you are a\ncommunity banker sitting here today, that itself is a testament to your ingenuity,\nresilience, and adaptability. But I would be remiss if I didn’t discuss a further challenge\nto community banks in this regulatory environment—deregulation of large banks.\nAs community bankers well know, it was not community banks that fueled the\n2008 financial crisis—it was the largest, most complex firms whose excessive risk-taking\nnearly brought down the system. In the years since, strong reforms—higher capital,\ntougher liquidity requirements, and rigorous stress testing—have helped to safeguard our\neconomy. Yet recent proposed rollbacks in capital standards for the largest banks, in the\nsupervisory framework for large financial institutions, and in the rigor of stress testing of\nlarge banks threaten to erode those protections. These shifts would not make the system\nsafer; they would leave community banks once again exposed to the fallout if the largest\nplayers stumble. Because we cannot afford to repeat those mistakes, I have spoken out\nagainst weakening standards for large banks, and I will continue to do so.\n\nIn closing, I’ll note my admiration for community bankers who know how to\nconfront uncertainty, to sort out the risks and the opportunities, and make the decisions\nand investments that have allowed community banks to continue to play the\nindispensable role you serve for your customers and communities. We all share an\ninterest in responsible regulation, which means promoting the safety and soundness of\ncommunity banks and compliance with applicable law but also ensuring that regulation is\nappropriate to the size, business model, and risk profile of regulated institutions. We all\nwant community banks to succeed and continue to play their important role in the\ncommunities they serve. One reason that I believe community banking has a bright\nfuture is that all the people here today recognize the unique and essential function of\ncommunity banks in our financial system and are helping to support community banking.\nThank you.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nConference on Measuring Cyber Risk in the Financial Services Sector\nBoston, Massachusetts\nJanuary 17, 2024\n\nThank you for the opportunity to welcome you to day two of the second annual\nConference on Measuring Cyber Risk in the Financial Services Sector.1 I’d like to thank\nthe staff who organized this gathering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and the Federal Reserve Board.\nCyber threats are constantly evolving, and we can expect them to become\nincreasingly disruptive as technology advances and our financial system becomes more\ninterconnected. In the past few months, ransomware attacks have disrupted the ability of\nsome financial institutions to offer a variety of banking and market services, including\nTreasury clearance and settlement and access to online banking and ATM operations.\nThese incidents were resolved without significant disruption to the broader market, but\nthey are stark reminders of the potential for cyber incidents to generate broader, even\nsystemic risks, and the importance of addressing these risks.\nCybersecurity preparedness has become increasingly important for banks. Banks\nmust take action to uncover vulnerabilities in their systems and remedy those\nvulnerabilities before attacks occur. But focusing on cyber defense is not sufficient. It is\nimportant that banks also focus on resilience to successful cyber-attacks, including by\ndeveloping and regularly testing business continuity plans.\nThe Federal Reserve and other banking agencies work to make sure that banks\nand service providers are appropriately focused on cybersecurity and operational\nresilience. Supervisors will continue to reinforce the need for appropriate risk\nmanagement.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board.\n\n- 2 -\nReliance by banks on third-party service providers has grown considerably in\nrecent years, and with that reliance comes the potential for greater cyber risk.2 It is\nultimately the responsibility of banks to manage their third-party risk, and we have\nhistorically seen gaps in this regard. Last year, together with the other bank regulatory\nagencies, the Federal Reserve adopted guidance on effective management of third-party\nrisk, based on the size and complexity of the bank and nature of the third-party\nrelationship. The guidance provides some specific examples throughout the lifecycle of a\nthird-party relationship, which should be helpful for banks as they strengthen their\nmanagement of these risks.\nForums like today’s conference are critical to improve how we think about and\nmeasure the presence of cyber risk in financial markets. The ability to better measure\ncyber risk will allow banks and supervisors to improve their understanding of the direct\nand indirect costs of a cyber disruption. An incident poses direct costs on an affected\nbank and its customers, as well as indirect costs to other market participants who are\nconnected to the affected bank. For instance, researchers at the New York Federal\nReserve Bank recently modeled how a cyber incident could be transmitted through the\nU.S. financial system under a variety of circumstances.3 The authors estimate how the\nimpairment of a single large bank, a group of smaller banks, or a common service\nprovider could be transmitted through the payments system and result in significant\nspillovers to other banks. Spillovers to the broader financial system are estimated to be\n2 See, e.g., Kotidis, Antonis, and Stacey L.

In addition, the researchers\nestimate that the potential impact of a cyberattack is systematically greater during\nstressed financial conditions. This indicates that we need a deeper understanding of how\ncyber risk interacts with traditional challenges to financial stability.4 Many of the\nparticipants in today's conference are working on research that will advance our\nknowledge of cyber risk and financial stability, and I am looking forward to continuing to\nfollow work in this area.\nDespite progress in recent years, techniques to quantify cyber risk are still at a\nnascent stage, in part because of a lack of good data. Better data on cyber threats and\nvulnerabilities will enable us to identify and assess threats to banks and the financial\nsystem. In addition, improved data on interconnectedness between financial institutions\nand service providers will help identify and measure the impact of an incident on the\nbroader financial system. The ability to quickly identify patterns, connections, and\nvulnerabilities will enable quick response, and may mean the difference between a\ncontrolled event and one that has a serious impact. We are supporting efforts to further\nstudy this subject through public-private coordination groups. In addition, cyber incident\nreporting will provide better data on the frequency, severity, and locality of cyber\nincidents that will enhance our collective ability to respond to these events.\nI am heartened to see that many of the attendees and speakers at this conference\ncome not just from the United States, but also from around the globe.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:00 a.m. EDT\nJuly 10, 2023\nHolistic Capital Review\nRemarks by\nMichael S. Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nBipartisan Policy Center\nWashington DC\nJuly 10, 2023\n\nThank you to the Bipartisan Policy Center for the opportunity to speak today. I’m\nhere to report on my holistic review of capital for large banks and to outline steps that I\nbelieve are appropriate to update our capital standards so that banks can continue to serve\nour communities, households, and businesses.1\nThe review was a top priority because capital is fundamental to safety and\nsoundness. I approached the task with humility. We need to be skeptical about the\nability of bank managers or regulators to anticipate all emerging risks. Events over the\npast few months have only reinforced the need for humility and skepticism, and for an\napproach that makes banks resilient to both familiar and unanticipated risks.\nOur dynamic financial system is complex and constantly evolving. Regulators\nand bank managers are limited in our ability to comprehensively identify risks and to\nmeasure them. We cannot fully appreciate how a specific vulnerability can interact with\nother vulnerabilities to amplify and propagate risk in the face of a shock, or multiple\nshocks. It is extremely difficult to identify shocks in advance. And we also cannot fully\npredict how firms and markets adapt to changes in the environment or to the behavior of\nregulators or other participants.\nSo, instead of trying to design rules to address every conceivable risk, regulators\nmust focus broadly on resilience—ensuring that banks and the financial system can\nwithstand challenges, wherever they emerge and however they are transmitted through\nthe system. Fortunately, there is a component of bank funding—equity capital—that is\n1 The views I express here are my own, and not those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nwell suited to building resilience.2 Banks rely on both debt and capital to fund loans and\nother assets, but capital is what allows the bank to take a loss and keep on operating. The\nbeauty of capital is that it doesn’t care about the source of the loss. Whatever the\nvulnerability or the shock, capital is able to help absorb the resulting loss and, if\nsufficient, allow the bank to keep serving its critical role in the economy. Higher levels\nof capital also provide incentives to a bank’s managers and shareholders to prudently\nmanage the bank’s risk, since they bear more of the risk of the bank’s activities.\nHolistic Review of Capital Standards\nI initiated a review of capital standards as one of my first actions as Vice Chair for\nSupervision. This review was focused on capital requirements for large banks with more\nthan $100 billion in total assets. Capital requirements are multi-layered with different\ncomponents. A holistic approach is important because the requirements function as a\nsystem—each component treats risks and associated capital needs differently, but all\ncomponents together result in a certain amount of capital required. Banks manage their\noperations with an eye on the entire system, and as such, adjustments to one part of the\nregime may imply adjustments to another.\nTo that end, over the last nine months, I have engaged with a wide range of\nparties: policymakers and staff from the Federal Reserve and other agencies, banks and\nfinancial sector groups, public interest groups, members of Congress, and academics to\nget a broad perspective on how the Fed’s capital standards interact with each other and\nthe result they together achieve. In the midst of this review, we once again learned the\n2 For a more in-depth discussion of why bank capital matters, see my speech in December 2022 on this\ntopic: Michael S. Barr, “Why Bank Capital Matters,” (speech at the American Enterprise Institute,\nWashington, DC, December 1, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20221201a.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nimportance of resilience when a sudden bank run and contagion caused three large banks\nto fail and we experienced significant stress in the banking system, stemmed only by\ninvocation of the systemic risk exception and creation of an emergency lending facility.\nThis should make us very humble indeed.\nI reviewed whether changes would be appropriate to better align capital\nrequirements with risk-taking, to help ensure that our banking system is sufficiently\nresilient to serve its vital role in our economy. Any proposed changes would go through\nthe standard notice-and-comment rulemaking process, allowing all interested parties\nample time to weigh in on the proposed changes. Any final changes to capital\nrequirements would occur with appropriate transition times.\nI will be pursuing further changes to regulation and supervision in response to the\nrecent banking stress, including how we regulate and supervise liquidity, interest rate\nrisk, and incentive compensation, as well as improving the speed, agility, and force of the\nFederal Reserve’s supervision. I expect to have more to say on these topics in the\ncoming months.\nMultiple Measures of Risk\nOur system of capital requirements uses multiple measures of risk, which work\ncollectively to achieve an overall level of resilience. We have a set of risk-based\nrequirements that are based on the risk of a bank’s activities to its safety and soundness\nand to the financial system, and a set of non-risk-sensitive backstops, which are simple\nmeasures the market and regulators can use to understand and protect against the\npossibility that the risk-sensitive measures get the risk wrong and result in capital\nrequirements that are too low. And we use stress testing as a complement to point-in-\n\n- 4 -\ntime capital requirements. Stress tests measure bank resilience against a hypothetical\nshock. These equity capital requirements are complemented by long-term debt\nrequirements, which help provide an additional cushion to restructure, sell, or wind down\na bank that has entered resolution.\nThese multiple ways of measuring and mitigating risk are helpful for the\nresiliency of banks and the robustness of the system. Any single way of measuring bank\nrisk would miss or underplay some aspect of risk, and each of the different approaches\ntends to measure risks not captured or measured as well by the others. Further, a capital\nframework with multiple ways of measuring risk is harder for banks to game.\nOf course, there are also downsides to having multiple approaches to measuring\nrisk in calculating capital requirements. The greater complexity itself introduces risk.\nBut on balance, I think multiple approaches are warranted.\nConclusion of the Holistic Review\nNow let me turn to the conclusion of the holistic review. In sum, I believe that\nthe existing approach to capital requirements is sound. As a result, my proposals build on\nthat foundation. The existing approach includes the risk-based requirements, stress\ntesting, the risk-based capital buffers, and the leverage requirements and buffers. Let me\nquickly summarize the proposal and then turn to each in more detail.\nWith respect to risk-based requirements, the standards should be updated to better\nreflect credit, trading, and operational risk. To help promote international comparability,\nthe updates to the standards should be consistent with international standards adopted by\nthe Basel Committee. The international standards were developed through a rigorous,\nlengthy process, have been under discussion for nearly a decade and will improve on the\n\n- 5 -\nextent to which capital requirements fully reflect the risks posed by different banks\nengaged in a variety of activities.\nWith respect to stress testing, I believe that the stress capital buffer framework is\nsound.3 At the same time, I believe that the stress test should continue to evolve to better\ncapture risk. The exploratory analysis conducted this year demonstrates the capacity of\nsupervisory stress testing to test for a wider range of risks and the value of doing so. Any\nchanges to the stress test should be complementary to the changes to the risk-based\ncapital framework I mentioned above.\nWith respect to the other capital buffers—the global systemically important bank\n(G-SIB) surcharge4 and the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB)5—I am not\nrecommending fundamental changes. For the G-SIB surcharge, I am recommending that\nwe improve the measurement of systemic indicators under the G-SIB surcharge\nframework, reduce “cliff effects,” and increase the sensitivity of the surcharge to changes\nin a bank’s risk profile.\nWith respect to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR), I am not\nrecommending changes to the calibration at this time. With the revisions in risk-based\ncapital requirements I mentioned above, the eSLR generally would not act as the binding\nconstraint at the holding company level, where Treasury market intermediation occurs.\n3 The stress capital buffer framework uses the results of the supervisory stress test to calibrate a risk-\nsensitive buffer above a firm’s minimum risk-based capital requirements. A firm whose capital ratios are at\nor below its minimum plus its stress capital buffer requirements and any applicable global systemically\nimportant bank (G-SIB) surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) is subject to automatic\nrestrictions on capital distributions.\n4 The G-SIB surcharge requires a firm that is identified as a global systemically important bank holding\ncompany to hold additional capital based on a measure of the firm’s systemic risk.\n5 The CCyB requires a firm to hold additional capital when systemic vulnerabilities are meaningfully above\nnormal.\n\n- 6 -\nWe will carefully monitor Treasury market intermediation, and if problems arise, will\nconsider appropriate policy responses.\nBasel III Endgame\nAn important aspect of my proposals will be to implement the changes to the\nrisk-based capital requirements, referred to as the Basel III endgame, which are intended\nto ensure that our minimum capital requirements require banks to hold adequate capital\nagainst their risk-taking. There was a consensus among the Basel jurisdictions that\ncurrent rules underestimate risks for the largest, most complex banks. The proposed\nreforms reflect our current understanding of risks and how to best measure those risks.\nThe international agreement to implement these reforms was finalized more than five\nyears ago, in 2017. Implementing these reforms in a timely way is important, and I am\npleased we are beginning that process. And lastly, before I walk through the main areas\nof changes, I’d like to emphasize that any changes would not be fully effective for some\nyears because of the notice and comment rulemaking process and any final rule would\nprovide for an appropriate transition.\nFirst, for a firm’s lending activities, the proposed rules would end the practice of\nrelying on banks’ own individual estimates of their own risk and instead use a more\ntransparent and consistent approach. Currently, large banks use their own internal\nmodels to estimate certain types of credit risk. These internal models for credit risk\nsuffer from several deficiencies. Experience suggests that banks tend to underestimate\ntheir credit risk because they have a strong incentive to lower their capital requirements.\nIn addition, the data doesn’t lend itself to robust modeling and back testing in some cases\nbecause defaults are relatively infrequent. And estimates of credit risk for similar\n\n- 7 -\nexposures can vary substantially across firms. So, skepticism is in order. Standardized\ncredit risk approaches—meaning we apply the same requirements to each bank and not\nlet each bank develop their own requirements—appear to do a reasonably good job of\napproximating risks. And we have the additional rigor of a supervisory stress test to\nassess the credit risk of lending activities.\nSecond, for a firm’s trading activities, the proposed rules would adjust the way\nthat the firm measures market risk, which is the risk of loss from movements in market\nprices, such as interest rate, equity price, foreign exchange, and commodities risk. The\nproposed changes better align market risk capital requirements with market risk exposure\nand provide supervisors with improved tools. The proposal would continue to permit\nfirms to use internal models to capture the complex dynamics of most market risks but\nwould not rely on banks modeling certain market risks that are too hard to model.\nInternal models of market risk can be more readily validated than internal models of\ncredit risk because they are based on daily data and outcomes generally are known\nrelatively quickly. The proposal would raise model quality standards. Firms would also\nbe required to model risk at the level of individual trading desks for particular asset\nclasses, instead of at the firm level. The proposal would also introduce a standardized\napproach that is well-aligned with the modeled approach, for use where the modeled\napproach is not feasible.\nThese changes would raise market risk capital requirements by correcting for gaps\nin the current rules. Requiring banks to model market risk at the level of individual\ntrading desks better reflects the observation that correlations across risks can change\ndramatically in times of stress. Requiring banks to use a standardized approach for hard-\n\n- 8 -\nto-model risks is appropriate, in light of the weaknesses that were exposed in the 2008\nfinancial crisis, when many firms did not have acceptable models for their risks. In\naddition, the proposal appropriately charges more capital for positions that are less liquid,\nin order to better capture the risks of illiquid trading positions.\nThird, for operational losses—such as trading losses or litigation expenses—the\nproposed rules would replace an internal modeled operational risk requirement with a\nstandardized measure. The proposal would approximate a firm’s operational risk charge\nbased on the firm’s activities, and adjust the charge upward based on a firm’s historical\noperational losses to add risk sensitivity and provide firms with an incentive to mitigate\ntheir operational risk.\nOne important question involves the size of institutions that the new risk-based\ncapital rules should apply to, and I will recommend that the enhanced capital rules apply\nto banks and bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in assets. A threshold of\n$100 billion would subject more banks to our most risk-sensitive capital rules compared\nto the current framework, which applies to firms that are internationally active or have\n$700 billion or more in assets. This expanded scope is appropriate for two reasons. First,\nthe proposed rules are less burdensome for banks to implement than the current\nrequirements, since they don’t require a bank to develop a suite of internal credit risk and\noperational risk models to calculate regulatory capital. Second, our recent experience\nshows that even banks of this size can cause stress that spreads to other institutions and\nthreatens financial stability. The risk of contagion implies that we need a greater degree\nof resilience for these firms than we previously thought, as the losses posed to society by\nthe failure of a given firm are greater, and the probability that another firm may be a\n\n- 9 -\nvictim to another firm’s failure are higher. The enhancements to the capital rules should\nimprove the resilience of these firms.\nImportantly, the proposed adjustments would require banks with assets of $100\nbillion or more to account for unrealized losses and gains in their available-for-sale\n(AFS) securities when calculating their regulatory capital. This change would improve\nthe transparency of regulatory capital ratios, since it would better reflect banking\norganizations’ actual loss-absorbing capacity. Realizing the losses from these securities,\nwithout adequate capital to protect from those losses, was an important part of the set of\nevents that triggered the run on Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). If the bank had already been\nrequired to include those losses in its reported capital, it is less likely that the market and\ndepositors would have reacted the same way. Furthermore, banks that were required to\nreflect unrealized losses on AFS securities in regulatory capital managed their interest\nrate risk more carefully, suggesting that the requirement to include gains and losses on\nAFS securities in regulatory capital leads to stronger risk management as well.\nThese changes would increase capital requirements overall, but I want to\nemphasize that they would principally raise capital requirements for the largest, most\ncomplex banks. We will have additional information when the proposal is published, but\nfor now, let me put the proposed increases in context. Recall that banks are, by nature,\nvery leveraged and fund only a small portion of their assets with capital. One can think\nof the proposal’s more accurate risk measures as equivalent to requiring the largest banks\nhold an additional 2 percentage points of capital, or an additional $2 of capital for every\n$100 of risk-weighted assets. While this increase in requirements could lead to some\n\n- 10 -\nchanges in bank activities, the benefits of making the financial system more resilient to\nstresses that could otherwise impair growth are greater.\nThat is not to ignore concerns that changes in capital requirements may cause\nfirms to change their behavior and the way that financial services are provided to our\neconomy. We intend to consider comments carefully and any changes would be\nimplemented with an appropriate phase-in. This phase-in will allow ample time for\nbanks to adjust their balance sheets and activities, and to build capital over time. In fact,\nmost banks already have enough capital today to meet the new requirements. For the\nbanks that would need to build capital to meet the requirements, assuming that they\ncontinue to earn money at the same rate as in recent years, we estimate that banks would\nbe able to build the requisite capital through retained earnings in less than 2 years, even\nwhile maintaining their dividends.\nChanges to the Stress Test to Improve Risk Capture\nAs part of the holistic review, I have evaluated the Board’s stress testing\nframework. In particular, I have considered whether the proposed changes to the risk-\nbased capital framework should prompt adjustments to stress testing, and whether there\nare ways the stress test can be improved to make it a more effective test of banks’\nresilience. I have concluded that the framework for stress testing generally remains\nsound, but that we should review our global market shock and the stress test’s approach\nto estimating operational risk so that they provide a complementary lens to our risk-based\nstandards on market risk and operational risk, respectively.\nBanks have raised concerns that the changes to the risk-based capital framework I\ndescribed earlier, combined with the stress test, result in a “double counting” of risk that\n\n- 11 -\nis already captured in the minimum requirements. Conceptually, this shouldn’t be the\ncase, as the changes in the risk-based capital requirements affect the way that minimum\ncapital requirements are calculated, and the stress test is used to calculate the buffer. But\nwe will seek comments on all elements of the proposed risk-based capital adjustments,\nincluding whether interaction with the stress test results in an inappropriate treatment.\nFourteen years of stress testing, and the real-life surprises during that time,\nincluding the pandemic and the bank stresses this spring, have made it clear that stress\ntests need to be stressful to adequately prepare banks for unanticipated events. A key\nstrength of stress testing is its ability to be responsive to the rapidly changing conditions\nby testing bank resilience to emerging or growing risks. In addition, stress testing can be\nused to assess banks’ resilience to different kinds of stress in the financial system. For\nexample, we have long known—and the recent experience with SVB reinforced—the\nimportance of banks’ resilience to funding stress.\nThe stress test should evolve to better capture the range of salient risks that banks\nface. In addition, the Board could use a range of exploratory scenarios to assess banks’\nresilience to an evolving set of risks and use the results to inform supervision.\nMinimal Adjustments to the G-SIB Surcharge to Improve Precision\nAs part of the holistic review, I have evaluated whether the proposed changes to\nthe risk-based capital framework should prompt revisions to the G-SIB surcharge.\nI am not recommending fundamental changes to the underlying framework at this\ntime, but I will be recommending a series of adjustments of a more technical nature that\nwould not reduce the resiliency of the largest banks or the strength of the surcharge.\nSpecifically, I will recommend that the Board propose to adjust the G-SIB surcharge\n\n- 12 -\nframework to better match a firm’s systemic footprint. First, the proposal would measure\non an average basis over the full year the indicators that are currently measured only as of\nyear-end. This change would more accurately reflect the systemic risk profile of a firm\nand reduce incentives for a firm to reduce its G-SIB surcharge by temporarily altering its\nbalance sheet at year end through so-called “window dressing.”6 Second, the proposal\nwould reduce “cliff effects” in the G-SIB surcharge by measuring G-SIB surcharges in\n10-basis point increments instead of the current 50-basis point increments.7 Third, the\nproposal would make improvements to the measurement of some systemic indicators to\nbetter align them with risk. These changes would ensure that the G-SIB surcharge better\nreflects the systemic risk of each G-SIB.\nSome have argued that certain fixed dollar elements of the G-SIB surcharge\nshould be updated for changes in the economy since the surcharge was adopted. I am not\nrecommending changes to the fixed elements of the calibration of the surcharge.\nMaintaining the fixed elements of the G-SIB surcharge should help to provide a further\nincentive for G-SIBs to reduce their systemic footprint, and to promote competitive\nopportunities for large banks that are not-G-SIBs in order to maintain the diversity of our\nbanking system, while providing further protections against systemically risky events.\nContinuous Assessment of Capital Needs and the CCyB\nAs part of the holistic review, I have evaluated whether to adjust the CCyB\nframework. I do not plan to recommend to the Board that we adjust the CCyB\n6 Window dressing occurs when a firm takes action to reduce the values of its systemic indicators at year-\nend in a way that is not commensurate with the firm’s actual systemic footprint.\n7 Today, a bank’s G-SIB surcharge increases in 0.5-percentage point increments (1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, etc.).\nUnder the proposal, the G-SIB surcharge would increase in 0.1-percentage point increments (1.0%, 1.1%,\n1.2%, etc.)\n\n- 13 -\nframework. The goal of the countercyclical capital buffer is to build buffers in good\ntimes to help prepare for bad times. As called for under our current CCyB framework, I\nwould recommend that the Board activate a positive buffer if macroeconomic conditions\nsuggested that it would be appropriate. Conversely, where times of stress would justify\nlowering capital buffers, we will consider taking accommodating actions as we did in the\nmidst of the COVID-19 crisis.\nCalibration of the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio\nAs part of the holistic review, I have also evaluated whether to adjust the\nenhanced supplementary leverage ratio. While we should continuously improve our risk-\nbased capital requirements to reflect our understanding of risks, experience has shown\nthat there will be times when banks and regulators are unable to accurately measure all\nrisks. That is why regulators have adopted a leverage ratio, which compares the amount\nof capital held by banks with their total assets. Leverage requirements do not vary based\non risk-weighted assets. They provide a simple, transparent measure of solvency that is\nuseful to banks, markets, and regulators, and a floor on the risk-based approaches. Yet\nproblems can sometimes emerge if leverage ratios are the most binding of the capital\nrequirements because then banks may have an incentive to do less low-risk, low-return\nactivity, and to engage in higher-risk, higher-return activities.\nSome have argued that when banks are close to the eSLR as a binding constraint\nthat it has reduced Treasury market intermediation. The evidence on that is inconclusive.\nTo the extent it matters, the revisions in risk-based capital requirements I discussed today\nwould mean that the eSLR generally would not act as the binding constraint at the\nholding company level, where Treasury intermediation occurs. To the extent that there\n\n- 14 -\nare problems with Treasury market intermediation in the future for which the eSLR might\nmatter, the Board could consider an adjustment.\nLong-Term Debt\nA related proposal will be to introduce a long-term debt requirement for all large\nbanks. Long-term debt improves the ability of a bank to be resolved upon failure because\nthe long-term debt can be converted to equity and used to absorb losses. Such a measure\nwould reduce losses borne by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC)\nDeposit Insurance Fund, and provide the FDIC with additional options for restructuring,\nselling, or winding down a failed bank. I support applying a long-term debt requirement\nto all institutions with $100 billion or more in assets. This would add an important\nsafeguard to a class of banks that came under pressure this spring after the failure of\nSilicon Valley Bank. If SVB had enough long-term debt outstanding, it might have\nreduced the risk of a run by uninsured depositors; and it might have given the FDIC more\noptions to resolve the bank or merge it with a healthy institution. And importantly, more\nlong-term debt at SVB would have reduced the cost to the FDIC of its resolution. All of\nthese factors would have reduced the risk of contagion to other banks.\nConclusion\nThe comprehensive set of proposals that I have described here today would\nsignificantly strengthen our financial system and prepare it for emerging and\nunanticipated risks, such as those that manifested themselves in the banking system\nearlier this year. The holistic review began well before then, of course, and the steps\nproposed here address shortcomings in capital standards that did not begin in March of\n2023. But in an obvious way, the failures of SVB and other banks this spring were a\n\n- 15 -\nwarning that banks need to be more resilient, and need more of what is the foundation of\nthat resilience, which is capital. Some industry representatives claim that inadequate\ncapital had nothing to do with those bank failures. I disagree. It was an unsuccessful\nattempt by SVB to raise capital that caused uninsured depositors to look more closely at\nhow the bank was capitalized.\nSome industry representatives have claimed that SVB’s problems were really\nrelated to poor management and shortcomings in the Federal Reserve’s supervision.\nIndeed, those failings were thoroughly documented in a report I released in May, and\nsteps by the Fed to address those issues will be announced in coming months. But it is\nnot logical to argue that failings in supervision must mean that SVB was adequately\ncapitalized—it wasn’t—or that supervision by itself can somehow assure safety and\nsoundness throughout the banking system. It is not a choice between supervision and\ncapital regulation—capital is and has always been the foundation of a bank’s safety and\nsoundness.\nSome industry representatives have claimed that raising capital requirements will\npush activity outside of the regulated financial sector. As I discussed in my speech on\ncapital last December, we need to worry, a lot, about nonbank risks to financial stability.8\nThe answer, however, is not lower capital requirements for banks, but more attention to\nthose nonbank risks. Further, as stress in nonbank financial markets is often transmitted\nto the banking system, both directly and indirectly, it is critical that banks have enough\ncapital to remain resilient to those stresses.\n8 See Michael S. Barr, “Why Bank Capital Matters,” (speech at the American Enterprise Institute,\nWashington, DC, December 1, 2022),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20221201a.htm.\n\n- 16 -\nFor the reasons I have outlined today, we need to strengthen capital standards for\nlarge banks. That process will be deliberative and open to public participation and\nimplementation of any changes agreed to will take a least several years, which is why it is\nso important to begin now. Everyone in America depends on a safe and stable financial\nsystem. By strengthening capital standards, we are ensuring that businesses have credit\nto grow and hire workers, and deal with the ups and downs in the economy. Stronger\ncapital standards mean workers can depend on getting their paychecks and families can\nsave and borrow to plan for the future. Our goal is a financial system that works for\neveryone, and having strong capital rules is essential for that.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nStress Test Research Conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\nBoston, Massachusetts\nOctober 19, 2023\n\n- 2 -\nThank you for the opportunity to speak today. I’m here to offer my thoughts on the next\nsteps for stress testing, and in particular why using multiple exploratory scenarios will help\nimprove our understanding of risk in the banking system.1\nThe stress test as we know it today grew out of the 2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment\nProgram, or SCAP, conducted in the heat of the global financial crisis. In the winter of 2008–09,\nmarkets had lost confidence in banks amid wide uncertainty about the future path of the\neconomy and the losses banks could face. This prompted the Federal Reserve and Treasury to\nconduct a stress test to determine the health of the 19 largest banks under a severely adverse\neconomic scenario and to publish the findings. The release of the results provided transparency\nabout the status of the largest banks, made it easier for firms to re-capitalize themselves, and\nrestarted the provision of credit to the economy that began the process of recovery.\nFollowing the success of this stress test, Congress mandated in the Dodd-Frank Act that\nthe Federal Reserve conduct an annual stress test of large banks to determine whether those\nbanks have sufficient capital to absorb losses under adverse economic conditions.2 And today\nthis test—as well as the data collection that supports it—is one of our primary tools to assess and\nto help ensure banks’ resilience, in good times and bad. During periods of economic or financial\nuncertainty, stress tests can provide critical assessments of bank resilience to supervisors, the\n1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the Board to conduct annual evaluations of firms to determine\nwhether “such companies have the capital, on a total consolidated basis, necessary to absorb losses as a\nresult of adverse economic conditions.” 12 U.S.C. § 5365(i)(1)(A).\n\n- 3 -\nmarket, and policymakers. This transparency helps enable markets to function better in times of\nstress.3\nOutside of stressful periods, stress tests can help to assess sufficient capitalization and\nimprove supervisory insight into risks. The stress test also can provide transparency into the\nbuild-up of risks across banks. In our experience, the test results have given supervisors valuable\ninformation to provide feedback to individual firms and helped the Board assess the stability of\nthe financial system. A recent study confirms this experience, finding that banks subject to the\nstress test were less exposed to common systemic risks.4 In addition, the stress test helps to\nmake capital requirements less susceptible to gaming by firms and therefore more likely to be set\nat adequate levels.5 This is so because the design of the scenario can change based on our\nobservations of growing risks in the system. The scenario framework, by using parameters that\nbecome stricter when the economy is stronger, also helps to avoid exacerbating the natural\ntendency for banks to take larger risks during good times and become highly risk averse during\nbad times.6 Furthermore, stress tests change in response to improved modeling and evolving\nrisks, so that the tests better estimate potential losses in a downturn.\nOver the past 14 years, we have learned from our experiences and continued to evolve the\nstress testing program. We have taken steps to increase the transparency of the stress testing\n3 See D. P. Morgan, S. Peristiani, and V.

I’ll walk through\nthree limitations and explain how they can be at least partially mitigated by incorporating\nmultiple exploratory scenarios into our stress test program. What I mean by an exploratory\nscenario is a scenario that is not used to set a firm’s stress capital buffer requirement. I’ll then\ndescribe how the Federal Reserve could use the results of exploratory scenarios to help ensure\nthe banking system remains strong and resilient, by allowing us to better understand potential\nrisks and improve our supervision of those banks.\nAs we move forward, we must remain cognizant that none of us can predict future\nstressful events and their consequences with confidence.\n7 See 12 C.F.R. § 252 appendixes A and B; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2023\nStress Test Methodology (Washington: Federal Reserve Board, June 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2023-june-supervisory-stress-test-methodology.pdf.\n8 See 2023 Stress Test Methodology, https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2023-june-\nsupervisory-stress-test-methodology.pdf.\n9 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Approves Rule to\nSimplify Its Capital Rules for Large Banks, Preserving the Strong Capital Requirements Already in\nPlace,” news release, March 4, 2020,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20200304a.htm.\n\n- 5 -\nLimitations of Stress Testing\nFirst, the current stress test uses a single scenario that is focused on a credit-driven\nrecession and single global market shock to test the financial condition of firms.10 A single\nscenario cannot cover the range of plausible risks faced by all large banks. This has been\nconfirmed time and time again, including in recent experience.\nThe failures of three large banks last spring showed that acute banking strains can emerge\neven without a severe recession. Yet, conditions such as those recently experienced presented\nchallenges for the design of the supervisory stress scenario. Most notably, the Federal Reserve’s\nstress testing policy statement—which governs how the hypothetical scenarios are determined—\nrequires that the severely adverse scenario include a rapid increase in the unemployment rate to\nat least 10 percent, as well as steep declines in house prices. Such conditions are historically\nassociated with subdued inflation and a fall in interest rates. The fact that significant banking\nstress emerged in very different conditions underscores the limitations of our current stress\ntesting processes.\nWe also do not take into account second-order effects of stress within the financial\nsystem, which are channels that amplify the effects of the shocks hitting bank’s balance sheets,\nleading to losses spreading throughout the financial system. A good example of this is the\nreaction of funding markets to stress at an individual firm or many firms. These network effects\nmay result in losses across the system not fully captured by our stress tests. While the severely\n10 Banks with large trading operations are tested against a global market shock component that stresses\ntheir trading, private equity, and certain other fair-valued positions. Furthermore, banks with substantial\ntrading or custodial operations are tested against the default of their largest counterparty.\n\n- 6 -\nadverse scenario is calibrated to historical recessions that have included contagion, our stress\ntests may not fully capture the evolving interconnections in today’s financial system.\nThe second limitation involves our models. In developing supervisory models, Federal\nReserve staff draw on economic research and industry practice; the models are also\nindependently validated by a group of experts outside of the stress testing program. However, all\nmodels have limitations—they are generally trained on historical data and therefore may not be\nrobust to structural breaks, such as a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, or important changes in\ntechnology.11 Expanding the range of risks captured in the stress test makes models more robust\nto these limitations but will not address them completely.12\nThe third limitation is how the stress test affects bank behavior. Using scenarios that test\nfor the same underlying risks year after year could disincentivize firms from investing in their\nown risk management as the test becomes predictable, and may encourage concentration across\nthe system in assets that receive comparably lighter treatment in the test. Additional exploratory\nstress test scenarios could allow supervisors to better probe the internal risk management of firms\nand assess whether they are holding sufficient capital for their risks.13 We find that firms often\nuse a large number of scenarios and shocks when running their own internal stress testing\nprocesses, and our regulatory counterparts use a number of scenarios as well.\n11 Each year, the Federal Reserve refines the supervisory stress test, including its development and\nenhancement of independent supervisory models. The supervisory stress test models may be enhanced to\nreflect advances in modeling techniques; enhancements in response to model validation findings;\nincorporation of richer and more detailed data; and identification of more stable models or models with\nimproved performance, particularly under stressful economic conditions.\n12 See Richard J. Herring and Til Schuermann, “Objectives and Challenges for Stress Testing,”\n(December 16, 2019), forthcoming in J. Doyne Farmer, Alissa Kleinnijenhuis, Til Schuermann, and\nThom Wetzer (eds.), Handbook of Financial Stress Testing (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press),\nhttps://ssrn.com/abstract=3504347 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3504347.\n13 See Herring and Schuermann, 2019, https://ssrn.com/abstract=3504347.\n\n- 7 -\nExpanding the Risks Captured in the Stress Test\nExploratory stress test scenarios could mitigate these and other risks. The goal of stress\ntesting should be to provide sufficient coverage of the types of severe but plausible scenarios that\ncould adversely impact a bank’s operations, and the combination of scenarios and shocks should\nbe curated to achieve this goal. This doesn’t imply a large number of scenarios. Given the\nlimited number of unique bank business models and variables that drive losses, a relatively small\nnumber of scenarios may be all that is required to capture a wide range of outcomes for the\nbanking system.14\nOn the macroeconomic side, additional scenarios could be used to explore the effects of\nqualitatively different macroeconomic and financial environments. For example, instead of the\nusual demand-driven recession, a scenario could explore the impact of an inflationary shock to\nsupply. Potentially, an exploratory scenario could probe the interplay between capital and\nliquidity, to help ensure firms understand their capital exposure to rapid changes in the\ncomposition or pricing of their liabilities.15\nWith respect to market risk, the current single market shock used in the test is a one-time\nshock to several thousand variables in bank trading books. This is just one realization of a large\nset of risk factors that determine changes in market values.16 Using additional market shocks\n14 See Bora Durdu, Rochelle Edge, and Daniel Schwindt, “Measuring the Severity of Stress-Test\nScenarios,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 5, 2017),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.1970 and R. Roengpitya, N. Tarasherv, K. Tsatsaronis, and A.\nVillegas, “Bank Business Models: Popularity and Performance,” Bank for International Settlements\nWorking Paper no. 682 (Basel: BIS, December 2017), https://www.bis.org/publ/work682.pdf .\n15 See William F. Bassett and David E. Rappoport, “Enhancing Stress Tests by Adding Macroprudential\nElements,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2022-022 (Washington: Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, May 2022), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2022.022.\n16 The global market shock is specified by a large set of risk factors that include, but are not limited to:\nequity prices, foreign exchange rates, selected-maturity government yields, selected maturities and\n\n- 8 -\nwould help us understand how the trading books and counterparty concentrations of firms would\nchange under a range of financial conditions. This could include testing the exposure of firms to\ndifferent directional risks, such as a sudden rise or fall in certain asset values, or to an\nunexpected divergence in values of correlated assets.17 It is particularly important for us to\nconsider a range of market shocks because some concentrated counterparty exposures may be\nrevealed only under certain scenarios.\nTo advance the goal of improved testing of market risk, last year, for the first time, we\nintroduced an additional, exploratory market shock component. As compared to the global\nmarket shock, the exploratory market shock was characterized by a less severe recession with\ngreater inflationary pressures. As we explained in our results disclosure, banks generally looked\nbetter under the exploratory market shock, experiencing smaller trading and counterparty losses\nin the exploratory market shock than under the global market shock. This is valuable\ninformation to us and the public, since it suggests that these banks’ trading and counterparty\nexposures may not be an unexpected source of vulnerability during a rising inflation scenario\n(although that test did not explore the effects of unrealized losses from interest rate risk). The\nexercise also provided important insight into banks’ counterparty exposures in varying\nconditions, since banks’ largest counterparties differed between the exploratory market shock\nand the global market shock.\nexpiries of implied volatilities that are key inputs to the pricing of interest rate derivatives, selected\nexpiries of futures prices for energy products, selected expiries of futures prices for metals and\nagricultural commodities, and credit spreads or prices for selected credit-sensitive products.\n17 As market makers, the banks subject to the stress test often take either long or short positions depending\non the demands of their clients. As such, it is possible that at a given time, the firm is exposed to either\nrising or falling prices.\n\n- 9 -\nBuilding on these experiences, the Federal Reserve is developing both exploratory\nmacroeconomic scenarios and exploratory market shocks for next year’s stress test. As I noted\nabove, an exploratory scenario would not be used to set a firm’s stress capital buffer\nrequirement. Instead, the exploratory scenarios will be used to inform the Board’s supervisory\nassessments of firms’ risk management and our understanding of different risks in the banking\nsystem.\nUsing the Additional Stress Test Results\nLet me speak to how we currently use the stress test, and how we could use exploratory\nscenarios going forward. A current use of the stress test is to help set capital requirements for\nlarge banks to help prepare firms to withstand a severe economic recession and continue to lend\nand operate. The key features of the scenario used to calculate the capital requirements are\ngenerally similar from year to year. Since the stress test is used to set each firm’s stress capital\nbuffer requirement, there is a benefit to predictability so that firms are better able to conduct\ncapital and business planning. To the extent we were to adjust key features of the scenario used\nto set the capital requirements, we would do so through a transparent, public process.\nHowever, a tradeoff with producing predictable scenarios is stifling creativity in scenario\ndesign and less bank resilience to a range of potential scenarios, and this is where exploratory\nscenarios can help. The use of stress scenarios and shocks that do not set a firm’s stress capital\nbuffer requirement can provide room to explore a wider range of vulnerabilities to inform risk-\nbased supervision. For example, if the purpose of the exploratory scenario is to inform the Board\nor the public about new or underappreciated risks, the Board could explore the impact of a\nscenario using a different set of variables than the ones it has currently defined in its policy\nstatement.\n\n- 10 -\nAdditional exploratory stress test scenarios could allow supervisors to better probe the\ninternal risk management of firms and assess whether they are holding sufficient capital for their\nrisks. For example, the 2018 stress test revealed that one firm had highly concentrated\ncounterparty exposures that would materialize under the hypothetical stress scenario. This led to\nsupervisory feedback to that firm and its prompt mitigation of the concern. We should continue\nto enhance the feedback loop between supervision and stress testing.\nWe can also learn from our international counterparts, who have effectively employed\nexploratory stress tests. Since 2017, the Bank of England has run a biennial exploratory scenario\ndesigned to explore risks not covered by their annual capital stress test. The results of their\nexploratory tests are used to improve supervisory feedback related to the risk management of\nfirms.\nWhile the results of our stress test are informative and provide a rigorous measure of\nresilience, the supervisory stress test is not a replacement for a firm’s own risk management or\nits own stress testing processes. Large banking organizations should maintain a solid line of\nsight into their own risks and focus their efforts to capture those risks and determine capital\nneeds. Our stress test is designed to provide a consistent measure of risk across firms, and is not\na replacement for comprehensive modeling, risk management, and capital planning by the largest\nbanks that enable them to measure and manage their own unique risks.\nThe Future Evolution of Stress Testing\nExploratory scenarios would also allow the Board to have more flexibility in its modeling\napproaches. For example, the Board could explicitly model the behavioral response of\ndepositors to losses, allowing for contagion of the type we saw earlier this year, the interaction of\n\n- 11 -\nthe broader economy and the banking system under stress, or the transmission of stress through\nnonbank parts of the financial system.18 The Bank of England’s recent stress tests included a set\nof models to better understand how feedback and amplification channels during a stress event\ncould drive contagion losses and exacerbate the impact of an initial shock. These feedback loops\nincluded a contagion model testing how deteriorating capital positions might impact the market\nfor interbank lending.19 Expanding the use of exploratory scenarios in the stress test would\nallow for more experimentation in the modeling of risks by the Board’s supervisory stress test\nprogram.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, forums such as this research conference are excellent sources of ideas and\nhypothesis testing. In thinking about the future evolution of stress tests, we would benefit from\nwide ranging input—from academics, other policymakers, public interest groups, bankers and\nother market participants.\nThe stress test needs to continue to evolve.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n10:35 a.m. EST\nNovember 16, 2023\nThe 2023 U.S. Treasury Market Conference\nRemarks by\nMichael S. Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York\nNew York, New York\nNovember 16, 2023\n\nI am pleased to join you today at the ninth annual U.S. Treasury Market\nConference.1 This event is a joint effort by the agencies that make up the Inter-Agency\nWorking Group on Treasury Market Surveillance and serves as a reflection of the group’s\nongoing, crucial collaboration.\nThe flash rally in the Treasury market in October 2014 revealed a need for a\ndeeper understanding of Treasury market functioning. The report that the joint agencies\nproduced in response sheds light on how the market had evolved. Since then, this annual\nconference has provided a forum for the official sector to come together with market\nparticipants and the scholarly community to identify ways to bolster the resilience of the\nTreasury market. This coordination has been important as we have worked together to\nstudy subsequent bouts of market stress. I am proud of the work done by the staff of the\nagencies and the private sector participants and wholeheartedly support our continued\ncollaboration to advance work in this area.\nBefore I dive into my remarks, I want to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork for hosting this event once again and for its ongoing thought leadership on Treasury\nmarket functioning. I also wanted to acknowledge the important leadership of the\nU.S. Department of the Treasury in convening both the agencies and the private sector to\nanalyze longer-term structural issues and to address emergent issues.\nThe Importance of the Treasury Market\nLet me start by sharing a few thoughts on why I think work on Treasury market\nstructure is so important to the public and the Federal Reserve.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard and the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nFirst, Treasury securities are the primary means of U.S. federal government\nfinancing. The American people rely on the Treasury market to function well, so that the\nTreasury can issue debt efficiently.\nSecond, the market for Treasury securities underpins the pricing of assets across\nthe financial system, providing benchmark rates on which other assets are priced. As\nsuch, the Treasury market is a key component of the transmission of monetary policy for\nthe Federal Reserve. In addition, open market operations in the Treasury cash and repo\nmarkets have long been central to how the Fed implements monetary policy. The\nTreasury market also helps us understand investors’ views on the outlook for growth and\ninflation. The insights we gain from studying the evolution of Treasury yields across the\ncurve help us understand financial conditions that affect borrowing costs for businesses\nand households.\nFinally, Treasury securities serve as reserve assets for private savers, financial\ninstitutions, and other countries. For example, Treasuries comprise a significant portion\nof banks’ high-quality liquid assets. In times of stress, certain sources of funding can, in\nsome cases, exit quickly. In such cases, access to immediately available liquidity is\nimportant, and thus, even in normal circumstances, helps promote safety and soundness.\nThis means that markets for high-quality liquid assets need to be deep and well-\nfunctioning in a variety of conditions. Of course, these holdings cannot completely\ninsulate banks from acute risks—a point I will discuss later—but having a readily\navailable liquidity buffer to meet outflows can provide firms with some flexibility to\nadjust their balance sheets in response to changing market or firm conditions.\n\n- 3 -\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe events in March made it clear how important it is for banks to properly\nmanage their interest rate risk, so I want to spend a few minutes on this topic. To start, I\nwould say that years of very low interest rates led to complacency at some financial\ninstitutions about the degree to which banks needed to manage interest rate risk,\nincluding in high-quality liquid asset portfolios. As in the case of Silicon Valley Bank,\nsupervisors could also have done more to act forcefully when they identified problems.2\nSavings soared during the pandemic as normal spending was disrupted, and\ngovernment payments to households and businesses increased significantly to avert a\nmassive economic contraction. As a result, bank deposits grew rapidly. To manage\nbalance sheet growth, understandably, a number of banks invested in securities, including\nTreasury securities. But investing heavily in fixed-rate, long-duration assets without\nappropriate interest rate risk management led to problems in some cases. As described in\nour Financial Stability Report, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised\nthe policy rate to combat inflation, yields increased across the curve and some banks\nexperienced sizable declines in the fair value of these assets.3\nThe higher rate environment also affected the liability side of banks’ balance\nsheets. The outflow of bank deposits into money market funds and other alternative\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board announces the results from\nthe review of the supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank, led by Vice Chair for Supervision\nBarr,” news release, April 28, 2023,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20230428a.htm.\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (Washington: Board of\nGovernors, October 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-\n20231020.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nshort-term instruments, for the most part, has been and remains both anticipated and\norderly. Unfortunately, a few firms had a combination of both poor interest rate risk\nmanagement and weak liquidity risk management. The combination led to failure, as\nstaff documented in my report on Silicon Valley Bank.4\nThe contagion from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and\neventually First Republic was stemmed from spreading further in large part by the\ninvocation of the systemic risk exception, permitting the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation to fully pay out on uninsured depositor claims, and the establishment of the\nBank Term Funding Program, which provides a long-term source of liquidity secured by\nTreasuries and agency securities at par. Deposit flows have reverted to their normal\npatterns.\nA few observations are in order, however. I will start with the liability side of\nbank balance sheets. As I mentioned, as yields on deposit alternatives, such as money\nfunds, increased as our tightening cycle took hold, banks found they needed to start\npaying higher interest rates to retain deposits and pay up for alternative sources of\nfunding as they lost deposits. A recent paper by three members of the Federal Reserve\nstaff discusses how deposit betas rise in a dynamic way as interest rates rise, rather than\nhaving a static relationship to rising rates. This paper formalizes the intuition that banks\nmust be prepared for potential declines in deposit duration as rates rise.5\n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and\nRegulation of Silicon Valley Bank (Washington: Board of Governors, April 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/review-of-the-federal-reserves-supervision-and-regulation-of-\nsilicon-valley-bank.htm.\n5 Emily Greenwald, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, and Joshua Younger, “Deposit Convexity, Monetary Policy,\nand Financial Stability,” Working Paper 2315 (Dallas: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, October 2023),\nhttps://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2023/wp2315.pdf.\n\n- 5 -\nLooking at the asset side of bank balance sheets, most banks do not need to record\nunrealized gains and losses of their security portfolios in regulatory capital. Banks have\nan incentive to avoid selling “hold to maturity” (HTM) securities because selling even a\nportion of a portfolio “taints” the entire portfolio since it requires recognizing changes in\nvalue. But, even if not recognized from an accounting or capital standpoint, losses on\nlong-duration asset portfolios can still lead to challenges. Federal Reserve supervisors\nhave stepped up their supervision of interest rate and liquidity risk, given what we have\nlearned from recent experience, and they will continue to work with banks to ensure their\nbalance sheets are resilient to a variety of conditions.6\nThe Importance of Contingency Funding Preparedness\nThat brings me to the importance of contingency funding planning and\npreparedness. Banks don’t need to sell securities to gain liquidity value from them if they\ncan borrow against them. But firms can face challenges in significantly ramping up\nfunding in private markets, such as repo markets, particularly if they do not tap those\nmarkets regularly.\nIn July, the Board, along with the other relevant agencies, updated guidance to\nhighlight that banks should maintain a broad array of funding sources, including the\ndiscount window, which can be accessed in a range of circumstances.7 Liquidity sources\nthat are not regularly tapped or tested may not function as expected when most needed.\n6 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Supervision and Regulation Report (Washington:\nBoard of Governors, November 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/202311-\nsupervision-and-regulation-report.pdf.\n7 Addendum to the Interagency Policy Statement on Funding and Liquidity Risk Management: Importance\nof Contingency Funding Plans,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20230728a1.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nI have recently discussed the importance of discount window preparedness. Last\nmonth, I outlined how the discount window is an important tool of both monetary policy\nand financial stability.8 It is an important tool of monetary policy because, with the\nprimary credit rate set at the top of the target range, it supports rate control. It is also an\nimportant tool of financial stability because it provides ready access to liquidity,\nregardless of market conditions. Other sources of funds to banks, even the Federal Home\nLoan Banks, are dependent on a functioning private-sector market to provide liquidity to\ntheir customers. When the market is not working, such sources of funding and liquidity\ncome under strain.\nThe discount window, however, can play these important roles only if eligible\ninstitutions are both willing and ready to use it. This means that it is important that banks\nestablish borrowing arrangements, pre-pledge collateral, and engage in test transactions at\nregular intervals.\nI also want to highlight the standing repo facility (SRF). The SRF was\nestablished by the FOMC to help keep the federal funds rate within the target range if\npressures arise in short-term funding markets, with the rate currently set at the top of the\ntarget range.9\nThis facility can be useful to both primary dealers and banks because it gives\nthem another venue to raise liquidity against Treasury securities and other eligible\nsecurities. It is encouraging to see an uptick in interest among banks to join the SRF as\n8 Michael S. Barr, “Monetary Policy and Financial Stability” (speech at the Forecasters Club of New York,\nNew York, October 2, 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20231002a.htm.\n9 Committee discussions about the design of the standing repo facility can be found in Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 15–16, 2021,” press\nrelease, July 7, 2021, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210707a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\ncounterparties, with 10 banks onboarded as counterparties in the last year, bringing total\ncoverage to about half the assets of the banking system. I am also encouraged to see that\nthere is now a broader appreciation among eligible institutions that Federal Reserve\nliquidity facilities are an important part of making sure that firms can weather a variety of\nmarket conditions. It is important that firms are ready to tap facilities when the rates they\nface from private market participants are higher than the rates offered on the facilities. In\nthis way, the facilities can serve to support interest rate control and broader market\nfunctioning.\nLeverage in the Treasury Market\nTurning to risks on the horizon, the Federal Reserve continues to study leverage\nin the Treasury market, and we have also been contributing to the Financial Stability\nOversight Council (FSOC) work to study this issue as well.\nI want to recognize that leveraged trading, including in the so-called basis trade,\ncan play an important role in capital markets. Basis trading serves a valuable function of\nmarket efficiency, improving the connection between cash and futures pricing and\nfacilitating access to futures for investing and risk management. Leverage allows market\nparticipants to arbitrage away relatively small pricing discrepancies, enhancing the\nintegration of prices across economically equivalent instruments and markets.\nBut leverage can also increase risks to both market participants and to Treasury\nmarket functioning and must be managed appropriately by both investors and their\ncounterparties, including through collecting margin to manage counterparty risk.\n\n- 8 -\nStaff at the Federal Reserve and other agencies have done important work to\nanalyze leverage in the Treasury market using available data.10 These studies have found\nthat hedge funds are significant investors in Treasury cash, derivatives, and repo markets;\nthat their highly leveraged positions in Treasury markets are facilitated by very low, or\neven zero, haircuts on their repo financing; and that demand for this leverage is highly\nconcentrated among a handful of large hedge funds. Moreover, liquidation of leveraged\nTreasury positions by hedge funds appears to have contributed to the Treasury market\nstress in March 2020.\nAll of us need to better understand this activity. The Federal Reserve collects\ninformation on the triparty repo market through its oversight of the Bank of New York\nMellon, and the Office of Financial Research (OFR) collects detailed information on repo\ntrading centrally cleared through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. But as\ndiscussed at this conference, there is much less information on the non-centrally cleared\nbilateral repo market, where much of this activity takes place. OFR’s proposal to collect\ninformation on this market segment on an ongoing basis is an important step forward, and\nI look forward to their final rulemaking.\nThe Board also contributes to the official sector’s visibility into the Treasury\nmarket by requiring banks that meet certain threshold requirements to report transactions\n10 Ayelen Banegas, Phillip Monin, and Lubomir Petrasek, “Sizing Hedge Funds’ Treasury Market\nActivities and Holdings,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\nOctober 6, 2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/sizing-hedge-funds-treasury-\nmarket-activities-and-holdings-20211006.html; and Ayelen Banegas and Phillip Monin, “Hedge Fund\nTreasury Exposures, Repo, and Margining,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, September 8, 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/hedge-fund-\ntreasury-exposures-repo-and-margining-20230908.html.\n\n- 9 -\nto TRACE.11 Under this rule, 22 depository institutions began submitting their Treasury\nand agency MBS transactions on a daily basis to TRACE last fall. Although the bulk of\ntransactions in the Treasury market are conducted through FINRA members, the addition\nof reporting by depository institutions has helped to ensure more complete coverage of\nthe market, and we will continue to consider enhancements so that the collection aligns\nwith FINRA’s reporting rules for its members and ensures consistent coverage of the\nmarket.\nWhile getting more and better data is crucial for fully understanding Treasury\nmarkets, some of the analysis outlined in recent research raises questions about how the\nofficial sector can further support the resilience of the Treasury market.\nThe Financial Stability Oversight Council’s Hedge Fund Working Group has\ndone excellent work to identify risks and offer recommendations to the council on\nleveraged trading.12 At the Federal Reserve, we will continue to work with the other\nagencies and market participants to identify and address risks to our supervised\ninstitutions and to the resiliency of Treasury markets. For instance, the capital\nrequirements applicable to banks are one of our primary tools to help ensure that banks\nhave sufficient capital to weather stressful conditions and continue to lend in good times\nand bad. We and the other banking agencies recently sought comment on a proposal to\nrevise these requirements to better reflect the risk of bank activities, and we are interested\n11 Agency Information Collection Activities: Announcement of Board Approval Under Delegated\nAuthority and Submission to OMB, 86 Fed.

The people in this room and those\nwatching online are well positioned to provide us detailed feedback on the capital\nproposal, including how different components of the rule could affect different markets,\nso I thank you in advance for your thoughtful contributions.\nI also want to highlight that the preamble to the proposal asks commenters for\nfeedback on whether and to what extent sovereign securities should be subject to\nminimum collateral haircut floors, including, for example, repo-style transactions in\nwhich a banking organization lends cash against Treasury securities.13 While we are in\nearly stages of exploring these issues, we appreciate commenter views on these issues.\nI have also taken note of some recent studies, including a paper presented at\nJackson Hole, that have looked at additional factors that could support Treasury market\nfunctioning, including a move to broader central clearing, all-to-all trading, and also\nensuring that risk-based capital requirements, rather than the enhanced supplementary\nleverage ratio, drive dealer balance sheet allocation.14 We are continuing to study these\nand other topics.\nManaging Cyber Risk\nI want to wrap up today by reiterating the importance of managing cyber risk.\nCyber threats are constantly evolving, and we can expect them to become increasingly\nsophisticated as technology advances.

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nYale School of Management\nProgram on Financial Stability\nNew Haven, Connecticut\nFebruary 25, 2025\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1 I note that the objectives of the\nProgram on Financial Stability include “supporting the world’s financial authorities in refining\nproven crises management tools and strategies.”2 Speaking as a representative of one of those\nauthorities, I thought I would further the program’s goals by focusing these remarks on the\nprinciples and practice of crisis management. I am favored in that task with what one might call\nthe luck of having been regularly confronted with crises in each of my three stints as a public\nservant, over a career divided between government and academia. In noting how often my\narrival in government was accompanied by crisis, it might be reasonable to wonder if this is\ncorrelation or causation.\nKidding aside, crisis management is central to all management because it demands the\nvery best from managers when it is most needed. Anyone who spends time in government can\nexpect that some of the most memorable and challenging experiences will be managing through\ntough situations, when the answers to problems are unclear but the mission of the organization\ncomes into acute focus. The financial system is in a perpetual state balancing risk and reward.\nSometimes the system falls out of balance, and vulnerabilities turn into stress or even crisis. This\nmoment is when it is crucial to mitigate spillovers from the financial system that can hurt\nbusinesses and households and wreak havoc on the economy at large.\nSome of the most important features of modern economies were developed to prevent\nand mitigate financial crises. The first central banks, and eventually the Federal Reserve, were\ncreated to provide stable currencies and banking systems in support of the long-term stability of\nthe provision of credit necessary to foster growth and rising living standards. Regulation of\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See Yale School of Management, Program on Financial Stability (2025), “About the Yale Program on Financial\nStability,” webpage, paragraph 1, https://som.yale.edu/centers/program-on-financial-stability/about.\n\n- 2 -\nfinancial markets, regulation and supervision of banks, federal deposit insurance, and laws to\nprotect investors, consumers, and businesses were developed over time to promote both financial\nstability and durable economic growth. I have spoken previously about how monetary policy\nand financial stability are inextricably linked and how the tools we use to conduct monetary\npolicy and support financial stability work together.3\nIn the spring of 2023, the United States faced the prospect of a spiraling stress event,\nwhen poor management and excessive risk-taking by Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) led to a run that\nquickly spread to other banks and threatened the wider banking system. Shortcomings in\nsupervision and gaps in the regulatory framework also contributed to SVB’s failure, and I’ve\nspoken about the steps the Federal Reserve has taken to improve supervision and other steps to\nclose regulatory gaps.4 Today, I’d like to talk about how effective management of the banking\nstress in the spring of 2023 helped prevent that event from spiraling into a financial crisis.\nGiven our student audience, I will begin with a little background on how I got into the\ncrisis management business. After Yale Law School and two court clerkships, I worked at the\nState Department and then went to work for Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin in 1995. When I\narrived, the Treasury Department had helped Mexico deal with a financial crisis that threatened\nto spread to the United States, and additional crises were to come in 1997 in Asia and in 1998 in\n3 See, for example, Michael S.

Together, these events credibly threatened a worldwide financial crisis, which was\naverted by a response across the U.S. government and coordinated with governments and lending\ninstitutions around the world. I left government for academia in 2001 and then returned to\nTreasury in 2009 under Secretary Tim Geithner, in the midst of the Global Financial Crisis\n(GFC). I worked to develop what became known as the Dodd-Frank Act. This law was a pivotal\ncomponent of our response to the GFC by addressing gaps in financial market oversight,\nincluding through strengthened regulation and supervision of banks that increased the safeguards\nagainst the excessive risk-taking that caused the crisis. I went back to academia again in 2011\nand then returned to public service as the Federal Reserve Board’s Vice Chair for Supervision in\nJuly 2022. In this position, I oversaw the response to the bank failures in March 2023 and have\nhelped develop ways to reduce these and other risks going forward.\nThe March 2023 Banking Stress\nLet me review some facts about what happened, so you can understand the context for\nhow we put crisis management principles and practices to work.\nSVB failed because of a textbook case of mismanagement of interest rate and liquidity\nrisk.5 This mismanagement made uninsured depositors lose confidence in the bank’s solvency,\nso they ran. While this was a textbook case, the speed and severity of the run were\nunprecedented. The largest previous bank failure before SVB was of Washington Mutual in\n5 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of Inspector General (2023), Material Loss Review\nof Silicon Valley Bank (Washington: September 25), https://oig.federalreserve.gov/reports/board-material-loss-\nreview-silicon-valley-bank-sep2023.pdf. Immediately following SVB’s failure, Chair Powell and I agreed that I\nshould oversee a review of the circumstances leading up to SVB’s failure. We published the results of this review\non April 28, 2023; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Review of the Federal Reserve’s\nSupervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank (Washington: Board of Governors, April),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\n2008.6 The accumulation of stresses that resulted in Washington Mutual’s failure occurred over\nseveral weeks. By contrast, SVB’s deposit outflows were much greater in both relative and\nabsolute terms, and they occurred in less than 24 hours. On top of that, the bank had major gaps\nin its liquidity risk management, including its preparedness to tap contingency liquidity.7\nBecause this discussion is for future first responders, I will share with you some detail\nabout what it’s like to be on the front lines working to address a bank run. On the morning of\nThursday, March 9, 2023, SVB had only a little over $5 billion in collateral pledged to the\ndiscount window, as compared to over $150 billion in uninsured deposits.8 Around midday, the\nfirm contacted the Federal Reserve, indicating that it wanted to take out a discount window loan\nagainst this collateral, and the loan was granted. But in the next several hours, its account was\ndrained as its deposit outflows spiraled. In the late afternoon, the firm indicated that it would\nneed additional liquidity to meet expected outflows. The Federal Reserve worked with the firm\nto help it identify additional assets it could pledge to the discount window, but SVB was\nunsuccessful in identifying and moving sufficient collateral. Fed staff worked with the firm\nthrough the night to establish ad hoc collateral arrangements, so that the firm could tap the\ndiscount window further to meet its liquidity needs in the morning.\nWhile this process was happening overnight, however, the volume of online deposit\nwithdrawal requests was growing, such that SVB management expected outflows of over\n6 See National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States (2011), The\nFinancial Crisis Inquiry Report (Washington: Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, January),\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf; and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(2017), Crisis and Response: An FDIC History, 2008–2013 (Washington: FDIC),\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/publications/crisis-and-response-fdic-history-2008-2013.\n7 For instance, the bank failed its own internal liquidity stress tests and did not have workable plans to access\nliquidity in times of stress. The bank changed its own risk-management assumptions to reduce how these risks were\nmeasured rather than fully addressing the underlying risks. See Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and\nRegulation of Silicon Valley Bank (note 5).\n8 See Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank (note 5).\n\n- 5 -\n$100 billion the next day, an unprecedented sum.9 Even if the bank were able to pledge all\ncollateral available that morning to the discount window, the firm would not have been able to\nmeet its obligations. It was not viable. The state of California closed the bank and turned it over\nto the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for resolution.\nSVB’s failure contributed to the strains at FDIC-supervised Signature Bank, and that\nbank failed in short order. As the situation intensified, the effects on businesses and households\nbecame increasingly apparent. Critically, these failures caused a reassessment of the viability of\nuninsured deposits as a funding source across the banking system. But strains at other banks\nmaterialized despite material differences between these firms. The rapidity of equity market\nprice declines for several banks triggered repeated trading halts for their shares. Online deposits\nbegan to migrate out of smaller banks to larger banks, putting pressure on these smaller\ninstitutions.10 Commercial customers that had remaining deposits at SVB after it failed realized\nthat they would not have access to their deposits and thus wouldn’t be able to make payroll or\neven stay in business.11\nThe severity and rapidity of the spread of stress warranted a decisive response. We\ndeveloped a two-part strategy that weekend.\nOn March 12, the Treasury Secretary, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve announced that\nthe FDIC would protect uninsured deposits at SVB and Signature Bank under the systemic risk\n9 See Review of the Federal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank, p. 7 (note 5).\n10 See Stephan Luck, Matthew Plosser, and Josh Younger (2023), “Bank Funding during the Current Monetary\nPolicy Tightening Cycle,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Liberty Street Economics (blog), May 11,\nhttps://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/05/bank-funding-during-the-current-monetary-policy-\ntightening-cycle.\n11 See Berber Jin, Katherine Bindley, and Rolfe Winkler (2023), “After Silicon Valley Bank Fails, Tech Startups\nRace to Meet Payroll,” Wall Street Journal, March 11,\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/after-silicon-valley-bank-fails-tech-startups-race-to-meet-payroll-\n4ebd9c5c?mod=article_inline.\n\n- 6 -\nexception to least-cost resolution.12 This action essentially implied that all depositors, insured\nand uninsured, would have access to their deposits Monday morning. And the step helped calm\nuninsured depositors around the country.\nAlso on March 12, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program\n(BTFP) under its emergency lending authority with the approval of and a backstop from the\nTreasury.13 The BTFP’s terms and conditions addressed the fundamental source of banking-\nsector jitters: questions about the ability of a range of banks to hold onto their high-quality\nsecurities that had lost value because of interest rate increases. Unrealized losses on securities\nportfolios were a problem for many banks, particularly when the stability of their deposit bases\ncame into question. The BTFP provided stable funding for these high-quality assets, addressing\nthese concerns. Specifically, the BTFP provided one-year loans to banks in sound financial\ncondition against Treasury securities and agency securities, valued at par.\nBy doing so, the BTFP addressed banks’ immediate concerns about the stability of their\nfunding and mitigated the risk that banks would be forced to liquidate assets in a fire sale,\nlocking in losses. BTFP advances provided confidence that banks would have sufficient funding\nto retain the securities on balance sheet. The program supported confidence among depositors\nthat their banks would have ready access to sufficient cash to meet their needs, thus helping\nreduce concern that a self-fulfilling panic could cause additional bank runs.\n12 See Department of the Treasury, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (2023), “Joint Statement by Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC,” joint press release,\nMarch 12, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312b.htm.\n13 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), “Federal Reserve Board Announces It Will Make\nAvailable Additional Funding to Eligible Depository Institutions to Help Assure Banks Have the Ability to Meet the\nNeeds of All Their Depositors,” press release, March 12,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230312a.htm; and Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (2025), “Bank Term Funding Program,” webpage,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/financial-stability/bank-term-funding-program.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nUsage of the BTFP was widespread across the banking sector, both in terms of actual\nusage and from a contingency standpoint. For example, at its peak, BTFP borrowing exceeded\n$160 billion, and collateral posted to the BTFP reached nearly $540 billion, suggesting that\nbanks saw value in being prepared and having capacity to tap the facility if necessary. Over\n1,800 institutions borrowed from the program, and the bulk of the borrowing was among\ninstitutions with less than $10 billion in assets. These smaller institutions took out 50 percent of\nloans by value and nearly 95 percent of loans by volume. Fed staff analysis showed the usage\nwas more likely among institutions that had experienced deposit outflows, but usage was also\nwidespread at firms that did not experience outflows. The broad-based actual and contingency\nuse was consistent with Federal Reserve communications that the program was part of prudent\nliquidity management and that we encouraged all depository institutions to use the\nprogram. Now, about two weeks before all remaining outstanding BTFP loans are set to mature,\nthe program is down to less than $200 million, and the program has experienced no losses.14\nOur response to the stress worked. After the announcement of the systemic risk\nexception and the BTFP in early March, signs of broad-based contagion subsided, and the system\nstabilized. While in the first two weeks of March midsize and regional banks experienced\nsignificant outflows of deposits, the acute phase of outflows had eased by the end of the month.\nStability among banks that had earlier come under pressure didn’t mean that every bank found its\nfooting, but the process of dealing with balance sheet gaps was much smoother and spillovers\nremained contained. By the fall of that year, deposit flows had fully stabilized and midsize and\nregional banks saw deposit inflows on net.\n14 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2025), Statistical Release H.4.1, “Factors Affecting\nReserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks” (February 20),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20250220.\n\n- 8 -\nManaging Additional Stress beyond Silicon Valley and Signature Banks\nWhile the announcement of the systemic risk exception and the BTFP on March 12,\n2023, helped stabilize banks in the United States, we were also continuing to manage stress in\nthe global financial system in cooperation with relevant authorities.\nCredit Suisse, a Swiss global systemically important banking organization, had been\nexperiencing stress over several years before March 2023, with doubts about its future viability\nafter the Archegos Capital Management and Greensill Capital scandals had tarnished its\nreputation and raised doubts about its business model. Stress and outflows at Credit Suisse\npicked up in the fall of 2022, and we spent many months working with Swiss, European, and\nU.K. regulators on how to manage the growing issues, including war-gaming potential resolution\nscenarios. Concerns about the firm’s viability accelerated on March 9, 2023, when it was forced\nto announce that its internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective and had been for\nseveral years. Though Credit Suisse continued to operate, it became apparent that the firm was\nin trouble in the week following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank.\nJust one week after SVB failed, Swiss authorities arranged for Credit Suisse to be\nacquired by UBS in a weekend deal that involved triggering Credit Suisse’s contingent\nconvertible capital instruments, a severe dilution of shareholders, and the removal of senior bank\nmanagement, as well as emergency liquidity support and extraordinary loss sharing from the\nSwiss government.15 In a sense, Credit Suisse had failed very slowly over many months—even\nyears—and then all at once.\n15 See Michael S. Barr (2023), “The Importance of Effective Liquidity Risk Management,” speech delivered at the\nECB Forum on Banking Supervision, Frankfurt, Germany, December 1,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20231201a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nThe combination of these events involved coordination across U.S. and foreign\njurisdictions, with careful monitoring and cooperation to identify risks to financial stability and\nto monitor spillovers to the U.S. and European banking systems.\nBack in the United States, we worked with our domestic counterparts as a handful of\nadditional banks remained under pressure in the months that followed. Notably FDIC-\nsupervised First Republic Bank was closed on May 1, 2023. First Republic had also experienced\ntremendous stress in March, as it suffered deposit outflows of nearly 20 percent in a single day.16\nFirst Republic withstood these outflows in part because of significant discount window lending,\nas well as the extraordinary coordination among several other banks that placed significant\ndeposits at the bank—worth $30 billion. But over time, it became clear that First Republic’s\nrapid and large deposit outflows and unrealized losses on loans and securities would lead to its\nfailure as well.17\nWhile these were the events that got the headlines, the Federal Reserve continuously\nmonitored other banks with potential balance sheet vulnerabilities, including those with gaps in\ninterest rate and liquidity risk management, as well as significant exposures to office commercial\nreal estate. We worked with these firms to ensure they addressed their vulnerabilities, while they\nbolstered their liquidity positions to manage potential stress. For example, overall, from March\n2023 to March 2024, banks of all sizes and condition, including many not under direct stress,\npledged more than $1 trillion in additional collateral to the discount window. Banks and\nsupervisors took a wide variety of steps to shore up resilience throughout the system.\n16 See Michael S. Barr (2024), “On Building a Resilient Regulatory Framework,” speech delivered at Central\nBanking in the Post-Pandemic Financial System 28th Annual Financial Markets Conference, Federal Reserve Bank\nof Atlanta, Fernandina Beach, Florida, May 20,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240520a.htm.\n17 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2023), FDIC’s Supervision of First Republic Bank, (Washington:\nFDIC, September 8), https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2023/pr23073a.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nPrinciples and Practices for Managing Financial-Sector Stress\nWhen a crisis hits, the stakes are high. In the GFC, millions of Americans lost their\nhomes, their jobs, and their dreams for their futures, when savings for education and retirement\ndisappeared with the collapse of asset prices.18 The contraction in credit hurt small businesses\nand families all across the country. When banks can’t carry out their role in supplying credit to\nthose who need it, the effects are severe and widespread.\nWith those stakes in mind, here are five key principles that I learned in my experiences\nmanaging financial crises.\nFirst, crisis response needs to be forceful. The factor that transforms a series of\nunfortunate events into a self-sustaining crisis is the belief that there is no end in sight and no\nprospect of a sufficient response. While we could debate whether every aspect of the GFC\nresponse was necessary, one clear lesson from this experience, and from other crises I have been\ninvolved in, is how important it is that the response be forceful enough to convince market\nparticipants and the broader public that there is a capability and the will to overcome the crisis.\nA second principle is that the response should be proportionate. While a forceful\nresponse is important to bolster confidence in the prospects for gaining control over the crisis,\nthe response also must avoid shaking confidence by suggesting that conditions are worse than\nthey seem. In a crisis, information is spread unevenly. A response that is out of proportion—for\nexample, by touching aspects of the financial system not considered endangered—can be\nmisinterpreted as providing vital information about the extent of vulnerabilities.\nAnother key component of crisis management is the need to engage in decisionmaking\namid significant uncertainty. I explained how the response needs to be both forceful and\n18 See National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis, The Financial Crisis Inquiry\nReport (note 6).\n\n- 11 -\nproportionate. Finding this balance requires making tough judgments amid rapidly evolving\nconditions. Crisis managers need to make consequential decisions quickly with the recognition\nthat their understanding of the facts is incomplete. Even the best of efforts to understand what is\nhappening and what is needed will be unsatisfactory in the moment. Decisionmaking under\nthese conditions takes some courage. It also takes humility: the ability to listen to others around\nyou, gather different perspectives, and weigh the imperfect information in real time.\nA fourth principle is the need for clear communication—internally to the teams working\non the response and externally to the public. And these communications need to be consistent\nwith each other and with the values of the institution, even if tailored to the particular audience.\nClear internal communication provides direction to the crisis response teams and facilitates\ncoordination across relevant public-sector actors. Clear external communication, when grounded\nin a realistic assessment of the situation, can calm markets and reassure the public about the\nstrategy. And clear communication is a two-way street: It involves listening to internal and\nexternal perspectives, as well as speaking in a way that can be heard.\nAnd that brings me to the fifth principle I would cite, which is accountability. Financial\ncrises come about because of a lack of confidence in counterparties and among other participants\nin the financial system. It is crucial for crisis responders to be credible and accountable not only\nfor assessing the root causes of the crisis, but also for addressing these causes and the aftermath.\nThat requires staying focused on the long-term goals for reform even as crisis management\nremains critically important and urgent.19\n19 I have discussed some thoughts on leadership attributes in previous speeches, including here: Michael S. Barr\n(2024), “Commencement Remarks,” delivered at the American University School of Public Affairs Graduation\nCeremony, Washington, May 10, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240510a.htm.\n\n- 12 -\nPractices for Effective Management under Periods of Stress\nThese are important principles, and I will talk a little bit about some of the practices we\nused as we were guided by these principles. One crucial component of successful management\nof a stress event is to gather the most relevant information as quickly as possible. In a large and\ncomplex organization, it is necessary to overcome barriers to information flow across functions.\nIn the case of the March 2023 banking stress, we drew from across the functions of the central\nbank to gather real-time information necessary to assess the severity of the conditions facing\ntroubled institutions and also to identify potential levers of response.\nSupervisors generally have real-time information from a bank as it undergoes stress, but\nthis information needs to be put into context with foundational knowledge about the firm, such as\nthe current structure of its balance sheet and typical payment flows. While we managed an\ninflux of reports about deposit flows at banks, it was important to be able to immediately put the\nsize of the outflows in context and corroborate anecdotal reports against multiple sources,\nincluding from our own systems. Our next step is to assess a firm’s capacity to weather\nadditional stress. First responders can assess if the firm has maximized the liquidity potential of\nits assets, including through its relationships with liquidity providers. And one needs to assess\nthese firms’ connections to the rest of the financial sector and identify interlinkages and\nspillovers. Leaning on experts who engage in broader monitoring of financial markets and\nengage in outreach with well-established contacts can be important. A team of staff who have\nthe capacity to think broadly across the institution and draw on the partnerships they have built\nwith a range of business lines is necessary to support the kind of information gathering and\nstrategizing that are crucial for consequential decisions. This is why an institutional culture that\n\n- 13 -\nsupports curiosity and openness to ideas and inquiry from the most junior to the most senior staff\nis foundational.\nEarlier I mentioned the principle of needing to be accountable to the public about the\nsources of the crisis and to address the underlying vulnerabilities that led to it. On March 13,\n2023, in consultation with Chair Powell, I requested a review of the failure of SVB. Self-\nevaluation is the first step in any sound risk-management framework. Experienced career staff\nfrom across the Federal Reserve System who were not involved in SVB’s supervision reviewed\nthe reasons for the bank’s failure.20 The review helped identify where the supervisory and\nregulatory functions of the Federal Reserve could be improved. Additional reviews by external\nindependent parties, which we welcomed, reached similar conclusions.21 More broadly,\ncarefully considering the underlying vulnerabilities that contributed to the stress helped the Fed\ndevelop proposals for how the supervisory and regulatory framework could be improved.22\nConclusion\nNo leader looks forward to managing through a crisis, but those who hope to be good\nleaders need to be good crisis managers. These are skills that are most effectively developed\nthrough hard experience, but we can also learn from those who have gone through the\nexperiences. In my case, the lessons of dealing with financial crises as a government official\nhave revealed to me some basic principles that I believe can be useful to crisis managers. I have\nalso learned that the best crisis management occurs beforehand, by strengthening rules and\n20 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), Vice Chair Barr for Supervision’s “Review of the\nFederal Reserve’s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank - April 2023: Key Takeaways,” webpage,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2023-April-SVB-Key-Takeaways.htm.\n21 See Government Accountability Office (2023), “Bank Regulation: Preliminary Review of Agency Actions\nRelated to March 2023 Bank Failures” (Washington: GAO, May 11),\nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106834; and Board of Governors, Office of Inspector General, Material Loss\nReview (note 5).\n22 See Barr, “On Building a Resilient Regulatory Framework” (note 16).\n\n- 14 -\nnorms and other structures meant to reduce the risk of a crisis in the first place and by fostering\norganizational values and culture that will help manage a crisis when it comes.\nThank you.i\ni Note: On February 25, 2025, the announcement date of the Bank Term Funding Program's creation was updated to\nMarch 12, 2023.",

It’s\nBlack History Month, and I feel privileged to be at this great historically Black\nuniversity, speaking on a topic of such vital importance to our country.\nI made my first trip to this state as a government official a quarter century ago, to\nClarksdale, Mississippi. I remember it was a sweltering July day, and we visited a local\ncabinet manufacturer with Bill Bynum, who, in my judgment, is one of the heroes of the\neconomic justice movement. The company had received financing from Hope, which\nwas then known as the Enterprise Corporation of the Delta. On that hot day, President\nClinton called on banks to do more to meet the needs of their communities, to do more\nunder a revamped Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), and to help set up or support\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions, or CDFIs, such as Hope, partnering with\nthe newly created CDFI Fund at Treasury.\nAnd he called on Congress to pass the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) to\nprovide tax credits to individuals and corporations for making equity investments in\nCommunity Development Entities (CDEs) in places such as the Mississippi Delta. This,\nin turn, would help establish and grow local businesses, create jobs, increase local\npurchasing power, and generate more local investment opportunities.\nCongress enacted the NMTC in December 2000 with bipartisan support. Since its\ninception, CDEs like Hope have used the program to support a wide array of job-creating\nbusinesses that increase local access to goods and services as well as to increase the\n1 The views here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.

To date, the\nNMTC program has awarded over $71 billion of tax credits, which translates, among\nother things, into 857,000 jobs and almost 239 million square feet of commercial real\nestate.2 In addition, the CDFI Fund has awarded more than $5.5 billion in grants and\nguaranteed over $2.1 billion in bonds.3\nThese programs and others like them also enable CDFIs to increase access to\nfinancial services in underserved communities, which can lead to opportunity and greater\neconomic mobility. This morning, we heard insightful discussions about economic\nmobility in the Deep South, including how to create ladders of economic opportunity, and\nthe important role that access to financial services plays in economic mobility.\nDiscrimination, the Racial Wealth Gap, and Disparities in Access\nWe all have an interest in promoting a vibrant economy as well as resilient\nfamilies and communities. In such an economy, people would have access to credit on\nfair and equal terms to build a secure financial foundation. Yet, despite widespread\nacceptance of this vision, we have a way to go in making it a reality, particularly for\nBlack households. I’m going to speak to three drivers of this disparity, and three ways\nthat the financial services community should work together to address them.\n2 Treasury Announces $5 Billion in New Markets Tax Credit Awards to Revitalize Low-Income\nand Distressed Communities.

Federal\nReserve System https://www.fedsmallbusiness.org/survey/2022/2022-report-on-firms-owned-by-\npeople-of-color\n\n- 4 -\nCompounding these challenges is the racial wealth gap.9 Federal Reserve data\nfrom 2019 show that White families had about eight times the wealth of Black families.10\nWhite families had a median wealth of approximately $188,000, compared to $24,000 for\nBlack families.11 Lower levels of wealth make it difficult for people of color to finance a\ndown payment for a home, invest in education, or establish a small business—all central\nto the American dream. These low levels of wealth also make it difficult for Black\nfamilies to weather emergencies, such as job loss, or pay for unexpected expenses, which\ncan lead to eviction, repossession of vehicles, and other devastating consequences.\nAnd there are racial disparities in financial services. While there has been\nsignificant progress over the last twenty-five years in expanding access to banking\nservices, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)’s most recent annual survey\nof the unbanked and underbanked found that the unbanked rate for Black households was\n11.3 percent, compared to just 2.1 percent for White households.12 The unbanked rate for\nBlack households in Mississippi was more than double the national average for Black\nhouseholds—23.2 percent.13 Lacking a bank account can present challenges for saving—\nleading to the same insecurities I noted above—and lead to reliance on expensive,\nalternative products. In addition to higher unbanked rates, only 48.8 percent of Black\n9 For example, see Yellen, J. L. (2014). Perspective on Inequality and Opportunity from the\nSurvey of Consumer Finances.

I’ll set out three areas in which\nfinancial institutions and regulators should do their part to address these issues, although\nthe issues are complex and multifaceted, and there are no easy solutions.\nFirst: Eradicate discrimination in lending and other financial services, and protect\nconsumers from other unfair, abusive, or illegal practices. It is incumbent on financial\ninstitutions to devote resources to stamp out these practices, and on regulators to\nreinforce the importance of this goal through supervision and enforcement.\nSecond: Look for opportunities to support a vibrant and thriving economy for the\nbenefit of everyone. This means seeking out opportunities to invest in low- and\nmoderate-income (LMI) communities, small businesses, and community infrastructure.\nThird: Develop products and services that can help people save and build wealth.\nEradicating Discrimination\nI’ll start with our collective responsibility for eradicating discrimination in\nunderwriting, lending, and other aspects of financial services. For most of our country’s\nhistory, the United States government and many state and local governments, as well as\n14 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households. Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC). https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/household-survey/2021report.pdf.\n15 For state-level data, see the FDIC Custom Data Table Tool.\n\n- 6 -\nmany private individuals, corporations, and organizations, did not merely fail to protect\nminorities from discrimination; they actively reinforced segregation, entrenched\ninequality, and enforced unequal policies—including through brutal violence. 16 17\nThe Civil Rights Movement brought about changes in public opinion and in law.\nDiscrimination in housing and lending became illegal in 1968 and 1974, respectively,\nthrough passage of the Fair Housing Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.\nCongress passed laws, such as the Community Reinvestment Act in 1977, to remediate\nredlining. But history casts a long shadow.\nHow can we—both banks and regulators—understand and address these problems\nwhere they persist? To start, there are some areas where we need better data. For\nexample, small business lending data required by section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act,\nonce implemented, will provide tangible insights into the availability and pricing of credit\nfor minority small businesses. Banks should also actively analyze their own data to\nidentify areas where racial disparities occur. On-the-ground testing, using techniques\nsuch as mystery shopping, may also help to identify discriminatory practices.18 And to\nthe extent that a bank uses AI or other algorithmic systems in making lending decisions,\nthey should review the underlying models, such as their credit scoring and underwriting\nsystems, as well as their marketing and loan servicing activities, just as they should for\nmore traditional models.19\n16 See Rothstein (2017).\n17 See Cook (2014).\n18 Mystery shopping involves two individuals who are identical except for a protected class\nattribute (such as race), and has these individuals apply for credit products. The results are\nexamined for disparate treatment based on that attribute.\n19 See SR Letter 11-7. See also Morse & Pence (2020), which explores the potential of fintech to\nincrease financial inclusion and attendant consumer protection risks.\n\n- 7 -\nRacial bias in the residential real estate market has long been noted as a source of\nconcern.20 In January, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s\nAppraisal Subcommittee held a public hearing on appraisal bias in the residential real\nestate market. I look forward to working with my fellow regulators to help ensure that\nindividuals are treated equally in the appraisal process regardless of race or the racial\ncomposition of neighborhoods.\nMore generally, there is another, glaringly obvious reason for banks to do all they\ncan to eradicate discrimination in lending. It is simply good business. Ensuring that all\nwould-be borrowers are treated equally means more customers, more loans, and better\nreturns for banks.\nThe Federal Reserve and our fellow regulators have a clear responsibility to use\nour supervisory and enforcement tools.21 All firms have a responsibility to operate in a\nmanner consistent with safety and soundness and in compliance with laws and\nregulations, including those related to consumer protection. Congress provided\nregulators with supervisory and enforcement tools to help ensure that supervised firms\nresolve consumer protection weaknesses as well as the more pervasive risk management\nissues that often lead to those weaknesses. We have a close working relationship with the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators and integrate other\nregulators’ consumer-focused reviews—such as examinations for unfair, deceptive, or\n20 See Rothwell and Perry (2022).\n21 The Dodd-Frank Act divided responsibility for supervising banks under consumer protection\nlaws between the prudential regulators and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB),\nwith the CFPB having primary responsibility for certain laws for banks with assets greater than\n$10 billion. Specifically, the Federal Reserve and the CFPB have overlapping authority for state\nmember banks on Unfair, Deceptive, and Abusive Acts and Practices (UDAP/UDAAP) matters.\nThe Federal Reserve also has responsibility for supervision of bank holding companies, including\nannually assessing risk management and compliance.\n\n- 8 -\nabusive acts or practices, as well as fair lending—into our assessments of bank holding\ncompanies, including in the context of applications for mergers and acquisitions. Such\ncollaboration is critical to ensure a level playing field and strong consumer protection\nenforcement.\nSupporting Vibrant Communities\nBut even if we address current discriminatory practices, we are still left with the\nlegacy of discrimination and redlining, which helped perpetuate economically depressed\nBlack neighborhoods.22 Historically, these neighborhoods have not had the benefit of\nrobust credit and financial services, which hindered their growth and left them less\neconomically connected than wealthier neighborhoods. This lack of connectivity can\nhave a large impact on an individual’s economic mobility.23 Before turning to the role of\nregulators, let me first speak a bit about the role of private institutions in supporting these\ncommunities.\nFirst, CDFIs and Minority Depository Institutions or MDIs are critical because\nthey deliver financial products to places and people often left behind by other financial\ninstitutions. Compared to other banks, MDIs originate a greater share of mortgages to\nminority borrowers and borrowers who live in lower- and middle-income census tracts.24\nAnd they played a critical role in disbursing the PPP. Recent legislation bolstered the\nCDFIs with funds from the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP). Hope\nFederal Credit Union estimates that the ECIP funds it received will allow it to double its\n22 See, e.g., Rothstein, R. (2017).\n23 See Chetty, Jackson, Kuchler, Stroebel, Hiller, Oppenheimer & team (2022).\n24 See Friesenhahn & Kwan (2021).\n\n- 9 -\nconsumer, mortgage, small business, and consumer lending portfolios over the next six\nyears, and Hope was able to mobilize $140 million of PPP funds to small businesses.25\nCommunity banks also serve an important role. Through their lending to local\ncommunities and small businesses, they often know their customers personally and\nengage in community-building activities.\nLarge banks also have a key part to play. For example, in 2022, many large\nfinancial institutions initiated or expanded special purpose credit programs, many of\nwhich provide mortgage assistance to benefit Black and Hispanic communities.26 In\naddition to their own lending, they help support MDIs and CDFIs through technical\nassistance and investment. They often share expertise in technology, business support\nsolutions, tax considerations, and bringing programs to scale.\nAnd, as is often true, the impact can be greatest through collective efforts. In\n2015, while I was at the University of Michigan, I helped a former student, James Wahls,\ndesign a program to bring together a local CDFI, philanthropies, and several banks, to\nlaunch the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund in Detroit. The Fund extended credit to small\nbusinesses in Detroit that otherwise might not qualify for bank lending, at the rate of\nmore than $2 million a year.27 And that same approach is now being used by eight\n25 Testimony of William J.

Freddie Mac’s Equitable Housing\nPlan described its multi-year plan to develop its own special purpose credit program and provide\nliquidity pursuant to the program https://www.freddiemac.com/about/pdf/Freddie-Mac-Equitable-\nHousing-Finance-Plan.pdf.

Closer to home,\nHope—together with a large bank and a set of HBCUs—has partnered to form the Deep\nSouth Economic Mobility Collaborative. This program provides capital, educational\nresources, and business support services to small businesses and entrepreneurs in the\nDeep South, especially those from underserved and under resourced communities.\nTurning to the role of regulators, we should do what we can to encourage the\nprivate efforts I mentioned above. For instance, the Fed’s Partnership for Progress helps\nMDIs navigate their unique business challenges, provides MDIs with resources for\ntechnical assistance, and conducts research on the unique challenges faced by LMI\ncommunities.28 We conduct and promote research on CDFIs and engage in thought-\nleadership to explore ways to bring additional capital and liquidity to the CDFI sector.29\nIn addition, regulators should also ensure that our regulations provide appropriate\nincentives for banks to invest in LMI communities and lend to LMI households. The\nCRA helps to address redlining and other systemic inequities in access to credit,\ninvestment, and banking services faced by LMI communities. The last major revisions to\nthe CRA’s regulations were made in 1995, and it is high time that we strengthen and\nmodernize the regulations to reflect the many changes in banking since then. In 2022, the\nFederal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n28 Minority Depository Institutions.

Federal\nReserve Bank of New York https://www.newyorkfed.org/outreach-and-education/community-\ndevelopment/community-development-finance-conference\n\n- 11 -\nrequested comments from the public on a proposal to do just that. Importantly, the\nproposal would encourage banks to expand access in LMI communities to home\nmortgage, small business, and other credit, to make community development\ninvestments, and engage in lending and banking services. The proposal would adapt the\nregulations to address changes in the banking sector, including internet and mobile\nbanking, and update the approach to assessment areas. It also would provide more\nclarity, consistency, and transparency for CRA evaluations and eligible activities. I\nsupport the overall objectives of the proposal, and I am pleased that all three agencies are\nworking together to have unified regulations.30 The agencies are benefitting from the\nthoughtful comment letters we received on the proposal, and all three agencies are hard at\nwork finalizing the rule.\nAnother area where Congress directed the Board to consider the convenience and\nneeds of communities is through our review of bank mergers. As I’ve said before,\nmergers are a feature of vibrant industries, but the advantages that firms seek to gain\nthrough mergers must be weighed against the risks posed, and the costs and benefits to\nthe community. There is likely important work we can do to improve our assessment of\nthe convenience and needs factor for bank mergers.\nWe also have an important role to play in ensuring that our safety and soundness\nregulations do not needlessly impede financial inclusion. For example, banks can make\ninvestments that support LMI communities, called public welfare investments, subject to\ncertain caps. We plan to change our approach to computing the public welfare\n30 Summary of Key Objectives of the Interagency CRA Proposal. Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/files/cra_npr_key_objectives_20220505.\npdf.\n\n- 12 -\ninvestment caps for state member banks using New Markets Tax Credits, and similar\ncredits, which would allow state member banks to make additional investment in LMI\ncommunities. And as ECIP funds are made available, regulators have an important role\nto play in ensuring our examiners are informed and knowledgeable about the work being\nconducted under these new programs.\nResponsive Products\nLast, let me turn to the need to develop products that are responsive to customer\nneeds. As many have said, it’s expensive to be poor. And many poor people lack any\nfinancial slack, such as savings, to tide them over through an emergency. No slack often\nmeans that a small problem can snowball into larger ones. As a result, low- and\nmoderate-income consumers often use alternative financial services, such as payday\nloans, which can help fill needs but are often high-cost and can lead to debt traps. There\nis an opportunity for traditional banks and mission-driven organizations to fill this gap,\nbut to be effective, they need to understand consumer preferences and behavior to\nprovide products and services that meet these needs in a safer and fairer way.\nStarting with customer preference, we know that speed can be key. Income\ndisruption and unexpected expenses are more common in LMI households, and quick\naccess to a loan can make all the difference. With proper safeguards, unsecured small\ndollar credit to consumers with less-than-prime credit scores can be very important in\nhelping people meet this need.31 We have seen banks begin offering small dollar loans to\nsome existing customers by factoring account data into the provision of credit. Now\n31 In May 2020, the Federal Reserve, working with other regulators, issued the Interagency\nLending Principles for Making Responsible Small-Dollar Loans to encourage lending to small\nbusinesses and consumers\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20200520a1.pdf.\n\n- 13 -\nthere is a growing number of additional banks in this space. These products are typically\navailable through the bank’s online interface, which streamlines the process and speeds\nup decisions. Although some of these may be considered high-cost products, they are\nstill less costly than payday loans or the cost of what many banks charge for overdraft\nprotection.\nAs an operator and regulator of payment systems, the Federal Reserve also has a\nrole in faster payments. We’re working to launch FedNow, which, once widely adopted,\nwill better enable banks to offer customers the ability to send and receive money\nimmediately at low cost. We can also make a difference by updating our rules on check\nclearance, so that consumers and small businesses still receiving checks have access to\ntheir funds in a timelier manner. And of course, we need strong consumer protections in\nplace so that consumers don’t have to worry about making payments in a safe way.\nThe Bank On initiative has been hugely successful in both identifying bank\naccount features that meet customer preferences and getting those accounts into the hands\nof consumers. Strongly recommended features include low minimum balances, no\noverdraft fees, robust transaction options, and online bill pay.32 More than 46,000 banks\nand credit union branches across the country currently offer Bank On certified accounts,\nand more than 5.8 million Bank On-certified accounts were open and active in 2021.33\n32 Bank On National Account Services, 2023-2024.

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/community-development/bank-on-national-data-hub/bank-on-report-\n2021.\n\n- 14 -\nIn addition to considering customer preference, product design should help to\ncounter, not lean into, biases that can lead to poor financial decision-making.34 Being\naware of these can help banks help customers better understand risks and structure\nproducts that are designed to overcome, and not exacerbate, these problems. For\ninstance, banks should ensure that their overdraft policies frame financial decisions in a\ntransparent and fair way and avoid unexpected and hefty fees.35 Customers should be\nempowered with timely information on balances so that they can avoid inadvertent\noverdrafts, and best practice builds in a grace period for customers to cure their\noverdrafts. Some banks have eliminated overdraft fees entirely.\nRegulators need to understand both human decision-making and market context in\ndesigning the right rules of the road. Regulators also need to engage with techniques,\nsuch as cash flow underwriting and alternative data, new credit models, and other\ntechnologies that hold out the promise to increase access and reduce bias in credit\nintermediation.36\nDiversity in the workforce of financial institutions also matters for financial\ninclusion. For instance, working with minority loan officers improves credit access for\nminority borrowers, which suggests that underrepresentation of minorities among loan\nofficers adversely impacts minority access to credit.37 And we regulators need to focus\non our own diversity as well.\n34 See Barr, Mullainathan & Shafir (2012).\n35 See, e.g., Consumer Compliance Supervision Bulletin, July 2018.

As I said at the outset, these are complex problems with no easy\nsolutions, but we have an obligation to do our part. One final important role we have to\nplay is encouraging awareness of these issues, and conferences such as these have\ntremendous value in this regard. On that note, once again, I’d like to thank Hope and\nJackson State University for hosting today’s event, and I look forward to your questions.\n\n- 16 -\nReferences\nBarr, M., Mullainathan, S. & Shafir, E.

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nAmerican Bankers Association Annual Convention\nNashville, Tennessee\nOctober 9, 2023\n\nThank you for the opportunity to join you today.1 Let me start by recognizing Indigenous\nPeoples’ Day, and the proud history and ongoing contributions of Native Americans throughout\nthe United States. Last month, I had the privilege to visit Native communities and Native lands\nin Montana to learn about the economic development opportunities and challenges in Native\neconomies and gain a better understanding of how we can foster a financial system that works\nfor all, including those in Indian Country.\nI have spent considerable time throughout my career thinking about the potential of the\nfinancial system to make a difference in the lives of individuals and their communities. Access\nto credit and other financial services is key to families navigating the many challenges they face\nand building a better future. The pursuit of this goal inspires many of you in your jobs as well.\nBut in order for the financial system to play this role, it must be able to weather unexpected\nstress and continue to serve its customers and communities. And this requires that banks have\nsufficient capital, the subject of a proposal that the agencies recently put out for comment.\nMost of the banks represented in this room today—and the vast majority of banks in the\ncountry—would not be subject to the Board’s recent “endgame” proposal on bank capital. The\nproposal affects only the very largest banks. Even so, I suspect that you have heard a lot about\nit! The bulk of the proposed changes have been a decade in the making, and, as the name\nimplies, the proposal is the last major plank to address gaps in regulation dating from the Global\nFinancial Crisis.\nSince the Federal Reserve Board has just begun to receive comments on the proposed\nrules, I cannot say how those rules will evolve, but I can try to provide more background on why\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee or the Federal Reserve Board.\n\nI believe the benefits of the proposal would outweigh the costs. I will also discuss the\nimportance we place on public engagement in the rulemaking process to ensure we strike the\nright balance between the costs and benefits of our rules.\nThe proposal is projected to raise capital for large banks. This may result in higher\nfunding costs. But this is only half the story. Capital also enables banks to absorb more losses\nwithout risking their ability to repay their creditors.\nThe effective rise in capital requirements related to lending activities in the current\nproposal is a small portion of the estimated overall capital increase. The bulk of the rise in\nrequired capital anticipated in the proposed rule is attributed to trading and other activities\nbesides lending—activities that have generated outsized losses at large banks and areas where\nour current rules have shortcomings. The estimated increase in capital required for lending\nactivities on average—inclusive of both credit risk and operational risk requirements—is limited.\nSuch a rise might be expected to increase the cost to banks for funding the average lending\nportfolio by up to 3 basis points—0.03 percentage points.2 We recognize that the cost of funding\nfor a specific loan would depend on the specific risk weight for that activity, and that there may\nbe other channels by which higher capital requirements could matter. This is an area where\ncommenters can shed light on additional considerations for the cost and benefits of the rule.\nThe private costs of capital must be weighed against the social benefits of higher capital\nin creating a healthier, more resilient financial system, and reducing the likelihood of financial\ncrises. As we indicated in the preamble to the endgame proposal, historical experience—\n2 As noted in the preamble to the proposal, the agencies estimated that the capital increase for lending activities due\nto the proposal was roughly equivalent to a 30 basis point rise in required risk-based capital ratios across large\nbanking organizations A 30 basis point rise in the required capital ratio would lead to an increase of 15 to 30 basis\npoints in additional capital required for typical loan portfolios with risk weights between 50 percent and 100 percent.\nAssuming conservatively that the cost of equity capital is roughly 10 percent greater than the cost of debt funding,\nthis would lead to a rise of 1.5 to 3 basis points in the cost to fund each dollar of a typical loan portfolio.\n\nparticularly our experience during the Global Financial Crisis—demonstrates the severe impact\nthat distress or failure at individual banking organizations can have on the stability of the U.S.\nbanking system. Fifteen years ago, the Global Financial Crisis starkly revealed the cost to\nsociety of a banking system that had held insufficient capital. In the lead-up to the financial\ncrisis, the rules didn’t fully capture the credit and operational risks of asset classes like subprime\nmortgages, securitizations, and derivatives, which led to enormous losses at banks. Banks were\nwoefully undercapitalized for these losses. The financial crisis upended lives and did severe\ndamage to the economy, causing the worst and longest recession since the Great Depression. It\ntook six years for employment to recover, during which time long-term unemployment ran for\nlong periods at a record high, and more than 10 million people fell into poverty. Six million\nfamilies lost their homes to foreclosure. And these costs occurred even with an unprecedentedly\nlarge response by government.\nResearch suggests the costs of a financial crisis are sizable. While estimates vary widely,\nthe cumulative loss in economic activity is consistently estimated to lie above 20 percent of\nannual GDP—and in some estimates up to 100 percent of GDP. For the United States, these\nestimates imply losses from financial crises of $5 trillion to $25 trillion based on current GDP.3\nThe macroeconomic benefit of increased capital comes from reducing the likelihood of such a\ncostly event. Better capitalized banks are better able to absorb losses and continue to lend to\n3 See Simon Firestone, Amy Lorenc, and Ben Ranish, “An Empirical Economic Assessment of the Costs and\nBenefits of Bank Capital in the U.S.,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review 101, no. 3 (2019),\nhttps://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2019/07/12/an-empirical-economic-assessment-of-the-costs-and-\nbenefits-of-bank-capital-in-the-united-states. See also Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 2010, ‘‘An\nassessment of the long-term economic impact of stronger capital and liquidity requirements’’ (BCBS, 2010) and\nMacroeconomic Assessment Group, ‘‘Assessing the macroeconomic impact of the transition to stronger capital and\nliquidity requirements’ (2010).\n\nhouseholds and businesses through times of stress, which in turn, helps to ensure that we have a\nhealthy and strong economy.\nThe Strength of the Initial Reforms\nFollowing enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\nAct (Dodd-Frank Act) in 2010, the Board adopted an initial set of reforms to increase the\nquantity and quality of capital, run an annual supervisory stress test, and set a capital surcharge\non global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) to reflect the greater risk these firms pose to\nU.S. financial stability. These initial reforms have greatly strengthened our banking system and\nthe common equity capital ratio of the largest banking organizations more than doubled, from\n5.5 percent in 2009 to 12.4 percent at the end of last year.\nAs these initial reforms were being put in place, many in the banking sector claimed that\nthe changes would harm lending and the broader economy. Since then, the U.S. economy has\ngrown substantially, and the U.S. banking system has grown from $12 trillion in assets to\n$23 trillion. Bank profitability measures—which dropped dramatically in the Global Financial\nCrisis—have mostly recovered and are close to historical averages. So as banks increased their\ncapital cushions, their profitability grew, as did their market valuation. The increased strength\nhas enabled banks to support the economy. U.S. banks have maintained their position at the top\nof the league tables of global capital markets activity.\nThis is not to dismiss arguments that higher capital could harm the economy—just to note\nthat similar warnings were not borne out in recent experience.\nThe Case for Building on the Initial Reforms\nWhen the initial reforms were put in place, bank regulators acknowledged that these\nchanges were a partial measure and that there were further elements of the capital rule that\n\nneeded adjusting: Less reliance on internal models for credit risk; operational risk should be\ncaptured in a standardized way; and capital requirements did not fully capture market risk.4 The\nagencies’ proposed rule attempts to address these issues.\nFirst, the proposal would remove the use of banks’ internal models to set credit risk\ncapital requirements. In the agencies’ experience, the subjective choices made for internal\nmodels have produced unwarranted variability across banking organizations in requirements for\nexposures with similar risks.5 This can weaken confidence, reduce transparency, and challenge\ncomparisons of capital adequacy across banking organizations.\nFor these reasons, the proposal would replace the internal models approach for credit risk\nwith a non-modeled approach. This so called “expanded risk-based approach” would be\nsensitive to important drivers of credit risk but would be standardized, transparent and consistent\nacross banks. The proposal contains adjustments relative to the international Basel Capital\nAccord to ensure that on average small and large banks are required to hold similar levels of\ncapital for key credit portfolios. The large banks subject to the proposal would continue to also\nbe subject to the same U.S. standardized approach as applicable to all firms, in order to maintain\ncompetitive equity across the full range of providers of credit. The agencies have sought\ncomment on this approach to competitive equity in light of the U.S. standardized approach\nrequirement and the generally higher overall calibration of the proposed requirements.\n4 Press release: Reports on measures to reduce risk-weighted asset variability and on Basel III implementation by the\nBasel Committee (bis.org).\n5 The Basel Committee has published analysis illustrating the variability of credit-risk-weighted assets across\nbanking organizations. See https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs256.pdf and https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d363.pdf. One\nresult of these analyses is that across banking organizations, for an identical portfolio of wholesale loan exposures,\nrequired capital based on banks’ internal models could vary by as much as 15 percent in either direction around a\nbenchmark level.\n\nSecond, turning to operational risk, large banks have experienced significant losses due to\noperational weaknesses over the past two decades. Experience shows that operational risk is\ninherent in all banking products, activities, processes, and systems and that losses at the largest\nbanking organizations can be substantial.\nUnder the current capital rule, the very largest, most complex banking organizations\ncalculate risk-weighted assets for operational risk using internal models. These models can\npresent substantial uncertainty and volatility.6 In the agencies’ proposal, the operational risk\ncapital requirements would be standardized rather than modeled and would be a function of a\nbanking organization’s business volume and historical operational losses. Research suggests that\nbanking organizations with higher overall business volume are likely to have exposure to higher\noperational risk. 7 Further, higher operational losses are associated with higher future operational\nrisk exposure. 8\nThird, the Global Financial Crisis taught regulators and banks many difficult lessons\nabout the importance of robust capital requirements for trading and market making activities.\nBanks at the time were undercapitalized, in particular, for the large losses that occurred in\n6 See, e.g., Eric W.

Although the current capital rule was updated to better\nreflect this risk following the crisis, the current approach has some material shortcomings. Most\nnotably, the current framework could result in capital requirements increasing during stress,\nrather than requiring firms to hold sufficient capital in advance of the stress to be manage\nthrough a stress period. The framework also did not account for the large range of liquidity\nprofiles across trading exposures.9\nThe aim of the revised market risk framework is to comprehensively address the lessons\nof the Global Financial Crisis. The revised framework would permit banks to use their own\nmodels to compute elements of the market risk capital requirements only when such risk can be\nmodeled well. Models under the new framework would need to better account for the possibility\nof large outlier events—tail risk—and for the illiquid nature of some trading exposures. The\nframework would also recognize that diversification that is beneficial in quiet times may not\nmaterialize under stress. The framework would backstop internal modeling with a new\nstandardized approach to market risk, to be applied to trading portfolios where banks are unable\nto demonstrate that their models adequately capture risk.\nImportance of Comments and the Comment Period\nThe comment period is an important part of the rulemaking process.

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nPolicy Summit 2025: Building Strong and Sustainable Communities,\nhosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\nCleveland, Ohio\nJune 26, 2025\n\nThank you, Eric, thank you to the conference organizers for asking me to speak\ntoday, and thank you, especially, to the practitioners here for the work you do in building\nstronger communities.1 Your mission has also been at the center of my career in many\ndifferent roles as an academic, a practitioner, and a public official, starting as the\nTreasury Department’s point person on community development way back in the 1990s.\nCommunity development has been an important part of my work ever since, as a\nprofessor, a university leader, and, most recently, a banking regulator. I think this might\nhelp you understand how thrilled I am to have recently taken on the role of consumer and\ncommunity development point person among the members of the Board of Governors, in\nsupport of Eric and his team and of the CD function throughout the Fed System.\nStrong and sustainable communities are crucial to the Federal Reserve’s mission\nof promoting a healthy economy and a stable financial system. Under the Community\nReinvestment Act (CRA), the Fed has a statutory obligation to supervise how banks meet\nthe credit needs of the communities they serve, consistent with safe and sound lending\npractices. Our community development work reinforces the benefits of this effort. More\nbroadly, community development work helps the Fed support a strong and healthy\neconomy. Our primary tool for doing this is monetary policy. Monetary policy\ninfluences interest rates and financial conditions to affect economic activity. We adjust\ninterest rates in service of seeking price stability and maximum employment for the\nAmerican people.\nLet me spend just a moment on the U.S. economy and the outlook. The economy\nis currently on a sound footing, with low and steady unemployment, and disinflation\n1 The views expressed here are my own are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nhaving continued at a gradual, albeit uneven, pace toward our 2 percent target. Low-\nincome households can ill afford increases in prices, and that’s why it is so important that\nwe bring inflation back down to our target. Looking forward, however, I expect tariffs\nwill put upward pressure on inflation. Higher short-term inflation expectations, supply\nchain adjustments, and second-round effects may cause some inflation persistence. At\nthe same time, tariffs may cause the economy to slow and unemployment to rise. Low-\nincome workers are often hit the hardest when the job market weakens. There is still\nconsiderable uncertainty about tariff policies and their effects. Monetary policy is well\npositioned to allow us to wait and see how economic conditions unfold.\nTurning from monetary policy to community development, let me explain how\ncommunity development also serves the goals of supporting a healthy economy that\nworks for all Americans. While monetary policy matters a lot, other factors have to come\ntogether for people to have good job opportunities. Businesses need access to credit to\nexpand and hire, and in many communities that credit depends on the CRA, community\ndevelopment financial institutions, and a range of other public policies. Businesses need\nqualified workers, and in many places that depends on workforce development that is\nsupported by community development organizations. Businesses that invest to create\njobs need to believe in the future and believe in the future of the communities they serve.\nThriving businesses and productive workers need safe, healthy, strong, and sustainable\ncommunities. These conditions are fundamental to achieving the Federal Reserve’s goals\nthat Congress has established.\n\n- 3 -\nIn Every Community\nThat is a big reason why the Fed’s community development function is such an\nimportant part of the Federal Reserve System. Getting monetary policy decisions right\nrequires a deep understanding of the conditions of local economies across the nation.\nThis need is one of the reasons that the Fed was designed as an institution with a presence\nin every region of the country, ensuring that the experiences and perspectives of people\nfrom everywhere are considered in the decisions we make. It is why the Federal Reserve\nis actively seeking input from the public in formulating our long-term goals and strategy\nfor monetary policy, with listening sessions around the country, including one right here\nat the Cleveland Fed. We want to hear from as many communities as we can, and an\nimportant way to do that is through our long-standing connections to organizations that\nare supporting strong and sustainable communities. In addition to the work you do, we\nvalue your perspectives, especially on how low- and moderate-income communities are\nfaring in the economy. Federal Reserve policymakers depend on a lot of data, such as the\nunemployment rate, in making our decisions, but numbers can only go so far, and we also\nrely on actual experiences, on the ground, of people like you and those you serve.\nBeyond providing insights on economic conditions, the Fed’s community\ndevelopment function supports the economy by promoting access to credit and other\nfinancial services among small businesses and low- and moderate-income households and\ncommunities. This access is a cornerstone of economic opportunity and resiliency. By\nanalyzing and disseminating information on local financial needs and highlighting\nsuccessful approaches for attracting and deploying capital, the Fed’s community\ndevelopment work advances economic vitality in communities across America.\n\n- 4 -\nThe Fed staff who work on community development also work closely with the\nsupervisors overseeing bank compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. By\nensuring that these two functions are working together, we can support financial\ninstitutions’ awareness of promising opportunities to meet their obligations under the\nCRA. Beyond supporting these statutory obligations, the insights gathered by the Fed’s\nCD function serve as an early warning system of risks in the financial system. CD\nprograms help spot emerging trends that may, for example, reveal patterns of unfair\ntreatment of borrowers or signal risks to the safety and soundness of lending practices in\nparticular communities.\nWhat Makes Community Development Work\nI’ve outlined the important role that support for community development plays at\nthe Federal Reserve. Now I’d like to offer a few words on effective community\ndevelopment—what works, and some ideas for how it might work even better. While we\nhave learned a great deal over the years about promoting healthy and vibrant people and\nplaces, there are substantial opportunities to expand and adapt successful approaches to\nnew areas. As an institution committed to conducting and disseminating high-quality,\nindependent, and actionable research, the Federal Reserve will continue to conduct and\nsupport research on community development, and policymakers, including me, will\nhighlight that research and engage with the public on new ideas for creating economic\nopportunity, particularly in low- and moderate-income communities.\nThis includes conducting original quantitative research to shed new light on\nevolving challenges, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’ recent research\nlooking into the incidence of youth disconnection from the labor force and education, and\n\n- 5 -\nhow that differs across communities. As far as collecting data, I would also point to our\nCommunity Perspectives Survey and the Small Business Credit Survey, which the\nCleveland Fed has conducted since 2020.2\nBeyond collecting and analyzing data, the Federal Reserve’s CD function also\nconducts qualitative research to understand the “why” behind the data. For example, the\nPhiladelphia Fed recently published insights from their conversations with employers in\nthe manufacturing as well as the leisure and hospitality sectors in Pennsylvania, New\nJersey, and Delaware on how they are addressing staffing challenges.3\nAnother way that the Fed helps advance knowledge is through convenings like the\none we’re a part of today. For example, the San Francisco Fed recently hosted the\nCalifornia Rural Success Summit, which aimed to connect rural stakeholders across the\nstate and to showcase innovative efforts to enhance access to jobs and credit across rural\nCalifornia.4 These convenings can also take the form of virtual events, such as the New\nYork Fed’s recent webinar exploring local approaches to developing and rehabbing\naffordable apartments.5\nThese are a few of the ways that the Fed’s community development work helps\nexpand knowledge across the field. Communities also need to know how to apply that\nknowledge and have access to the partners and resources needed to do so.

MAX, as it is\nknown, helps bring together employers with those involved in training, apprenticeships,\nand certification programs to fill specific demands.8 And, lastly, I would include the\nOccupational Mobility Explorer, an interactive tool developed by the Federal Reserve\nBanks of Cleveland and Philadelphia that allows workers to explore career paths and\nvisualize how job skills can transfer to higher-paying occupations.9\nFed CD staff also help investors and community development organizations\nconnect with each other to explore mutually beneficial opportunities to work together.\nThrough initiatives like the Kansas City Fed’s Investment Connection and the Richmond\n6 Additional information on the Working Places Initiative is available on the Boston Fed’s website at\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/workingplaces.aspx.\n7 Additional information is available on the Dallas Fed’s website at https://www.dallasfed.org/cd/at.\n8 Additional information about the Metro Atlanta eXchange for Workforce Solutions is available at\nhttps://metroatlantaexchange.org.\n9 Additional information about the Occupational Mobility Explorer is available on the Philadelphia Fed’s\nwebsite at https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/community-development-data/occupational-\nmobility-explorer.\n\n- 7 -\nFed’s Rural Investment Collaborative, the Federal Reserve helps communities identify\npotential financing partners who can move their ideas to action.10\nThese are just some of the ways the Federal Reserve supports the work of\ncommunity development practitioners, who, as I have described, in turn support the\nFederal Reserve’s work of promoting a healthy economy and a safe and stable financial\nsystem. Thank you for the work you do and for sharing some time with me today as we\nwork together now and into the future to achieve our community development goals.\n10 Additional information about Investment Connection is available on the Kansas City Fed’s website at\nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/community/investmentconnection; additional information about the Rural\nInvestment Collaborative is available on the Richmond Fed’s website at\nhttps://www.richmondfed.org/region_communities/rural/rural_investment_collaborative.",

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nAlan Meltzer Speaker Series\nKogod School of Business\nAmerican University\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 18, 2025\n\nI am pleased to be here today to discuss a core part of the Federal Reserve’s\nmission: banking supervision.1 Much of what the Fed does to conduct monetary policy,\npromote a stable financial system, provide a safe and efficient payments system, and\nsupport consumers and community development depends on a healthy banking system.\nLending fuels entrepreneurship, helps families buy homes, and enables communities to\nthrive—all critical aspects of a healthy economy. Ensuring banks operate in a safe and\nsound manner is essential because the banking system sits at the center of the economy.\nThat is why banks’ risk-taking must always be guided by clear guardrails, underpinned\nby effective banking supervision.\nWe need these guardrails because experience shows that market discipline alone\ndoes not prevent excessive risk-taking by banks.2 As I’ve noted before, time and again,\nperiods of relative financial calm have led to efforts to weaken regulation and\nsupervision.3 This has often had dire consequences, as we saw prominently during the\nGlobal Financial Crisis.\nIn the midst of that crisis, I saw first-hand in my own community in Michigan\nwhat weak regulation and supervision could mean: foreclosed homes, shuttered\nbusinesses, and lost jobs. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,\nMichigan’s unemployment rate was 14.9 percent in 2009, meaning one in seven workers\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 For example, in 2008 Alan Greenspan testified before Congress that he had “found a flaw” in his ideology\nof trusting markets to self-correct.

There are growing pressures to weaken\nsupervision—to scale back examiner coverage, to dilute ratings systems, and to redefine\n“unsafe and unsound”—in ways that will make it harder for examiners to act before it is\ntoo late to prevent a build-up of excessive risk. These pressures present real dangers to\nthe American people.\nThe Mission of Banking Supervision\nLet me begin with the mission of bank supervision, which is to promote a safe,\nsound, and efficient banking system that supports a strong economy.6 Our banking\nsystem relies on trust. That trust is earned when banks behave responsibly and when\nsupervisors effectively perform their statutory duties. These duties include verifying that\nbanks are operating soundly and identifying and addressing weaknesses before they\nthreaten the solvency of particular banks and possibly spread through the financial\nsystem. Supervision also ensures compliance with laws and regulations that safeguard\nthe integrity of the banking system. This reduces the risk of misconduct or malfeasance,\nincluding real-world consequences of fraud, consumer abuse, cyberattacks, money\n4 Martin Lavelle, “How Tight Is Michigan’s Labor Market?” Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (Michigan\nEconomy Blog), October 11, 2016, https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/blogs/michigan-\neconomy/2016/how-tight-is-michigans-labor-\nmarket#:~:text=Michigan's%20labor%20market%20continues%20to,shorter%20and%20milder%202001%\n20recession.\n5 Christopher J.

Trust in the banking system relies on strong\nsupervision.\nBenefits of Supervision\nSupervision delivers clear benefits not only for individual banks but also for the\nstability of the financial system as a whole. Enforcement actions are associated with\nlower systemic risk, and research shows that banks subject to more oversight are safer\nand just as profitable as their peers.7 While supervision does impose costs, it is most\neffective when calibrated to the risks each institution poses. More closely supervised\nbanks tend to experience steadier income and fewer loan losses, making them more\nresilient during times of stress, when contagion risks are greatest.8\nSupervision is critical to the Federal Reserve’s mission to promote the stability of\nthe financial system and contain systemic risk. A macroprudential perspective—where\nwe look across the entire banking system for correlated risks—complements traditional\nmicroprudential oversight where we examine individual banks. This is done by focusing\non risks that threaten financial stability and the banking system’s core functions: credit,\npayments, and intermediation. Our economy depends on a strong and stable financial\nsystem, which makes banking supervision essential for every household and business.\nThe Foundations of Effective Supervision\nEffective supervision begins with appropriate regulation as a foundation.\nRegulation provides the rules of the road that establish minimum capital levels, liquidity\nrequirements, and define permissible activities. But regulation alone is not enough.\n7 Beverly Hirtle, Anna Kovner, and Matt Plosser, “The Impact of Supervision on Bank Performance,”\nJournal of Finance 75, no. 5 (2020): 2,765–2,808, https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.12964.\n8Hirtle, Kovner, and Plosser, “The Impact of Supervision on Bank Performance,” 2798-99.\n\n- 4 -\nSupervision is necessary to ensure banks stay on the road and comply with the rules,\nespecially as conditions shift and new risks emerge.\nEffective supervision depends on its human capital. The knowledge necessary to\nbe an effective examiner comes from both formal training and through an accumulation\nof on-the-ground practical exposure. Supervisory staff carry responsibility for risk\nidentification and analysis and execution of examinations to assess whether a firm truly\nunderstands its risks, whether its governance and controls are effective, and whether its\ncapital and liquidity are sufficient for its business model. Institutional knowledge and\nexperience-based judgment are critical for supervisors’ ability to manage these\nresponsibilities. They take time to develop and cannot be easily replicated.\nEffective supervision also requires moving with speed, force, and agility\nappropriate to the risks posed. This requires institutional commitment to act swiftly as\nrisks emerge, using supervisory tools decisively, and adapting to shifts in markets or the\neconomy.9\nEffective Supervision Under Pressure\nBeyond these foundations, effective supervision is based on numerous other\nfactors. Today I will outline key components of strong, effective supervision that are at\nrisk of being seriously weakened in the current environment.\nA credible ratings framework. First, effective supervision requires a credible\nrating system.10 A credible rating system incentivizes firms to promptly remediate\n9 Michael S. Barr, “Supervision with Speed, Force, and Agility,” speech delivered at the Annual Columbia\nLaw School Banking Conference, New York, NY, February 16, 2024,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20240216a.htm.\n10 Banks receive ratings that quantify their safety and soundness based on supervisory exams. Ratings\nevaluate banks’ performance on key risks, including their capital and liquidity positions and management\nquality.\n\n- 5 -\nweaknesses by translating supervisory assessments into objective outcomes that matter\nfor management and boards of directors. It ensures consistency across institutions,\nsupports transparency in how risks are evaluated, and anchors supervisory discipline.\nCrucially, a credible rating system looks beyond immediate financial metrics to\nthe quality of a firm’s governance, internal controls, and risk management practices.11\nWeak management rarely shows up first as a capital or liquidity problem. Rather, it\nbecomes evident through inconsistent processes, inadequate escalation of supervisory\nconcerns, unclear lines of accountability, and organizational blind spots that, over time,\nallow risks to accumulate. These weaknesses can prevent management from seeing and\neffectively acting on emerging risks. A ratings system that captures only past actions that\nhave resulted in observable financial harm is inherently backward-looking. It will miss\nthe risks of what may come.\nUnfortunately, the framework for supervisory ratings is currently being modified\nin ways that diminish its strength and credibility. For example, earlier this month, the\nFederal Reserve Board issued its final rule making changes to the Large Financial\nInstitution (LFI) rating system.12 Poor performance is being deemphasized, which is\ntantamount to grade inflation, a problem this academic audience understands. As I noted\nin my dissent, I believe these changes reduce incentives for large banks to fix serious\n11 See, for example, key findings that the Management component of CAMELS ratings has significant\npredictive power for future bank risk/performance. Lewis Gaul and Jonathan Jones, “CAMELS Ratings\nand Their Information Content,” OCC Working Paper WP-2021-01 (Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency, January 2021), https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-\nresources/publications/economics/working-papers-banking-perf-reg/economic-working-camels-\nratings.html.\n12 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Federal Reserve Board Finalizes Changes to Its\nSupervisory Rating Framework for Large Bank Holding Companies,” press release, November 5, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20251105a.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nmanagement problems.13 They will also allow firms with significant governance\nweaknesses to expand or acquire other enterprises, raising the chance and cost of future\nfailure. Changes to the LFI rating system also reduce supervisory attention on\ncompliance matters for the largest banks. As such, bank holding companies could have,\nfor example, seriously deficient consumer compliance programs but still be considered\nwell managed. Further, the revisions remove the presumption that large firms with\nsignificant deficiencies must face an enforcement action—a move that could significantly\nweaken accountability for poor practices. And in taking this action, the Board ignored a\nmore moderate reform option that would have established a composite rating for large\nbank holding companies.\nIn addition, I understand that efforts are currently underway to modify the\nCAMELS rating system, the interagency framework used by supervisors to assess banks’\noverall condition.14 Some have proposed changes that would effectively diminish the\nweight assigned to the management component. I believe that such a move would be\nmisguided and shortsighted. The “Management” rating is not simply one item among\nsix; it is the element that ties the others together. It measures the quality of governance,\nrisk identification, internal controls, and the institution’s ability to respond to emerging\nthreats.15 Strong management can compensate for unexpected stress, whereas weak\n13 “Statement on Large Financial Institution Rating Framework by Governor Michael S. Barr,” press\nrelease, November 5, 2025, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/barr-statement-\n20251105.htm.\n14 CAMELS evaluates six components: Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings,\nLiquidity, and Sensitivity to Market Risk. Each component is rated on a scale from 1 to 5, and together\nthey form the institution’s composite rating, which supervisors rely on to evaluate safety and soundness.\nSee Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System,”\nSR letter 96-38 (December 27, 1996), https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/1996/sr9638.htm.\n15 See Gaul and Jones, “CAMELS Ratings and Their Information Content” (finding that Management\nrating is most strongly correlated with composite rating of all CAMELS components and has significant\npredictive power for future bank performance and risk measures).\n\n- 7 -\nmanagement can magnify even modest vulnerabilities. Deemphasizing the rating\nsystem’s focus on management could lead to significant increases in risk, even in\ninstitutions that look good on paper.\nFurthermore, in October, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and\nthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) proposed a rule that would limit the\nissuance of enforcement actions for “unsafe or unsound practices.”16 This would have\nthe effect of making it harder for supervisors to issue an enforcement action and compel a\nbank to fix its flaws. This effectively ties examiners hands. The proposed rule would\nalso limit the issuance of matters requiring attention, or MRAs, which are supervisory\nfindings used to prompt a bank to act quickly to fix problems before they become\nenforcement actions. The new standards for issuing enforcement actions and MRAs\nwould center on a narrow definition of “material financial risk” and exclude material\nnonfinancial risks except in limited circumstances, such as violations of law.\nTo put this into context, under the standard established by this proposed rule, a\nbank with woefully deficient controls to prevent money laundering or discrimination\nwould not necessarily receive an MRA requiring the bank to correct the situation unless\nthe bank had actually violated the law or supervisors were able to identify a material\nfinancial harm that had already occurred due to the lapse in controls or that could be\nshown to likely cause such harm. Waiting to act until the bank, its customers, or\npotentially the financial system have been harmed is not a responsible approach to risk\n16 Unsafe and unsound practices would be defined under Section 8 of the FDIA as any act, practice, or\nfailure to act that deviates from generally accepted standards of prudent banking and either causes material\nharm to an institution’s financial condition or, if continued, would be likely to do so or pose a material risk\nto the Deposit Insurance Fund. See https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/10/30/2025-\n19711/unsafe-or-unsound-practices-matters-requiring-attention.\n\n- 8 -\nmanagement or supervision. Bottom line—under this proposal, examiners will issue\nfewer MRAs, even where financial and operational risks have been identified. This will\nalso lead the agencies to issue fewer enforcement actions. I fear that the Fed may head\ndown a similar, or even worse, path, further tying supervisors’ hands.\nFurthermore, I am concerned about an initiative that will allow the banks\nthemselves to decide whether a supervisory finding or requirement imposed by an\nenforcement action should be lifted. Under this approach, if a bank had a satisfactorily-\nrated internal audit function, that internal audit function would have the ability to decide\nif the bank had appropriately remediated a deficiency identified in the supervisory finding\nor enforcement action. A bank’s internal audit function would essentially displace\nvalidation by Federal Reserve examiners. Examiners would not independently determine\nwhether the terms of the supervisory findings or enforcement action provisions had been\nmet, or whether the bank’s changes were sustainable. A parallel approach was tried\nat the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), where the internal audit function\nof Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was permitted to “validate” remediation of MRAs,\nand FHFA’s supervisory division sometimes accepted that validation in closure\ndeterminations without independent validation. In 2018, the FHFA’s inspector general\nfound this problematic, and warned that allowing such discretion “without a predicate\nsupervisory conclusion … creates the risk that … assessments … will be impaired.”17\n17 Federal Housing Finance Agency: Office of Inspector General, FHFA Requires the Enterprises’ Internal\nAudit Functions to Validate Remediation of Serious Deficiencies but Provides No Guidance and Imposes\nNo Preconditions on Examiners’ Use of That Validation Work (FHFA: OIG, March\n2018), https://www.fhfaoig.gov/Content/Files/EVL-2018-002_Redacted.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nThis is a bad idea for bank prudential supervision, and to be clear, will not be\nimplemented in the consumer compliance function.\nForward-looking supervision. A second component of effective supervision is\nthat it must be forward-looking.18 The purpose of supervision is to prevent risks from\nbecoming problems that harm banks and the public. By anticipating vulnerabilities and\nprompting early action, supervisors use tools such as stress testing and scenario analysis\nto prevent problems from escalating. In contrast, backward-looking supervision often\ndetects weaknesses only after they become serious problems. Forward-looking\napproaches, grounded in judgment and horizontal comparisons, are more effective in\npromoting the safety and soundness of individual banks and safeguarding financial\nstability. In short, supervision needs to see and point out how weak risk management can\nlead a bank to be vulnerable to unanticipated shocks.\nStress tests illustrate this principle clearly: they are supposed to provide a rigorous\nway to assess resilience under severe but plausible conditions that may occur in the\nfuture. Supervisory stress tests are structured exercises conducted by supervisors to\nevaluate how a bank’s capital and earnings would perform under adverse macroeconomic\nscenarios—such as a sharp rise in unemployment, a collapse in asset prices, or a severe\nmarket disruption. They are designed to test the soundness of a bank’s balance sheet and\nto ensure that it could continue to operate and support the economy even in times of\nstress. These tests help to uncover vulnerabilities at individual banks and across the\nfinancial system.\n18 Tobias Adrian, Marina Moretti, Ana Carvalho, Hee Kyong Chon, Fabiana Melo, Katharine Seal, & and\nJay Surti, “Good Supervision: Lessons from the Field,” IMF Working Paper WP/No. 23/181 (International\nMonetary Fund, September 2023): 18–20, https://doi.org/10.5089/9798400253782.001.\n\n- 10 -\nIn October, the Federal Reserve proposed several changes to our heretofore-\nsuccessful stress testing program.19 I noted then that the proposed changes risk turning\nthe stress test into a rigid exercise that offers false confidence by producing overly\noptimistic results driven by less conservative modeling and opportunities for banks to\ngame the process.20 The proposed changes would weaken capital requirements and erode\nincentives for strong independent risk management. Weaker stress tests mean worse\nsupervision.\nAnother valuable forward-looking tool that has been criticized lately is the use of\nhorizontal reviews, supervisory examinations focused on a specific topic across multiple\nbanks simultaneously. This technique allows supervisors to spot emerging risks, helping\nsupervisory frameworks remain proactive rather than reactive. Because financial risks\ndevelop and change at a faster pace than regulation, horizontal reviews are valuable to\ncompare practices and outcomes across banks, identifying patterns of systemic or inter-\nfirm amplification that might otherwise go undetected.21 Just as importantly, horizontal\nreviews promote consistency and fairness in supervisory judgments. They are not meant\nto impose rigid benchmarks or uniform expectations, but rather to shed light on emerging\nvulnerabilities, highlight sound practices, and ensure that judgments are grounded in\ncomparable evidence. Severely limiting their use would constrain supervisory insight\nand weaken the ability of supervisors to address emerging problems.\n19 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/boardmeetings/enhanced-transparency-and-public-\naccountability-proposal-frn.pdf.\n20 “Statement on Proposals to Enhance the Transparency and Public Accountability Of the Board’s Stress\nTesting Framework By Governor Michael S. Barr,” press release, October 24, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/barr-statement-20251024.htm.\n21 “Horizontal reviews and benchmarking provide a cross-sectoral perspective of risks, enable a deeper\nreview of certain topics and promote consistency in the exercise of expert judgment...Horizontal reviews\nthat focus on a specific issue across banks are increasingly used for a proactive, forward-looking\nsupervisory approach.” See https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/wp45.pdf at 2.\n\n- 11 -\nA strong supervisory staff. Finally, effective supervision requires skilled\nsupervisory staff. The strength of a supervisory system depends not only on its policies\nand tools, but also on the expertise, capacity, and judgment of the people who implement\nthem. Adequate staffing—measured both by headcount and experience—ensures that\nsupervisors can conduct thorough examinations, identify emerging risks early, and\nrespond swiftly to signs of instability. It also supports the institutional memory and\ncontinuity needed to assess complex financial institutions over time. Having sufficient\nand experienced staff is crucial.\nStaff at both the Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks play distinct but\ncomplementary roles in safeguarding the banking system. Board staff in Washington,\nD.C., focus on risk identification, oversight, consistent policy, horizontal reviews, and\ncoordination across the entire banking system. Most Board supervisory staff who focus\non day-to-day supervision of banks work on banks with assets exceeding $10 billion\nrather than community banks. Reserve Bank examiners conduct most day-to-day\nsupervision of individual banks and holding companies. Together, these efforts form an\nintegrated supervisory framework.22\nRecently announced plans to reduce staffing in the Board’s Supervision and\nRegulation division by 30 percent by the end of 2026 will impair supervisors’ ability to\nact with the speed, force, and agility appropriate to the risks facing individual banks and\nthe financial system. Such a drastically reduced staff will slow response time for the\npublic and the banks themselves, limit supervisory findings and enforcement actions, and\n22 “Understanding Federal Reserve Supervision,” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, last\nmodified April 27, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/understanding-federal-reserve-\nsupervision.htm.\n\n- 12 -\nerode supervisors’ ability to be forward-looking. Losing experienced supervisory staff\nwith institutional knowledge also means the system will have diminished capacity to\nmanage crises when they arise. Among other things, the financial crisis showed that the\nFed’s bank supervision had failed to keep up with the growth in the size and complexity\nof the banking system, and it took nearly a decade afterward to build up this capacity.\nNow it is being gutted, practically overnight.\nThe impact of these staffing cuts is compounded by reductions at other\nsupervisory agencies. Deep reductions in force are also underway at the FDIC, the OCC,\nand the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), with the CFPB recently\nannouncing that it would not seek any funding for the foreseeable future.23 It is difficult\nto argue, as some have, that the Federal Reserve can rely solely on the work of other\nagencies in its holding company evaluations when those agencies are also experiencing\nsignificant contraction.\nCumulative Effect of Weakened Supervision\nLet me close by emphasizing that I support the healthy evolution of banking\nsupervision. It is both natural and appropriate to regularly assess supervisory approaches\nand tools over time. After periods of crisis, regulators logically strengthen oversight to\nprevent a recurrence. After periods of relative stability, there is often pressure to lower\nthe guardrails put in place. Adjustments can be constructive, but they must be made with\nforesight and care to preserve the hard-won resilience of the financial system.\n23 Katanga Johnson and Weihua Li, “Trump Cuts Thousands of Wall Street Cops While Markets Swing,”\nBloomberg, May 7, 2025, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/trump-s-layoffs-cut-more-\nthan-2-300-from-us-bank-and-markets-regulators?sref=zNmRQ0gk.\n\n- 13 -\nToday I have outlined several essential components of robust banking supervision\nthat, I believe, are being altered without sufficient appreciation for the consequences of\nthese actions. Weakening any one of these elements diminishes supervisory\neffectiveness; taken together, the cumulative impact could be profoundly damaging to\nbanks and destabilizing for the financial system.\nHistory reminds us that we have seen this pattern before, including in the financial\ncrisis.24 Periods of weakened supervision have often preceded episodes of financial\nexcess and instability. The erosion of supervisory resources, the diminished focus on\ngovernance and controls, the weakening of forward-looking tools, and the constraints\nplaced on supervisory action all undermine supervisors’ ability to adequately protect\nagainst excessive risk taking. When coupled with broader deregulatory momentum, these\ntrends create a dangerous environment for both institutions and the economy at large.\nThe vulnerabilities that weaker supervision and regulation create may not be\nvisible in the short term. They rarely are. But experience tells us that the bill always\ncomes due. The only question is when, and how high the cost will be.\n24 Michael S.

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 18, 2025\n\n2\nAdvances in artificial intelligence (AI) have accelerated rapidly over the past few years.1\nIt is now commonplace to see autonomous vehicles navigating city streets, and generative AI\ntools are available on phones and other devices wherever we go. AI innovations make headlines\nand play a big role in financial markets, and generative AI has the potential to change how we\nthink about productivity, labor markets and the macroeconomy.2 Today, I will address that\nquestion by outlining two hypothetical scenarios for AI’s impact and the implications for\nbusinesses, regulators, and society. I will focus my comments on Generative AI, or GenAI, a\nsubset of AI that has seen significant growth and integration into economic activity in just a few\nshort years.\nGenAI and Its Adoption\nCompared to earlier iterations of AI, GenAI is able to generate content, which allows it to\nsignificantly enhance productivity across a range of knowledge-based activities and be used by\npeople without coding skills. GenAI will likely become a “general purpose technology,” with\nwidespread adoption, continuous improvement, and productivity enhancements to a wide range\nof sectors across the economy. We are already seeing GenAI improve the productivity of its own\nR&D.3 There is widespread enthusiasm for GenAI, and survey evidence shows much faster rates\nof consumer adoption of GenAI already than were seen for the personal computer or the\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard.\n2 See, for instance, Lisa D. Cook, “Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and the Path Ahead for Productivity,” (speech at\nTechnology-Enabled Disruption: Implications of AI, Big Data, and Remote Work Conference, Atlanta, Georgia,\nOctober 1, 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20241001a.htm.\n3 See Gaurav Sett, “How AI Can Automate AI Research and Development,” RAND Commentary, October 24, 2024,\nhttps://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/10/how-ai-can-automate-ai-research-and-development.html.\n\n3\ninternet.4 While actual deployment of GenAI is limited to some business functions, and there\nhave been pitfalls along the way, businesses in almost every sector are experimenting with or\nconsidering how to make use of the technology.5\nFirms are also exploring Agentic AI—Gen AI systems that not only produce new content,\nbut are also able to proactively pursue goals by generating innovative solutions and acting upon\nthem at speed and scale.6 Imagining Agentic AI’s ultimate application, some speculate that we\ncould experience a “country of geniuses in a data center”—a collective intelligence that\nsurpasses human capabilities in problem-solving and collaboration.7 Some believe Agentic AI\nhas the potential to connect ideas in disparate domains, potentially transforming research and\ndevelopment and society more broadly.8\n4 See Cory Breaux and Emin Dinlersoz, “How Many U.S. Businesses Use Artificial Intelligence?” (Washington:\nU.S. Census Bureau, November 28, 2023), https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/11/businesses-use-ai.html;\nAlexander Bick, Adam Blandin, and David J.

In the other, we see transformative change\nwhere we extend human capabilities with far-reaching consequences. For each scenario, I\nconsider the potential implications for the economy and financial sector.\nThinking through hypothetical scenarios can help widen our lens to a range of possible\noutcomes and provide a framework for assessing the balance between benefits and risks.\nScenarios are not predictions of the future, but provide a framework for analyzing the factors that\ncould lead to different outcomes. Reality is complex. GenAI adoption rates will vary across\nindustries, leading to diverse impacts on market structures. Elements of both scenarios will\nlikely come to pass, and play out at different rates, which will influence the effects on the\neconomy and society. In the short term, GenAI may be overhyped, while in the long run, it may\nbe underappreciated. And, of course, things might turn out differently from these hypotheticals.\nHypothetical 1: Incremental Progress with Widespread Productivity Gains\nFirst, let me begin with the incremental scenario, where GenAI primarily augments work\nin existing processes and leads to steady and widespread productivity gains, but does not\nfundamentally unlock new capabilities or transform the economy.\n9 Others have used other types of scenarios. See Anton Korinek, “The Economics of Transformative AI,” The\nReporter (Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research, December 31, 2024),\nhttps://www.nber.org/reporter/2024number4/economics-transformative-ai; Iñaki Aldasoro, Leonardo Gambacorta,\nAnton Korinek, Vatsala Shreeti, and Merlin Stein, “Intelligent Financial System: How AI Is Transforming Finance,”\nBIS Working Papers No. 1194 (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for International Settlements, June 2024),\nhttps://www.bis.org/publ/work1194.pdf; and Ethan Mollick, Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI (New\nYork: Portfolio/Penguin, 2024).\n\n5\nIn this state of the world, GenAI tools enhance efficiency and enable more personalized\nsolutions across industries, in ways that have incremental—but still meaningful—effects on\npeople’s lives. For instance, in customer service, professional writing—but not this speech—and\nsoftware engineering, GenAI-powered tools are already supporting workers, improving accuracy\nand speed, and these effects could spread to other sectors.10 In this world, health care sees\nsignificant improvements as GenAI reduces administrative burdens, assists with diagnostics, and\npersonalizes treatment plans based on real-time patient data. Medicines and other treatments are\ndeveloped at a faster pace.11 Education is similarly affected, as GenAI alleviates administrative\n10 For worker productivity gains in customer service, see Erik Brynjolfsson, Danielle Li, and Lindsey R.

Community banks leverage GenAI-\npowered chatbots to provide customized financial advice rooted in local knowledge, while\ninstitutions of all sizes continue to advance use of GenAI for compliance monitoring, fraud\ndetection, risk management, and document analysis.15\n12 For more on education, see Justin Wolfers, “An Econ Educators Guide to our AI-Powered Future,” Macmillan\nLearning, EconEd (presentation), September 26, 2024,\nhttps://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/events/econed#:~:text=Justin%20Wolfers%20Speaks%20at%20Eco\nnEd%202024&text=He%20discusses%20AI%20tools%20like,focus%20on%20core%20economic%20principles;\nand Anne J.

Humans\nwould use GenAI as a tool to deliver goods and services that we currently produce in a more\nefficient way. Productivity would go up. The economy would grow at a faster pace. 16\nWhat does this mean for the labor force? The impact will depend on the industry and the\nnature of the job. GenAI experiments suggest the technology holds the promise of levelling up\nskills and bringing productivity of lower-performing workers into line with higher performing\nworkers.17 In other cases, it could augment the highest performers, leaving them more time for\ncreativity or strategic aspects of their roles. Increasing automation for certain tasks may displace\nsome workers, where certain skills can be replicated by GenAI. Historically, as technology has\nreplaced some jobs, it has augmented existing roles or created new ones.18 However, this is not\nto downplay the individual cost for workers who need to retrain, find other employment, or\nchange careers in response to major changes in labor demand. Society will need to account for\nthese possible effects of AI.\nWhat does this mean for the economy? As I noted before, the economy should grow, if\nthe incremental productivity gains are widespread. However, in this scenario, it is possible that\nthe expected value creation from GenAI was overhyped, anticipating transformative\nbreakthroughs rather than incremental productivity gains. This could trigger market corrections\nfor the firms that have heavily invested in this technology if reality doesn’t measure up to\n16 Lida R.

While the U.S. economy experienced a surge of productivity growth during the\ndot.com boom in the late 1990s, it was followed by a wave of bankruptcies, capital overhang,\nand a cautious business investment climate.19 The effects of the ensuing recession were\nwidespread.\nWhat does this mean for financial stability and other financial risks? In this incremental\nscenario, GenAI may magnify both the vulnerabilities and sources of resilience that already exist\nin the system. Attractive trades become more crowded, but risk managers gain new insights.20\nMalicious actors gain new tools, but cyber defenders become better armed. So long as financial\nregulators, enterprise risk managers, and others charged with managing downside risks prioritize\nefforts to keep pace with the evolving financial ecosystem, there’s nothing to suggest a wholesale\ntransformation of the balance of risks. Of course, keeping pace will pose challenges, and it’s\nimportant that we all focus on the need to meet these risks.\nHypothetical Scenario 2: Transformative Change\nNow, let’s consider a more dramatic hypothetical scenario, in which GenAI adoption\nextends beyond improving on what we currently do, and provides new expertise and capabilities\nthat have transformative effects on the economy and society. In this scenario, humans deploy\ntheir imagination and creativity—combined with robust investment in research and\ndevelopment—to deploy intelligent GenAI systems to make rapid breakthroughs in, for example,\nbiotechnology, robotics, and energy, fundamentally reshaping existing industries and creating\n19 See Ben S.

In this instance, to focus the mind, we can think of GenAI as no longer only a tool for\nscientists to analyze data—in a sense, it becomes the scientist, directing the research.21\nFor instance, let’s say that GenAI applications in health care do not simply improve how\nwe currently deliver care, but also enable therapies that target genetic mutations and cure\ndiseases previously considered incurable.22 Similarly, manufacturing evolves to create GenAI-\ndriven robotic factories, with goods produced with new materials and atomic precision. 23\nMaterials science is transformed through the discovery of programmable materials and self-\nhealing substances, all of which reshape construction, technology, and consumer goods.24\nMeanwhile, GenAI optimizes fusion energy research, expediting the shift to sustainable energy\n21 For some very early examples, see Davide Castelvecchi, “Researchers Built an ‘AI Scientist’—What Can It Do?”\nNature, August 30, 2024, https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02842-3; Daniil A.

We would need to fundamentally\nreimagine how the economy is structured.\nWhat are the impacts on the labor force, in a world where GenAI’s capabilities extend\nbeyond what humans can accomplish today? Humans may have a role to manage multi-agent\nGenAI frameworks, or fill gaps where GenAI solutions remain expensive or inefficient for some\napplications. But this is a world where some workers may see their current jobs disappearing. It\nis also a world in which they may see their own work transformed and have many more choices\nabout the work they do. The nature of labor would radically change, and this will require us to\nhave broader conversations about how to organize the economy. These conversations should\nwrestle with how to navigate major economic shifts in a way that recognizes the impact on the\nhuman condition, and the extent to which people derive their communities, friendships, personal\nsense of meaning and dignity from their work.\nWhat about the competitive landscape? There is probably a greater likelihood that\nrewards for businesses would be distributed more unevenly at first, as significant breakthroughs\nwith far-reaching ramifications may benefit a subset of firms and industries and concentrate\n29 Large language models may even allow for the creation of synthetic data that allows for enhancing\nmacroeconomic nowcasting and forecasting through economic AI agents that can also help with analyzing\nmacroeconomic trends and contribute to more informed financial decisionmaking.

If only a handful of firms have the\nability to accomplish the incredible things I’ve mentioned above, they may dominate markets\nand crowd out competitors. To the extent that GenAI becomes broadly effective, widely\navailable, and cheap, these market advantages could lessen over time if the right regulatory\nenvironment supports competitive market dynamics.30 But history suggests caution in this\nregard; a handful of players may dominate.31\nAnd finally, for finance, we should anticipate fundamental changes in this scenario.\nWhen it’s working well, the financial system helps move money and risk through time and\nspace.32 To the extent there are fundamental changes to how the economy is organized, we could\nneed a new set of institutions, markets, and products to facilitate transactions among households,\nbusinesses, and GenAI agents.\nWhat Should We Do?\nAmong the many ways in which we can help to harness the potential benefits of GenAI\nand minimize its risks, I will highlight only a couple today.\nFinancial institutions, and the Federal Reserve System, should consider investing\nsufficient resources in understanding GenAI technology, incorporating it into their workflows\n30 Kelly Ng, Brandon Drenon, Tom Gerken, and Marc Cieslak, “DeepSeek: The Chinese AI App That Has the World\nTalking,” BBC News, February 4, 2025, https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yv5976z9po.\n31 For example, see IBM Newsroom, “Data Suggests Growth in Enterprise Adoption of AI Is Due to Widespread\nDeployment by Early Adopters, But Barriers Keep 40% in the Exploration and Experimentation Phases,” IBM,\nJanuary 10, 2024, https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-10-Data-Suggests-Growth-in-Enterprise-Adoption-of-AI-is-\nDue-to-Widespread-Deployment-by-Early-Adopters; and Jefferies Editorial Team, “Can Startups Outsmart Big Tech\nin the AI Race?” Jefferies, September 17, 2024, https://www.jefferies.com/insights/boardroom-intelligence/can-\nstartups-outsmart-big-tech-in-the-ai-race.\n32 If AI agents proliferate in financial transactions, we will also need to be careful about the potential for unintended\nconsequences such as collusion among AI agents. See Winston Wei Dou, Itay Goldstein, and Yan Ji, “AI-Powered\nTrading, Algorithmic Collusion, and Price Efficiency,” Jacobs Levy Equity Management Center for Quantitative\nFinancial Research Paper, The Wharton School Research Paper, May 30, 2024,\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4452704.\n\n13\nwhere appropriate, and training staff on how to use the technology responsibly and effectively.33\nMeanwhile, the financial regulatory community should approach the changing landscape with\nagility and flexibility. And beyond the financial sector, collaboration between governments,\nprivate industry, and research institutions will be critical to ensure that GenAI systems are not\nweaponized in catastrophic ways. We should continue to focus on responsible AI research and\ndevelopment and implement safeguards against misuse, including monitoring systems, standards\nfor secure AI system development, and agreement on red lines for acceptable use cases.34 We\nshould be attuned to the impact of GenAI on our economic and political institutions. There’s a\nrisk that it concentrates economic and political power in the hands of the very few and could lead\nto the gains being realized only by a small group, while the rest are left behind.\nAnother thing I want to emphasize is AI governance. I think most would agree that the\ngoal of the technology is to improve the human condition, and to do that, we need to be\nintentional in advancing that goal. We should make sure that we think about GenAI as\nenhancing, not replacing, humans, and set up best practices and cultural norms to that end.\nEvery financial institution should recognize the limitations of the technology, explore where and\nwhen GenAI belongs in any process, and identify how humans can be best positioned to be in the\nloop. We should also focus on data quality, and make sure that uses of GenAI do not perpetuate\nor amplify biases inherent in the data used to train the system or make incorrect inferences to the\nextent the data is incomplete or nonrepresentative.35 In the realm of regulation, frameworks for\n33 See Request for Information on the Development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Plan, 90 Fed.

The very attributes that make GenAI\nattractive—the speed, automaticity, and ability to optimize financial strategies—also present\nrisk.36 When the technology becomes ubiquitous, use of GenAI could lead to herding behavior\nand the concentration of risk, potentially amplifying market volatility. As GenAI agents will be\ndirected to maximize profit, they may converge on strategies to maximize returns through\ncoordinated market manipulation, potentially fueling asset bubbles and crashes. Speed,\nautomaticity, and ubiquity could generate new risks at wide scale.37\nWe also should monitor how introduction of this technology changes the banking\nlandscape. Nonbanks may be more nimble and risk-forward in incorporating GenAI into their\noperations, which may push intermediation to less-regulated, less transparent corners of the\nfinancial sector. In addition, this competitive pressure may push all institutions, including\nregulated institutions, to take a more aggressive approach to GenAI adoption, heightening the\ngovernance, alignment, and financial risks I mentioned before.\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02077-2; Saul Asiel Flores, “‘Bias in, Bias out’: Tackling Bias in\nMedical Artificial Intelligence,” Yale School of Medicine, November 18, 2024, https://medicine.yale.edu/news-\narticle/bias-in-bias-out-yale-researchers-pose-solutions-for-biased-medical-ai; and Adam Zewe, “Researchers\nReduce Bias in AI Models While Preserving or Improving Accuracy,” MIT News, December 11, 2024,\nhttps://news.mit.edu/2024/researchers-reduce-bias-ai-models-while-preserving-improving-accuracy-1211.

However, as I mentioned above, elements of both scenarios\nwill likely be present in the future, and play out at different rates, which will influence the effects\non the economy and society. Rapid advances in this technology, such as Agentic AI and\nadvancements in open-source models, underscore just how new this technology is and the\nimportance of understanding what it means for individuals, businesses, and markets.

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nD.C. Fintech Week\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 12, 2022\n\nThank you, Chris, and thank you for the invitation to speak to you today about the\nopportunities and risks of innovation. For the purposes of our discussion today, I will be\nfocusing on financial innovation supported by new technologies, or fintech.1 In the fall\nof 2017, we managed to get Chris to accept an invitation to speak at a fintech conference\nin Ann Arbor, so it’s about time that I returned the favor. Since then, we have continued\nto see major changes in technologies and the financial services and products they support.\nIn looking over the materials for that conference, however, I’m struck by how the key\nthemes have remained constant over, not only the last five years, but arguably for\ncenturies. Financial innovation has always brought promise and risk, and the urgent need\nto get regulation right. In 1610, when Dutch merchants and bankers were otherwise busy\ncreating global finance, a series of destabilizing bank runs also moved them to establish a\nban on short-selling. Many of the issues we grapple with today are not as new as we\nthink.\nSupporting Innovation with Appropriate Regulation\nFirst, let’s start with the promise. Every day, we all have countless interactions\nwith the financial system—depositing our paychecks, buying groceries, paying rent,\nborrowing, saving, and insuring against important risks. The promise of fintech is that it\ncan make financial products and services better, faster, cheaper, and more available.\nFinancial innovation supported by new technologies can disrupt traditional providers by\nspurring competition, creating products that better meet customer needs, and extending\nthe reach of financial services and products to those typically underserved.\n1 I am grateful to Christine Graham, Laura Lipscomb, and John Maggs of the Federal Reserve Board for\ntheir assistance in preparing this text. The views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nTo realize the benefits of innovation, we need to manage relevant risks. We have\nseen through history that excitement over innovative financial products can lead to a pace\nof adoption that overwhelms our ability to assess and manage underlying vulnerabilities.\nAs we saw in the lead up to the Global Financial Crisis, innovative financial products can\nmask emerging risks, resulting in significant harms to businesses and households and\nultimately undermining financial stability. These products can leave consumers\nvulnerable if they are not coupled with meaningful disclosures and basic protections\nagainst abusive practices. Innovation can lead to disruptions of existing markets, which\nmay be beneficial, but may also generate new systemic risks.\nGuarding against these risks is one of the jobs of financial regulation and\nsupervision, and I’ll talk through a few examples of how we are working to do so now.\nBut I would note with some humility that striking the right balance between creating an\nenabling environment that supports innovation and managing related risks to businesses,\nhouseholds, and the stability of the financial system is no easy task. When regulations\nare too prescriptive or regulators too cautious, they run the risk of stifling innovation and\nlocking in the market power of dominant participants in ways that can raise costs and\nlimit access. When regulation is lax or behind the curve, it can facilitate risk-taking and a\nrace to the bottom that puts consumers, businesses, and the economy in danger and\ndiscredits new products and services with consumers and investors. I believe everyone\nhas a stake in getting the regulatory balance right.\nStriking the Right Balance for Crypto-Asset Activity\nCrypto-assets have grown rapidly in the last several years, both in market\ncapitalization and in reach. But recent fissures in these markets have shown that some\n\n- 3 -\ncrypto-assets are rife with risks, including fraud, theft, manipulation, and even exposure\nto money-laundering activities. Crypto-asset-related activity, both outside and inside\nsupervised banks, requires oversight that includes safeguards to ensure that crypto service\nproviders are subject to similar regulations as other financial services providers. We\ncontinue to work on this issue from the overriding principle that the same type of activity\nshould be regulated in the same way. This principle holds even when the activity may\nlook different from the typical activities we regulate, or when it involves an exciting new\ntechnology or a new way to provide traditional financial services.\nThe Board is working with our colleagues at the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to ensure that\ncrypto-asset-related activities banks may become involved in are well regulated and\nsupervised, to protect both customers and the financial system.2 Many of these activities\npose novel risks, and it is important for banks to ensure that any crypto-asset-related\nactivities they conduct are legally permissible and that banks have appropriate measures\nin place to manage those risks. In August, the Board issued supervisory guidance that\noutlines the steps Federal Reserve-supervised banks should take prior to engaging in\ncrypto-asset-related activities.3\nThe recent volatility in crypto markets has demonstrated the extent of\ncentralization and interconnectedness among crypto-asset companies, which contributes\n2 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office\nof the Comptroller of the Currency, “Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Policy Sprint Initiative and Next\nSteps,” joint press release, November 23, 2021,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20211123a1.pdf.\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, SR Letter 22-6/CA-22-6: Engagement in Crypto-\nAsset-Related Activities by Federal Reserve-Supervised Banking Organizations, August 16, 2022,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2206.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nto amplified stress. While banks were not directly exposed to losses from these events,\nthese episodes have highlighted potential risks for banking organizations. When a bank’s\ndeposits are concentrated in deposits from the crypto-asset industry or from crypto-asset\ncompanies that are highly interconnected or share similar risk profiles, banks may\nexperience deposit fluctuations that are correlated and closely linked to broader\ndevelopments in crypto-asset markets. In addition, misrepresentations regarding deposit\ninsurance by crypto-asset companies can cause customer confusion and lead to increased\nwithdrawals at banks providing deposit services to crypto-asset firms and their customers\nduring times of stress.\nThe Fed is working with the OCC and the FDIC on these issues and highlighting\nthem to supervised institutions. For example, it is important for banks to understand\nsome of the heightened liquidity risks they may face from certain types of deposits from\ncrypto-asset companies. This effort is not intended to discourage banks from providing\naccess to banking products and services to businesses associated with crypto-assets. Our\nwork in this area is focused on ensuring risks are appropriately managed. Looking ahead,\nthere are additional types of crypto-asset-related activities where the Fed may need to\nprovide guidance to the banking sector in the coming months and years.\nRegulating Stablecoins\nBecause crypto-assets have proved to be so volatile, they are unlikely to grow into\nmoney substitutes and become a viable means to pay for transactions. However,\nstablecoins, which purport to maintain a stable value, have greater capacity to function as\nprivately issued money. For this reason, they pose specific, and well-understood risks,\nsimilar to other types of money-like assets. History has shown that money-like assets are\n\n- 5 -\nsubject to runs that can threaten financial stability. Stablecoins linked to the dollar are of\nparticular interest to the Federal Reserve. As Chair Powell said the other day, a central\nbank is and will always be the main source of trust behind money. Stablecoins borrow\nthat trust, so we have an abiding interest in a strong federal prudential framework for\ntheir use.\nOver time, stablecoins could pose a risk to financial stability, and it is important\nto get the regulatory framework right before they do. Here too, the Fed is working with\nother regulatory agencies. The President’s Working Group report on stablecoins that\ncame out about a year ago called upon Congress to take the necessary action to ensure\nthat stablecoins, particularly those that serve as a means of payment, are subject to\nprudential regulation.4 Congress should take action to provide a strong federal\nframework for prudential oversight, and regulators must also use existing authorities.\nRecognizing the Risks of Tokenizing Bank Liabilities\nWe are seeing banks explore a variety of different models to issue dollar-\ndenominated tokens on distributed ledger networks. The proposals range from issuance\nof tokens on private, controlled networks to facilitate payments within or among banks,\nto proposals that explore issuance of freely circulating tokens on open, permissionless\nnetworks. As banks explore different options to tap into the potential of the technology,\nit is important to identify and assess the novel risks inherent in those models and whether\nthose risks are surmountable. For instance, with some models that are being explored,\n4 See the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency, Report on Stablecoins (Washington: PWG, FDIC, and OCC,\nNovember 2021), https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nthe bank may not be able to track who is holding its tokenized liability, or whether its\ntoken is being used in risky or illegal activity. While there is work underway on\ntechnical solutions for managing these risks, it remains an open question whether banks\ncan engage in such arrangements in a manner consistent with safe and sound banking and\nin compliance with relevant law. Given these open questions, banks looking to\nexperiment with these new technologies should do so only in a controlled and limited\nmanner. As banks experiment, I invite them to engage with their regulators early and\noften to discuss the benefits and risks of new use cases, ensuring they are consistent with\nbanking activities conducted in a safe, sound, and legally permissible manner.\nAdvancing Customer Autonomy\nLet me mention an example of where I think regulators could play a more active\nrole in shaping how innovation is changing the financial products landscape. Over the\npast decade, digitization of financial services has led to the creation of vast amounts of\ncustomer data. Advancement in technologies now facilitates greater connectivity and\nsecure data sharing between banks and nonbanks. This has served as the foundation for\nopen banking and the development of new types of financial products and services that\noffer consumers greater customization and an end-user experience with less friction,\ncompared to traditional banking.\nJurisdictions around the world have taken different approaches to open banking.\nSome, such as Australia, Britain, and the European Union have adopted a regulatory\napproach to facilitate open banking by implementing specific regulatory frameworks that\nare built upon the concepts of consumer data rights, data privacy, and competition. So\nfar, the United States has taken more of a market-driven approach to open banking. The\n\n- 7 -\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau is charged with implementing regulations to give\nconsumers access to their financial data, pursuant to Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nWhile this is not an “open banking” rule, it will set the stage for consumers to gain\ngreater control when it comes to sharing their data with prospective providers. The goal\nof this effort is to advance consumer autonomy, enhance competition for financial\nservices, and to provide easier portability of account information from bank to bank as\nwell as nonbank providers. I look forward to hearing more on this from the CFPB.\nProviding Public Sector Support for Payment Innovation\nSo let me now turn to how the Federal Reserve is taking proactive steps to work\nwith the private sector to support innovation. The Federal Reserve has been working on\nmodernizing our payment system for a few years now, and we are in the final stages of\ncreating the FedNow Service, a new platform for digital payments that will safely,\nefficiently, and instantaneously move money. FedNow will improve safeguards on\ninstant payments, making the financial system safer. And it will improve access to the\nfinancial system by reducing payment delays and the high costs associated with those\ndelays.

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(via pre-recorded video)\nat\nCrossing the Credit Barrier: Advancing Access and Creating Opportunities Conference\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nOctober 22, 2025\n\nGood afternoon and thank you to the Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, Boston,\nRichmond, and Philadelphia for hosting today’s discussions.1 You have organized a\ndynamic conversation on topics that have a significant bearing on the financial well-being\nof consumers and communities.\nFinancial inclusion and access to credit have been a long-standing focus of my\nwork and a key component of the Federal Reserve’s mission. The Fed has an important\nrole in implementing a series of laws passed by Congress related to access to credit,\nincluding the Community Reinvestment Act. Today, I will share my perspective on the\ncritical role that bank accounts, faster payments, and small-dollar loans can play in\nserving the needs of low- and moderate-income communities.\nThe ability to manage personal financial decisions safely and dependably begins\nwith access to a bank account. One program that has been successful in expanding\naccount access is Bank On, supported by the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund\n(CFE Fund). Bank On accounts certified by the CFE Fund meet standards including low\nminimum deposits for account opening and low maintenance, overdraft, and other\nunexpected fees. The Bank On National Data (BOND) Hub, hosted by the Federal\nReserve Bank of St. Louis, is a critical data set that helps us understand how financial\ninstitutions are expanding access to low-cost banking for consumers.2 It also helps us\nbetter understand how this access directly benefits different households in numerous\nways.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 See https://www.stlouisfed.org/community-development/bank-on-national-data-hub/about-data-hub.\n\n- 2 -\nBeyond account access, innovations such as more efficient payments systems,\nsmall dollar loans, and underwriting loans using alternative data, such as cash flows\nfacilitate greater financial inclusion for consumers.\nThe ability to move money faster can empower households by providing them\nwith more control over financial inflows and outflows—receiving their income and\npaying their bills. Better control over their financial lives can reduce knock-on effects\nfrom financial volatility, particularly for low-to-moderate income households with less\nfinancial slack.\nLikewise, products like bank-offered small-dollar loans can provide affordable,\nshort-term liquidity to cover emergencies and unexpected expenses. Data from the Fed’s\n2024 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking provide insights into how\nhouseholds might handle a small-dollar liquidity need. The short answer is it would be\ntough for many households. When asked how they would respond if confronted with an\nunexpected $400 expense, nearly 20 percent of adults said they would have paid at least\nin part by selling something, using a payday loan, deposit advance, or overdraft. When\nlooking at households with incomes of under $25,000, this number increased to 46\npercent.3\nA bank-offered small-dollar loan could provide help to these households. Some\nbanks have begun offering small-dollar loans that are partially or wholly underwritten\nusing alternative financial data, such as cash-flows, including deposits, paying rent and\nutilities, and the like. This type of underwriting can help assess the creditworthiness of\n3 Federal Reserve Board staff analysis of survey results, published in the Economic Well-Being of U.S.\nHouseholds in 2024 (Federal Reserve Board, May 2025),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2024-report-economic-well-being-us-households-\n202505.pdf.\n\n- 3 -\nconsumers with thin or no credit files. Additionally, cash-flow underwriting can help\nbanks offer a “second look” for consumers who would otherwise not qualify based on\nmore traditional credit-score-based underwriting models. Beyond expanding the pool of\neligible consumers, loans underwritten using alternative financial data can lead to less\nexpensive and faster loan underwriting. A safe, reasonably priced, and transparent small-\ndollar loan could help consumers better navigate the burden of emergency expenses.\nI’ve mentioned a few ways that financial services can help improve the financial\nhealth of low-and moderate-income households—through safe and affordable bank\naccounts, faster payments, and small-dollar loans. Thank you for the work you are doing\nto understand how to better serve households and small businesses in a wide variety of\nways. Better access to financial services can help communities to thrive. I hope to see\ncontinued collaboration among the Federal Reserve System and myriad stakeholders,\nincluding all of you. Through our shared efforts, we can continue to advance financial\ninclusion for all communities. Thank you.",

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nEconomic Club of Minnesota Luncheon\nGolden Valley, Minnesota\nOctober 9, 2025\n\nThank you to the Economic Club of Minnesota for the opportunity to speak to you\ntoday.1 I’m happy to be here for several reasons, one of which is that I have roots in\nMinnesota. My grandmother was born and raised in Eveleth, where her parents ran a\nsmall clothing store they opened in 1906 to serve the growing population that came here\nin the iron ore mining boom of that era. That generation’s hard work and dreams of a\nbetter future helped build this great state as well as the prosperous economy that this club\nand the Federal Reserve are both dedicated to fostering.\nWe are midway between the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) and our next meeting at the end of this month. At our last meeting in\nSeptember, we decided to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points, a decision I\nsupported. My FOMC colleagues and I also updated our projections for the economic\noutlook for the next couple of years and gave our assessments of the likely appropriate\npolicy rate path as economic conditions evolve. In my remarks today, I will share my\nown thinking related to those decisions last month, and how incoming data and other\ndevelopments have subsequently shaped my views as we head into the FOMC’s next\nmeeting in three weeks. That includes the economic implications of various\ndevelopments in Washington including the federal government shutdown, which I\nimagine is on the minds of many of you today.\nWe are currently in a challenging position, because the risks to both sides of the\nFOMC’s mandate—employment and inflation—are elevated. I agree with Chair\nPowell’s succinct view that there is no risk-free path forward for monetary policy. While\ninflation has come down a great deal since 2021, it is still above our 2 percent target and\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nis now rising. And although several data points indicate that the labor market may be\nroughly in balance, we also know there has been a sharp drop in job creation since May,\nwhich suggests risks to the labor market going forward. The most difficult circumstances\nfor making monetary policy decisions are when both mandate variables are at risk.\nLet me start with inflation. The latest data show that 12-month headline inflation\nbased on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose again in August to 2.7 percent.\nCore PCE inflation, which has historically been a good guide to future inflation, was\n2.9 percent. After falling from its high of 7.2 percent in mid-2022 to 2.3 percent in April\nof this year, PCE inflation has been rising since then.\nThat timing is no coincidence. Research by Federal Reserve staff and others\nindicates that the increase in inflation since April has likely owed largely to the sharp\nincrease in tariffs that kicked in around then. There are various measures of the overall\nlevel of tariffs. For assessing how tariffs are affecting inflation, I find it helpful to look at\ntariff collections relative to imports, which gives us a measure of the real effective tariff\nrate paid as goods come into the country. This rate has risen sharply this year, reaching\nabout 11 percent in August, and is likely to rise further in the near term.\nThe tariff hikes have boosted core goods inflation, and at the same time progress\non core services inflation has stalled. I expect that core PCE inflation will end the year\nover 3 percent.\nThe median FOMC participant estimates that headline PCE inflation will not\nreturn to our 2 percent target until the end of 2027, more than two years from today and\nsix and a half years since inflation began rising in 2021. This would be the longest period\nof PCE inflation above 2 percent since a seven-year stretch that ended in 1993. I\n\n- 3 -\nrecognize that the economy and the American people have been hit by a series of unusual\neconomic shocks in recent years—the COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdowns,\ndisrupted supply chains for goods and labor shortages, higher energy costs from Russia’s\nwar on Ukraine, and the sudden increase in tariffs this year. Even so, after the high\ninflation Americans have endured, two more years would be a long time to wait for a\nreturn to our target, and that possibility weighs on my judgment for appropriate monetary\npolicy.\nI am also concerned about further upside risks to inflation and inflation\nexpectations. While the immediate effects of tariffs on inflation have been smaller than\nmost economic forecasters had expected, the inventories built up in anticipation of the\ntariffs may have had a role in easing the immediate impact, as have compressed profit\nmargins. While that is good news for inflation, the corresponding bad news is that firms\nwill eventually run down those inventories and will only be able to compress margins for\na while. Many importers, and firms affected by imports, are reporting that they are\nwaiting as long as possible to pass on the costs from tariffs to their customers, mostly by\ntemporarily reducing profit margins.2 Normalizing margins over time implies a gradual,\nbut longer, upward trajectory for inflation, a pattern of price increases that I fear could\nconvince many consumers that higher inflation is going to be more of a permanent\nphenomenon. This is important because expectations of future inflation affect spending\n2 There is little evidence that foreign producers are absorbing the cost of tariffs; see Robbie Minton and\nMariano Somale (2025), “Detecting Tariff Effects on Consumer Prices in Real Time,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 9),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/detecting-tariff-effects-on-consumer-prices-in-\nreal-time-20250509.html.\n\n- 4 -\ndecisions in the near term and can drive a cycle of escalating inflation, as we saw after\nprices began rising in 2021.\nWith that experience in mind, I am skeptical of assurances that we should fully\n“look through” higher inflation from import tariffs. While, in principle, tariffs are a one-\ntime increase in prices and should not sustainably raise inflation, that may not be the case\nif prices keep rising month after month and affect expectations. There has been nothing\n“one-time” or predictable about these tariff increases, which have ratcheted upward this\nyear on particular countries and particular sectors in a series of steps. At some point,\nbusinesses and consumers could start to make pricing, spending, and wage decisions\nbased on their belief in higher future inflation, thereby driving a cycle of persistence.\nMeasures of near-term inflation expectations are down from peaks in April when tariffs\nwere announced, but they are still higher than last year.\nAs a result, I believe the Federal Reserve’s price stability goal faces significant\nrisks. That said, there are some factors that mitigate these risks. In particular, the softer\nlabor market could help keep inflation in check by making it harder for workers to\nbargain for higher wages even if people expect their cost of living to increase, and by\nmaking it harder for businesses to fully pass through price increases to consumers. In\naddition, the more gradual effect of tariffs on prices has not, to date, led to the type of\nsupply chain dislocations that can have pronounced second-round effects on inflation.\nAlso, longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.\nSo let’s turn to the labor market. While we do not have the full complement of\nlabor market data because the government shutdown has delayed the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics’ employment report, we do know that the payroll services firm ADP found that\n\n- 5 -\nprivate-sector employment shrank last month, in keeping with a slowdown in job creation\nsince May. Part of the slowing surely reflects developments on the supply side—from\nboth reduced net immigration and somewhat reduced labor force participation—but it is\nunclear exactly how much. As a result, it is challenging to gauge exactly how much labor\ndemand has softened. Growth in labor supply has declined significantly, with perhaps as\nmany as a million fewer people in the workforce than would have been expected based\non the typical pattern of immigration that prevailed in the years prior to the pandemic.\nWith a reduced supply of labor, what constitutes a healthy growth rate for employment\nwould be smaller. One can see that slower labor supply growth has been an important\nfactor in the weaker job creation, because over the period that job gains have slowed\nsignificantly, the unemployment rate has only edged up to 4.3 percent, a level typically\nassociated with a sound labor market.\nOther measures suggest that labor supply and demand remain in the same rough\nbalance they have been in for more than a year. The ratio of job openings to the number\nof people looking for work is around 1, the level that has persisted since about the middle\nof 2024. Likewise, the rate of people losing their jobs is running at the same rate that it\nhas for the past two and a half years, and there is no sign of an impending jump in the\nunemployment rate in the weekly reports of new claims for unemployment insurance.\nThat said, even if the labor market is still roughly in balance, the fact that this balance is\nbeing achieved from simultaneous slowing in labor supply growth and in hiring suggests\nthat the labor market is more vulnerable to negative shocks.\nIn addition, despite the low and relatively steady unemployment rate, household\nperceptions of the labor market have deteriorated and are below the level they reached in\n\n- 6 -\nthe strong labor market immediately before the pandemic. According to the New York\nFed’s survey of consumers, people’s perceptions of their chance of finding a new job if\nthey lost their current job fell sharply in August to the lowest reading since the survey\nstarted in June 2013. It rebounded somewhat in September, but remained at levels seen\nin 2013, when the labor market was weak. Also, components of the workforce that are\nusually an early indication of cyclical changes in the labor market have deteriorated. The\nunemployment rate for Black or African American workers, which reached a historic low\nin 2023, is back to its highest level since the pandemic. Unemployment rates for younger\nworkers are also up.\nOne reason I take these signals seriously is that experience shows that when labor\nmarkets turn down, it can happen suddenly. With job growth near zero for the past\nseveral months, the labor market could decline precipitously if the economy is hit with\nanother shock. Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) has slowed significantly this\nyear; however, earlier concerns of a continued slowdown seem to be fading. After a\nnegative reading in the first quarter, real GDP grew at a 3.8 percent rate in the second\nquarter—smoothing through to a rate of 1.6 percent for the first half of the year. Strong\nspending and other data for the third quarter indicate that GDP remained strong last\nquarter. While I expect that tariffs and lower labor supply have weighed on growth and\nwill continue to do so, I do not yet see significant risks in the growth data, though I\nremain attuned to risks from a variety of factors. It is hard to judge at this point whether\nthe federal government shutdown will leave a noticeable imprint on economic growth,\nbecause we don’t know how long it will last, and whether it may result in sustained\nchanges in government spending. Based on past shutdowns, it is most likely that a\n\n- 7 -\nshutdown would reduce GDP growth in the quarter in which it occurs and then boost\ngrowth in the subsequent quarter by the same amount.\nAs I said earlier, this economic outlook, and the associated uncertainties that\nunderlie it, pose challenges for judging the correct stance of monetary policy as well as\nthe appropriate path forward, given that the risks to achieving both components of our\nmandate are elevated.\nWith the easing in output growth and the likelihood of tariffs and labor supply\nweighing on the economy in the months ahead, we need to be prepared for the possibility\nthat the softening in the labor market will become something worse, especially if there is\na further adverse shock to demand.\nAt the same time, inflation, which made steady progress last year toward the\nFOMC’s 2 percent goal, has moved up in 2025, especially after the sharp increase in\ntariffs, which keep rising. I have laid out my reasons for believing that the so far modest\nimpact of tariffs on inflation probably means a much longer-lasting rachet upward,\npotentially affecting expectations in a way that makes the job of taming inflation harder.\nIn balancing and managing these risks to the FOMC’s goals, I supported the\nCommittee’s decision on September 17 to lower the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.\nMonetary policy was and remains modestly restrictive, so it seemed to me appropriate to\nmove the rate a bit closer toward neutral, pending more data and further developments on\nthe economy, the forecast, and the balance of risks. Since that meeting, we have learned\nthat consumer spending has been on a notably stronger trajectory than previously\nindicated, leading most observers to revise up estimates of spending and GDP growth for\nthe rest of the year. We also got confirmation that PCE inflation moved up as expected,\n\n- 8 -\nand that core inflation remains well above the FOMC’s target. Another development was\nthe announcement of new tariffs on imports of heavy trucks, medicine, and furniture.\nThere was, and remains, considerable uncertainty about the future course of the\neconomy. It is possible that recent low payroll growth is a harbinger of worse to come,\nor that payroll growth eventually strengthens, consistent with the low unemployment rate\nand sound growth. It is possible that tariffs will have only a modest impact on the course\nof prices and that progress resumes toward 2 percent inflation next year, but it is also\npossible that both inflation and expectations of future inflation escalate.\nCommon sense would indicate that when there is a lot of uncertainty, one should\nmove cautiously. This is validated by past monetary policymaking experience, and a\nparticular research insight from nearly 60 years ago. The Brainard principle, developed\nby economist William Brainard, holds that when there is considerable uncertainty about\nthe consequences of a policy action, the recommended course is to move more gradually\nthan would otherwise be the case.3 I believe that principle applies now, and that the\nFOMC should be cautious about adjusting policy so that we can gather further data,\nupdate our forecasts, and better assess the balance of risks. If we see inflation moving\nfurther away from our target, then it may be necessary to keep policy at least modestly\nrestrictive for longer. If we see heightened risks in the labor market, then we may need to\nmove more quickly to ease policy. The FOMC can, and I believe would, act forcefully to\nstabilize the economy if necessary.\nI think a cautious approach will help us to balance the risks to both sides of our\nmandate as we continue to assess the economic outlook.\n3 See William C. Brainard (1967), “Uncertainty and the Effectiveness of Policy,” American Economic\nReview, Papers and Proceedings, vol. 57 (May), pp. 411–25.\n\n- 9 -\nThank you.",

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n2025 College Fed Challenge Finals\nFederal Reserve Board\nWashington, D.C.\nNovember 21, 2025\n\nThank you, Robin, and to the students, advisers, and others who are our guests today,\nwelcome to the Federal Reserve.\nI’m glad I could be here this morning for these finals of the College Fed Challenge,\nwhich the Federal Reserve Board is hosting for the 22nd year. The challenge for students on the\nsix teams competing today is to prepare and present a monetary policy recommendation that will\nbest promote the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.\nLet me begin by congratulating the students and advisers of the teams who will face each\nother today, representing the University of Chicago, Davidson College, Harvard University, the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Pace University, and the University of California at Los Angeles.\nThey advanced to the finals by winning preliminary rounds of the competition earlier this year.\nA record 139 schools competed in 2025, from 36 states, a geographical reach that I am pleased to\nsay has steadily grown in recent years. I am also happy that, for the first time since the pandemic\nmoved this competition online, these finals are back to being held in person, in the very room\nwhere the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets.\nAs a former university leader and a citizen who thinks about the future of our country, I\nthink it is wonderful to see this Board room filled with bright young minds motivated to learn\nabout how a vital function of the Federal Reserve promotes a healthy economy that works for\neveryone. Only one team will be judged the winner of today’s competition, but you are all to be\ncommended for the hard work and skill that brought you here. I feel honored to share this\nmoment with you and to think about what each of you will do over the course of your lives to\nadvance the public interest.\nIn just a couple of weeks, my colleagues on the FOMC and I will meet in this room and\nsit around this table. The FOMC will be facing very much the same questions you take up today.\n\n- 3 -\nLike you, we will be carefully examining the latest available data on economic and financial\nconditions, a task made more challenging by data delays caused by the government shutdown.\nWe will apply our understanding of how monetary policy influences the economy to render our\nbest judgment of the policy stance that will most effectively further the Federal Reserve’s dual\nmandate, as set out by Congress, to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Often the\nanswer to the policy questions in front of us at this table is not clear. We listen to each other’s\nviews as each of us does our best to assess appropriate policy and weigh the risks that economic\nand financial conditions may evolve in unexpected ways. Arriving at the best decision requires\nthat monetary policy can be conducted independently of short-term political pressures.\nCrucial to the success of monetary policymaking is clearly explaining the Committee’s\nactions and intentions to the public, similar to the task that you will face later today when you\npresent your recommendations to our judges. As I expect you have learned in preparing for this\ncontest, clear communication is essential because monetary policy works to a considerable extent\nby helping to inform the public’s view of future economic and financial conditions.\nI hope your preparations for this event have added to your understanding of the economy\nand the Federal Reserve’s role and perhaps will even spur some of you to pursue further study of\neconomics and finance. Among the talented individuals who are participating in today’s\nchallenge, I hope there are some who may one day contribute to our understanding of the\neconomy and to the work of the Fed. Perhaps some of you may even choose to spend at least\nsome of your careers in public service, one of the most satisfying parts of my life’s work and a\nprofession that needs talented and conscientious people. I hope that all of you have benefitted\nfrom this experience, by adding to your knowledge and by developing research, analytical, and\ncommunication skills that will help you in whatever careers you choose.\n\n- 4 -\nI’d like to thank the judges who have given their time and brought their expertise and\nexperience to the evaluation of each team’s work. They are among the talented and valued\nprofessionals on the staff of the Federal Reserve System who are so important to the work we do.\nKaren Pence is deputy associate director in the Division of Research and Statistics here at the\nFederal Reserve Board, Francisco Vazquez-Grande is a senior adviser in the Division of\nMonetary Affairs, and Matthew Lueke is deputy secretary of the FOMC. Thomas Lubik is a\nsenior adviser in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, one of a\nnumber of Reserve Bank staff who have generously given their time to serve as judges this year.\nAlso, let me thank the faculty advisers of each of the six teams for helping guide,\nmotivate, and prepare today’s finalists.\nAnd thanks also to the Federal Reserve staff who have organized the competition this\nyear. Thanks to them and all of you, the Fed Challenge is helping to inform the public about our\nwork and investing in your future, for the betterment of all.\nIn closing, I wish you all the best of luck in what I expect will be a spirited competition.",

Now, advances in AI can do much more damage by\nreplicating a person’s entire identity. This technology—known as deepfakes—has the\npotential to supercharge identity fraud. I’ve recently spoken about the importance of\nrecognizing both the benefits and the risks of generative AI (Gen AI).2 Today, I’d like to\nfocus more on the darker side of the technology—specifically how Gen AI has the\npotential to enable deepfake technology, and what we should be doing now to defend\nagainst this risk in finance.\nEscalating Threat of Gen-AI Facilitated Cybercrime\nCybercrime is on the rise, and cybercriminals are increasingly turning to Gen AI\nto facilitate their crimes. Criminal tactics are becoming more sophisticated and available\nto a broader range of criminals. Estimates of direct and indirect costs of cyber incidents\nrange from 1 to 10 percent of global GDP.3 Deepfake attacks have seen a twentyfold\nincrease over the last three years.4\nCybercrime with deepfakes involves the same cat and mouse game common to\nsophisticated criminal activity. Both cybercriminals and financial institutions are\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Michael S.

Criminals develop new attack methods, and\ncompanies respond with better defenses. Here, the same technological innovations that\nenable the bad actors can also help those fighting cybercrime. However, there is an\nasymmetry—the fraudsters can cast a wide net of approaches and target a wide number of\nvictims, and they only need a small number to be successful. Their marginal cost is\ngenerally low, and individual failures matter little. Conversely, companies must undergo\na rigorous review and testing process to mount effective cyber defenses and will thus be\nslower in developing their defenses. A single failure is very costly. As we consider this\nissue from a policy perspective, we need to take steps to make attacks less likely by\nraising the cost of the attack to the cybercriminals and lowering the costs of defense to\nfinancial institutions and law enforcement.\nAnatomy of a Deepfake\nDeepfake attacks are those in which an attacker uses Gen AI to create a\ndoppelganger with a person’s voice or image and uses this doppelganger to interact with\nindividuals or institutions to commit fraud. Deepfake technology is a particularly\npernicious vehicle for cybercrime.5 The process begins with voice synthesis, where Gen\nAI models can synthesize the speech of their victim not only in words, but also in phrase\npatterns, tone, and inflection. With just a short sample audio, for example, criminals\nassisted by Gen AI can impersonate a close relative in a crisis situation or a high-value\nbank client, seeking to complete a transaction at their bank.6\n5 Federal Bureau of Investigation, “Criminals Use Generative Artificial Intelligence to Facilitate Financial\nFraud,” public service announcement, December 3, 2024,\nhttps://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA241203#:~:text=AI2DGenerated20Audio2C20aka20Vocal20Cloning&\ntext=Criminals20generate20short20audio20clips,assistance20or20demanding20a20ransom.\n6 See note 5.\n\n- 3 -\nCriminals can also use Gen AI-generated videos to create believable depictions of\nindividuals. For videos, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are the core\ntechnology behind most deepfake systems.7 GANs consist of two competing models, the\ngenerator and the discriminator, which compete with and improve each other. This\ncompetition results in increasingly realistic, indistinguishable fake images and videos.8\nDeepfake technology can also be augmented by other AI tools; for instance,\ncriminals can use AI to extract and organize extensive multimodal personal data to\nfacilitate identity verification. Attackers can also turn to “dark web” tools, such as\njailbroken versions of popular large language models, where the guardrails have been\nremoved, to learn the deepfake trade and improve their attacks.9\nDeepfakes in Action\nI expect that many of you can recall examples of how deepfakes of politicians and\nprominent business executives have fooled the public and spread disinformation.\nDeepfakes are also being used to commit payment fraud. In one case in 2024, a\nsophisticated deepfake of the chief financial officer for British engineering and\narchitectural firm Arup was reportedly deployed in a video meeting and convinced an\nArup financial employee to transfer $25 million to thieves.10\n7 Tianxiang Shen, Ruixian Liu, Ju Bai, and Zheng Li, “Deep Fakes” Using Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GAN), https://noiselab.ucsd.edu/ECE228_2018/Reports/Report16.pdf.

When we see realistic and interactive video images of a loved one in\ntrouble, we are disposed to trust them and do what we can to help. Identity verification\nstandards at banks often use voice detection, which may become vulnerable to Gen AI\ntools. If this technology becomes cheaper and more broadly available to criminals—and\nfraud detection technology does not keep pace—we are all vulnerable to a deepfake\nattack. These attacks can have significant financial costs to the victims of the crime and\ncan also pose costs to society, eroding trust in communications and in institutions.\nDefending Against Deepfakes\nSo what should we do? As I mentioned above, we should take steps to lessen the\nimpact of attacks by making successful breaches less likely, while making each attack\nmore resource-intensive for the attacker.\n11 Sandra Galletti and Massimo Pani, “How Ferrari Hit the Brakes on a Deepfake CEO,” MIT Sloan\nManagement Review, January 27, 2025, https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-ferrari-hit-the-brakes-on-a-\ndeepfake-ceo/.\n12 Chad Brooks, “1 in 10 Executives Say Their Companies Have Already Faced Deepfake Threats,”\nbusiness.com, June 28, 2024, https://www.business.com/articles/deepfake-threats-study/.\n\n- 5 -\nLet me start with ways to make successful breaches less likely. A key step is to\nrecognize the importance of strong, resilient financial institutions in preventing attacks.\nBanks are frontline defenders against deepfake-enabled fraud due to their direct\ninvolvement with financial transactions and customer data. To verify payors, banks\nmaintain identity verification processes, including multi-factor authentication and\naccount monitoring practices. To the extent deepfakes increase, bank identity\nverification processes should evolve in kind to include AI-powered advances such as\nfacial recognition, voice analysis, and behavioral biometrics to detect potential deepfakes.\nOther techniques focus on assessing the probability that AI has been used in audio or\nvideo based on underlying metadata and then flagging the identity or transaction for\nfurther review using other verification. These technical solutions can detect subtle\ninconsistencies in video and audio that human observers may miss.\nBanks have two points of control over the transaction—confirming not only the\nsender’s identity, but also the legitimacy of the recipient address. They can scrutinize the\nrecipients of large or unusual transactions, employing advanced analytics to flag\nsuspicious patterns that could indicate fraudulent activities, and perform additional\nreviews before authorizing a payment to a recipient that raises flags. Banks also invest in\ntheir human controls by maintaining up-to-date training for staff on the emerging risks\nand incorporating the necessary security measures to mitigate the damages from breaches\nwhen they occur. And they are engaging with other financial institutions to help define\nthe threat and identify appropriate controls and mitigants.13\n13 See, for instance, FS-ISAC’s report on deepfake threats and risk management at\nhttps://www.fsisac.com/hubfs/Knowledge/AI/DeepfakesInTheFinancialSector-\nUnderstandingTheThreatsManagingTheRisks.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nCustomers should do their part, enabling multi-factor authentication on their\naccounts and verifying unusual requests through a separate channel, even if the person\nmaking the request seems genuine. They should seek out education for themselves and\ntheir loved ones to help them detect and prevent fraud before it occurs.14 And customers\nshould value strong security practices at their financial institutions, including those which\nmay add some friction to the user experience. The customers that may be the highest-\nvalue targets for criminals are often those with the largest digital presence, and thus most\nsusceptible to deepfakes. They are also the customers who may prefer the most\nfrictionless user experience, making detecting deepfakes more difficult. When it comes\nto protecting our money, we ought to expect and appreciate a little friction.\nRegulators can help to reinforce the importance of cyber defenses in safe and\nsound banking through appropriate updates to guidance and regulation. As with all rules,\nwe should be mindful of the impacts on smaller institutions and help ensure that rules are\nright-sized for the risk. In addition, we can work with core providers to understand the\nextent to which they are incorporating AI advancements in their products and services to\nhelp smaller banks defend against deepfakes and other emerging risks from the\ntechnology. Last, we can also highlight research and development for cybersecurity\nstartups and research into tools to combat deepfakes and Gen AI-based fraud.\nRegulators should consider how we could leverage AI technologies ourselves,\nincluding to enhance our ability to monitor and detect patterns of fraudulent activity at\n14 There are a variety of public and private resources that can help. See, for example, the National Security\nAgency/Central Security Service at https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-\nRelease-View/Article/3523329/nsa-us-federal-agencies-advise-on-deepfake-threats/; and the National\nCybersecurity Alliance at https://www.staysafeonline.org/articles/why-your-family-and-coworkers-need-a-\nsafe-word-in-the-age-of-ai.\n\n- 7 -\nregulated institutions in real time. This could help provide early warnings to affected\ninstitutions and broader industry participants, as well as to protect our own systems.\nIn addition to preventing attacks, we should also explore ways of making attacks\nmore costly. These may include coordination with domestic and global law enforcement,\ninternationally consistent laws against cybercrime, and continued improvement on\nsharing threat intelligence and insights in real-time. The official sector and banks should\ncontinue efforts to improve fraud data sharing within the financial sector and help\ninstitutions respond more quickly to emerging Gen AI-driven threats. This will make it\nfar harder for fraudsters to operate undetected, increasing the complexity and cost of their\nactivities. But the sharing is only as good as the data, and banks must do their part. We\nshould help ensure that banks and other regulated institutions meet their duties to report\ncyber incidents in a timely way, and regulators should too.15\nAnother way to disrupt the economics of cybercrime is by increasing penalties for\nattempting to use Gen AI to commit fraud and increasing investment in cybercrime\nenforcement. This includes targeting the upstream organizations that benefit from illegal\naction and strengthening anti-money-laundering laws to disrupt illicit fund flows and\nfreeze assets related to cybercrime. The fear of severe legal consequences could help to\ndeter bad actors from pursuing AI-driven fraud schemes in the first place.\nConclusion\nDeepfakes are only one of many new techniques to facilitate cyberattacks, but\nthey feel particularly salient because they are so personal. And they are on the rise.\n15 “Computer-Security Incident Notification Requirements for Banking Organizations and Their Bank\nService Providers,” 86 Fed.

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT\nSeptember 25, 2025\nPreserving the Dynamism and Credibility of Stress Testing\nRemarks by\nMichael S. Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nWashington, D.C.\nSeptember 25, 2025\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you.1\nToday, I would like to discuss a vital tool for supervising the safety and\nsoundness of the largest banks and preserving the stability of our financial system. I was\nthere, at the Treasury Department in 2009, when stress testing was first used in the\nUnited States in the heat of battle, an ad hoc measure to reverse a loss of confidence in\nU.S. banks that was a major force then driving the Great Recession. By examining how\nthe balance sheets of banks would be affected by a worsening of financial and economic\nconditions, this process was intended to reveal weaknesses that could threaten the\nsolvency of banks and prevent them from playing their central role in the economy.2\nStress testing ultimately succeeded in helping to restore confidence during the\ncrisis, and in the aftermath this battle-tested tool became a formal and integral part of the\neffort to repair the ensuing damage and strengthen the banking system. Stress testing has\ncontinued to evolve in the years since then to maintain that strength and help limit the\nchances of another devastating financial crisis. Stress testing changed as its purpose\nchanged from wartime to peacetime—from mitigating the crisis to preserving safety,\nsoundness, and stability. It has changed as banks and regulators learned more about how\nstress testing works in practice and as part of an otherwise evolving supervisory and\nregulatory framework for banks that must necessarily adjust as finance itself evolves.\nAdjusting regulation in this dynamic environment is challenging, and one of those\nchallenges is dealing with unintended consequences. The Federal Reserve made changes\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 The stress tests during the Global Financial Crisis also included measures to address bank balances sheet\nweaknesses in a timely manner under stressed conditions, further supporting confidence, as discussed\nbelow.\n\n- 2 -\nto stress testing in 2020 intended to make it more predictable and to better integrate it\nwith overall capital regulation, but those changes are now at the center of litigation\nbrought by large banks. The Fed responded in April by proposing more changes intended\nto address these criticisms. But as I explained in voting against those measures, I believe\nthese steps will substantially impair stress testing, concealing rather than revealing crucial\nweaknesses in the risk management of individual banks and in the stability of the\nfinancial system.3 As the Federal Reserve Board considers these changes, I believe we\nshould focus on how best to address the original purpose—and preserve the\neffectiveness—of stress testing. As I will explain, I believe that the best way to further\nthese goals is to separate stress testing from capital requirements in order to maximize the\ninformative value of the tests and their results and untangle them from the larger and\ncomplex task of setting capital requirements. I will lay out that alternative approach\ntoward the end of these remarks, but first I believe it is helpful to take a step back and\nrecall how stress testing has evolved to this point, then turn to where it should go from\nhere.\nIt all began during the Global Financial Crisis. Capital markets froze, resulting in\nbusiness failures and prompting the need for unprecedented public-sector intervention.\nCredit to households and businesses slowed to a trickle, and millions of people were\nlosing homes and jobs. By the fall of 2008, there was a broad-based lack of confidence\nin the banking system, as large banks faced questions about their exposures to losses\n3 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Statement on Stress Test Proposal by Governor\nMichael S. Barr,” press release, April 17, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/barr-statement-20250417.htm.\n\n- 3 -\nrelated to real estate and other assets. These were questions that large banks in many\ncases couldn’t credibly answer because of the complexity and opacity of their direct and\nindirect exposures to mortgages at the center of the crisis. Without this information,\ninvestors assumed the worst, driving down equity prices of banks, which complicated\nefforts by banks to bolster their balance sheets.\nRestoring confidence in the banking system required credible information from a\nreliable source. Treasury worked with the Federal Reserve to design the Supervisory\nCapital Assessment Program (SCAP) to test the capital adequacy of what were\ndetermined to be the 19 most systemically important banking and financial institutions.\nIn addition, Congress had provided a backstop in the form of the Troubled Asset Relief\nProgram (TARP), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had backstopped\nbank funding through guarantees, and the Federal Reserve had stepped up in significant\nways to bolster the financial system and the economy. The existence of a government\nbackstop played a big role in the success of the first stress test. With the use of public\nfunding on the line, the rigor and transparency of the stress test was doubly important.4\nRebuilding Confidence in the Largest Banks\nThere were five aspects of the SCAP that are elemental to stress testing and have\nbeen present in the different tests since then.\nFirst, there was the use of a severe but plausible scenario for macroeconomic\nconditions. The scenario assumed a deeper and more prolonged recession than\nforecasters expected. Because of the focus on housing-related losses, the scenario’s\n4 At the point of the stress tests results, taxpayers had already acquired an actual stake in all but one of the\n19 SCAP institutions, which had accepted a total of just under $190 billion in funding from the emergency\nTroubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Banks could go to TARP to get more capital if needed after the\nstress test, but most were able to tap market sources and repay TARP.\n\n- 4 -\nassumption of a further severe decline in housing prices was essential to rebuilding\nconfidence.\nSecond, there was the use of economic models to translate a given scenario into\nquantified losses for each bank. The banking regulators worked together to develop\nmodels to map the stress scenario into a range of associated loss rates for different loan\ncategories and iterated with the banks to assess their specific exposures.\nThird, based on the extent of those projected losses, the test arrived at a firm-\nspecific amount of capital that each bank would need in order to withstand this stress and\nkeep lending to customers.\nA fourth aspect of the SCAP and subsequent stress tests was the public disclosure\nof the scenario, the basic testing methodology, and, most importantly, firm-specific\nresults.\nAnd lastly, in addition to the balance sheet data and other numbers related to the\nstress test, the Federal Reserve produced a qualitative supervisory assessment of the\nbanks’ capital planning decisions and processes.\nOne essential element of that first test is that the supervisors reviewed and\nassessed the data and modeling assumptions used by the banks, which helped to provide\ncredibility for the loss estimates. The result of the SCAP was that 10 of the 19 tested\ninstitutions were required to raise capital sufficient to keep them above regulatory\nminimums if the scenario were to materialize—a total of $75 billion. The 10 were given\nsix months to develop capital plans to meet their stress test minimums.\nThe SCAP was remarkably successful. There was skepticism that the test would\nbe sufficiently severe or transparent to be credible, and bank stock prices were volatile\n\n- 5 -\ndue to speculation about what the stress test results would reveal. But bank stocks\nrecovered after the results were announced in May. Most banks that had been struggling\nto raise capital were able to do so, with 9 of the 10 able to find private sector sources of\nfunding by the six-month deadline.5 Credit default swaps for large banks returned to\nlevels seen before the acute stage of the crisis.6 Bank lending was slower to recover, but\nstabilizing the banks helped stop the crisis and the U.S. economy started the long process\nof recovery that July.\nSupporting the Resilience of the Largest Banks\nI have compared the SCAP to a battlefield campaign, and while the financial\ncrisis certainly felt like combat at the time, my point is to emphasize the unique challenge\nof making financial regulatory policy in an emergency. The goal was to restore public\ntrust in banks that were under fire, and as the job shifted to preserving that trust, it was\napparent that there should be an ongoing role for stress testing in peacetime as well.\nStarting with the yearly stress test established in 2010 with the Dodd-Frank Act and\ncontinuing with the integration of stress testing into the Federal Reserve’s annual\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), the peacetime approach focused\non institutionalizing bank resilience and risk-management practices. The Federal\nReserve Board conducted the first CCAR exercise in 2011. CCAR was an overall\nassessment of the capital planning processes of banks, which included quantitative and\nqualitative components. Either of those components could form the basis for an objection\n5 Troubled Asset Relief Program: Bank Stress Test Offers Lessons as Regulators Take Further Actions to\nStrengthen Supervisory Oversight (GAO, September 2010), https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-10-861.pdf.\n6 Seung Jung Lee and Jonathan D. Rose, “Profits and Balance Sheet Developments at U.S. Commercial\nBanks in 2009,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, September 2, 2010,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2010/articles/profit/default.htm.\n\n- 6 -\nby the Fed to firm plans to distribute capital to shareholders, distribution which would\nreduce the capital available that the firm could use to buffer its losses.\nThe quantitative evaluation of a firm’s capital adequacy was driven by the results\nof the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test, or DFAST.7 It departed from the SCAP in at least\ntwo important ways. First, rather than making the severe scenario just a more negative\nversion of the current consensus forecast, the Fed built a process to develop thematic\nforward-looking scenarios using macroeconomic models calibrated to historical data.8\nSome parts of the scenario design framework are purposely countercyclical under normal\nconditions—for instance, the minimum peak unemployment rate is set at 10 percent. The\ncountercyclicality of stress test scenarios is an attempt to lean against pro-cyclical effects\nthat can make borrowers appear overly resilient in good times, something which could\ncause the model to significantly understate the magnitude of borrower defaults when the\neconomy turns.9\nThe second way that the Dodd-Frank stress test departed from CCAR is that most\nlosses under DFAST are projected by applying models developed and operated by the\nFederal Reserve based on data provided by the banks. Using Fed-developed and\nvalidated models provides for independent risk assessments. The granular data provided\n7 The number of financial institutions that participated in the annual DFAST exercise has varied from 18 to\n33 between 2013 and 2025.\n8 See 12 CFR pt. 252, appendix A (The Federal Reserve’s Policy Statement on the Scenario Design\nFramework for Stress Testing). Although stressed losses in DFAST are projected for a two-year time\nhorizon, the macroeconomic scenario itself is on a three-year time horizon. This reflects the fact that the\nCCAR capital planning exercise performed by the banks goes out three years. Moreover, a three-year\nscenario provides the public with greater transparency regarding the entirety of the conditions assumed as\npart of the macroeconomic cycle contemplated in the test. The number of scenario variables has increased\nnotably from SCAP and the early days of CCAR.\n9 Ben Bernanke, Mark Gertler, and Simon Gilchrist, “The Financial Accelerator in a Quantitative Business\nCycle Framework,” in Handbook of Macroeconomics, Vol. 1, 1999, (ScienceDirect, 1999),\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157400489910034X.\n\n- 7 -\nby banks has been valuable in ensuring that the stress tests are truly risk sensitive and in\nunderstanding broader trends and interconnections in the financial system.\nIn addition to this quantitative test, CCAR assesses the ability of banks to\ndetermine their capital needs in the future. Supplementing the DFAST model\nadministered by the Fed, each bank projects its income over the stress scenario using its\ninternal models, providing supervisors with a view of governance and risk management\nof the bank’s capital planning process. If a bank did not pass either the quantitative or\nqualitative evaluation, the Board of Governors was able to object to the capital plan and\nrestrict the firm’s shareholder distributions.\nOver time, several criticisms of CCAR’s approach emerged. The first was that\nCCAR was wholly separate from the process used to set a bank’s basic, risk-based capital\nrequirements. Large banks also criticized CCAR for a lack of transparency and\npredictability that resulted in them pre-committing to lower capital distributions and\nhigher levels of capital.\nIn 2020, the Federal Reserve Board addressed these bank criticisms by creating\nthe stress capital buffer (SCB). To address the criticism that CCAR was additive and\nwasn’t integrated into capital planning, the SCB combined the basic capital requirement\nfor banks with one equal to a bank’s projected capital ratio decline during the stress test\nplus a year’s worth of planned dividends, linking components of the capital framework.\nTo address the claim that CCAR lacked transparency and predictability, the SCB\n\n- 8 -\nrequirement was set for each participating bank at a level that reflected its losses in the\nstress test and provided banks with flexibility to change their dividends in real time.10\nAnother bank criticism was that CCAR’s use of a qualitative assessment was\nsubjective. The SCB dropped the qualitative objection and recast the assessment of\ncapital planning practices as a traditional supervisory exam.\nBy more directly integrating stress testing into capital regulation, the SCB\nincreasingly moved stress testing away from supervision and toward the regulatory arena,\na consequential decision. While this change was intended to promote consistency and\npredictability, in retrospect, it may have reduced some of the value of the exercise, in that\nit reduced the range of facts and circumstances the Board would take into account when\nevaluating an individual firm’s capital adequacy. As a result, the Board’s flexibility to\nadjust capital adequacy determinations based on the unique features of different firms,\nincluding different business models and risk profiles, was constrained.\nWhen I became Vice Chair for Supervision in 2022, we continued the process of\nevolving the stress test as necessary. In particular, the Fed conducted multiple scenarios\nnot directly connected to setting banks’ capital requirements.11 Using additional\nscenarios has helped us to understand how a broader range of risks might affect the\nbanking system. For example, we’ve explored a stagflation scenario and looked at the\nfailures of large non-bank counterparties. Using multiple scenarios has helped to keep\nour risk-assessments dynamic.\n10 As part of its efforts to address concerns about transparency, in early 2019 the Fed finalized a proposal to\naugment its disclosures regarding its stress testing models. 84 Fed. Reg. 6784 (2019).\n11 See Michael S. Barr, “Multiple Scenarios in Stress Testing,” speech at the Stress Test Research\nConference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Boston, MA, October 19, 2023.\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20231019a.htm.\n\n- 9 -\nBenefits and Effects of the Current Stress Testing Framework\nBefore turning to the legal challenges of the current stress test framework, I would\nbe remiss not to emphasize the value of that framework. The stress test has been a\ncritical element that led to strengthening both the quantity of capital in the banking\nsystem and the risk-management capabilities of large banks.\nSince the Global Financial Crisis, large banks have more than doubled their risk-\nbased common equity capital ratios—from roughly 5 percent to 12 percent or more. At\nthe same time, they have made meaningful improvements in their ability to measure,\nmonitor, and manage their own risks. The stress test has directly contributed to both.\nDespite this success, some have argued for what they term “full transparency” of\nthe test. But the criticism can be misleading because two important points are often\nomitted. First, the Federal Reserve already provides substantial information about the\ndesign of the test and has expanded those disclosures over time. Banks are far from\nuninformed. They receive substantial information about the models in annual model\nmethodology disclosures.12 Any material model changes are phased in over two years,\nwith full explanation. Second, what critics call “transparency” is not disclosure of basic\ninformation about the rigor and methodology of the test essential for its credibility;\ninstead, it is the equivalent of handing out the questions to the test in advance. That\nwould fundamentally undermine the rigor of the test, which is intended to assess\nresilience under conditions not fully known in advance, just as in a financial crisis.\n12 See, e.g., Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2025 Supervisory Stress Test Methodology\n(Board of Governors, June 2025), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2025-june-supervisory-\nstress-test-methodology.pdf; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2024 Supervisory Stress\nTest Methodology (Board of Governors, March 2024),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2024-march-supervisory-stress-test-methodology.pdf.\n\n- 10 -\nIn short, the framework strikes a deliberate balance: providing banks with enough\ninformation about scenarios and models to ensure fairness and accountability, while\npreserving the rigor that makes the stress test an effective safeguard.\nChallenges to the Current Stress Testing Framework\nIn December 2024, bank trade associations brought suit against the Board of\nGovernors, challenging the role of stress testing in setting SCB requirements for large\nfirms. The trade associations have challenged what they contend is the opacity of certain\nelements of the stress testing process and have argued that the models and scenarios\nshould be released in proposed form to promote transparency and facilitate public\ncomment. In anticipation of, and in response to, this litigation, the Board announced that\nit would disclose and seek public comment on all of the models that determine the\nhypothetical losses and revenue of banks under stress, as well as the annual stress\nscenarios. The Board also proposed to change its rules to average stress testing results\nover two years to reduce the year-over-year volatility in the capital requirements that\nresult from annual stress testing.\nThese proposed changes represent a policy choice to respond to the litigation by\nenhancing transparency and promoting public participation, and they are not intended to\nmaterially affect overall capital requirements. But in my judgment, they are a mistake\nthat will make stress testing less rigorous and nimble.\nSubjecting the stress testing models to the notice and comment process could lead\nthem to ossify, and their dynamism and effectiveness may fade. Stress testing models are\ninherently complex and require adjustments to maintain accuracy and relevance to\nappropriately account for quickly developing risks. Changes in the models would require\n\n- 11 -\nnew notice and solicitation of comment, and the time lag and burden in making changes\nwould be significantly extended. We saw this type of ossification play out before the\nGlobal Financial Crisis, when supervisory stress testing of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nbecame formulaic and failed to capture escalating risks, with dire consequences.13\nAn additional problem is that the comment process may have an uneven effect,\nsince banks have an incentive to object to aspects of the models that result in higher\ncapital requirements and not to highlight the areas in which the models underestimate\ndownside risk. Responding to these comments could create a one-way ratchet that\nsuccessively weakens capital requirements.\nKnowing the details of the stress test in advance will also increase the likelihood\nthat banks are able to game the results to lower their capital requirements. We have seen\nexamples of how firms have been able to game stress tests. For instance, some firms\nstarted to use so-called “macro hedges” in the late 2010s. Many of these macro hedges\nwere hedges against a deep recession, similar to a stress test scenario, and these short-\nterm hedges were cheap because investors assessed these scenarios as extremely unlikely\n(they were far “out of the money” in option terms). The hedges reduced projected capital\nlosses in the stress tests by billions of dollars for some banks. But they weren’t credible\nprotection from the effects of a recession because maintaining these hedges would\nbecome prohibitively expensive as the economy moved into an actual downturn. This is\njust one example of attempts to game the stress tests, that were eventually addressed\n13 Scott Frame, Krisopher Gerardi, and Paul Willen, “The Failure of Supervisory Stress Testing: Fannie\nMae, Freddie Mac, and OFHEO,” Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Working Paper No. 15-4 (Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston, October 2015), https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-\nworking-paper/2015/the-failure-of-supervisory-stress-testing-fannie-mae-freddie-mac-and-ofheo.aspx.\n\n- 12 -\nthrough the supervisory process. But this example underscores how full disclosure of the\nFed’s stress models and scenarios would enable banks to optimize stress test results by,\namong other things, adjusting their balance sheets based on their knowledge of where the\nmodels underprice risk, in order to reduce their capital requirements without materially\nreducing risks.\nBanks are likely to change their behavior in other ways that increase risk. Banks\nmay invest less in their own risk management if the test becomes too predictable. Full\ndisclosure of the Board’s models may encourage concentration across the banking system\nin assets that receive comparably lighter treatment in the test, which could create risks to\nfinancial stability. And banks are likely to reduce their management buffers, making it\nmore likely that they would breach their required buffers and minimums in the event of\nstress. The upshot is that a full-transparency stress testing regime can increase systemic\nrisks because risk is underestimated and capital is too low. The stress tests could lose\ntheir credibility. A loss in credibility is bad for the banks, the banking system, financial\nstability and, ultimately, American families and businesses.\nAn Alternative Path Forward\nAs an alternative to these proposed changes, I would favor prioritizing the rigor of\nthe stress testing framework by separating stress testing from binding regulatory capital\nrequirements, which would instead be increased commensurately.14 The Dodd-Frank Act\nrequires that the Board conduct stress tests on large banks “to evaluate whether such\ncompanies have the capital, on a total consolidated basis, necessary to absorb losses as a\n14 See Daniel Tarullo, “Reconsidering the Regulatory Uses of Stress Testing,” Hutchins Center Working\nPaper #92 (Brookings, May 2024), https://www.brookings.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2024/05/WP92_Tarullo-stress-testing.pdf.\n\n- 13 -\nresult of adverse economic conditions.”15 While these results can and should still play a\nrole in informing supervisory and management assessments of the appropriate capital\nlevel for particular banking organizations, decoupling the stress test results from the\npreliminary SCB would enable the Board to preserve essential aspects of stress testing,\nincluding the generation of credible and detailed information on the risk exposures of\nbanks and how their capital levels would be affected by a stress event. Such information\nwould be valuable in the supervision of banks in normal times and especially important if\nbanks and the financial system are again threatened by crisis.\nIf the stress tests are no longer used to inform the calculation of a firm’s\npreliminary SCB requirement, the legal justification for publishing the models and\nscenarios for comment would be eliminated, and I’ve already discussed the policy\ngrounds for not publishing them. So, the Board could abandon the notice and comment\nproposal.\nThe Board could approach these statutorily required tests primarily as a\nsupervisory exercise and could thereby retain flexibility to design and adjust the models\nand scenarios as appropriate to ensure their rigor and robustness. Moreover, as\nauthorized by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Board could run multiple scenarios to provide\ngreater dimension to the assessment of risks.16 As history teaches us, shocks and crises\ncan manifest through a range of channels, and testing a large bank’s unique profile under\na range of risks is more likely to yield high-value information about a bank’s likely\nresilience to potential stress events. The net result of these changes would be to increase\n15 12 U.S.C. § 5365(i)(1).\n16 12 U.S.C. § 5365(i)(1)(B) (“The Board of Governors—(i) shall provide for at least 2 different sets of\ncondition under which the evaluation required by this subsection shall be conducted, including baseline and\nseverely adverse.”) (emphasis added).\n\n- 14 -\nthe nimbleness, dynamism, and effectiveness of our current stress testing framework.\nThe Board’s continued publication of firm-specific results would promote transparency\nand market discipline.\nSo that this change does not reduce overall capital in the system, SCBs could\ninstead be set entirely by regulation. For most non-G-SIBs subject to the SCB\nrequirement, the current 2.5 percent buffer floor likely remains an appropriate level. For\nG-SIBs with a lot of trading, past stress tests have routinely indicated that SCBs should\nlikely be set higher than the 2.5 percent floor, and any regulatory capital measure\ndesigned to replace the current SCB framework would need to account for this gap.\nWhile further analytical work is required, the shortfall generated by decoupling the stress\ntests from the SCB may be largely addressed by a regulatory capital requirement linked\nto the risks in the trading book, with perhaps some other adjustments as required to\nmaintain appropriate capital levels. If, over time, stress testing results indicate that this\nreplacement regulatory capital measure routinely exceeds or falls short of the capital\nlevels required to provide adequate resilience to stress conditions, the Board could revise\nthe regulatory measure through a notice-and-comment process, informed by data\ngathered in the stress testing process.\nThis proposed approach of decoupling the stress tests from regulatory capital and\nincreasing regulatory capital to make up the shortfall in the SCB appears to me to be the\nbest way to retain the value of stress testing as a supervisory exercise while maintaining\nappropriate levels of capital in the system. However, replacing the current framework of\nindividualized SCBs—informed by firm-specific stress test results—with broadly\napplicable, formulaic regulatory capital requirements would result in a diminution of the\n\n- 15 -\nrisk sensitivity reflected in SCB requirements. That is, capital levels for firms that are\nsubject to the stress tests would be relatively less tailored than they currently are and less\nreflective of the unique business models, exposures, and risk profiles of a particular firm.\nTo address this loss in risk sensitivity, I would propose that, in exceptional\ncircumstances, the Board could use its capital directive authority to impose individualized\ncapital requirements on specific firms to account for a firm’s particular circumstances,\nincluding its capital structure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities, and other\nappropriate risk-related factors.17 This would be similar to the United Kingdom’s Pillar\nII-B requirements and those of other jurisdictions.18 While these requirements could be\ninformed by the stress test results in part, they would also take into account qualitative\nfactors and supervisory judgment. Because these individualized requirements would\nconsider the specific risks of a firm, they would be adjusted to reflect a specific firm’s\nrisk profile. While I don’t believe it would be advisable for this type of exercise to\nbecome the default manner for setting capital requirements, in exceptional cases, it would\npreserve some of the tailoring benefits of the current SCB regime in a manner that\ncomports with the changes I have discussed. Furthermore, it would preserve the ability\nfor the Board to address stress results that demonstrate significant deficiencies in capital\nadequacy under a stressed scenario, when the firms are otherwise in compliance with\nregulatory capital requirements.\n17 12 U.S.C. § 3907(a)(2). Other statutes provide the Board with authority to impose individualized capital\nrequirements through the issuance of orders. See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. §§ 1844(b), 1467a(g)(1).\n18 See Bank of England, “CP16/22 – Implementation of the Basel 3.1 Standards: Interactions with the\nPRA’s Pillar 2 Framework,” chapter 10 (BOE, November 30, 2022),\nhttps://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2022/november/implementation-of-\nthe-basel-3-1-standards/interactions-with-the-pras-pillar-2-framework.\n\n- 16 -\nWith these changes, stress testing could maintain its flexibility and adaptability\nand therefore could retain its value as an effective tool for identifying idiosyncratic risk in\na major bank and ensuring that capital is sufficient to address the risk. Among the\nbenefits would be the space this approach would allow for continued innovation in stress\ntesting. Such innovation is vital as finance evolves and banks continue to seek ways to\nreduce supervisory and regulatory requirements. This approach could allow for scenario\ndesign and modeling advancements unencumbered by the limitations I’ve spoken of\nimposed by the notice-and-comment process.\nIn conclusion, I believe it is critical to maintain the dynamism and rigor of stress\ntesting so that supervisors, banks, and the public understand the underlying\nvulnerabilities in the banking system and at the largest banks and understand that these\nfirms are holding sufficient capital to address these vulnerabilities. I have deep concerns\nthat the set of changes the Board is now considering risks reliance on a stress test that can\nno longer effectively assess the resilience of the largest banks and lacks credibility, thus\nputting our financial system and economy at risk.",

Barr\nMember\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat a\nFed Listens event\nhosted by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City\nOmaha, Nebraska\nJune 24, 2025\n\nThank you, President Schmid, and thank you to the Federal Reserve Bank of\nKansas City for hosting this event.1 The Federal Reserve, with its system of 12 distinct\nregional Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., was\ndesigned to ensure that monetary policy was a national decision with input from all parts\nof the country. The work of the District Reserve Banks, and events like this one, make\nsure that a wide range of views can inform President Schmid, me, Federal Reserve Chair\nJerome Powell, and all of our colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC) as we come together in Washington to set monetary policy.\nLet me spend just a moment on the economy and the outlook. The economy is\ncurrently on a sound footing, with low and steady unemployment, and disinflation having\ncontinued at a gradual, albeit uneven, pace toward our 2 percent target. Looking forward,\nhowever, I expect inflation to rise due to tariffs. Higher short-term inflation expectations,\nsupply chain adjustments, and second-round effects may cause some inflation\npersistence. At the same time, tariffs may cause the economy to slow and unemployment\nto rise. There is still considerable uncertainty about tariff policies and their effects.\nMonetary policy is well positioned to allow us to wait and see how economic conditions\nunfold.\nThe broad objectives of monetary policy are clear and have been mandated by\nCongress—maximum employment and stable prices. Our strategy for getting there is\nlaid out in the Fed’s policy framework, which we plan to update later this year. And\nsetting that strategy to reach our goals is informed by outreach like the session today.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nMonetary policy decisions affect everyone. Stable prices are important for\nfamilies and businesses to be able to plan for the future, and for sustainable and healthy\nlabor markets. When we get it right, we can help foster broad and inclusive employment\ngains that benefit the American people. Our decisions play a role, for example, in the\nprices for agricultural commodities that are particularly important for businesses and\nconsumers in this region. These decisions affect the labor market, including the\nchallenges that businesses can face in finding qualified workers, which I know is a bigger\nissue in Nebraska, with lower unemployment than in some other places. But the Federal\nReserve’s role is a limited one—most of what affects the economy are the individual\ndecisions of households and businesses.\nThe primary tool for monetary policy is short-term interest rates, which in turn\ncan affect longer-term rates that you, your customers, and people in your communities\npay to finance land and equipment and other inputs. Credit has always played a\nparticularly important role in agriculture, so I know that interest rates matter a lot in this\npart of America. Let me emphasize that real-world rates are significantly affected by\nother forces in the economy, but Fed policy does play a role.\nMonetary policy sometimes requires tradeoffs—a stance of policy that is\nnecessary to lower inflation, for example, may also lower aggregate demand and slow the\neconomy. Crucial in balancing our economic goals is determining how policy decisions\naffect households and businesses, which is why we are here to listen to you.\nBusinesses also have to balance their goals. Producers need to judge the strength\nof demand for their products and services, the trend in costs for their inputs, and the\nexpected future costs for credit. These and other factors affect how businesses see\n\n- 3 -\ntradeoffs as they make decisions about expanding operations and hiring. Workers need to\nbalance their prospects for their wages keeping up with inflation or whether it’s worth\nmoving to find a better job. Your experience, and the experiences of your customers and\nthe other people you serve, is an important input into the strategy the Fed will decide on\nfor our long-term monetary policy framework.\nWe are going to consider everything we’ve learned in the past five eventful years\nsince we last updated our framework, and we have learned a lot. But we can’t do it\nwithout you, because you are who we serve. And so, since listening requires that one\nstop talking, I am going to wrap up by thanking everyone from the Omaha area and\nacross the 10th District for agreeing to be part of today’s gathering. I look forward to\nhearing what you have to say.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nFinancial Inclusion Practices and Innovations Conference\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nWashington, D.C.\nJuly 9, 2024\n\nThank you, Art, and let me say how excited I am to be a part of the Federal\nReserve Board’s inaugural conference on financial inclusion and innovation.1 Financial\ninclusion is central to the Federal Reserve’s mission of promoting a strong and stable\nfinancial system and a healthy economy that works for everyone. This event brings\ntogether academics, practitioners, and thought leaders to discuss how financial products\nand practices are evolving to better meet the needs of individuals and businesses\nhistorically underserved by the financial system.\nI have spent much of my career in the public sector and academia working on\ntopics related to financial inclusion. I’ve found that projects that bring together public,\nprivate, academic, and nonprofit perspectives are often the most productive, since we all\napproach the issue differently and can learn from each other’s perspectives. Forums like\nthese provide good opportunities to form connections and spark collaboration.\nLooking over the past few decades, significant progress has been made in\nimproving financial inclusion, including progress on many of the issues that will be\ndiscussed at this conference. And yet we still have further to go. Continued support for\nresponsible innovation in this space is needed and can benefit from engagement across\nindustry, academia, and regulators. This morning, I will touch on how approaches to\nfinancial inclusion have evolved, where things stand today, and how we can continue\nprogress toward a more inclusive financial system.\nAdvancing the Goals of Financial Inclusion\nThe goal of financial inclusion is to improve access to affordable financial\nservices that meet the needs of individuals and businesses. Banking the unbanked is part\n1 The views here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve\nBoard or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nof that, but we also need to make sure that both bank and nonbank products and services\nare designed to meet the financial service needs of low- and moderate-income\nhouseholds. And we need strong consumer protections to guard against abuse.\nBanks are playing a pivotal role in innovating to serve low- and moderate-income\nhouseholds, sometimes in partnership with financial technology companies, or fintechs.\nFor example, we have seen a growing number of banks offering small-dollar loans,\nexpanding use of alternative data to underwrite and price their credit products, and\ninvesting in tools to help better understand consumers’ financial health. When adopted in\na responsible and well-managed manner—with systems, processes, and policies in place\nto monitor and manage related risks—these innovations can broaden access to fair,\naffordable, and transparent bank-provided credit. This in turn can create financial\nresilience among small businesses and help individuals and families become\nhomeowners, build wealth, and become financially empowered.\nThe Importance of Durable Inclusion\nInnovations in banking services are important to improving financial inclusion.\nBut to have a durable impact on society, innovations must be adopted responsibly. Banks\nmust have controls to manage risks and prevent violations of law, and their approach\nmust keep pace with the growth of new products and services. Complexity can\nexacerbate risks and requires banks to pay particular attention to ensure that laws are\nfollowed and customers protected. To the extent banks are working with fintech partners,\nbanks have a responsibility to manage the risks associated with the third parties they\npartner with to serve their customers.\n\n- 3 -\nWe have, unfortunately, seen examples of failures of banks to effectively manage\nthe risks of partnerships with other companies that support services to their end\ncustomers, and these failures have resulted in customer harm. In communities where\npeople are living on tight budgets or with limited access to financial services, disruptions\nof this kind can be catastrophic. These examples are a reminder that providing\ninnovative financial services comes with responsibilities to ensure that risks are\nappropriately controlled. Durably supporting financial inclusion means ensuring that\nnecessary controls grow in step.\nUse of Alternative Data\nWe do see great promise to improve financial access when innovation is done\nwith the appropriate risk controls in place. One such promising avenue is the use of\nalternative data in credit decisions involving small-dollar loans. Historically, access to\nthe financial system was limited for many households and small businesses that lacked\nkey financial credentials. For example, traditional credit models favor an applicant that\nalready has a sufficient credit history and a file from a credit reporting bureau to qualify\nfor lending. This leads to a catch-22 where lower-income applicants with scant credit\nhistory but ample ability to repay are denied access to credit because they do not have a\ncredit history.2 As a result, many lower-income households, both banked and unbanked,\n2 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reports that, as of 2016, 26 million Americans (11 percent of\nadults) do not have a credit record at one of the three national credit reporting agencies. See Kenneth P.\nBrevoort and Michelle Kambara, CFPB Data Point: Becoming Credit Visible (Washington: Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau, June 2017),\nhttps://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/BecomingCreditVisible_Data_Point_Final.pdf.\n\n- 4 -\nend up using a range of formal and informal services outside the banking system that too\noften keep households in a cycle of debt.3\nActions by the Federal Reserve have supported the opportunities, as well as\nidentified potential risks, associated with innovations in bank products and practices\nmarketed to those who have limited access to the financial system. In 2019, the Federal\nReserve’s alternative data statement highlighted the benefits and risks when banks and\nnonbank firms leverage alternative data in credit underwriting, particularly for borrowers\nthat have been locked out of conventional borrowing.4 This guidance underscored the\npotential benefit of using data that has a clear connection to creditworthiness, such as\ninformation on inflows and outflows from a bank customer’s deposit account. With the\nshare of households with bank accounts much larger than the share with credit scores and\nespecially with prime or near-prime credit scores, this information has the potential to\nallow underwriting of a much larger pool of potential reliable borrowers. In addition, in\n2020, the Federal Reserve issued principles for responsible small-dollar lending, typically\nuncollateralized loans of less than $2,000 that often leverage alternative data while being\nunderwritten.5 This guidance has encouraged the spread of these types of loans to\nhouseholds and small businesses that otherwise have had limited access to credit.6 In\n3 For example, see Michael S. Barr, “Financial Services, Savings and Borrowing Among Low- and\nModerate-Income Households: Evidence from the Detroit Area Household Financial Services Survey” (3rd\nAnnual Conference on Empirical Legal Studies Papers, March 30, 2008),\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1121195.\n4 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Interagency Statement on the Use of Alternative\nData in Credit Underwriting,” CA letter 19-11 (December 12, 2019),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/caletters/caltr1911.htm.\n5 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Interagency Lending Principles for Making\nResponsible Small-Dollar Loans,” SR letter 20-14 / CA 20-8 (May 20, 2020),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2014.htm.\n6 For more details on the impact of small-dollar loan guidance, see Daniel Gorin, Sarah Gosky, and\nMichael Suher, “Empirical Assessment of SR/CA Small-Dollar Lending Letter Impact,” FEDS Notes\n(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 28, 2023),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.3329.\n\n- 5 -\naddition, given the small but growing number of banks partnering with fintechs for\nalternative data and small-dollar lending, among other things, the Federal Reserve issued\nguidance in 2023 and 2024 on how to responsibly manage these third-party\nrelationships.7 Taken together, these statements are helpful resources to ensure that\nbanks are using the technological innovations from these third parties in safe and\nresponsible ways.\nAs noted in the alternative data guidance, alternative data can be sourced from a\nbank’s own relationship with its customers. And evidence from research and industry\nexperimentation suggests that information on cash flow from an individual’s bank\naccount can help predict credit risk while expanding credit access.8\nWe are already seeing progress in this space. Banks and credit unions of all sizes\nare starting to use alternative data to offer small-dollar loans to their existing customers\nwith short-term liquidity needs. Given the early promise of these loans, this area seems\nparticularly suitable for banks to innovate and experiment safely and fairly, within the\nconfines of safety and soundness standards and consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, banks and others have done extensive work over the past few years to\nmeasure the impact of bank products on the financial outcomes of customers. Among\nthose metrics are a set of financial health indicators around a customer’s cash flow and\npayment history that capture their ability to meet their own short-term liquidity needs,\n7 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Interagency Guidance on Third-Party\nRelationships: Risk Management,” SR letter 23-4 (June 7, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2304.htm; and Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, “Third-Party Risk Management: A Guide for Community Banks,” SR letter 24-2 /\nCA 24-1 (May 7, 2024), https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2402.htm.\n8 For example, see FinRegLab, “The Use of Cash-Flow Data in Underwriting Credit: Empirical Research\nFindings,” https://finreglab.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FinRegLab_2019-07-25_Research-\nReport_The-Use-of-Cash-Flow-Data-in-Underwriting-Credit_Empirical-Research-Findings.pdf.\n\n- 6 -\nbuild financial capacity, and affordably access financial services over time.9 Such\nindicators can help banks better understand the impact of their products and services on\ntheir customers, so that they support their customers’ longer-term financial resilience.\nThese indicators can also equip customers with the transparency and tools to assess\nfinancial service offerings.\nPotential of Instant Payments\nI’d also like to highlight the potential for real-time payment systems—including\nFedNow® and private sector systems—to advance financial inclusion. These services\nwill enable banks to offer customers the ability to send and receive money immediately,\nwhich can help customers weather income disruption and unexpected expenses. By\nreducing payment delays and the high costs for consumers associated with those delays,\nFedNow can over time improve access to the financial system and lower costs.\nIncreased Access to Consumer Data\nI’m also interested to see how increased access to consumer-authorized data will\nchange the landscape for innovation. As the rules, regulations, and practices related to\nexpanded access and sharing of customer-permissioned data flows evolve, consumers\nmay benefit from having a fuller picture of their financial life to better understand ways\nto improve their financial health. Customer-permissioned data access, alongside\ninnovations in digital identity, also has the potential to allow banks to better assess a\nborrower’s creditworthiness, increase customer access to financial services, offer\ncustomized and innovative financial products, and empower individuals to move more\nfreely in the emerging digital financial system. Of course, bank adoption will play a key\n9 Examples of financial health indicators include a customer earning more than they spend monthly, having\naccess to adequate savings, and maintaining a prime credit score.\n\n- 7 -\nrole in unlocking the power of such innovation. As with most innovations, regulators\nwill need to ensure appropriate measures are in place to protect consumers and promote\nfinancial stability. For example, regulators will need to be diligent so that the entities to\nwhich consumers grant access to their data safeguard privacy and data security.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act: Past, Present, and Future\nLet me turn now to the importance of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)\nand its role in advancing financial inclusion. As we know well, access to financial\nservices and credit is fundamental to economic security and vital to strong communities.\nThis access is the foundation of homeownership, education, small business development,\nand other economic activities that improve our lives and neighborhoods. I want to relate\nthese values to the CRA and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to encourage access to\ncredit in low- and moderate-income communities.\nCongress enacted the CRA in 1977 as one of a set of laws, together with the\nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity\nAct, to address redlining, other forms of racial discrimination, and lack of access to credit\nin low- and moderate-income communities. Fair lending laws set the unequivocal\nstandard that there is no place for such discrimination in the financial system. Federal\nbanking agencies reinforce this standard by taking a bank’s fair lending record into\naccount when assigning a CRA rating and evaluating whether banks meet the credit\nneeds in low- and moderate-income communities, consistent with safe and sound lending.\nThrough the enactment of the CRA, Congress charged the Federal Reserve and\nother federal bank regulators with the responsibility of assessing the performance of\nbanks in meeting the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities.\n\n- 8 -\nThroughout the CRA’s nearly 50 years of supervisory history, the agencies have strived\nto provide guidance that reflected dynamic changes in the financial landscape and at\nsome points in time revise the regulations to do so.\nLast October, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to strengthen\nand modernize the regulations implementing the CRA.10 Prior to the issuance of the final\nrule, the regulations had not been significantly updated since 1995. Throughout the\nrulemaking process, bankers and community groups consistently emphasized the need for\ngreater clarity, consistency, and transparency than was provided under the existing rules\nand guidance.\nIn response, much of the detail in the final rule is designed to provide the desired\nadditional clarity. The final rule standardizes the evaluation approach so that it is more\nconsistent across the agencies and more transparent to banks and the public. It does this\nin a way that builds on how CRA examinations are conducted today.\nThe final rule includes several provisions intended to advance financial inclusion.\nFor example, it emphasizes the work that minority depository institutions (MDIs) and\ncommunity development financial institutions do to expand access to credit and\nopportunity in underserved communities. It also includes a focus on activities that serve\nNative Land Areas, persistent poverty areas, and other high-need areas.\nWe take our supervisory responsibilities under the CRA seriously, knowing that it\nhelps to foster real opportunity for consumers and communities. The CRA has served as\na critical tool to support financial inclusion across the country since its passage and will\nremain a vital tool for bankers and community organizations to work together to promote\n10 Community Reinvestment Act, 89 Fed. Reg. 6,574 (February 1, 2024),\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-02-01/pdf/2023-25797.pdf.\n\n- 9 -\nfinancial inclusion and economic development in low- and moderate-income\ncommunities.\nThe Future of Financial Inclusion\nGiven the importance of innovation to the goal of financial inclusion, I am\ngrateful that we have been able to gather so many experts on topics related to it.\nWhile we have made considerable progress, we need to continue our efforts to\nsupport greater inclusion and a financial system that meets the needs of all Americans.\nAt the Federal Reserve, we will continue to work to improve our understanding of the\ninnovations in financial inclusion, and the intersection of payments innovation and\nfinancial inclusion, among others. We also will use our position to monitor innovations\nthat have financial inclusion implications—such as alternative data use and financial\nhealth measurement—and keep the public informed on the evolving industry practices\nthat help meet the needs of the financially underserved. For example, we expect to\nprovide additional resources on alternative data use in the coming months. In addition,\nthe Fed’s Partnership for Progress program helps MDIs and women’s depository\ninstitutions (WDIs) navigate their unique business challenges, provides MDIs and WDIs\nwith resources for technical assistance, and conducts research on the unique challenges\nfaced by low- and moderate-income communities.11 We also actively partner with Native\nAmerican communities to better understand their financial needs.\n11 Details about the Partnership for Progress program for MDIs and WDIs can be found in SR letter 21-6 /\nCA 21-4. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Highlighting the Federal Reserve\nSystem’s Partnership for Progress Program for Minority Depository Institutions and Women’s Depository\nInstitutions,” SR letter 21-6 / CA 21-4 (March 5, 2021),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2106.htm.\n\n- 10 -\nIn addition to the Federal Reserve’s role, the private sector is a key source for\nfinancial innovation, and we encourage businesses to responsibly innovate so that new\ntools that can increase financial inclusiveness are safe for customers and consistent with\nfinancial stability.\nWe would all benefit from additional research in this area. For instance, how do\nwe help ensure that expanding access to fair and affordable credit advances safe and\nsound lending? Empirically, which innovations are best able to meet customer needs\nsafely and affordably, maintain bank safety and soundness, and promote a healthier\neconomy? And how can we leverage concepts in behavioral economics to improve the\neffectiveness of credit products? I hope the conversations in today’s conference can\nspark productive dialogue and spur potential research in these areas.\nConclusion\nIn closing, my hope is that these kinds of efforts, as well as continued innovation\nin the banking system, can bring us closer to a time when all families and communities in\nour country have adequate access to credit and financial services on fair, affordable,\ntransparent, and accessible terms.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\n40th Annual National Association for Business Economics (NABE)\nEconomic Policy Conference\nWashington, D.C.\nFebruary 14, 2024\n\nThank you for having me here today. After having had to miss this conference\nlast year, I greatly appreciate the opportunity to join you. As you might expect, I was a\nlittle busy in March 2023, and I will share some thoughts on lessons learned from the\nstress in the banking system at that time, in particular what we have learned in terms of\nliquidity risk management.1\nBut first, I will start by discussing recent economic developments and the\nimplications for monetary policy. I will then turn to the banking sector and will focus on\nsome topics that lie at the intersection of the composition of the Fed’s balance sheet,\nmarket functioning, bank liquidity risk management, and the Fed’s role in liquidity\nprovision.\nStarting with economic developments, I think it is helpful to reflect on how\nsurprised most watchers of the economy were by developments in 2023, me included.\nPerhaps like many of you, at the start of 2023 I had projected that tighter\nmonetary policy would cause a slowdown in both inflation and economic activity. Then,\nwith the March 2023 banking stress, I was concerned that a potential credit contraction\ncould further weaken the economy.\nAt the same time, I also worried that inflation might remain elevated, even if we\nhad weaker economic activity, as supply chain problems and job-matching challenges\ncontinued to be prominent elements of the pandemic’s disruption to the operation of our\neconomy.\nI am glad to say that those worries did not come to pass, in part due to the official\nsector response to the banking stress, sound monetary policy, and a healing economy.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee.\n\n- 2 -\nEconomic activity expanded at a solid pace, the labor market remained strong, and\ninflation came down significantly.\nDisinflation and a growing economy\nThe current mix of outcomes we are experiencing would have seemed improbable\none year ago, and we might ask, how did we end up with disinflation and an economy\nwith brisk growth? The short answer is the healing of the economy. The pandemic\nbrought our economy to a screeching halt. During the second quarter of 2020, the\nunemployment rate jumped to a high of 14.8 percent and gross domestic product plunged\nat a 28 percent annual pace. These dynamics hit some of the most vulnerable populations\nthe most, though strong government responses helped to both ease the effects and make\nmany households much more resilient. Once the economy restarted, demand rebounded\nquickly, while supply was hampered by supply chain difficulties. These supply snags\nwere compounded enormously by a shift in demand away from in-person services and\ntoward goods, which generally have a larger exposure to shipping and supply chain\nproblems. Supply shocks to the global economy were subsequently compounded by\nRussia’s war against Ukraine, which severely disrupted food and energy markets. And\nlabor markets were disrupted by the pandemic as well. Employers could not find enough\nworkers, and job-matching was impaired.\nAn important component of post-pandemic healing has been the recovery of\nsupply chains after the pandemic-induced bottlenecks in both goods production and\ndistribution. Recent shipping disruptions show supply chain conditions are still an issue,\nbut compared to pandemic-era constraints, we are in a much better position. For\nexample, the price to ship a 40-foot container from China to the West Coast has recently\n\n- 3 -\nrisen to around $4,000, about twice the pre-pandemic level, but it is far below the\n$20,000 rate in 2021.\nAnother key component of the improvement in supply has been in the labor\nmarket. We have seen substantial improvements in the labor force through both stronger\nimmigration and higher labor force participation rates, notably by women. As supply has\nimproved, labor demand has cooled, but this cooling has manifested largely in a\nreduction in job vacancies, rather than layoffs. At the same time, we have seen the labor\nmarket working more efficiently—for example, with improved job matching after the\nlarge disruptions during the pandemic. The improvements in labor supply and labor\nmarket functioning have allowed the unemployment rate to hold steady at a low level.\nThe strong labor market has broadly improved the lives of Americans, and particularly so\nfor groups that have long suffered significantly higher unemployment levels and whose\njobless rates respond more forcefully to the business cycle.\nImprovements in productivity\nAnother key part of the story in the post-pandemic healing of our economy has\nbeen the growth of productivity. While measures of productivity tend to be volatile,\nproductivity growth has picked up in the past year. Increased productivity is, in part,\nlikely coming from components that will continue to yield improvements, such as the\nintegration of new technology, new ways of working, and the large increases in new\nbusiness formation. Growth in new businesses has been found to lead to productivity\ngains, likely because new entrants innovate, and legacy firms must also innovate to\ncompete with new entrants. These increases in productivity are also consistent with real\nwage gains, one measure of rising living standards.\n\n- 4 -\nThe net result of all this healing of the economy is that growth has been robust\neven as upward pressure on inflation has diminished. This healing has been helping both\nsides of our dual mandate over the past year.\nMonetary policy has been essential in this process. Higher interest rates have\nhelped to restrain demand, giving supply the opportunity to catch up. Monetary policy\nhas also anchored inflation expectations. Longer-term inflation expectations have stayed\nanchored, and shorter-term expectations have fallen. The Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s (FOMC) preferred inflation gauge has fallen from a peak of 7.1 percent in\nJune 2022 to 2.6 percent in December 2023. We have made this progress while\nunemployment has remained near a 50-year low.\nAs central bankers, we always need to consider the full range of risks to achieving\nboth our goals. We are always assessing risks on the horizon, including the risk of an\neconomic slowdown that could reduce employment, or the risk that inflation does not\nstay on its path of sustainably returning to 2 percent. As Chair Powell indicated in his\nmost recent press conference, my FOMC colleagues and I are confident we are on a path\nto 2 percent inflation, but we need to see continued good data before we can begin the\nprocess of reducing the federal funds rate. I fully support what he called a careful\napproach to considering policy normalization given current conditions. January’s report\non consumer price index inflation is a reminder that the path back to 2 percent inflation\nmay be a bumpy one.i\nGiven the limited historical experience with the growth and inflation dynamics we\ncurrently face, and no modern experience of emerging from a global pandemic, we have\nyet another reason to proceed carefully, as we have been doing.\n\n- 5 -\nBanking conditions\nNext, I want to turn to current banking conditions, lessons learned from the March\n2023 banking stress in terms of liquidity risk management, and how we can put those\nlessons to use for a resilient banking system.\nStarting with current banking conditions, the banking system remains sound and\nresilient, and it is in much better shape than it was last spring. However, there are a few\npockets of risk that we continue to watch, including the pandemic’s persistent impact on\noffice commercial real estate in certain central business districts.2\nJust a couple of weeks ago, disappointing earnings and higher loss provisions at\none bank precipitated significant declines in stock prices. A single bank missing its\nrevenue expectations and increasing its provisioning does not change the fact that the\noverall banking system is strong, and we see no signs of liquidity problems across the\nsystem. Nevertheless, we continue to monitor conditions carefully across the sector, just\nas we always do.\nA few lessons from March 2023\nCrucial to banks being resilient is effective liquidity risk management. That was\nclear in March 2023 and remains so now. We learned that runs can materialize with\nunprecedented speed and severity, spreading contagion. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) lost\n$40 billion in deposits in a single day, and the firm’s management expected to lose $100\nbillion more the following day. In total, that represented about 85 percent of the firm’s\n2 These risks have been discussed in recent editions of the Financial Stability Report, which are available\non the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/financial-stability-report.htm.\n\n- 6 -\ndeposits.3 The runs on SVB and, shortly thereafter, on Signature Bank and First\nRepublic, each of which lost around 20 percent of deposits within hours, were much\nfaster than we had seen in previous episodes.4\nThe runs on all three were also especially severe, driven in part by imprudent\nfunding reliance on uninsured deposits placed by concentrated and often highly\nnetworked customer bases. These deposits proved flightier than previously assumed. For\nexample, SVB’s depositors were heavily concentrated in venture capital and technology-\nsector firms, Signature Bank had uninsured depositors from crypto-related firms, and\nFirst Republic had high concentrations of high-net-worth uninsured depositors. Many of\nthese uninsured depositors rapidly withdrew their balances, resulting in deposit flows that\nwere much higher than assumed under the standardized liquidity requirements, such as\nthe liquidity coverage ratio.\nAt the same time that these institutions faced these outflows, they also faced\nchallenges meeting them with available assets. Firms, even those with large stocks of\nhigh-quality liquid assets (HQLA), were not sufficiently prepared to monetize these\nassets—that is, to turn them into cash. Challenges with monetization can be especially\nacute for securities designated as held-to-maturity (HTM). As interest rates increase and\nthe value of HTM securities goes down, banks that account for them at amortized cost do\nnot have to reflect the decline in market value on their balance sheets. But selling even a\n3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), Review of the Federal Reserve’s\nSupervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank (Washington: Board of Governors, April),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf.\n4 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2023), FDIC’s Supervision of Signature Bank (Washington:\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, April), https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-\nreleases/2023/pr23033a.pdf; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2023), FDIC’s Supervision of First\nRepublic Bank (Washington: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, September),\nhttps://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2023/pr23073a.pdf.\n\n- 7 -\nportion of an HTM portfolio results in a firm needing to recognize losses on the entire\nportfolio, a hit to capital. The ability to turn HTM assets into cash, particularly when\nsales are not feasible, is limited by a firm’s ability to ramp up access to secured funding\nsources, which proved problematic in large size last March.\nMany banks have been analyzing these dynamics and have taken steps to address\nthese risks. Over the past year, for example, we have seen banks reducing their reliance\non HTM for liquidity purposes, adjusting the composition of their HQLA portfolios, and\nenhancing their ability to tap different sources of liquidity. They have also been updating\ntheir contingency funding plans. These improved practices are important for both\nindividual firm resilience and aggregate financial stability.5\nAdditionally, I remain focused on how we can improve bank readiness to tap the\nFed’s discount window. The discount window provides ready access to liquidity,\nincluding when forms of market funding come under strain. But banks should do some\npreparation to be fully ready to tap the window. That includes pre-positioning collateral\nand testing discount window usage. While banks do their part to get operationally ready,\nwe at the Federal Reserve also need to continue to improve discount window operations.\nBank liquidity needs also relate directly to the evolution of the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet. The Fed’s Senior Financial Officer Survey shows that banks now prefer to\n5 I have discussed the importance of prudent liquidity risk management in a number of previous speeches;\nsee, for example, Michael S. Barr (2023), “The Importance of Effective Liquidity Risk Management,”\nspeech delivered at the ECB Forum on Banking Supervision, Frankfurt, Germany, December 1,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20231201a.htm.\n\n- 8 -\nmanage to higher reserve levels than they did pre-COVID, with several citing the March\nliquidity stress as a significant driver.6\nRight now, the Federal Reserve is implementing monetary policy with plentiful\nreserves in the system, even as we continue to run down the balance sheet with sizable\nsecurities redemptions every month. This process has been operating smoothly. So far,\nbalance sheet asset reduction has largely been accompanied on the liability side of our\nbalance sheet by large declines in overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP)\nusage, rather than reductions in reserves. Since the ON RRP remains sizable, we still\nhave a buffer before reserves begin to decline in a meaningful way.\nThe FOMC reiterated in May 2022 that it plans to operate monetary policy with\nan ample-reserves regime over time.7 As many market commentators have pointed out, it\nmay be difficult to determine what level of reserves is consistent with “ample.” The\nmarket dynamics from September 2019 illustrate this; when repo rates spiked and these\npressures spilled over into the federal funds market, the Fed had to rapidly ramp up\noperations to add reserves to the banking system. This episode was a factor leading to\nthe establishment of the standing repo facility, which, along with the discount window,\nwill help dampen pressures that could emerge in short-term money markets.8 I am\n6 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), Senior Financial Officer Survey Results\n(Washington: Board of Governors, September), https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sfos/files/senior-\nfinancial-officer-survey-202309.pdf; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), Senior\nFinancial Officer Survey Results (Washington: Board of Governors, May),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sfos/files/senior-financial-officer-survey-202305.pdf.\n7 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), “FOMC Communications Related to\nPolicy Normalization,” webpage, https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-\nnormalization.htm. Note that the original statement was in January 2019; see Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (2019), “Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet\nNormalization,” press release, January 30,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm.\n8 Both the standing repo facility and the FIMA repo facility were established in July 2021; see Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “Statement Regarding Repurchase Agreement\n\n- 9 -\npleased to see that there has been a steady growth in the number of firms signed up for\nthe facility, and that current bank counterparties to the facility engage in regular testing as\na part of maintaining access.\nDespite these improvements in our tools, it is also important to closely monitor\nmarket conditions well before pressures emerge. There are a variety of market indicators\nthat we can track closely to assess whether banks are beginning to have difficulty\naccessing reserves in a way that could affect the constellation of short-term rates. We are\nalso watching for signs of frictions in the redistribution of reserves that may not be\nimmediately evident in wholesale funding markets. These frictions could result from a\nvariety of factors including the fact that smaller banks generally have a less diverse array\nof wholesale market funding options to tap when they need to bolster reserve positions.\nSo we will be approaching these questions carefully. The Committee is planning to begin\nin-depth discussions of balance sheet issues soon.\nIn conclusion, I hope my remarks have given you a sense of how I view the\ncurrent state of the economy as well as the path that has gotten us here. Economic\nhealing is helping us to lower inflation while growth remains solid. That is to the great\nbenefit of the American people. The banking sector is sound, and I am focused on\nensuring its continued resiliency. One aspect of this work is carefully examining the\nlinks between bank liquidity, market functioning, the Federal Reserve’s liquidity\nprovision, and the evolution of our balance sheet.\nThank you.\nArrangements,” press release, July 28,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210728b.htm.\n\n- 10 -\ni Note: On February 26, 2024, a typo was corrected to change an erroneous reference of the “consumer\nproduct index” to “consumer price index”: “January's report on consumer price index inflation is a\nreminder that the path back to 2 percent inflation may be a bumpy one.”",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision-Federal Reserve\nCounterparty Credit Risk Conference\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 27, 2024\n\nThank you for the opportunity to be part of this important discussion on\ncounterparty credit risk.1 It’s particularly appropriate for the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York to host these discussions. Twenty-five years ago, New York Fed officials\nconvened the creditors of Long-Term Capital Management (LTMC) to facilitate the\nfirm’s stabilization. LTCM was a heavily leveraged hedge fund that had borrowed more\nthan $125 billion from its counterparties and had derivatives estimated at over $1 trillion\nin notional value. Stabilizing LTCM narrowly averted significant financial stress, an\nevent I remember vividly from my vantage point as a Treasury official at the time. That\nevent prompted deep reflection on both the risks presented by nonbanks such as hedge\nfunds and the state of counterparty credit risk management practices by banks that\nfinance their activities.\nThe more recent failure of Archegos Capital Management resulted in over $10\nbillion of reported losses across several banks and revealed many of the same gaps in\nhow banks manage their exposure to investment funds, which are far larger today than at\nthe time of LTCM’s collapse. Managing these exposures has become more challenging\nas the financial system has become more complex, diverse, and interconnected. For\nexample, the sudden rise in commodities prices in March 2022 rippled around the global\nfinancial system in part because of the sudden rise in margin requirements on\ncommodities derivatives as the stress hit. Further, an increasingly varied and evolving\ncollection of nonbank clients, including pension funds and asset managers, is playing a\nsignificant role in the global economy and presenting new and unconsidered risks. For\ninstance, losses in 2022 in the liability-driven investments of pension funds in the United\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board.\n\n- 2 -\nKingdom demonstrated how even traditionally safe exposures, such as government\nbonds, when combined with excessive leverage, can threaten the stability of bank\ncounterparties and the global financial system. These events highlight why counterparty\ncredit risk is such an important risk discipline.\nBanks have made important progress since the failure of Archegos to improve\ncounterparty credit risk management practices because of their own reflection on the\nlessons learned from Archegos and in response to supervisory input. For instance, banks\nhave improved information disclosures from clients, adopted risk-sensitive margin\npractices to a greater extent, and enhanced tools to manage risk.\nGoing forward, the Federal Reserve plans to continue its focus on fundamental\nrisk management related to counterparty credit risk, and I’ll focus my remarks on three\nthemes. First, banks should know their customers exceedingly well, both at onboarding\nand throughout the evolution of the relationship. Second, banks should have tools to\nidentify the unique risks they face as these risks materialize across products, business\nlines, and clients and use these risk measures to maintain appropriate margins through the\ncredit cycle. Third, banks should set prudent risk limits and respond to signals of risk\nappropriately. These risk management practices are important to help control the build-\nup of risk—preventing banks and the banking system from taking on outsized exposure\nto leveraged entities and preventing the build-up of that leverage. These credit risk\nmanagement practices are important complements to prudent liquidity risk management\nand resilience measures, such as contingency planning, in which banks take steps to\nmitigate the impact of distress of a counterparty to the bank and the financial system\nmore broadly.\n\n- 3 -\nThe Federal Reserve will also use its own tools to assess counterparty credit risk\nin the banking system. For example, alongside this year’s stress test results, we will\npublish the aggregate results of several exploratory analyses, including analysis of the\nresilience of the globally systemically important banks to the simultaneous default of\ntheir five largest hedge fund counterparties. We will conduct that analysis under two\ndifferent sets of financial market conditions to learn about how such exposures may vary\nacross different types of stresses. We expect the information yielded from that analysis\nwill deepen our supervisory understanding of counterparty credit risk at the banks. As\nwe noted, the exploratory analysis will not affect bank capital requirements.\nThere will be more to come on that in June, but for now let me speak about the\nrisk management practices we plan to focus on in our ongoing supervision.2\nThorough Due Diligence\nAs with many things in banking and business, strong risk management starts with\nknowing your customers. In traditional lending, a lender should understand the finances\nand exposures of the borrower to ensure it will be able to pay back the loan. A lender\nshould also understand the borrower’s managerial and financial history, profitability\ngoals and the risk-taking to achieve them, and how those goals may change over time.\n2 See also Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Supervisory Guidance Regarding\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management,” SR letter 99-3 (February 1, 1999),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/1999/sr9903.htm; Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, “Interagency Counterparty Credit Risk Management Guidance,” SR letter 11-10 (July 5,\n2011), https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1110.htm; Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System, “The Federal Reserve Reminds Firms of Safe and Sound Practices for\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management in Light of the Archegos Capital Management Default,” SR letter\n21-19 (December 10, 2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2119.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nAnd once the loan is made, lenders should do the hard work to continually obtain\nnecessary and timely information about the borrower.\nThis understanding is especially important when customers are counterparties in\ncomplex or dynamic trading activities. Banks need reliable, comprehensive, granular,\nand frequent information about their counterparties to make prudent decisions. Obtaining\nthis information can be challenging because of client activity happening away from the\nbank. Having only partial disclosure of the positions of a counterparty prevents banks\nfrom understanding the vulnerabilities in the counterparty’s risk profile, such as excessive\nconcentrations and leverage, that could lead to major losses. If a counterparty is\nunwilling to offer an appropriate level of disclosure, the bank should take this into\naccount in whether to deal with the counterparty and the terms that it offers if it\nnonetheless chooses to lend or provide other services.\nIn the case of both LTCM and Archegos, the lack of appreciation for their overall\nsize, leverage, and concentration was a significant factor in explaining the deficiencies in\nhow banks risk-managed their exposures to those funds. This lack of transparency\ncontributed to remarkable growth of the funds’ positions and exacerbated the risk to\ncounterparty banks from their collapse.\nMeasuring Risk and the Importance of Margining\nNext, I’ll discuss the importance of identifying and measuring counterparty credit\nrisks, as well as mitigating those risks through sound margining practices. Sound\ncounterparty risk measurement rests upon four important foundations. The first involves\nunderstanding a counterparty’s risk profile through a range of risk measurement tools. In\n\n- 5 -\ncontrast to many traditional lending relationships, trading activities can be more complex\nand riskier, which demands more nuance and attention in risk measurement.\nSecond, banks should conduct risk aggregation within and across products,\nbusiness lines, and clients. Large trading clients may have varied exposures across\ndifferent products, asset classes, and business lines at the bank. Managing this effectively\nrequires the bank to understand how these risks fit together and how they add up.\nThird, banks should have capabilities for timely and accurate risk measurement\ngiven the dynamic and complex nature of trading activities. There should be appropriate\nunderstanding of the risk measurement tools used within the organization—including\ntheir strengths and limitations—to allow for appropriate use and action.\nFourth, based on their assessment of the risk, it is important that banks maintain\nappropriate levels of margin to insulate them from loss. Risk-based margining and\nassociated terms and conditions are an important and often necessary part of the\ncounterparty credit risk management toolkit. Margining practices should be conservative\nand appropriately risk-sensitive because financial markets can change rapidly. Waiting to\nincrease margins until markets become volatile and the risks apparent can, ironically,\ncreate additional risk.\nMargining practices are important for all asset classes, including highly liquid\nassets such as Treasury securities. The strength of the Treasury markets relies on its\nresilience and elasticity in both normal times and episodes of stress. Prudent margin\npractices both protect banks extending credit against safe assets and promote market\nfunctioning, as they limit the extent to which firms can obtain outsized positions that\nrequire disorderly liquidation and exacerbate price volatility. As noted in a previous\n\n- 6 -\nspeech, liquidation of leveraged Treasury positions by hedge funds appears to have\ncontributed to the Treasury market stress in March 2020.3\nImportantly, weakening standards on margin or terms and conditions should not\nbe a negotiation point to win business. In a competitive business landscape, it is easy to\nsee how exceptions to the rules can become common practice, leading to weaker\ncounterparty practices across the sector. If banks are not resolute in their standards, a\ncascade of weaker margin practices and terms and conditions could lead to unacceptable\nlevels of risk for individual banks and the broader financial system.\nSetting Risk Limits and Responding Appropriately\nMy next area of focus relates to setting prudent counterparty credit risk limits and\nresponding when those limits are breached. Risk limits establish how much risk a bank is\nwilling to accept, and escalation and remediation processes determine what a bank should\ndo if a counterparty nears or breaches a limit. Proactive measures can help ensure that\nbanks take action to manage risks before they become too acute and avoid the need for\ndestabilizing actions in times of stress.\nIn past failures, we observed banks established what had seemed like reasonable\nlimits at the time; however, these banks did not always act in a timely manner when those\nlimits were breached. Counterparty credit exposures can evolve rapidly as conditions in\nthe financial markets change or counterparty risk profiles shift. As a result, a quick\nresponse is critical for risk managers in responding to these signals.\nStrong governance and a robust risk culture are some of the most important\nfactors in ensuring durable and effective management of counterparty credit risk. Banks\n3 Michael S. Barr, remarks at The 2023 U.S. Treasury Market Conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York, November 16, 2023, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20231116a.htm.\n\n- 7 -\nshould have multiple measures of counterparty risk, regularly use those measures to\nidentify material risk, and respond in those cases. Still, it does not matter if a bank has\nample reporting, the best counterparty risk measurement capabilities in the world, and\nperfectly calibrated limits: if risks are ignored by key decisionmakers, or if individuals\nwith responsibility for managing the risk don’t have influence on the firm’s business\ndecisions, the firm is not engaging in effective credit risk management.\nOf course, having good governance and risk culture is in part about the basics:\nbanks should ensure that they have capable people with the skills necessary to manage\nthe risk; adequate staffing levels; strong documentation; and clear roles, responsibilities,\nand accountability. It also means banks need to create a risk culture that prioritizes\ntimely and comprehensive communication and information sharing across the\norganization, and that banks respect the views of risk managers about when to avoid\ntaking bad risks.\nInternational Cooperation Is Vital\nCounterparty credit risk can have global implications because financial markets,\nand banks’ trading businesses and their clients, are often global. International\ncooperation is vital to promote the smooth functioning of markets that move around the\nglobe and to ensure a level playing field for American financial institutions.\nAfter the failure of LTCM, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\npublished “Sound Practices for Banks’ Interactions with Highly Leveraged Institutions,”\nmuch of which remains relevant today.4 As this gathering shows, the Basel Committee\n4 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, “Sound Practices for Banks’ Interactions with Highly\nLeveraged Institutions” (Basel: Bank for International Settlements, January 1999),\nhttps://www.bis.org/publ/bcbsc123.pdf.\n\n- 8 -\ncontinues to play a leading role in bringing together bank supervisors to solve\nchallenging problems that cross borders and recommending solutions to ensure consistent\nglobal standards. This conference is also a byproduct of the default of Archegos in\nMarch 2021, which was a counterparty of numerous banks. As supervisors of some of\nthose institutions, the Federal Reserve and the United Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation\nAuthority led a valuable post-mortem effort with numerous other domestic and\ninternational supervisory authorities to investigate the causes and associated risk\nmanagement failures that led to such significant and widespread financial stress.\nConclusion\nWe all have an interest in seeing that counterparty credit risk management\npractices are commensurate with the inherent complexity, materiality, and\ninterconnectedness of trading activities. This is even more important today than when\nLTCM collapsed in 1998. Since that time, the hedge fund industry is much larger, with\nfunds currently reporting around $9 trillion in assets,5 and many funds are leveraged and\ninterconnected with major banks. Getting this right is in the interest of banks, their\ncustomers, and the public, which depends on a stable and strong financial system.\n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Financial Stability Report (Washington: Board of\nGovernors, October 2023), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-\n20231020.pdf.",

We all play a part in fostering responsible innovation.\nResponsible innovation requires a few things—having the optimism and curiosity to\nunderstand the potential benefits, the rigor and realism to identify the attendant risks, and\nthe collective intent to find solutions to advance a safe and fair financial system.\nToday, I’d like to speak about responsible innovation in the context of generative\nartificial intelligence (Gen AI) in banking and how bank–fintech partnerships may\naccelerate the integration of the technology and banking. Earlier this year, I laid out two\nscenarios for Gen AI adoption—an incremental scenario where the technology primarily\naugments what humans do today, and a transformative scenario where we extend human\ncapabilities with far-reaching consequences.2 Of course, these are hypotheticals, and\nelements of both scenarios will likely come to pass. But in either scenario, we should\nanticipate widespread productivity gains, particularly for banking.3\nToday, banks appear to be moving cautiously with their Gen AI use, which\nreflects the current state of the technology, as well as banks’ internal organizational\nstructure and the highly regulated environment in which they operate. At the same time,\nGen-AI offers enormous potential to significantly alter the business of banking, provided\nthat the risks are managed appropriately. Given rapid advances in Gen AI every quarter,\nin the not-too-distant future, we may approach a point at which Gen AI becomes an\n1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal\nReserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.\n2 Michael S. Barr, “Artificial Intelligence: Hypothetical Scenarios for the Future,” speech at the Council on\nForeign Relations, New York, February 18, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm.\n3 See the SAS web page, Cashing In: Study Shows Banks Investing Big in GenAI, and It’s Paying Off,\nhttps://www.sas.com/en_us/news/press-releases/2024/october/generativeai-banking.html.\n\n- 2 -\nimperative—a competitive necessity—in banking. To prepare for that point, it is useful\nfor regulators and banks to think about the channels through which this competitive\nnecessity may arise. Today, I want to focus on one of those channels, and that’s the\nbank–fintech relationship. Fintechs are well positioned to integrate Gen AI into their\nproducts and services, and banks have valuable data on customer behavior on which the\nGen AI models can be optimized. Given these synergies, competition and cooperation\nbetween banks and fintechs will likely spur innovation and accelerate the integration of\nGen AI into banking.\nGen AI may have benefits for consumers and businesses through better, cheaper,\nand faster financial services; however, to harness the upsides of Gen AI, banks, fintechs,\nand regulators all have a role to play in helping to ensure that the risks are managed.\nGen AI and Banking\nLet me begin with why Gen AI has such potential for the banking industry. The\nbusiness of banking is data-driven—data underpin the decisions to set yields on deposits,\nunderwrite and price credit products, and manage the attendant risks. While traditional\nforms of artificial intelligence have become essential in areas like fraud detection, Gen AI\noffers new possibilities for data analysis, taking into account a broader and more diverse\nset of data. Gen AI has benefits for document analysis, which could be applied to\nimprove credit underwriting.\nBeyond data processing and analytics, Gen AI-powered chatbots are already\nhelping assist in customer service. While we still breathe a sigh of relief when we\nconnect to a real customer service representative, this paradigm may change—Gen AI\nhas the potential to enable such high-quality and efficient customer engagement and\n\n- 3 -\ncorrect answers that customers may come to prefer Gen AI agents to people. Gen AI\nchatbots can break down complex tasks into component parts, split up tasks between\nseveral AI agents, and help customers make informed decisions. They can also replicate\nthe human touch—adapting to the level of sophistication of their customers, anticipating\nthe customer’s needs, and being empathetic to the customer’s experience—perhaps better\nthan some humans.4\nAnd moving to trading and capital markets, Gen AI-based analytic tools can build\non existing algorithmic trading capabilities by harnessing an enormous knowledge base\nin both the public and private domains. These enhancements have the potential to enable\ndecisions that are faster and more informed—although with some attendant risks as I’ve\ndiscussed previously.5\nWhy Not Yet?\nGiven the potential for Gen AI to enhance banking, why do we not see\nwidespread integration of Gen AI enhanced products and services in banking to date?\nThere are several factors contributing to our current state. Let me highlight some key\nreasons.\nOf course, one reason is that banks are being appropriately cautious in the highly\nregulated environment in which they operate. Beyond that, for some of these\napplications, the technology is not fully mature. For instance, Gen AI systems may still\nhallucinate, generating plausible sounding but inaccurate information. Relatedly, because\n4 J.W. Ayers, A. Poliak, M. Dredze, et al., “Comparing Physician and Artificial Intelligence Chatbot\nResponses to Patient Questions Posted to a Public Social Media Forum,” JAMA Internal Medicine, April\n28, 2023;183(6):589–96, https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2804309.\n5 Michael S. Barr, “Artificial Intelligence: Hypothetical Scenarios for the Future,” speech at the Council on\nForeign Relations, New York, February 18, 2025,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250218a.htm.\n\n- 4 -\nGen AI usually involves stochastic processes, answers can differ in response to the same\nquery asked at different times or to similar queries. This is tough to square with the\nrequirements of banking, where decisions must be well-controlled, numerically and\nlegally precise, explainable, and replicable.\nInformation security is another key concern. To the extent that a Gen AI-powered\nagent is accessing sensitive customer data and authorizing transactions, it becomes an\nattractive target for malicious actors.6 Further, as Gen AI models process vast amounts\nof data, there’s a risk that proprietary or customer information could be inadvertently\nincluded in the model’s outputs or responses, leading to legal violations and privacy\nbreaches.\nMoreover, business processes at banks have not evolved to optimize Gen AI\nusage. Gen AI requires data and infrastructure to be effective. Many banks have existing\ntech debt, and their data storage is siloed and not optimized for firmwide analysis.\nFurthermore, there may be organizational practices that may make it hard to evolve\nexisting processes to ones optimized by AI.\nThe technological and organizational limitations are real. Nevertheless, I think it\nmay be only a matter of time before the technology advances so that these are\nengineering, product design, and risk management challenges—rather than\ninsurmountable problems. And with regard to the business process issues, I think\nfintechs have a real role to play in helping to accelerate responsible innovation by banks\nin this space.\n6 For instance, see NIST blog, “Technical Blog: Strengthening AI Agent Hijacking Evaluations,” January\n17, 2025, https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/01/technical-blog-strengthening-ai-agent-\nhijacking-evaluations.\n\n- 5 -\nFeatures of Fintechs and Banks\nAs Gen AI technology continues to develop, there’s a good chance that fintechs\nwill help drive widespread Gen AI adoption in financial services. There are a few\nreasons why this may be the case. First, fintechs are generally young companies with a\nclean tech stack and don’t have to integrate new technology into old infrastructure. This\nallows them to make the most of their data and continuously integrate the latest AI\ncapabilities. Second, these firms have financial and time constraints. Early funding\nrounds provide limited time and resources to demonstrate outcomes and drive fintechs to\nfind effective, quick solutions, which often involve creative uses of cutting-edge\ntechnology. Third, because fintechs usually start as a simple business idea and focus on\nmoving one product to production, they can optimize their tech stack for a single\noutcome instead of balancing the interests of competing business lines.\nThese attributes of fintechs can make them symbiotic with banks. Banks have\ndeep customer data, and data are a key input to effective application of machine learning\nmodels, including large language models. Banks are also able to look across a range of\nbusiness lines and use Gen AI to customize integrated sales strategies, and they have the\nscale to adopt global Gen AI solutions for compliance and risk management. And banks\nhave existing customer relationships and mature control frameworks that form the basis\nof their credibility and trust.\nAnother way to consider the relationship of fintechs and banks is as a race\nbetween speed and scale. Fintechs have the ability to operate at speed but start with no\nscale. Banks, on the other hand, move more slowly but have scale in terms of\ninvestment, consumer reach, and risk management. This creates the dynamic where\n\n- 6 -\nfintechs must attempt to scale their market share quickly enough to overcome the scale\nand incumbent advantage of the banks.7\nBank–Fintech Relationship as an Accelerant for AI Adoption\nAnd this leads me to my next point—I believe that the bank–fintech relationship\nhas the potential to accelerate adoption of Gen AI in financial services. This may come\nin the form of direct competition, with fintechs taking market share from banks for\ncertain products, or banks crowding out fintechs by introducing better technology into\ntheir existing or new product lines. Such competition usually benefits consumers by\nproviding more choice and better and cheaper products, provided that the risks are\nappropriately managed. It may also create competitive pressure and consumer demand\nthat pushes banks to adopt Gen AI products and solutions more quickly.\nAlternatively, fintechs and banks may enter into a symbiotic relationship, forming\ncollaborative partnerships where fintechs and banks merge their strengths. Examples of\nthese partnerships may include banks purchasing or investing capital in fintechs with Gen\nAI products, or banks and fintechs entering into traditional vendor–client relationships.\nResponsibility for AI Risk Management\nThere’s one common theme in these scenarios: technology advances outside of\nthe bank perimeter and rapidly enters the regulated sector. To get prepared for this\nmoment, bank risk managers and regulators should become familiar with Gen AI trends\nand monitor developments outside the bank perimeter so that they are not caught off\nguard as this technology quickly enters the banking system.\n7 And many fintechs have success, achieving significant scale in a relatively short period.\n\n- 7 -\nWe have a shared role in creating the incentive structure to appropriately manage\nrisks. To the extent banks are using Gen AI or offering Gen AI products and services,\nthey have the responsibility to manage their risk, and should use their relationships to\nincentivize good risk management practices for fintechs.8 This means choosing fintech\npartners that provide transparency and clarity regarding the development of AI tools and\nhave demonstrated appropriate control in deployment. There’s necessary tension here, as\nbanks must understand the tools offered by their fintech partners for their own risk\nmanagement, while fintechs may not want to share details they hold close—their secret\nsauce. With respect to Gen AI, it is important for fintechs and banks to tackle questions\nlike who owns the customer data, and potential conflicts that may arise if a bank’s\ncustomer data are fed back into a fintech’s Gen AI model.\nFintechs also have an important role to play in laying the groundwork for good\nrisk management of Gen AI.9 As I’ve mentioned before, data quality and model training\nare critical to safe, sound, and fair use of these tools.10 Fintech developers should, for\nexample, prioritize identifying biases in training data sets and monitoring outputs in order\nto prevent those biases from amplifying inequalities or mispricing risks. Moreover,\nfintechs should be aware of how banks manage risk, so that the fintech can adapt Gen AI\nsolutions to be compatible with sound risk management approaches.\nAnd what should regulators do? As I’ve mentioned, regulators need to stay\neducated and informed on the technology, so that they understand the business case for\n8 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, SR letter 23-4, “Interagency Guidance on Third-\nParty Relationships: Risk Management” (June 7, 2023),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2304.htm.\n9 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, SR letter 11-77, “Guidance on Model Risk\nManagement,” https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107.htm.\n10 Michael S. Barr, “Artificial Intelligence: Hypothetical Scenarios for the Future,” speech.\n\n- 8 -\ndeploying the technology and the attendant risks. They should review and update\nexisting standards on model risk management, as appropriate, and engage in public–\nprivate forums where there are opportunities to work together. And they need to explore\nhow and when to deploy the technology themselves, to remain in touch in the changing\nworld and make reasoned judgments about how to supervise the use of Gen AI in the\nbanking sector.\nThese changes will require broad-based curiosity from regulators, fintechs, and\nbanks—combined with education and investment—to create a culture of awareness on\nthe opportunity and risks of the technology. Equally as important is leadership, to\nestablish appropriate governance over AI and provide appropriate direction on priorities.\nConclusion\nIn closing, successful integration of Gen AI into banking will require both\ncreativity in adoption as well as getting the guardrails right. That’s not a zero-sum game.\nIt’s an opportunity for all stakeholders—banks, fintechs, regulators, and consumers—to\nhelp to set the foundation for the benefits of the technology to be achieved and the risks\nto be effectively managed. In this way, we can help to be part of the sound and resilient\nfinancial system for all. Thank you.",

Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nEconomics of Payments XII Conference\nFederal Reserve Board\nWashington, D.C.\nOctober 27, 2023\n\nI am grateful for the opportunity to speak with you today, at a time of great\nchange, and great promise, for the payments system.1 The Federal Reserve plays\nmultiple roles in the payments system, including as a supervisor of banks and financial\nmarket utilities and as an operator of some key components of payments infrastructure.\nThe research done by experts, including those in this room, is vital in helping us\nunderstand what works well in the payments system and what can be done to improve it.\nWe introduced the FedNow Service® in July to facilitate secure and convenient\ninstant payments. We developed FedNow in response to a growing demand for instant\npayments from both households and businesses. A hundred years ago, the Fed facilitated\npayments by moving checks across the country by train. FedNow represents new “rails”\nby which payments can keep pace with today’s businesses and consumers. The Federal\nReserve has now made these rails available; banks can build on this infrastructure to\nprovide better service for households and businesses.\nIt is hard to speak about payments innovation without mentioning the increased\nexperimentation with new payments technologies, such as stablecoins and central bank\ndigital currencies (CBDCs) happening in the private and public sectors, both in the\nUnited States and elsewhere. As this work proceeds, we must carefully weigh the\nbenefits and risks of different uses of these new technologies.\nStablecoins, as I have said in other remarks, need to be regulated. When an asset\nis pegged to a government-issued currency, it is a form of private money. When that\nasset is also used as a means of payment and a store of value, it borrows the trust of the\ncentral bank. So, the Federal Reserve has a strong interest in ensuring that any stablecoin\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or the Federal Reserve Board.\n\n- 2 -\nofferings operate within an appropriate federal prudential oversight framework, so they\ndo not threaten financial stability or payments system integrity. We also have provided\nguidance to the banks that we supervise on how they should engage with their supervisors\nwhen considering use of these products.\nIn terms of CBDCs, we continue to speak to a broad range of stakeholders and\nconduct basic research in emerging technologies that might support a CBDC payments\nbackbone, or for other purposes in the existing payments system. The research is\ncurrently focused on end-to-end system architecture, such as how ledgers that record\nownership of and transactions in digital assets are maintained, secured, and verified, as\nwell as tokenization and custody models. This work helps us consider how we could\ndesign a digital analog to the paper bank note that permits a transfer of value between two\nparties without direct facilitation by the issuing central bank.\nIt is important to note, however, that while the Federal Reserve supports further\nresearch and continued engagement with a broad range of stakeholders, the Fed has made\nno decision on issuing a CBDC and, as Chair Powell has emphasized, would only\nproceed with clear support from the executive branch and authorizing legislation from\nCongress. With this in mind, learning from both domestic and international\nexperimentation can aid decisionmakers in understanding how we can best support\nresponsible innovation that safeguards the safety and efficiency of the U.S. payments\nsystem. We’ll hear more about the results from some of these domestic and international\ninitiatives on CBDCs later today.\nInternational collaboration and coordination are often essential in payments\nsystems, as we heard in Jon Cunliffe’s keynote yesterday. In 2020, the G20 governments\n\n- 3 -\nendorsed a roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments, aimed at making them faster,\ncheaper, more transparent, and more accessible globally. 2 The Federal Reserve supports\nand continues to work with the international community on these issues, and I look\nforward to our ongoing engagement with stakeholders, both public and private, on the\npath forward.\nCloser to home, traditional payment methods are still the backbone of the U.S.\npayments system, despite the surge in interest in emerging payment technologies. It is\nimportant to advance research in both new and older payment methods. Questions on the\nuse of cash and the dynamics among the players in the debit card industry remain worthy\nof investigation, as is evident in the conference agenda.\nEarlier this week the Board proposed revisions to the interchange fee cap for debit\ncard issuers, as required by law. Public input is a key element of the rulemaking process\nfor the Federal Reserve, and I look forward to reviewing the comments that we will\nreceive on the proposed revisions. I also appreciate the opportunity for Federal Reserve\nstaff to engage with the broader scholarly community on this and other topics, as research\nis an important component for our consideration of regulatory actions. Engagement with\nresearchers, stakeholders, and the public will help the Federal Reserve continue to\nsupport a safe and efficient payments system, which has been part of our mission since\nthe Fed’s establishment in 1913.\nFinally, whether we talk about traditional or emerging payment technologies, in\nthe public or private sector, innovation must proceed in a way that respects fundamental\nprinciples for serving the public good. Payments innovation should support and promote\n2 https://www.fsb.org/2020/10/enhancing-cross-border-payments-stage-3-roadmap/\n\n- 4 -\nbroad access and financial inclusion. Financial inclusion is affected by many factors, but\ntoo often the cost of a payment service is prohibitive and represents a barrier that limits\naccess for low- and moderate-income households and small businesses. I am pleased to\nsee that so many of the topics covered in this conference touch on factors that affect\nfinancial inclusion: issues of cost, trust, privacy, and security, among others.\nIn conclusion, I want to thank the organizers for putting together this forum and I\nlook forward to further engagement. Thank you all for being here and giving us the\nopportunity to learn more about your research.",

    "text": "For release on delivery\n1:00 p.m. EDT\nOctober 2, 2023\nMonetary Policy and Financial Stability\nRemarks by\nMichael S. Barr\nVice Chair for Supervision\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nat the\nForecasters Club of New York\nNew York, New York\nOctober 2, 2023\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you. I would like to talk with you\ntoday about the intersection of my two roles at the Federal Reserve as the Vice Chair for\nSupervision at the Federal Reserve Board and as a member of the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).1 In particular, I’ll focus on the interaction of monetary policy and\nfinancial stability policy.\nViews on Monetary Policy and Current Conditions\nFirst, my views on current monetary policy.\nI am squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment\nand stable prices for the American people. I strongly agree with the point that Chair\nPowell has made often, which is that without price stability, the economy does not work\nfor anyone. Price stability is crucial to achieving a sustained period of strong labor\nmarket conditions that benefit all.\nI joined the FOMC last year at a time when the headline CPI inflation was\npeaking at about 9 percent, and we had begun our policy response. There has been a lot\nof progress since tightening the stance of policy began last year. In August, the 12-month\nchange in CPI inflation was about 3¾ percent. The Committee has raised the federal\nfunds rate 5¼ percentage points while also reducing the Fed’s securities holdings by\nabout $1 trillion. Our strong measures have ensured that inflation expectations remain\nwell anchored.\nWhile inflation has been moderating, incoming data on economic activity have\nshown considerably more resilience than I had expected. We are being helped by\nimprovements in supply. I now see a higher probability than I did previously of the U.S.\n1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee or the Federal Reserve Board.\n\neconomy achieving a return to price stability without the degree of job losses that have\ntypically accompanied significant monetary policy tightening cycles. However, the\nhistorical record cautions that this outcome could be quite difficult to achieve.\nOf course, the labor market is tight and the data show that employment continued\nto expand through August, but incoming data also suggest we are making progress on\nbringing labor demand and supply back into better balance. Job growth has moderated\nwhile labor force participation has continued to improve. Immigration has increased, and\njob vacancies have moved down toward a more normal level.\nMy baseline projection is for real GDP growth to moderate to somewhat below its\npotential rate over the next year as restrictive monetary policy and tighter financial\nconditions restrain economic activity, and I expect this below-trend growth will be\nassociated with some further softening in the labor market. As we watch how conditions\nevolve, I remain highly attuned to risks to achieving both components of our mandate.\nThere is a robust debate about the lags of monetary policy transmission; how long\nit takes for past tightening to come into full effect. While these lags are difficult to\nestimate, I expect that the full effects of past tightening are yet to come in the months\nahead. I strongly agree with what Chair Powell has said about where we are in the\ntightening cycle. Given how far we have come, we are now at a point where we can\nproceed carefully as we determine the extent of monetary policy restriction that is\nneeded. In my view, the most important question at this point is not whether an\nadditional rate increase is needed this year or not, but rather how long we will need to\nhold rates at a sufficiently restrictive level to achieve our goals. I expect it will take some\ntime. I will continue to evaluate a range of incoming data as I make my assessments at\n\nupcoming meetings. As a part of this, I continue to track the cost and availability of\ncredit to the economy, as I will discuss later in these remarks.\nMonetary Policy and Financial Stability\nNow let me turn to my focus today, which is the interaction of monetary policy\nand financial stability. Monetary policy affects the cost and quantity of credit in the\neconomy, usually in a broad-based and gradual fashion. Financial instability, however,\ncan affect the cost and quantity of credit in an acute and abrupt fashion. Both forces have\nan effect on economic activity, as the flow of credit to businesses and households is\ncrucial for spending, hiring, and production, underpinning economic growth.\nFinancial stability was a key motivation for the creation of the Federal Reserve\nSystem in 1913.2 Although the term “financial stability” wasn’t in the vernacular at the\ntime, the Fed was established in part to provide “an elastic currency”—a major concern\nin an era when periodic strains in the banking sector resulted in currency hoarding and\nwidespread bank runs and failures, causing severe harm to our economy. For much of\nour subsequent history, however, the Federal Reserve tended to consider financial\nstability and monetary policy separately.3 That perspective changed considerably in the\nyears after the Global Financial Crisis, which had many implications for how we think\n2 As Paul Volcker put it 40 years ago when testifying as Federal Reserve Chair, “the Federal Reserve, like\nany central bank, has a continuing and abiding interest in . . . the stability of the financial system in the\nbroader sense. If you go back to history, that’s really why the Federal Reserve was founded.” See Paul\nVolcker (1983), “Panel Discussion,” in Problems, Options, and Issues Currently Facing the Financial\nServices Industry and the Agencies that Regulate and Supervise These Entities, hearing before the\nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, Apr. 26, Senate Hearing 98-142, 98\nCong. (Washington: Government Printing Office), p. 78. In addition, Robert Owen wrote, “It is the duty\nof the United States to provide a means by which the periodic panics which shake the American Republic\nand do it enormous injury shall be stopped.” See Robert L. Owen (1919), The Federal Reserve Act: Its\nOrigins and Principles (New York: Century Company).\n3 See, for example, Ben S. Bernanke (2013), “A Century of US Central Banking: Goals, Frameworks,\nAccountability,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 27 (Fall), pp. 3–16.\n\nabout financial stability and the role of the Federal Reserve. The Dodd-Frank Act was\npivotal in reducing financial-sector vulnerabilities that contributed to the crisis, as were\nattendant reforms to capital and liquidity rules that strengthened the resiliency of the\nbanking system.\nFinancial Stability Considerations in a Low-Rate Environment\nAfter the Global Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low for\nyears to revive a badly damaged economy. Researchers, market participants, and\npolicymakers took note of the potential for very low interest rates to encourage investors\nto “reach for yield”—that is, to take increased risk in pursuing higher returns on their\ninvestments. This behavior can include taking on increased interest rate, credit, and\nliquidity risk. In some ways, investor reach for yield is an indication that monetary\npolicy is helping stimulate economic activity. Lowering borrowing costs increases the\nexpected return on any investment that is financed. This means that lower rates result in\nmore investments or projects getting the green light. As a result, more people get jobs as\neconomic activity increases.\nBut in that environment of record low interest rates, and with the ravages of the\nfinancial crisis a fresh memory, people rightly wondered whether the incentive to reach\nfor yield would drive excessive risk-taking, leading to a buildup in vulnerabilities that\ncould ultimately threaten the stability of the financial system and the economy. Were\nthose risks so considerable that financial stability concerns should be taken into\nconsideration in making monetary policy decisions?4 At the same time, some risks were\n4 Michael Woodford raised the issue in 2012; see Michael Woodford (2012), “Inflation Targeting and\nFinancial Stability,” NBER Working Paper Series 17967 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of\nEconomic Research, April), https://www.nber.org/papers/w17967. Among Fed policymakers, it was\n\nmoving outside the banking system, leading some to worry that measures to build\nresilience at banks would miss these risks. Indeed, as then-Governor Jeremy Stein\nfamously pointed out, monetary policy “gets in all the cracks” and therefore could push\nback against excessive risk-taking, not only in banks, but across the financial system.5\nDespite these concerns, financial stability risks were contained until the pandemic.\nFinancial Stability Consideration of Moving from Low Rates to Rising Rates\nThe pandemic resulted in an unprecedented mismatch between demand and\nsupply, both here and abroad, and these forces were the initial impetus for high inflation.\nThe shift from an environment of generally low and slowly adjusting rates to the rapid\nand near-simultaneous tightening of monetary policy around the world that began last\nyear set the stage for additional stresses in the financial system. For example, in the\nUnited Kingdom, an initial jump in the yields on longer-maturity government bonds was\namplified by distress at liability-driven investment funds. These funds had become\npopular with many pension funds during the low-rate period and faced a liquidity\nsqueeze, as they had to rapidly post collateral to cover derivatives losses. This led to\nwidespread disruptions in the gilt market last fall, requiring the Bank of England to\nbroached in 2013 by Narayana Kocherlakota and then dealt with more extensively in 2014 in speeches by\nJeremy Stein and Janet Yellen; see Narayana Kocherlakota (2013), “Low Real Interest Rates,” speech\ndelivered at the 22nd Annual Hyman P. Minsky Conference, Levy Economics Institute of Bard College,\nNew York, April 18, https://www.minneapolisfed.org/speeches/2013/low-real-interest-rates; Jeremy C.\nStein (2014), “Incorporating Financial Stability Considerations into a Monetary Policy Framework,” speech\ndelivered at the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy, Washington, March 21,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/stein20140321a.htm; Janet L.

While most banks were well positioned to handle rate increases, higher interest\nrates had a severe effect on the balance sheets of banks that had not managed their\ninterest rate risk appropriately. This mismanagement came into acute focus when Silicon\nValley Bank (SVB) announced it had realized a large loss from the sale of securities that\nhad declined in value and that it intended to raise capital to fill that hole. Uninsured\ndepositors abruptly ran on the bank—with actual and planned flight totaling roughly 85\npercent of its deposits within 24 hours—and it failed instantly. SVB’s failure caused\nwidespread contagion that led quickly to the failure of Signature Bank and eventually to\nthe failure of First Republic Bank, and it posed acute stress on other banks. The stress\nonly abated after invocation of the systemic risk exception that permitted the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation to protect all depositors (including uninsured depositors)\nof the failed banks and the creation of the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) using the\nFed’s emergency lending authorities. The BTFP allowed banks to get access to Fed\nliquidity based on the par value of their high-quality securities at fixed rates for up to a\nyear.\nThis response helped calm conditions in the banking sector. Deposit flows\nreturned to normal, and the prospect of a widespread and acute bank credit contraction\n6 See Bank of England (2022), Financial Stability Report (London: BOE, December),\nhttps://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/financial-stability-report/2022/financial-stability-\nreport-december-2022.pdf.\n\nreceded. Such a contraction could well have harmed the economy and even triggered a\nrecession. Indeed, one recent study looked at data for 46 countries over 150 years and\nfound that episodes of bank stress are frequently followed by significant drops in bank\nlending and economic activity that persist for many years.7 Despite the effectiveness of\nour response to the March stress events, the question again arose whether monetary\npolicy goals were in conflict with financial stability.\nGiven these historical experiences, I think it is particularly important that we\nwatch closely how both monetary policy and the effects of the March banking stress are\naffecting bank behavior and the provision of credit to the economy. Recent data are\nconsistent with pressures on banks easing relative to March. Nevertheless, although\ndeposit volatility has abated, some banks have had to turn to higher-cost funding sources\nto make up for lost deposits. And core loan growth appears to be relatively stagnant in\nbanks of all sizes. While low loan growth can be explained in part by weaker demand for\nloans in response to higher costs of credit, it is also driven in part by banks tightening\ntheir standards, as they reported they were doing in the past several releases of the Senior\nLoan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices.8\nAs we continue to track developments, we are also continuing to learn from this\nepisode. As I have discussed in other remarks, as well as in congressional testimony, we\nare using lessons learned from the March episode to consider how we can both enhance\nour supervision and adjust our regulations as appropriate to address risks at the\ninstitutions over which we have supervisory and regulatory authority.\n7 See Matthew Baron, Emil Verner, and Wei Xiong (2021), “Banking Crises without Panics,” Quarterly\nJournal of Economics, vol. 136 (February), pp. 51–113.\n8 The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey is available on the Federal Reserve’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos.htm.\n\nA stable financial system is a necessary condition for sustainably achieving the\nFOMC’s monetary policy goals of maximum employment and stable prices. It is critical\nthat banks have enough capital to remain resilient to those stresses. The safety and\nsoundness of the banking sector is paramount in achieving both our monetary policy and\nfinancial stability goals. Everyone in America depends on a safe and stable financial\nsystem that channels credit to businesses so they can grow and hire workers, and to\nhouseholds so they can deal with the ups and downs in the economy and invest in the\nfuture. Of course, major portions of the financial sector are not subject to federal\nprudential regulation. As I noted in a speech on bank capital earlier this year, we also\nneed to worry about how risk outside the banking sector can threaten financial stability,\nas stress in broader financial markets is often transmitted to the banking system.9 So we\nneed to take a broad view of financial stability.\nPerspectives from the Literature and the Policy Debate\nRecent experience lines up with academic research. I see three basic findings.10\nFirst, when financial intermediaries, such as banks, play the important role of channeling\nfunds from savers to borrowers, they frequently do so through various forms of maturity\nand credit transformation. This transformation results in the creation of risk on their\nbalance sheets. Issuing short-term, liquid liabilities (including uninsured deposits) to\n9 See Michael S. Barr (2023), “Holistic Capital Review,” speech delivered at the Bipartisan Policy Center,\nWashington, July 10, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20230710a.htm.\n10 For a recent review and synthesis of the theoretical and empirical academic literatures, see Andrea\nAjello, Nina Boyarchenko, Francois Gourio, and Andrea Tambalotti (2022), “Financial Stability\nConsiderations for Monetary Policy: Theoretical Mechanisms,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series\n2022-005 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February),\nhttps://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2022.005; and Nina Boyarchenko, Giovanni Favara, and Moritz Schularick\n(2022), “Financial Stability Considerations for Monetary Policy: Empirical Evidence and Challenges,”\nFinance and Economics Discussion Series 2022-006 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System, February), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2022.006.\n\nfund longer-term, less liquid assets is one example of maturity transformation. These\nassets, such as loans, can have a credit risk component as well. These types of activities\nare key aspects of how the financial system supports the economy. But they can also lead\nto a buildup of financial vulnerabilities. And, of course, banks also engage in trading\nactivities with their own set of exposures to market risk, a concern for regulation and\nsupervision.\nThe second conclusion of researchers is that such financial vulnerabilities can\namplify the effects of adverse shocks to the economy, as witnessed during the Global\nFinancial Crisis.\nAnd third, there is some evidence that monetary policy can affect financial\nvulnerabilities. I described, for example, how a low-rate environment can affect\ninvestors’ inclination to reach for yield and how a rising rate environment can expose\npoor asset-liability management.\nWhile there is some agreement among researchers about how monetary policy can\naffect the accumulation of financial vulnerabilities, there is more debate about whether\nmonetary policy decisionmaking should be affected by concerns about financial stability.\nOne view is that there is often a discernable tradeoff between the objectives of monetary\npolicy and financial stability, and that monetary policy decisions should consider the\nconsequences for the stability of the financial system.11 Another view is that there should\nbe a strict separation of monetary policy and financial stability policy. According to this\n11 See, for example, Jeremy C. Stein (2014), “Incorporating Financial Stability Considerations into a\nMonetary Policy Framework,” speech delivered at the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy,\nWashington, March 21, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/stein20140321a.htm; and\nJeremy C. Stein (2021), “Can Policy Tame the Credit Cycle?” IMF Economic Review, vol. 69 (March), pp.\n5–22.\n\nperspective, these goals are often complementary, particularly over the longer run, and\neven in cases when they do clash, the conflicts are short lived and better dealt with\nthrough specific and separate sets of tools. For example, Ben Bernanke, Don Kohn, and\nLars Svensson, among others, have argued that the likely costs of using monetary policy\nto address financial stability risks outweigh the benefits.12 My view is somewhere in the\nmiddle of these two perspectives. Let me explain what I mean.\nMonetary policy is a blunt tool, affecting every individual, investor, and business.\nIn contrast, financial stability threats can emerge from discrete parts of the financial\nsystem. Correctly calibrating monetary policy to target a financial vulnerability specific\nto one part of the financial system is likely not possible. Moreover, a monetary policy\nresponse, even to a broad-based search for yield, might require an increase in rates so\nlarge that it causes broad-based economic harm.13 In addition, if a segment of the\nfinancial system comes under stress but does not affect broader credit conditions, easing\nfunding costs to the entire economy through monetary policy may not be appropriate.\nTargeted supervisory and regulatory action is often more effective. If financial stress is\nso large that it causes a macroeconomic downturn, then monetary policy and financial\nstability policy are well aligned, and the objective function can be clearly defined as\n12 See, for instance, Ben S. Bernanke (2015), “Should Monetary Policy Take into Account Risks to\nFinancial Stability?” Brookings Institution, April 7, https://www.brookings.edu/articles/should-monetary-\npolicy-take-into-account-risks-to-financial-stability; Don Kohn (2016), “Monetary Policy and Financial\nStability,” speech delivered at Tsinghua University, Beijing, May 21, https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-\n/media/boe/files/speech/2016/monetary-policy-and-financial-stability.pdf; Lars E. O. Svensson (2017),\n“Cost–Benefit Analysis of Leaning against the Wind,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 90 (October),\npp. 193–213.\n13 See for example, Moritz Schularick, Lucas ter Steege, and Felix Ward (2021), “Leaning against the Wind\nand Crisis Risk,” American Economic Review: Insights, vol. 3 (June), pp. 199–214; Lars E. O. Svensson\n(2014), “Inflation Targeting and ‘Leaning against the Wind,’ ” International Journal of Central Banking,\nvol. 10 (June), pp. 103–14.\n\nrestoring economic growth. Therefore, monetary policymakers are generally best served\nby focusing squarely on their macroeconomic objectives.\nThat said, policymakers need to be cognizant of what is happening in the financial\nsystem and of any accumulation of financial stability risks, as these risks can be a threat\nto achieving the dual mandate. As the first line of defense, where we have authority,\nsupervision and regulation are best positioned to address vulnerabilities in the financial\nsystem as they emerge. If these tools are properly deployed, these actions may be\nsufficient. But sometimes they won’t be. Turning back to the SVB example, the bank\nfailed because of a textbook case of mismanagement, particularly of interest rate and\nliquidity risk.14 The result was that the firm’s collapse created financial stability risks\nthat required emergency intervention.\nMonetary policy cannot be indifferent to financial stability risks. When financial\nstability events materialize, they can significantly affect both the price and quantity of\ncredit to the economy. At that point, financial stability problems become a monetary\npolicy concern, as they can adversely affect the flow of credit to households and\nbusinesses as well as depress economic activity.\nAs I mentioned earlier, in its deliberations about monetary policy, the FOMC\nconsiders how credit conditions are affecting the economy. We receive regular briefings\n14 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2023), Review of the Federal Reserve’s\nSupervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank (Washington: Board of Governors, April 28),\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf. The Government\nAccountability Office’s preliminary report and the Federal Reserve’s Office of Inspector General’s\nMaterial Loss Review similarly found weak risk management at SVB and inadequate supervisory responses\ngiven the firm’s deficiencies. See Government Accountability Office (2023), “Preliminary Review of\nAgency Actions Related to March 2023 Bank Failures,” GAO-23-106736 (Washington: GAO, April),\nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106736.pdf; and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n(2023), “Material Loss Review of Silicon Valley Bank,” Evaluation Report 2023-SR-B-013 (Washington:\nBoard of Governors, September 25), https://oig.federalreserve.gov/reports/board-material-loss-review-\nsilicon-valley-bank-sep2023.pdf.\n\non financial stability risks, briefings that I find hugely valuable. But we also need to be\nconscious of the inherent limits in our ability to foresee how the financial system will\nrespond to shocks given its complexity and evolving nature. Our ability to address\nfinancial stability risks has been greatly improved by the reforms of the Dodd-Frank Act\nand enhanced bank capital and liquidity requirements. But we can expect that the\neconomy remains vulnerable to unanticipated shocks that affect both financial stability\nand economic growth. While continuing to bolster the resilience of the financial sector\nwhere we have authority to do so, we must also continue to monitor how emerging\nfinancial-sector risks may threaten the broader economy.\nConcluding Thoughts on Federal Reserve Liquidity Provision\nI would like to wrap up my thoughts today by discussing one of the Federal\nReserve’s oldest tools of both monetary policy and financial stability: the discount\nwindow. I will again harken back to our founding and note that providing backstop\nliquidity to banks is one of the original purposes of the Federal Reserve System.15\nToday, the discount window plays an important role. Currently, the primary\ncredit rate, which is the rate available to banks in generally sound financial condition, is\nset at the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. In this way, this tool, as well\nas the standing repo facility, which also has a rate currently set at the top of the target\n15 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), “Federal Reserve Actions to Support the\nFlow of Credit to Households and Businesses,” press release, March 15,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm; Paul Warburg (1916),\n“The Reserve Problem and the Future of the Federal Reserve,” speech before the Convention of the\nAmerican Bankers Association, Kansas City, September 29,\nhttps://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/historical/federal%20reserve%20history/bog_members_statements/W\narburg_19160929.pdf; Mark A. Carlson and David C. Wheelock (2015), “The Lender of Last Resort:\nLessons from the Fed’s First 100 Years,” in Owen F. Humpage, ed., Current Federal Reserve Policy under\nthe Lens of Economic History: Essays to Commemorate the Federal Reserve System’s Centennial (New\nYork: Cambridge University Press), pp. 49–101.\n\nrange, can help keep the federal funds rate within the target range established by the\nFOMC if pressures arise in short-term funding markets.16 For the discount window to\nsupport rate control, however, banks need to be willing and prepared to use it when other\nmeans of supporting their funding and liquidity—such as tapping the federal funds\nmarket—are more expensive. I have been working to ensure that eligible institutions\nknow that supervisors expect them to be ready and willing to use the discount window.\nWe recently published a joint-agency message on the importance of readiness to tap\ncontingency funding sources, including the discount window.17\nReadiness to use the discount window is also crucial when it comes to financial\nstability. When the system is hit with a shock that results in widespread stress, funding\nmarkets are often unable to effectively distribute liquidity. In these cases, the discount\nwindow can be particularly important both to the institutions that need liquidity and to the\nFederal Reserve’s efforts to stop dysfunction from spreading and restore stability, but,\nagain, only if banks do the work ahead of time and are ready and able to use it. As we\nsaw in March, many banks found that having more than one option at the ready to\nmonetize assets was important. Other sources of funds to banks, even the Federal Home\nLoan Banks, are dependent on private-sector financial market functioning to provide\n16 Committee discussions about the design of the standing repo facility can be found in Board of Governors\nof the Federal Reserve System (2021), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 15–16,\n2021,” press release, July 7,\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210707a.htm.\n17 See the “Addendum to the Interagency Policy Statement on Funding and Liquidity Risk Management:\nImportance of Contingency Funding Plans,” which is available on the Federal Reserve’s website at\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20230728a1.pdf.\n\nliquidity to their customers. When the market isn’t working, such sources of funding and\nliquidity come under strain.18\nIn contrast, even when banks find that other sources of funds are not available, the\ndiscount window can provide liquidity to every eligible institution that is prepared to use\nit. In this way, the discount window is an important means of supporting financial\nstability.\nIn conclusion, monetary policy needs to be cognizant of the risks that financial\nstress can lead to abrupt changes in the price and quantity of credit, and thus can cause\nsignificant harm to the real economy. At the same time, focusing monetary policy\ndecisions on macroeconomic objectives and using other tools for financial stability is\nlikely the most prudent path. Even as we address the lessons from past financial stress,\nthe Federal Reserve must be vigilant about potential risks to financial stability that may\nlie ahead. Financial institutions need to have an array of both public and private\ncontingent funding sources immediately available to weather a variety of conditions.\nThank you, and I am happy to take questions.\n18 The events of September 11, 2001, are one example; see James J.
