    "text": "Thank you for that warm introduction.  It’s just over two years since I became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and I am reminded that one of my first public speaking engagements was to this group in February of 2008.  You'll recall that my remarks that day were made as the world financial crisis was in its early stages. In fact I spoke to you just before the collapse of Bear Stearns in mid-March.\n\nSo much has happened since then, not the least of which is the fact that the crisis and the actions of the Federal Reserve in helping to resolve it have become a staple for the news media worldwide. In fact, it's almost impossible to read a newspaper or watch television without hearing something about the Fed, the economy, and the financial crisis.\n\nAs I have travelled around the country making speeches over the past few months, I find myself being asked the same three questions over and over again. So for my prepared remarks today, I’d like to address those big questions about the economy. Afterwards, I’ll also give you an opportunity to ask some questions of your own.\n\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet’s begin with the question I am asked more frequently than any other: Is the recession really over? In a narrow, technical sense, the short answer is yes. Many broad indicators of economic activity are increasing as we would expect in the early stages of a recovery. Nonetheless, I keep hearing the question because many households and businesses do not yet feel like they are in much of a recovery. Unemployment remains very high, and many businesses are still producing and selling much less than they did two years ago. What people really want to know is when will we make significant progress in returning unemployment and other measures of economic health to more normal levels? We appear to be moving in that direction, but there is much work to be done.\n\nLet me elaborate a little on those points. Although 2009 started as a very weak year, it finished well. Real gross domestic product (GDP), our broadest measure of economic output, increased at a 4.1 percent rate in the second half of last year. A portion of this improvement reflects the effects of government stimulus spending. But private demand is beginning to firm up as well. For example, in the automobile industry, which was hit especially hard by the recession, sales have held up in recent months even after the cash-for-clunkers program ended. In other industries, many firms that cut production and inventories very aggressively during the recession are now dialing back their inventory liquidation. On balance, the latest data on manufacturers’ orders have been more positive, both for materials and parts and for capital equipment. Demand from abroad is also increasing; in particular, the emerging-market economies are showing renewed vigor that should benefit U.S. exporters.\n\nIn the housing market, the news has been mixed. Sales of new homes and housing starts stopped falling early last year and have been bouncing along without much of a trend over the past several months. Sales of existing homes increased a good deal through most of 2009, but much of the gain was retraced around the turn of the year. Subsidies for first-time home buyers have contributed to the ups and downs in the data, and we have yet to see how well the housing market will hold up once they ultimately expire. However, the declines in home prices that earlier precipitated the financial crisis are now attracting buyers, and so are low mortgage rates. Sadly, many of these sales are for foreclosed homes, but at least they are now moving on the market. Last year's sales and the low level of starts have substantially helped to reduce the overhang of unsold homes, which should help set the stage for a gradual recovery in residential construction.\n\nMost forecasters also expect only a gradual recovery in consumer spending. In part, this is because the drop in home prices and the fall in the stock market during the height of the crisis reduced household wealth. It’s also because the availability of household credit has tightened. In addition, the unemployment rate currently is at 9.7 percent. For states in the Federal Reserve’s Seventh District, unemployment was 11 percent in December. With such a depressed labor market, workers are seeing little growth in wages and salaries. So, with credit tight and households needing to repair their balance sheets, consumer spending will gain momentum only as people get back to work.\n\nEmployment is often the last piece of the puzzle to fall into place during a recovery. This will certainly be true this time. Many businesses slashed payrolls during the recession, and going forward, many are hoping to keep staffing levels lean. Indeed, even though output was increasing, employment still fell substantially during the second half of 2009. Toward the end of the year, however, the pace of job loss moderated significantly. Some of the businesses that cut their payrolls most deeply during the recession have begun to rehire workers. Others have accommodated recent increases in demand by hiring temporary workers. This is just the first stage of the recovery process. Most employers are very cautious about hiring at this time, given the uncertainty over the pace of the recovery. But I think that many businesses already are finding they can take lean production only so far. These firms should be ready to expand permanent hiring once they see clearer signs of sustained increases in demand.\n\nThe picture with regard to financing conditions is complex to say the least. On the plus side, more and more financial markets are functioning well without the need for ongoing government support. As a result, large firms are able to borrow at reasonable spreads, both short term in commercial paper markets and long term in corporate bond markets. On the down side, the availability of bank credit remains a significant headwind for many small- and medium-sized companies. Some of the decline in bank lending that we saw last year reflects weak demand for loans by businesses wary of taking on new debt burdens in an uncertain economic environment. But at least some of the reduced lending arises from banks’ tighter lending standards. These tighter standards, in turn, appear to reflect banks’ concern over their capital levels and also the credit quality of borrows. More generally, credit flows are being reduced because both borrowers and lenders are still dealing with losses from the recession, especially the busts in residential and commercial real estate. I expect banking conditions to improve, but this is likely to take some time.\n\nLooking ahead, I anticipate that restrictive bank credit, along with business and household caution, will continue to restrain the recovery’s strength. Nevertheless I expect these dampening influences to abate as we move through 2010. We at the Chicago Fed expect GDP growth to average 3 to 3-1/2 percent in 2010. Such growth is only slightly above our estimate of the economy’s potential growth rate, which means unemployment will likely decline only modestly in 2010.\n\nOf course, the recovery could exceed these expectations. The growth we’re expecting is modest for a recovery following a deep recession, which is typically followed by a sharp increase in economic activity. For example, GDP growth in the year and a half following the recession of 1981 and 1982 averaged about 8 percent. While that’s not the case now, some of the recent data have been better than expected. Increases in confidence could turn into higher spending sooner than we think. And an important longer-term factor is that productivity growth has remained strong. Technology continues to advance, and firms continue to create new products and find new ways to produce more efficiently. Such productivity gains will result in higher incomes and improving standards of living over the longer term.\n\nWell, that was a long answer to a short question about the recovery. The second question I’m often asked comes in two versions. The first version is: Isn’t inflation about to go through the roof? The second version is: Isn’t inflation about to fall further—aren’t we looking at deflation? The answer is no in both cases: I think inflation will remain relatively stable. But the fact that I get these completely different questions highlights the degree of uncertainty currently underlying the inflation outlook. Surveys of consumer inflation expectations, professional forecasters’ projections, and the implied inflation forecasts from the market for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities all see inflation running close to current rates over the medium term. But these stable inflation expectations balance out some important crosscurrents. I’m reminded of the old joke that says if you put two economists in a room you’ll get at least three opinions. Well, that’s especially true now.\n\nThe current low rates of resource utilization strongly point to lower inflation. The 9.7 percent unemployment rate and the still very low rates of manufacturing capacity utilization are factors that reduce cost pressures and make firms less able to push through price increases. In fact, these factors have significantly contributed to a recent decline in inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of core inflation—the deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, excluding food and energy—has fallen from 2.7 percent in August 2008 to 1.4 percent in January 2010. That is a large decline for a relatively slow moving data series.\n\nThe people who press me on higher inflation point to the Fed’s expanded balance sheet and the associated large increase in what economists call the monetary base. We all know that too much money chasing too few goods will generate inflation. But, currently, most of the increase in the monetary base is sitting idly in bank reserves—and because banks are not lending those reserves, they are not generating spending pressure. Of course, leaving the current highly accommodative monetary policy in place for too long would eventually fuel inflationary pressures.\n\nWith core inflation at 1-1/2 percent, we see the opposing forces of resource gaps and accommodative monetary policy as roughly balancing out over the medium term. Resource slack could result in core PCE inflation coming down a bit more in 2010 and 2011. As resource slack abates in a recovering economy, I expect inflation to move up to about 1-3/4 percent in 2012.\n\nTo achieve this outlook, monetary policy cannot be passive. A large challenge facing policymakers over the next couple of years will be judging the appropriate timing and pace for reducing accommodation. On the one hand, removing too much accommodation prematurely could choke off the recovery. On the other hand, as I noted, if the Fed leaves the current level of accommodation in place too long, inflationary pressures will eventually build. The Fed is preparing for these decisions by carefully monitoring business activity and remaining alert for signs of incipient inflation. In addition, the FOMC is making sure that it has the technical tools it will need when it decides to reduce monetary accommodation. Overall, I am confident that monetary policy will bring and keep inflation near my guideline of 2 percent over the medium term.\n\nNeedless to say, the crisis and recession have kept us busy. But we have also devoted a good deal of energy to reflecting on events of the past several years. This is, in large part, because of the importance of the last question I have been asked recently: What have you at the Federal Reserve learned about how to guard against future financial crises again creating such a major recession?  It is not always worded so nicely!  There are, of course, a number of lessons. I’d like to touch on a couple of them now.\n\nOne lesson is that responding effectively during times of crisis may require innovative and targeted policy tools. As the crisis arose, we first used our traditional tools, substantially cutting the federal funds rate and lending to banks through our discount window. However, we lowered the funds rate to zero—as far as it can go—and still were facing frozen credit markets and severely deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. We thus turned to nontraditional tools to clear up the choke points. These included providing liquidity directly to nonbank financial institutions, and supporting a number of short-term credit markets. We also purchased additional medium- and long-term Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and the debt of government-sponsored enterprises. These purchases further reduced long-term interest rates.\n\nThese nontraditional actions helped us avoid what easily could have been an even more severe economic contraction. Of course, in the future it would be best to reduce the chances of facing financial crises in the first place by better protecting the economy from systemic financial risks. Another important lesson is that to be most effective, financial market supervision needs to be based on prospective economic conditions and applied at the same time across the range of institutions. This is an essential aspect of an approach known as horizontal macroprudential regulation. Such an approach was taken during the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (what we called the SCAP). In the popular press this was better known as the bank stress tests. This was an important effort undertaken in the spring of 2009 that went a long way toward stabilizing and restoring trust in the banking system.\n\nDuring SCAP, the Fed and other regulators worked with the 19 largest bank holding companies to evaluate the banks’ capital adequacy under two macroeconomic scenarios. One was a baseline that embodied the expectations of most professional forecasters at the time. The other was a more adverse scenario, which ended up being closer to how the economy actually performed. As part of the exercise, banks’ assets were grouped into several buckets—categories such as First-Lien Mortgages, Junior Mortgages, Commercial Real Estate loans, etc. Both the banks and the SCAP staff of more than 150 examiners, economists, accountants, and other bank supervision specialists were asked to evaluate how these assets would perform under the two scenarios. Comparing the different assessments and working through them led to a much better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the leading bank holding companies.\n\nIn the end, the results indicated which institutions would need additional capital to cover their losses and maintain good capital ratios in the worse-than-expected macroeconomic environment. With this information in hand, the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) compelled institutions that fell short of this common benchmark to increase their capital. And they did. The information made public after the SCAP helped private investors make more confident valuations of the banks. Nearly all banks then were able to raise new capital on public equity markets without drawing on additional government funds.\n\nI see a number of benefits to making similar macroprudential stress tests routine. Such horizontal cross-bank reviews of balance sheets and risk exposures can identify potential systemic risks that might escape an institution-by-institution analysis. Furthermore, they provide a ready way for supervisory reviews and actions to respond to the latest information on macroeconomic developments. In addition, going forward, we might consider dynamic capital standards that would require banks to build their capital base during periods of strong economic growth and high bank profitability, and let banks draw down their capital cushions during downturns when profits and capital tend to be more scarce.\n\nSuch proactive bank supervision requires collaboration between economists and regulators. The Federal Reserve has many well-trained and experienced economists gathering intelligence and analyzing incoming data to prepare the Federal Reserve System’s Governors and Bank presidents for their monetary policy decisions. I believe that the same macroeconomic insights can help promote financial stability by substantially improving regulators’ ability to identify and assess risks that are relevant to a range of financial institutions. This was demonstrated during the SCAP and this approach will be applied to other supervisory efforts.\n\nAt the same time, we have well-trained and experienced bank examiners who can offer sound judgments on the creditworthiness of financial institutions’ balance sheets. Such supervisory information can and does make a valuable contribution to monetary policy analysis. For a number of years, we at the Chicago Fed have included information on banks’ financial condition and lending activity from our staff in Supervision and Regulation in our regular preparation for monetary policy meetings. Since a recovery in bank lending capacity and inclination will be an important indicator of self-sustaining momentum in the recovery and of the appropriate time to adjust monetary policy, this information is crucial now more than ever.\n\nJust a minute ago, I used the term macroprudential regulation. This is part of a shift in our philosophy spurred by the crisis. Since Congress created the Federal Reserve System in 1913, our approach to preventing financial crises has relied on the microprudential supervision and regulation of individual banks. In theory, ensuring sound lending standards and adequate capitalization on a bank-by-bank basis would reassure depositors that their money was safe and prevent panics. Such panics were all too common in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and were important factors leading to the formation of the Fed. If a problem bank slipped through this regulatory safety net, we could use our powers as the lender of last resort to prevent its weakness from contaminating a broader range of institutions. And, if there were macroeconomic consequences, then monetary policy could be eased to mitigate the overall effects on the economy.\n\nOf course, as Chairman Bernanke and other experts on the Great Depression have noted, the 1930s Fed failed to use these tools well enough. But from then until the current episode, this approach appeared to suffice, even as our financial system became more dependent on nonbank financial intermediaries, such as broker–dealers, hedge funds, and other institutions beyond the regulatory reach of the Fed and the other banking regulators. Nevertheless, the scale and scope of the past few years’ events have exposed the weaknesses of a bank-by-bank regulatory approach to guarding against the macroeconomic risks stemming from financial instability.\n\nOne highly visible characteristic of our recent financial instability was the bubble that arose in the housing market and its subsequent collapse. Now, in the aftermath of that bubble’s collapse, there are increasing calls for central banks to be more proactive in responding to signs that an asset bubble may have emerged. This is often described as an imperative to “lean against potential bubbles,” meaning that the central bank should act to lower asset prices that, according to some benchmark, seem unusually high. Now not all financial crises arise from bubbles; the implosion of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) following the Russian bond default is a case in point, so a policy of leaning against bubbles is at best incomplete. Moreover, there are good reasons to think that using one of the traditional monetary policy tools—namely, adjusting the short-term policy interest rate—to lean against a potential bubble could be ineffective and maybe even counterproductive. One argument is that interest rate policy is too blunt of a tool to effectively prick bubbles—it cannot be targeted precisely, and thus will affect other financial and macroeconomic variables beyond just the set of asset prices in question. A second argument is that the typical changes in interest rates that a central bank might contemplate are likely to be too small to produce big changes in asset prices. I continue to find these two arguments quite persuasive, which is why at this point I think that well-structured regulatory policy provides the most promise in protecting the economy from financial crisis.\n\nI’d like to conclude at this point, but I hope you’ll recall that the answers to our three questions about recovery, inflation, and the financial crisis were yes, no, and we’ve learned a lot. Giving shorter answers to these questions is certainly easy and often necessary, but always frustrating. Today, more than at any time in recent memory, people want to know about the Federal Reserve, the things we do and think about, and how we put the pieces together to create a picture of the current economy. We’re doing our best to satisfy that demand by providing as much information as we can to business people and bankers, members of Congress, the media, and, most important, consumers and the public.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to be with you today. I look forward to your questions.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nThank you for inviting me to share my thoughts about the economy and the financial circumstances we are currently facing. About a month ago I was in New York to discuss monetary policy in light of financial market conditions. As part of a very lively discussion, the group addressed the question of whether the Federal Reserve had appropriate tools to address financial market disruptions. Since that time, we have seen ongoing turmoil in financial markets as well as indicators of weakening real activity, and the Fed has responded by lowering the fed funds rate and by taking a number of innovative steps to target liquidity conditions in financial markets.\n\nIn the course of my remarks today, I will address how I have approached policymaking in this challenging environment. I will then go on to discuss current economic conditions and our expectations for future developments in light of the policies that we have implemented since August. As always, these are my own views and not those of the FOMC or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nDuring both normal times and periods of financial stress, monetary policy decisions depend on the prospects for our mandated policy goals of stable prices and maximum employment. Fortunately, periods of financial stress are relatively rare in economies with strong commitments to price stability and low variability in economic activity. During normal times, the conduct of monetary policy will account for financial conditions as part of our standard evaluation of macroeconomic prospects, and the usual approaches to policy generally serve us quite well. However, during the rare periods of emerging or even actual financial stress, policy actions that are more directly related to the changing circumstances in financial markets may need to be taken. Even in such cases, monetary policy must focus on our macroeconomic goals over the medium term. But now the weighing of risks to growth and inflation must also carefully account for the risk that poorly functioning financial markets will disrupt real economic activity.\n\nWhen thinking about policy adjustments during normal times, a useful benchmark is the line of research on policy rules pioneered by John Taylor. This research indicates that most historical policy actions have been systematic responses to changes in the prospects for our goal variables of output growth, employment, and inflation. The main ideas are the systematic response component, and that particular rules are benchmarks for typical policy. Financial developments typically play a role in these systematic responses through the normal effects of changes in the funds rate on other credit conditions that affect the real economy.\n\nOf course, even Taylor's research points out that periods of financial stress may require policy responses that differ from the usual prescriptions. It's not that we downgrade our focus on the policy goals. It is that during these times we often are highly uncertain about how unusual financial market conditions will influence inflation and economic activity. In some cases, the baseline outlook may be only modestly affected by these conditions, but there may be risks of substantial spillovers that could lead to persistent declines in credit intermediation capacity or large declines in wealth. These in turn would reduce business and household spending. In such cases, policy may take out insurance against these adverse risks and move the policy rate more than the usual prescriptions of the Taylor Rule. If the downside spillovers do materialize, then policy may have to be recalibrated further.\n\nPart of our job as a central bank is to properly price these insurance premiums against the achievement of maximum employment and price stability over the medium term. And if further policy adjustments become necessary, they need to take into account the insurance that is already in place. In addition, when risks subside, promptly moving policy to appropriate levels will reiterate and reinforce our commitment to our fundamental policy goals.\n\nNow, let me discuss how I see financial markets and financial stability fitting into our policy goals. There is no analogy in financial markets to macroeconomic price stability. The prices of financial products may change quite substantially when new information arrives. Indeed, one of the most important activities of financial markets is price discovery—the efficient assimilation of all available information into asset values. This promotes the appropriate allocation of capital among competing demands and supports maximum sustainable growth. And it is this efficient functioning of markets that is our concern with regard to financial stability.\n\nMost of the time, monetary policy and financial markets intersect directly at our primary policy tool, the federal funds rate. To alter the trajectory of inflation and economic growth toward their goals, changes in the federal funds rate directly alter short-term risk-free rates of interest. Perceptions of our willingness and ability to adjust future policy then may also alter risk premiums in fixed-income markets and result in a change in the cost of financial credit to numerous other borrowers.\n\nWhen the economy is weak and we lower rates to stimulate activity, projects that previously had too much risk relative to their expected return become more attractive for two reasons: The future returns may look better, and the financing costs are lower. And this may be a good thing if, for example, it can help stimulate an economy that is mired in a situation where overcautious businesses or households are holding back on investment and spending.\n\nAs an aside, gauging the appropriate level of caution by businesses and households at any given time is difficult. Simply observing decisions and investments as they are made is not enough. For example, in an environment where uncertainty is high and market liquidity is low, only investment projects that reduce the overall risk profile of the firm or that have a very high probability of success may seem worthwhile. Of course, in the end, the investment strategy may turn out to be more cautious than had been understood ex ante . The greater caution could be due to overly negative assessments of the size of the investment payoffs, or the level of diversification achieved by the portfolio as the returns to the various investments turn out to be less correlated than had been feared and market conditions normalize.\n\nNow, let me return to how policy can deal with financial disruptions. At times, adjusting the federal funds rate may not be enough to address the special circumstances we face in financial markets, particularly with regard to liquidity and the smooth functioning of markets. When markets are illiquid, uncertainty about asset values is large. In these circumstances, lenders are often unwilling to accept hard-to-value and illiquid assets as collateral, and as a result, market participants find it increasingly difficult to convert these illiquid, but otherwise sound, assets into cash or cash-like instruments. This in turn complicates the process of price discovery, increases uncertainty, and poses additional risks to real economic activity. Our recent policy innovations have been designed to address these effects of illiquidity directly.\n\nWe have several ways to add liquidity to the economy in addition to normal open market operations: the discount window, extended to term borrowing, and the new and now expanded Term Auction Facility, as well as foreign exchange swaps to help enhance liquidity abroad. In these operations, we accept collateral others see as less readily marketable. I should note that we apply the standard discount window \"haircuts\" in our treatment of the collateral.\n\nMore recently, the establishment of the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) extended the term of the existing dealer securities lending program from overnight to 28 days and expanded the set of acceptable collateral. On March 16, we created a lending facility to extend overnight credit directly to primary dealers. This facility, known as the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, or PDCF, will be in place for at least six months and may be renewed as conditions warrant. These loans would be collateralized by a broad range of investment-grade debt securities, again with appropriate \"haircuts.\" Since the primary dealers include some nondepository institutions, the PDCF required the Fed to invoke its authority under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to lend to nonbanks in \"unusual and exigent circumstances,\" when the borrower is not able to \"secure adequate credit accommodations from other banking institutions.\" The Fed's policy actions in mid-March represented the first invocation of this authority since the Great Depression.\n\nTogether these policy actions expand our role by providing liquidity in exchange for sound but less liquid securities. These policy innovations share important features of increasing both the term and the quantity of our lending and making additional quantities of highly liquid Treasury securities available to financial intermediaries. This is intended to reduce uncertainty among financial institutions and allow them to meet the liquidity needs of their clients.\n\nWhile these policy actions represent major innovations in practice, they are in the spirit of the oldest traditions of central banking. As described by Walter Bagehot in his 1873 treatise Lombard Street , the job of the central bank is to \"lend freely, against good collateral\" whenever there is a shortage of liquidity in markets.\n\nReview of the Current Economic Situation\n\nLet me now turn to our assessment of the current economic situation and how the policy actions I've been discussing could impact the outlook going forward.\n\nIn assessing the extent of the current slowdown, I find it useful to look at an index we developed at the Chicago Fed several years ago to summarize the information in a large number of monthly indicators of economic activity. The index is the Chicago Fed National Activity Index, or CFNAI. An index value of zero is consistent with trend growth in overall GDP. The three-month moving average of the CFNAI was -0.87 in February, suggesting little or no economic growth over the last few months.\n\nThese challenges are evident in other recent indicators as well. The labor market, for example, weakened substantially in February with overall nonfarm payroll employment dropping 63,000 and private employment falling by 101,000. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.8 percent, but this was due to a drop in the labor force.\n\nConsumption growth is also below its long-run average, growing at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 and softening further early this year. Slower income growth, falling consumer sentiment, high food and energy prices, lower housing and equity wealth, and tighter credit conditions are all restraining consumer activity and are likely to do so for at least the near term.\n\nGrowth in business investment likely is moderating as well, reflecting tighter credit conditions and less need to expand capacity in a slower economic environment. However, some impetus to demand should come from advances in high-tech equipment. One plus for recovery is that inventory-sales ratios remain low. This suggests that any inventory corrections may be limited.\n\nAnd a bright spot has been net exports. The weaker dollar (down 30 percent since 2002) and continued growth abroad has kept exports growing at a healthy rate. We have seen notable contributions to growth from the declining trade deficit in 2007, and prospects are good for additional contributions as we move through 2008.\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, our outlook at the Chicago Fed is for weakness in real GDP this year, particularly in the first half of the year. However, we think conditions will improve in the second half of the year.\n\nA number of factors will likely hold back activity for some time. The strains on credit intermediation and financial balance sheets mean that credit conditions will likely restrict spending. The large overhang of unsold homes will continue to restrain residential investment. Greater caution on the part of businesses and consumers will likely limit increases in their discretionary expenditures as well. Because financial issues are being worked out against the backdrop of a soft economy, we also have to recognize the risk that interactions between the two might reinforce the weakness in the economy.\n\nNonetheless, other factors point to improvement later in the year. We have lowered the federal funds rate by 300 basis points since September. At 2.25 percent, the current federal funds rate is accommodative and should support stronger growth. Indeed, because monetary policy works with a lag, the effects of last fall's rate cuts are probably just beginning to be felt, and the cumulative declines should do more to promote growth going forward.\n\nThe effects of the fiscal stimulus bill also are likely to boost spending in the second and third quarters of 2008.\n\nIn addition, there is productivity. Productivity is the fundamental determinant of growth in the longer run—it determines how we can turn labor and capital inputs into the goods and services we consume and invest. The good news here is that, while it is not as robust as it was in the late 1990s and early this decade, the underlying trend in productivity in the U.S. economy is still solid. This trend provides a sound base for production and income generation to move forward over the longer haul.\n\nThe economy's inherent resiliency and internal adjustment mechanisms will also work to support growth. One part of the internal adjustment process centers on housing. As house prices fall, more buyers will find it worthwhile to enter the market. Eventually, price adjustments will stabilize supply and demand, and the drag from residential construction on the economy will subside. In the current situation, another important part of the internal adjustment process is the work the financial sector is doing in \"price discovery,\" that is, the process of determining the proper valuation of assets in light of changes in their expected cash flows and risks to these flows. In addition, intermediaries will do more work in restoring their balance sheets. Together, these activities will eventually reduce strains on the real economy from financial conditions. While there are ongoing challenges, this process has and will be facilitated by our recent initiatives to bolster liquidity and promote orderly market functioning.\n\nAlthough most of the recent concern about the U.S. economy has been focused on growth, we must also be mindful of inflationary pressures. The news here has been somewhat disappointing. We have experienced large increases in food and energy prices, and other commodity prices are high. In addition, we are hearing numerous anecdotes of firms passing on cost increases to their downstream customers, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen. The recent numbers on core inflation—that is, inflation excluding food and energy—have also moved up some over the past several months. Core PCE inflation is now at 2.2 percent—a higher rate than I would like to see in the long run.\n\nI want to emphasize here that, while we often talk about inflation in terms of the core measure, we are concerned about maintaining the purchasing power over all of the goods and services consumed by households. Accordingly, our goal of price stability must be defined in terms of total inflation. Traditionally, we have found it useful to concentrate on the core measure because it gave us a less noisy reading of longer-run trends in inflation; in turn, this reflected the tendency for food and energy prices to be volatile in the short run, but to generally average out to the same as core over the medium term. However, if outsized increases in food and energy prices persist, then core becomes a less useful medium-term guide to inflation trends. Furthermore, persistent food and energy price increases will find their way into inflation expectations, which in turn would boost core measures. So the recent developments in food and energy prices are a concern that deserves careful monitoring.\n\nThat said, our forecast is for inflation to moderate over the next two years with a leveling out of energy and commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization due to the slower pace of economic activity. Still, our uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased, and we will continue to monitor inflation developments very carefully.\n\nTo conclude, it is important to remember that the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate—working to foster financial conditions that help the economy obtain maximum sustainable employment and price stability. As the Committee noted in the policy statement following the March FOMC meeting, though downside risks to growth remain, the policy actions taken in March, in combination with earlier moves, should help to promote moderate growth over time and moderate the risks to economic activity. Looking ahead, my policy views will depend on the evolution of these risks, as well as how developments influence the price stability component of our dual mandate over the medium term.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

    "text": "I would like to thank the Corridor Business Journal for inviting me to speak today. I appreciate events like this for two reasons. First, it’s an opportunity for me to share my perspective on the economy. And second, having the chance to spend a day in Iowa is a great way for me to learn more about the regional economy, specifically business conditions in this area.\n\nI’ve been doing a number of events like this over the past few months. And no matter where I am speaking I find myself being asked the same three questions over and over again. So for my prepared remarks today, I’d like to address those big questions about the economy. Afterwards, I’ll also give you an opportunity to ask some questions of your own.\n\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet’s begin with the question I am asked more frequently than any other: Is the recession really over? In a narrow, technical sense, the short answer is yes. Many broad indicators of economic activity are increasing as we would expect in the early stages of a recovery. Nonetheless, I keep hearing the question because for many households and businesses it does not yet feel like much of a recovery. Unemployment remains very high, and many businesses are still producing and selling much less than they did two years ago. I think what people really want to know is when will we make significant progress in returning unemployment and other measures of economic health to more normal levels? We appear to be moving in that direction, but there is much work to be done.\n\nLet me elaborate a little on those points. After falling for four consecutive quarters, real gross domestic product (GDP), our broadest measure of economic output, increased at a 2-1/4 percent rate in the third quarter of last year. In addition, growth appears to have accelerated in the fourth quarter—some analysts are even expecting growth to top 5 percent. A portion of this improvement reflects the effects of government stimulus spending. But private demand is beginning to firm up as well. For example, in the automobile industry, which was hit especially hard by the recession, sales have continued to increase in recent months even after the cash-for-clunkers program ended. In other industries, many firms that cut production and inventories very aggressively during the recession are now dialing back their inventory liquidation. The latest data on manufacturers’ orders have been more positive, both for materials and parts and for capital equipment. Demand from abroad is also increasing; in particular, the emerging-market economies are showing renewed vigor that should benefit U.S. exporters.\n\nIn the housing market, the news has been mixed. Sales of new homes and housing starts stopped falling early last year and have been bouncing along without much of a trend over the past several months. Over the same period, sales of existing homes have increased a good deal. Subsidies for first-time home buyers were a factor. But they were not the whole story. The declines in home prices that earlier precipitated the financial crisis are now attracting buyers, as are low mortgage rates. Sadly, many of these sales are for foreclosed homes, but at least they are now moving on the market. These gains in sales have helped to substantially reduce the overhang of unsold homes, which should set the stage for a gradual recovery in residential construction.\n\nMost forecasters also expect only a gradual recovery in consumer spending. In part, this is because the drop in home prices and the fall in the stock market during the height of the crisis reduced household wealth. It’s also because the availability of household credit has tightened. In addition, the unemployment rate currently is at 10 percent, and for states in the Federal Reserve’s Seventh District, it was 11 percent last November. With such a depressed labor market, workers are seeing little growth in wages and salaries. So, with credit tight and households needing to repair their balance sheets, consumer spending will gain momentum only as people get back to work.\n\nEmployment is often the last piece of the puzzle to fall into place during a recovery. This will certainly be true this time. Many businesses slashed payrolls during the recession, and going forward, many are hoping to keep staffing levels lean. Indeed, even though output was increasing, employment still fell substantially during the second half of 2009. Toward the end of the year, however, the pace of job loss moderated significantly. Some of the businesses that cut their payrolls most deeply during the recession have begun to rehire workers. Others have accommodated recent increases in demand by hiring temporary workers. Looking ahead, most employers are very cautious about hiring at this time, given the uncertainty over the pace of the recovery. But I think that many businesses already are finding they can take lean production only so far. These firms should be ready to expand permanent hiring once they see clearer signs of sustained increases in demand.\n\nThe picture with regard to financing conditions is complex. On the plus side, more and more, financial markets are functioning well without the need for ongoing government support. As a result, large firms are able to borrow at reasonable spreads, both short-term in commercial paper markets and long-term in corporate bond markets. On the down side, the availability of bank credit remains a significant headwind for many small- and medium-sized companies. Some of the decline in bank lending that we saw last year reflects weak demand for loans by businesses wary of taking on new debt burdens in an uncertain economic environment. But at least some of the reduced lending arises from banks’ tighter lending standards. These tighter standards, in turn, appear to reflect banks’ concern over their capital levels and also the credit quality of borrows. More generally, credit flows are being reduced because both borrowers and lenders are still dealing with losses from the recession, especially the busts in residential and commercial real estate. I expect banking conditions to improve, but this is likely to take some time.\n\nLooking ahead, restrictive bank credit, along with business and household caution, will continue to restrain the recovery’s strength. Nevertheless I expect these headwinds to abate as we move through 2010. We at the Chicago Fed expect GDP growth to average 3 to 3-1/2 percent in 2010. Such growth is only slightly above our estimate of the economy’s potential growth rate, which means unemployment will likely decline only modestly in 2010.\n\nOf course, the recovery could exceed these expectations. The growth we’re expecting is modest for a recovery following a deep recession, which is typically followed by a sharp increase in economic activity. For example, GDP growth in the year and a half following the recession of 1981 and 1982 averaged about 8 percent. While that’s not the case now, some of the recent data have been a good deal better than expected. Increases in confidence could turn into higher spending sooner than we think. And an important longer-term factor is that productivity growth has remained strong. Technology continues to advance and firms continue to create new products and find new ways to produce more efficiently. Such productivity gains will result in higher incomes and improving standards of living over the longer term.\n\nWell, that was a very long answer to a very short question about the recovery. The second question I’m often asked comes in two versions. The first version is: Isn’t inflation about to go through the roof? The second version is: Isn’t inflation about to fall further—aren’t we looking at deflation? The answer is no in both cases: I think inflation will remain relatively stable. But the fact that I get these completely different questions highlights the degree of uncertainty currently underlying the inflation outlook. Surveys of consumer inflation expectations, professional forecasters’ projections, and the implied inflation forecasts from the market for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities all see inflation running close to current rates over the medium term. But these stable inflation expectations balance out some important crosscurrents. I’m reminded of the old joke that says if you put two economists in a room you’ll get three opinions. Well, that’s especially true now.\n\nThe current low rates of resource utilization strongly point to lower inflation. The 10 percent unemployment rate and the still very low rates of manufacturing capacity utilization are factors that reduce cost pressures and make firms less able to push through price increases. In fact, these factors have significantly contributed to a recent decline in inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of core inflation—the deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, excluding food and energy —has fallen from 2-3/4 percent in August 2008 to 1-1/2 percent in November 2009. That is a large decline for a relatively slow moving data series.\n\nThe people who press me on higher inflation point to the Fed’s expanded balance sheet and the associated large increase in what economists call the monetary base. We all know that too much money chasing too few goods will generate inflation. But, currently, most of the increase in the monetary base is sitting idly in bank reserves—and because banks are not lending those reserves, they are not generating spending pressure. Of course, leaving the current highly accommodative monetary policy in place for too long would eventually fuel inflationary pressures.\n\nWith core inflation just below 1-1/2 percent, we see the opposing forces of resource gaps and accommodative monetary policy as roughly balancing out over the medium term. Resource slack could result in core PCE inflation coming down a bit more in 2010 and 2011. As resource slack abates in a recovering economy, I expect inflation to move up to about 1-3/4 percent in 2012.\n\nTo achieve this outlook, monetary policy cannot be passive. A large challenge facing policymakers over the next couple of years will be judging the appropriate timing and pace for reducing accommodation. On the one hand, removing too much accommodation prematurely could choke off the recovery. On the other hand, as I noted, if the Fed leaves the current level of accommodation in place too long, inflationary pressures eventually will build. The Fed is preparing for these decisions by carefully monitoring business activity and remaining alert for signs of incipient inflation. In addition, the FOMC is making sure that it has the technical tools it will need when it decides to reduce monetary accommodation. Overall, I am confident that monetary policy will bring and keep inflation near my guideline of 2 percent over the medium term.\n\nNeedless to say, the crisis and recession have kept us busy. But we have also devoted a good deal of energy to reflecting on events of the past several years. This is, in large part, because of the importance of the last question I have been asked recently: What have you at the Federal Reserve learned about how to guard against future financial crises again creating such a major recession? There are, of course, a number of lessons. I’d like to touch on a couple of them now.\n\nOne lesson is that responding effectively during times of crisis may require innovative and targeted policy tools. As the crisis arose, we first used our traditional tools, substantially cutting the federal funds rate and lending to banks through our discount window. However, we lowered the funds rate to zero—as far as it can go—and still were facing frozen credit markets and severely deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. We thus turned to nontraditional tools to clear up the choke points. These included providing liquidity directly to nonbank financial institutions, supporting a number of short-term credit markets, and reducing long-term interest rates further—by purchasing additional medium- and long-term Treasury bonds, as well as mortgage-backed securities, and the debt of government-sponsored enterprises.\n\nThese nontraditional actions helped us avoid what easily could have been an even more severe economic contraction. Of course, in the future it would be best to reduce the chances of having financial crises by better protecting the economy from systemic financial risks.\n\nAnother important lesson is that to be most effective, financial market supervision needs to be based on prospective economic conditions, applied at the same time across the range of institutions, an essential aspect of an approach known as horizontal macroprudential regulation. Such an approach was taken during the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, what we called the SCAP. In the popular press this was better known as the bank stress tests. This was an important effort undertaken in the spring of 2009 that went a long way toward stabilizing and restoring trust in the banking system.\n\nDuring SCAP, the Fed and other regulators worked with the 19 largest bank holding companies to evaluate the banks’ capital adequacy under two macroeconomic scenarios. One was a baseline that embodied the expectations of most professional forecasters at the time. The other was a more adverse scenario, which ended up being closer to how the economy actually performed. As part of the exercise, banks’ assets were grouped into several buckets—categories such as First-Lien Mortgages, Junior Mortgages, Commercial Real Estate loans, etc. Both the banks and the SCAP staff of more than 150 examiners, economists, accountants, and other bank supervision specialists were asked to evaluate how these assets would perform under the two scenarios. Comparing and working through the different assessments led to a much better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the leading bank holding companies.\n\nIn the end, the results indicated which institutions would need additional capital to cover their losses and maintain good capital ratios in the worse-than-expected macroeconomic environment. With this information in hand, the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) compelled institutions that fell short of this common benchmark to increase their capital. And they did. The information made public after the SCAP helped private investors make more confident valuations of the banks. Nearly all banks then were able to raise new capital on public equity markets without drawing on additional government funds.\n\nI see a number of benefits to making similar macroprudential stress tests routine. Such horizontal cross-bank reviews of balance sheets and risk exposures can identify potential systemic risks that might escape an institution-by-institution analysis. Furthermore, they provide a ready way for supervisory reviews and actions to respond to the latest information on macroeconomic developments. In addition, going forward, we might consider dynamic capital standards that would require banks to build their capital base during periods of strong economic growth and high bank profitability, and let banks utilize/draw down their capital cushions during downturns when profits and capital tend to be scarcer.\n\nSuch proactive bank supervision requires collaboration between economists and regulators. The Federal Reserve has many well-trained and experienced economists gathering intelligence and analyzing incoming data to prepare the Federal Reserve System’s Governors and Bank presidents for their monetary policy decisions. I believe that the same macroeconomic insights can help promote financial stability by substantially improving regulators’ ability to identify and assess risks that are relevant to a range of financial institutions. This was demonstrated during the SCAP and this approach will be applied to other supervisory efforts.\n\nAt the same time, we have well-trained and experienced bank examiners who can offer sound judgments on the creditworthiness of financial institutions’ balance sheets. Such supervisory information can and does make a valuable contribution to monetary policy analysis. For a number of years, we at the Chicago Fed have included information on banks’ financial condition and lending activity from our staff in Supervision and Regulation in our regular preparation for monetary policy meetings. Since a recovery in bank lending capacity and inclination will be an important indicator of self-sustaining momentum in the recovery and of the appropriate time to adjust monetary policy, this information is crucial now more than ever.\n\nJust a minute ago, I used the term macroprudential regulation. This is part of a shift in our philosophy spurred by the crisis. Since Congress created the Federal Reserve System in 1914, our approach to preventing financial crises has relied on the microprudential supervision and regulation of individual banks. In theory, ensuring sound lending standards and adequate capitalization on a bank-by-bank basis would reassure depositors that their money was safe and prevent panics. Such panics were all too common in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, and were important factors leading to the formation of the Fed. If a problem bank slipped through this regulatory safety net, we could use our powers as the lender of last resort to prevent its weakness from contaminating a broader range of institutions. And, if there were macroeconomic consequences, then monetary policy could be eased to mitigate the overall effects on the economy.\n\nOf course, as Chairman Bernanke and other experts on the Great Depression have noted, the Fed failed to use these tools well enough during the 1930s. But from then until the current episode this approach appeared to suffice, even as our financial system became more dependent on nonbank financial intermediaries, such as broker–dealers, hedge funds, and other institutions beyond the regulatory reach of the Fed and the other banking regulators. Nevertheless, the scale and scope of the past few years’ events have exposed the weaknesses of a bank-by-bank regulatory approach to guarding against the macroeconomic risks stemming from financial instability.\n\nOne highly visible characteristic of our recent financial instability was the bubble that arose in the housing market and its subsequent collapse. Now, in the aftermath of that bubble’s collapse, there are increasing calls for central banks to be more proactive in responding to signs that an asset bubble may have emerged. This is often described as an imperative to “lean against potential bubbles,” meaning that the central bank should act to lower asset prices that, according to some benchmark, seem unusually high. Now not all financial crises arise from bubbles; the implosion of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) following the Russian bond default is a case in point, so a policy of leaning against bubbles is at best incomplete. Moreover, there are good reasons to think that using one of the traditional monetary policy tools—namely, adjusting the short-term policy interest rate—to lean against a potential bubble could be ineffective and maybe even counterproductive. One argument is that interest rate policy is too blunt of a tool to effectively prick bubbles—it cannot be targeted precisely, and thus will affect other financial and macroeconomic variables beyond just the set of asset prices in question. A second argument is that the typical changes in interest rates that a central bank might contemplate are likely to be too small to produce big changes in asset prices. I continue to find these two arguments quite persuasive, which is why at this point I think that that well-structured regulatory policy provides the most promise in protecting the economy from financial crisis.\n\nI’d like to conclude at this point, but I hope you’ll recall that the answers to our three questions about recovery, inflation, and the financial crisis were yes, no, and we’ve learned a lot. Giving shorter answers to these questions is certainly easy and often necessary, but always frustrating. Today, more than at any time in recent memory, people want to know about the Federal Reserve, the things we do and think about and how we put the pieces together to create a picture of the current economy. We’re doing our best to satisfy that demand by providing as much information as we can to business people and bankers, members of Congress and the media, and, most important, consumers and the public.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to be with you today. I look forward to your questions.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nThank you, Jeff Mayers [president of WisPolitics.com, WisBusiness.com] for that introduction. And thanks to the Wisconsin Bankers Association for inviting me to speak. I'm delighted to be here to share my thoughts on the economy during this challenging period. As always, these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday we find ourselves in the midst of a serious recession—one that may end up being more like the large downturns in the 1970s and 1980s than the more moderate contractions of 1990 and 2001. I want to use my time today to discuss briefly how we got to this point, the outlook going forward, and the policy challenges that will be confronting the Fed as we move through these troubling times.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nLast Friday the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the cumulative job loss in December alone was over 550,000 jobs. Since the beginning of the recession in December 2007, 2.6 million jobs have been lost, 1.9 million in the last four months. In December 2007 the unemployment rate was just 4.9 percent; it ended 2008 at 7.2 percent. The latest data on household and business spending are no more encouraging. Overall economic activity has declined substantially over the past six months despite aggressive moves by the Fed that lowered the fed funds rate to near zero and tripled the size of our balance sheet, as well as major actions by the Treasury and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) aimed at addressing difficulties in credit markets.\n\nIn 2007 housing prices peaked, mortgage defaults rose, and strains began to appear in the market for securitized mortgages. The problems in mortgages spilled over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants reassessed risk, and the prices of many assets declined. This cascading process of re-pricing had a detrimental impact on the liquidity and capital positions of a wide range of financial institutions in the United States and around the world.\n\nBy the spring and summer of 2008, the tightening of credit conditions had begun to weigh on business spending, and by the fall, household spending was affected as well. Spending was also reduced by the protracted weakness in housing markets, declines in financial wealth, and substantial increases in prices for energy and other commodities. These factors contributed to negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the third quarter of 2008.\n\nAs we moved through last year, many financial firms began reporting severe losses. Some institutions—notably Bear Stearns, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, and Merrill Lynch—appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by large banks. In the case of Bear Stearns, this occurred with assistance from the Fed. In the case of Lehman Brothers, the losses were especially large, and no buyer came forward at suitable terms. As a result, Lehman had to declare bankruptcy. At about the same time, American International Group (AIG), an important provider of large credit default insurance during this period, was unable to fund its liabilities. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury were able to arrange a package of loans and guarantees for AIG in order to support the functioning of markets that had important exposures to these credit default swaps and related instruments.\n\nAnd as we moved through the summer, ongoing developments in the financial markets dealt a series of blows to market confidence. The problems with such major institutions intensified financial market participants' concerns about the ability of their counterparties to repay debt. Money market mutual funds, important suppliers of funds to short-term credit markets, were exposed to potentially significant losses, and many investors began making withdrawals. To meet the redemptions, many money market funds liquidated assets into an already depressed market. As perceived price risk and redemption risk increased dramatically, there was a marked reduction in the maturity of commercial paper and other debt being rolled through the markets.\n\nAs a consequence of these pressures, even some highly rated firms have found it more difficult and expensive to obtain short-term financing. Some of these firms have been able to tap bank backup lines of credit. But this substitution just pushes the money market difficulties back into the banking system, squeezing out the ability of banks to make other loans.\n\nActions by the Federal Reserve\n\nIn response to these extraordinary events, the Fed has implemented a number of policies aimed at mitigating the problems in the financial system and their potential fallout on the rest of the economy.\n\nFirst, the Fed turned to its traditional monetary policy instruments; that is, it reduced the federal funds rate and the discount rate. The first funds rate cut occurred in September 2007. The initial moves were measured, but they eventually gave way to more aggressive rate cuts. At the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the funds rate was essentially cut to zero—525 basis points lower than when we began.\n\nAlthough the corresponding injections of liquidity helped credit conditions somewhat, it became clear early on that further and alternative extensions of central bank liquidity would be necessary to facilitate market functioning.\n\nThe Fed made a number of substantial changes to the discount window operations since August 2007 to encourage its use as a source of liquidity: We reduced the spread of the discount rate over the federal funds rate from 100 to 25 basis points; we increased the maximum maturity of the loans from overnight to 90 days; and we introduced a new facility that provides loans through auctions to overcome any stigma that was associated with discount window loans. As a result, we have seen a large increase in lending to depository institutions.\n\nEarly in 2008, new market dysfunctions emerged, such as the collapse of the auction rate security market. And then there was the sudden demise of Bear Stearns last March. These episodes clearly indicated that in this strained environment, financial market participants other than depository institutions might face liquidity shortfalls that could have serious, far-ranging repercussions for the economy. This led the Fed to create a number of facilities to directly provide liquidity to nondepository institutions; the Federal Reserve Act grants us such emergency powers when the economy is faced with \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\"\n\nAt first, these measures were aimed at lending to broker-dealers who engage in securities transactions with the Fed and who have a large-scale presence in short-term funding markets. Subsequently, we have introduced lending facilities to help work through the disruptions in the money market mutual fund and commercial paper markets. These programs provide a liquidity backstop for commercial paper and facilitate the sale in secondary markets of a number of instruments held by money market funds. The Fed began to purchase debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. This initiative will help support the flow of credit and lower credit costs in mortgage markets. Indeed, we have already seen a notable reduction in the spreads of conforming mortgages to Treasury bonds since the program has been announced.\n\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in dealing with the crisis. The FDIC increased deposit insurance limits and put in place special facilities to insure other liabilities of depository institutions. Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which authorized the Treasury Department's Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP. This program has so far provided more than $335 billion in capital injections to the financial system to support the lending capacity of banks. 1 And, as you are aware, these capital injections are made through the purchase of preferred stock and also include other features that support the prudent stewardship of taxpayer resources.\n\nIn another joint program, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury established the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. This facility is designed to support the demand for asset-backed securities by reducing the likelihood that future liquidity needs could force holders to sell them into a depressed market. Holder of securities that are bundles of student, consumer, and small businesses loans can borrow from the TALF, using the securities themselves as collateral. TARP funds provide credit protection to the facility.\n\nThe traditional easing of monetary policy and the nontraditional actions by the Federal Reserve, Treasury, and other government agencies all are working to support the functioning of credit markets and reduce financial strains. These actions and the work being done in the private sector to reassess risks and shore up balance sheets will help move us back toward something resembling financial stability. But this will not be an easy process, and it could take some time before financial markets function in a manner that noticeably facilitates the activities of businesses and households. Until they do, we will continue to experience some drag on activity in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy. And as we know too well, spending, production, and job creation all currently are contracting at a disturbing pace.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nLet's now take a look at these recent developments in overall economic activity as well as the outlook for the next few years.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research declared the U.S. economy peaked in December 2007 and subsequently entered into a recession. Overall GDP growth has been choppy, but in the third quarter of 2008, GDP fell at an annual rate of 0.5 percent. Most indicators point to a large contraction in economic activity in the fourth quarter, with many private sector forecasters looking for a drop of 5 percent or more.\n\nAs I stated at the outset, labor markets have deteriorated significantly over the last few months. Weak labor markets have held back growth in real incomes. Along with the financial strains, these factors have led to weak business investment, industrial production, and consumer spending. Indeed, the declines in consumer spending over the past few months have been very large—on par with the drops experienced during the 1990 and 1982 recessions.\n\nThe housing market has continued to deteriorate, with construction, new home sales, and home prices all declining further in recent months. In the business sector, investment in equipment and software continued to contract. Weakening foreign activity and the higher dollar are reducing exports.\n\nOver the last several months we've seen a further pullback in risk-taking in financial markets, spurred in part by the more pessimistic outlook for economic activity. This led to lower equity prices, higher risk spreads, and tighter constraints in credit markets, all of which fed back into a further decline in real activity.\n\nGoing forward, rising unemployment, low levels of consumer sentiment, losses in stock market wealth, declining home values, and restrictive credit conditions are likely to continue to weigh on household spending. Business expenditures are also likely to be held back by a weaker sales outlook and tighter credit conditions. Consequently, real GDP is likely to fall sharply in the first half of 2009. We expect GDP growth to slowly recover over the remainder of the year, reflecting the support from both traditional and nontraditional monetary policies, fiscal policy actions (many of which are yet to be enacted), and progress by the financial markets in working through their difficulties. I expect real GDP to decline for 2009 as a whole and to rise at a pace in the neighborhood of potential growth during 2010. However, this growth will not be strong enough to close the resource gaps emerging over this period. Indeed, the unemployment rate—the main resource gap measure in the labor market—is likely to rise into 2010.\n\nOn the inflation front, headline consumer prices declined in recent months, since energy prices fell sharply and increases in consumer food prices moderated. Falling prices for energy and other commodities, declines in import prices, and the increase in resource utilization slack due to diminished economic activity have resulted in an appreciable reduction in inflationary pressures. These, along with some moderate reductions in inflation expectations, have caused me to reduce my forecasts for both core and overall personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation. I expect core inflation to slow considerably in 2009 and then to edge down further in 2010. My modal forecast is for inflation to level out within the range we generally see as being consistent with price stability, somewhere between 1-1/2 to 2 percent. There is notable risk that inflation will decline below this range in the medium term. We could see more declines in the headline inflation numbers—which includes both food and energy components—in the near term because of declining energy prices. However, I do not currently see much risk of an outright deflationary episode, that is, a period of sustained declines in the prices for a wide range of goods and services.\n\nSome Perspectives on Policy\n\nLet me now turn to the policy picture. The traditional monetary policy action used to combat sluggish economic activity is to lower the fed funds rate. This in turn reduces other borrowing rates and thus stimulates aggregate demand. At its last meeting, the FOMC moved the funds rate down very close to zero. In doing so, we judged that the benefits of these low rates in stimulating demand outweighed the possible adverse effects the low rates might have on the operations of some banks and other financial firms. With the fed funds rate now near zero, we cannot lower it any further. So, going forward, the Committee will have to focus on other ways to impart additional monetary stimulus to the economy.\n\nOne way that monetary policy influences financial and economic activity is through the clarity of our intentions and communications. The manner in which the FOMC communicates policy clearly influences its effectiveness. And expectations of likely future outcomes, including those for monetary policy, obviously matter for decisions made by households and businesses today. In this vein, at a time when near-term inflation is likely to be lower than usual, having an explicit numerical objective for inflation could help keep inflation expectations from falling very far. Such an anchor on inflation expectations would help preserve low real inflation-adjusted interest rates.\n\nAs I discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve has already adopted a number of nonstandard policies that are providing liquidity support to a range of institutions and markets. If credit market functioning does not improve, and if the outlook for economic activity does not begin to show signs of improvement, it may be necessary to use these nontraditional tools further.\n\nFor example, it could be useful to purchase significant quantities of longer-term securities such as agency debt, agency mortgage-backed securities, and Treasury securities to reduce borrowing costs for a range of longer-term instruments. Similarly, possible changes in the size and scope of credit facilities would lower the cost of borrowing in particular targeted markets.\n\nOf course, as economic activity recovers and financial conditions normalize, the use of nontraditional policy tools will have to be scaled back, the size of the balance sheet and level of excess reserves will have to be reduced, and the FOMC will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate. Some of this scaling back will occur naturally as market conditions improve, on account of how these programs have been designed. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities that have been put in place during the financial turmoil.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the U.S. economy continues to face many challenges. The Fed has been proactive in addressing market liquidity stress during the financial crisis—first by using our traditional monetary policy tools and later through our improvised lending facilities. Moving forward, it is important that we be vigilant in monitoring the risks to growth, as well as any risks to the prospects for obtaining price stability. It is also important for us to continue to collaborate with policymakers across the globe in the pursuit of financial stability worldwide. We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance. But the policy actions taken by the Fed and other governmental agencies over the course of the financial crisis, and the effort of the private sector to work through its difficulties, will eventually help support a recovery in economic growth.\n\nYet, undoubtedly, the greatest challenge we face is the enormous uncertainty of our situation. One great feature of being an economist in Chicago is that we benefit from the wisdom of many distinguished scholars at our local universities. An example of such wisdom is an observation made long ago by Robert Lucas, a Nobel Laureate from the University of Chicago: \"As an advice-giving profession, we economists are in way over our heads.\" At any time, this is a sobering and humbling thought to remember. Nevertheless, in the current environment, the pursuit of a range of robust policies in the face of large uncertainties is likely to be most efficacious. A good decision-maker can't place all of his or her policy bets on a single hypothesis when the evidence is still ambiguous.\n\nThe need to act in the presence of ambiguity and such unusual events certainly adds to our policy and communications challenges.\n\nWe need to work very hard to explain the risks that we are facing and the rationale for why we think our policy actions best address those risks. Much digital ink has been spilled in these attempts so far. More is on the way. If ink were fiscal stimulus, we might see a more rapid economic recovery in 2009.\n\nNote\n\n1 TARP has provided $250 billion to financial institutions, $40 billion to AIG, $25 billion to Citigroup, and $20 billion in other lending to institutions (U.S. Treasury Department, 2009, report, January 12).\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. And thank you, Phelps Hoyt [Vice President of the CFA Society of Iowa] for that kind introduction and arranging my visit.\n\nCurrently, we find ourselves in the midst of a serious recession—one that appears headed towards an experience more like the large downturns in the 1970s and 1980s than the moderate contractions of 1990 and 2001. Today I will discuss the events that brought us to this point, the outlook for the economy, and the policy challenges confronting the Fed during these troubling times. I should note that these are, of course, my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nBackground\n\nOver the past 18 months the economy has experienced deteriorating housing markets, large-scale disruptions to our financial services industry, and plummeting consumer and business confidence. These and related developments have resulted in a significant decline in overall spending and production and a rise in the unemployment rate, particularly over the past six months. All of this has occurred despite aggressive actions by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to address difficulties in credit markets and bolster aggregate demand. And as you know, Congress has been working on a fiscal stimulus package, and the Treasury has recommended new proposals to deal with the financial sector problems. I will touch more on these later.\n\nThese certainly are challenging, if not extraordinary, times. How did we get here?\n\nIn 2007 housing prices peaked, mortgage defaults rose, and strains began to appear in the market for securitized mortgages. The problems in mortgages spilled over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants re-assessed risk, and the prices of many assets declined. This cascading process of re-pricing had a detrimental impact on the liquidity and capital positions of a wide range of financial institutions in the United States and around the world.\n\nBy the spring and summer of 2008, the tightening of credit conditions had begun to weigh on business spending. And by the fall, household spending was affected as well. Spending was also reduced by the protracted weakness in housing markets, declines in financial wealth, softening labor markets, and substantial increases in prices for energy and other commodities. These factors contributed to a contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) beginning in the third quarter of 2008.\n\nA series of solvency and liquidity events also occurred during this period. Many financial firms reported severe losses, with big names like Bear Stearns, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group (AIG) all on the list. Some of these firms appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by other financial institutions. In the case of Bear Sterns, this involved assistance from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury also were able to arrange loans and guarantees to AIG in order to avoid large-scale disruptions in markets that had exposures to credit default swaps written by AIG. In contrast, when Lehman Brothers experienced especially large losses last September, no sale or loan support could be made at suitable terms. As a result, they went into bankruptcy.\n\nThese developments intensified financial market participants' concerns over the potential losses on a range of assets as well as the ability of their counterparties to meet contractual obligations. One important sector that was disrupted was the money market fund industry. Money funds are major suppliers of financing to the commercial paper and other short-term credit markets. Worried over losses, investors in money market funds began making redemptions. To meet these, some funds had to liquidate assets into an already depressed market, further lowering the prices of these instruments.\n\nThis process resulted in a marked increase in the cost of issuing all but the safest, shortest maturity of debt that usually rolls through these markets. Even highly rated firms have found it more difficult and expensive to obtain financing. Some have been able to tap bank backup lines of credit. But this substitution just pushes the funding difficulties back into the banking system, squeezing out the ability of banks to make other loans.\n\nActions by the Federal Reserve\n\nIn response to these extraordinary events, the Fed has implemented a number of policies aimed at mitigating the problems in the financial system and their potential fallout on the rest of the economy.\n\nFirst, the Fed turned to its traditional principal monetary policy instrument, the federal funds rate. Since September 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee has lowered the target funds rate 525 basis points, bringing it to essentially zero in December of last year.\n\nAlthough the corresponding injections of broad liquidity helped credit conditions somewhat, it became clear early on that more had to be done to facilitate market functioning.\n\nAt first, we simply made a number of adjustments to make it more attractive for banks to borrow from the discount window—which is the traditional way the Fed lends overnight to depository institutions.\n\nGiven the events of 2008—in which all types of institutions faced liquidity shortfalls—the Fed created a number of facilities to directly provide liquidity to nondepository institutions; the Federal Reserve Act grants us such emergency powers when the economy is faced with \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\"\n\nMost of these facilities have been aimed at the functioning of short-term credit markets. Some lend to broker-dealers that engage in securities transactions with the Fed and have a large-scale presence in short-term funding markets such as the repo market. Others provide a liquidity backstop for commercial paper issuers and facilitate the sale in secondary markets of a number of instruments held by money market funds. As such, these facilities are lending at relatively short maturities—generally not more than 90 days.\n\nMore recent Fed actions, however, have taken some longer-term assets onto our balance sheet. In December, we began purchasing debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). This initiative will help support the flow of credit and lower borrowing costs in mortgage markets.\n\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in dealing with the crisis. The FDIC increased deposit insurance limits and began to offer insurance on some liabilities of eligible depository institutions and financial holding companies. Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which authorized the Treasury Department's Troubled Assets Relief Program, (or TARP). This program has so far provided more than $335 billion in capital injections to the financial system to support the lending capacity of banks.\n\nJust yesterday, Treasury Secretary Geithner outlined the Financial Stability Plan. One element of the plan is aimed at valuing illiquid assets and moving them off of banks' balance sheets. By doing so, this should attract more private capital and ease balance sheet restrictions on banks' lending capacity.\n\nWe have seen a number of indications that the traditional easing of monetary policy and the nontraditional policy actions are beginning to help the functioning of credit markets and reduce financial strains. The spreads on the interest rates charged for interbank lending and on commercial paper relative to the fed funds rate have come down appreciably since October, particularly at the one-month maturity. $156 billion of debt has been issued with FDIC guarantees, facilitating medium-term funding by eligible financial institutions. And the rates on conforming mortgages relative to Treasury bonds have declined since the Fed's GSE purchase program was announced.\n\nThat said, market disruptions clearly remain, and most spreads between private lending rates and comparable-maturity risk-free government debt are still quite elevated relative to where they were before the crisis. Of course, we would not expect spreads and other lending terms to return to those prevailing before the crisis—a period when risk was clearly underpriced. Nevertheless, current spreads and terms seem to be well above where the \"new normal\" will end up.\n\nOver the longer run, we will reach the \"new normal.\" Policy actions and the work being done in the private sector to reassess risks and shore up balance sheets will help move us back toward something resembling financial stability. This will not be an easy process, and it could take time before financial markets function in a manner that fully facilitates the activities of businesses and households. Until they do, we will continue to experience some drag on activity in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nAs we know only too well, the economy currently is contracting at a disturbing pace. Labor markets have deteriorated significantly. The unemployment rate was 4.9 percent when the recession started in December 2007; last month it reached 7.6 percent. Weak labor markets have held back growth in real incomes, and further declines in the stock-market and homes prices have led to marked reductions in household wealth. Slowing foreign activity and the higher dollar are reducing demand for our exports. Although there has been a modest improvement in some credit conditions, overall they still remain tight. The more pessimistic outlook for the economy has reduced everyone's confidence. In turn, we've seen a further pullback in risk-taking by investors, households, and businesses. They are particularly reluctant to take on longer-term investment or spending commitments.\n\nTogether, these factors have led to sharp drop offs in business investment, industrial production, and household spending. Overall output, as measured by real GDP, fell at a 0.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2008 and then dropped at a 3.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Last quarter business fixed investment declined at a 19 percent annualized rate, residential investment fell at a 22.4 percent rate, and consumer spending dropped at a 3.5 percent pace. These are very large declines—on par with those experienced during the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe factors that produced the sharp decline in output in the second half of last year are still in play today. Consequently, I expect real GDP will fall markedly in the first half of 2009. I am currently projecting that GDP will begin to expand some later in 2009, but not enough to offset the declines in the first half of the year. In part, this expected pickup reflects the support from both traditional and nontraditional monetary policies, fiscal actions already taken to address the strains in financial markets, and progress that financial markets themselves make in working through their difficulties. In addition, the new fiscal stimulus package will boost output. However, its full size and impact are still unclear, and our forecast could need some recalibration as we gain knowledge on how the package is affecting the economy. Looking out a bit further, I expect the pace of GDP growth to move back up in the neighborhood of potential as we move through 2010. However, I do not see growth as being strong enough to make much progress in closing resource gaps over this period. Indeed, the unemployment rate—the main resource gap measure in the labor market—is likely to rise into 2010.\n\nOn the inflation front, headline consumer prices have fallen in recent months, and core prices—which exclude the volatile food and energy categories—have changed little. This appreciable reduction in inflationary pressures reflects falling prices for energy and other commodities, declines in import prices, and the increase in resource slack due to diminished economic activity. Looking ahead, futures markets expect some increase in energy prices. However, substantial resource slack and the likelihood of some moderate reduction in inflation expectations should hold back overall price increases. Consequently, I expect additional slowing in core consumer price inflation in 2009 and a further edging down in 2010. Over the longer-run, with appropriate monetary policy, I see both overall and core inflation averaging somewhere into the neighborhood of 2 percent, which is a rate I see as being consistent with price stability. That said, there is notable risk that inflation will remain a good deal below this range in the medium term.\n\nSome Perspectives on Policy\n\nI am now going to turn to some broader perspectives on the policy picture. The traditional monetary policy action used to combat sluggish economic activity is to lower the fed funds rate. This in turn reduces other borrowing rates and thus stimulates aggregate demand.\n\nIn December the FOMC decided to move the funds rate to near zero and two weeks ago we voted to leave it unchanged. With the fed funds rate near zero, we cannot lower it any further. Yet, clearly, the recession, financial distress, and low inflationary pressures call for more policy accommodation. For the Fed, this means that the Committee will have to focus on other ways to impart monetary stimulus to the economy.\n\nOne way that monetary policy influences financial and economic activity is through the clarity of our intentions and communications. Expectations of likely future outcomes, including those for monetary policy, obviously matter for decisions made by households and businesses today. In this vein, at a time when near-term inflation is likely to be lower than usual, endorsing an explicit numerical objective for inflation could help keep inflation expectations from falling very far. Such an anchor on inflation expectations would help preserve low real inflation-adjusted interest rates.\n\nAnother way to increase monetary accommodation is to work to bring down unusual liquidity and risk premia that are raising private and longer-term borrowing costs. As I discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve has already operated in this arena, adopting a number of nonstandard policies that are providing liquidity support to a range of institutions and markets. And, if necessary, such nontraditional tools can be expanded.\n\nIn this regard, in November we announced another joint program with the Treasury, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. And yesterday the Fed announced it is prepared to undertake a substantial expansion of the TALF. Although not yet operational, the TALF should be up and running soon. This temporary facility is designed to support the demand for asset-backed securities by reducing the likelihood that future liquidity needs could force investors to sell into a depressed market. Holders of securities that are bundles of student, consumer, and small businesses loans can borrow from the TALF, using the securities themselves as collateral. Other asset-backed securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, could also be eligible. The terms on these loans are more costly than those seen during more normal times. Thus TALF loans eventually will become unattractive when conditions improve in markets for traditional sources of funding. Large haircuts on the collateral and TARP funds provide the Fed with credit protection on the facility.\n\nAnother feature of the TALF is that its loans are for three years—medium-term loans that are noticeably longer than at our other lending facilities. So, like our GSE purchases, it can directly affect interest rates further out on the yield curve.\n\nI should also note that, as conditions warrant, we will be expanding existing programs. In addition, we are considering the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities, if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.\n\nA common question I hear is: \"What principles guide the implementation of these new initiatives?\"\n\nLet me step back for a second and discuss these programs at a more conceptual level. In a well-functioning financial system, arbitrage moves funds across markets and balances out profit opportunities. It thus aligns term and risk-adjusted returns across markets. This is the reason, for example, why our typical moves to lower the short-term risk-free federal funds rate affect borrowing rates over a large range of maturity and risk structures. In such an environment, we can focus on the size of the liquidity injection instead of the particular segment of the market in which the injection occurs.\n\nBut that is not the case today. There is abundant evidence that arbitrage opportunities remain unexploited. Due to balance-sheet capacity limitations, or because uncertainty and risk aversion are so much higher than normal, participants are largely avoiding markets that are undergoing unusual stress. For example, many student loan payments are guaranteed by the federal government. Despite the guarantees, liquidity disruptions have all but shut down the auction rate security markets that student loan providers had used to obtain a good deal of their funding. Subsequently, they have had substantial difficulty in attracting investors to other types of securities backed by student loans.\n\nOne way of thinking about these developments is that markets have become highly segmented. We do not see funds flowing in to take advantage of apparent profit opportunities with respect to distressed assets. Such an action could ease liquidity pressures in these sectors and help keep some problems from spilling over into solvency concerns.\n\nThe flip side of this segmentation is that liquidity injections aimed directly at a particular distressed market are less likely to leak out to other areas. The injections thus hold open the possibility of improving that market's functioning a good deal, seeding its transition to more normal liquidity and risk valuations. This is the rationale for why our nontraditional policies focus on loans and securities that affect transactions in particular key markets where we see points of stress. But a downside is that markets outside of this segment could experience stress because of the separation.\n\nAs stressed markets improve, more normal functioning of the financial system as whole can be achieved. Financial firms will become more willing to carry on their usual arbitrage activities, and market segmentation will diminish. As such, both the need and effectiveness of the special programs will diminish.\n\nBecause segmentation will change dynamically, the effectiveness and unintended consequences of credit policies can shift over time and in unexpected ways. This highlights the need for careful design and continuous monitoring of these programs.\n\nMore generally, as economic activity recovers and financial conditions normalize, the use of nontraditional policy tools and the size of the Fed's balance sheet will be reduced, and the FOMC will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate. Some of this wind-down will occur naturally as market conditions improve, given the particular pricing and maturity design features of these programs. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities that have been put in place during the financial turmoil. Fortunately, it is most likely that this dismantling would be associated with better economic and financial performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the U.S. economy faces many challenges. The Fed has been proactive in addressing market liquidity stresses during the financial crisis—first by using our traditional monetary policy tools and later through our nontraditional lending facilities. Moving forward, we will be vigilant in monitoring the risks to growth and price stability. It is also important for us to continue to collaborate with policymakers throughout government and across the globe in the pursuit of financial stability worldwide. We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance. But the policy actions taken by the Fed and other governmental agencies over the course of the financial crisis, and the efforts of the private sector to work through its difficulties, will eventually help support a recovery in economic growth.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

    "text": "I would like to compliment the organizers for posing a very challenging set of questions for the panel to address. Although you will quickly notice that I am not going to respond to each question explicitly, I will address what I think are the key issues. And in doing so, I think you will see how I have approached monetary policy decision-making during the challenging environment that has inspired these questions. As always, these are my own views and not those of the FOMC or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe four questions for the panel can be boiled down to two broad issues:\n\nLet me start by summarizing my views. First, because periods of financial stress are relatively rare in economies with strong commitments to price stability and low variability in economic activity, the normal approaches to monetary policy—as summarized by the Taylor Rule—generally serve us quite well. Second, during periods of nascent or even actual financial stress, it is appropriate for policy to maintain its focus on obtaining its macroeconomic goals over the medium term. Third, timely access to substantive information about financial market participants' activities is a critical aid to policymakers when assessing disruptions to the credit intermediation process that could adversely affect the real economy. In the United States, the Fed's supervisory responsibilities have been a helpful tool in obtaining such information.\n\nBefore I go on, allow me to quibble with the term \"excessive risk-taking.\" As we all know, it is difficult to define what \"excessive\" is.\n\nWe need to bear in mind that risk-taking is an important ingredient in economic growth and the efficient allocation of resources. Developing new technologies and their applications requires creativity and a willingness to take risks. Some innovators will succeed and invent great things, and some will fail. Resources will flow to the successful innovators, which boosts productivity and economic growth. Workers also take risks, choosing new careers and job opportunities to improve their standard of living. Clearly risk-taking is an important ingredient in well-functioning competitive economies, and living standards are enhanced by such activities.\n\nBut when is this risk-taking \"excessive\" and when could it have large downside economic effects? This is difficult to know simply by observing the decisions and investments as they are made. For example, a large investment project may appear to be relatively safe when the probability of its success is judged to be high. In addition, the investment might be part of a larger diversified strategy designed to reduce the overall risk profile of the firm. Of course, in the end the investment strategy may turn out to be more risky than understood ex ante . The greater risk could be due to overly optimistic assessments of the likelihood of the investment payoffs or the lack of diversification achieved by the portfolio as the returns to the various investments turn out to be more correlated than had been anticipated.\n\nThe financial developments that spawned some of last summer's turmoil in subprime mortgage markets have some of these properties. The extent to which risk-taking was excessive at the outset remains unclear. But the important question for today is whether our policy responses to these events in themselves will lead to further excesses at some point in the future. There is no way to answer this question for sure. But I think that we can minimize the potential for problems if monetary policy focuses clearly on our legislative mandate to facilitate financial conditions that promote effectively the goals of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nNow, let me discuss how I see financial markets and financial stability fitting into our policy objectives. There is no analogy in financial markets to macroeconomic price stability. The prices of financial products may change quite substantially when new information arrives. Indeed, one of the most important activities of financial markets is price discovery—the efficient assimilation of all available information into asset values. This promotes the appropriate allocation of capital among competing demands and supports maximum sustainable growth. And it is this efficient functioning of markets that is our concern with regard to financial stability.\n\nMost of the time, monetary policy intersects financial markets directly at our primary policy tool—the federal funds rate. To alter the trajectory of inflation and economic growth towards their goals, changes in the federal funds rate directly alter short-term risk-free rates of interest. Perceptions of our willingness and ability to adjust future policy then may also alter risk premiums in fixed-income markets and result in a change in the cost of financial credit to numerous other borrowers.\n\nWhen the economy is weak and we lower rates to stimulate activity, we encourage risk-taking. This is a natural consequence of lowering rates. At the margin, projects which previously had too much risk relative to their expected return become more attractive for two reasons: The future returns may look better and the financing costs are lower. And this may be a good thing, for example, if it can help stimulate an economy that is mired in a situation where overcautious businesses or households are holding back on investment and spending. These actions would further reduce macroeconomic risk.\n\nHowever, in principle, these effects could go too far and encourage too much risk–taking. How would we know? In my mind, we would begin to see imbalances emerge that would put our policy goals at risk over the medium term. For example, in the late 1990s, we felt that the increases in household wealth—much of it related to the booming stock market—were causing spending to outstrip the economy's productive capacity at that time and posing a threat to price stability.\n\nWhen thinking about policy adjustments, a useful benchmark is the line of research on policy rules pioneered by John Taylor. This research indicates that most historical policy actions have been systematic responses to changes in the prospects for our goal variables of output growth, employment, and inflation. The main ideas are the systematic response component, and that particular rules are benchmarks for typical policy. Financial developments play a role in these systematic responses through the normal effects of changes in the funds rate on other credit conditions that affect the real economy. So policy responds to economic developments that affect the achievement of its goals. As long as the goals themselves are compatible with the structure of the economy, it is hard to see how the normal conduct of policy would generate excessive risk-taking.\n\nOf course, even Taylor's research points out that periods of financial stress may require policy responses that differ from the usual prescriptions. It's not that we downgrade our focus on the policy goals. It is that during these times we often are highly uncertain about how unusual financial market conditions will influence inflation and economic activity. The baseline outlook may be only modestly affected by the conditions, but there may be risks of substantial spillovers that could lead to persistent declines in credit intermediation capacity or large declines in wealth. These in turn would reduce business and household spending. In such cases, policy may take out insurance against these adverse risks and move the policy rate more than the usual prescriptions of the Taylor Rule.\n\nNow if we took out such insurance too liberally or too often, then private sector markets would change their views regarding policy and alter their base level of risk-taking. But in doing so, we likely would observe inflationary imbalances emerging or unusual volatility in output. So part of our job as a central bank is to properly price these insurance premiums against the achievement of maximum employment and price stability over the medium term. Importantly, when insurance proves to be no longer necessary, removing it promptly and recalibrating policy to appropriate levels will reiterate and reinforce our commitment to these fundamental policy goals. And if we are transparent so that markets understand that we will adhere to this strategy, such insurance-based monetary policy will not encourage excessive risk-taking.\n\nWe also must remember that we can't eliminate risk and uncertainty completely; nor would it be a good idea to do so. But by the same token, we don't want to add to uncertainty. The literature on asset bubble pricking is related to this discussion of excess risk-taking: Should a policymaker deflate a bubble before it becomes problematic? I am skeptical that we can identify bubbles with enough accuracy and know enough about how to act to say that we wouldn't have more failures than successes. Remember that in 1996, many commented that the stock market might be overvalued; however, the then unappreciated acceleration in productivity eventually justified even higher valuations. Furthermore, as former Chairman Greenspan [2004] noted, in order to make sure you burst a bubble, you have to attack it aggressively, because if your attack fails, it just gets bigger. And there are big risks to the real economy of making such large moves.\n\nI would now like to say a few words about the adequacy of our toolkit during periods of financial disruptions. We have several ways to add liquidity to the economy in addition to the normal open market operations: the discount window—extended to term borrowing and the new Term Auction Facility—and foreign exchange swaps to help enhance liquidity abroad. In these operations we accept as collateral assets that others see as less readily marketable. I do not think this adds undue risk since we only lend to qualified solvent institutions and the collateralization rates include appropriate haircuts on riskier assets. In addition, we sterilize the effects of the borrowings on aggregate reserves, so that the liquidity injections are done while maintaining the fed funds rate target. This keeps the funds rate at a level we see as consistent with achieving our announced policy goals.\n\nAnother tool we have is the ability to obtain timely information directly from financial market participants that can help us gauge the extent and potential fallouts of financial disruptions. One way we do so is through our role as a supervisor: Our experience here has given us a good base of understanding and timely access to a wide range of information regarding financial intermediaries' activities. This is important, since most financial crises involve developments in new or unusual products that affect the income flows and balance sheets of these institutions. There seem to be synergies from the knowledge we gain through supervision and the policy questions we are faced with during periods of unusual financial stress. In addition to information from banking entities, it is important to have information flows from other financial sector participants.\n\nThanks and I look forward to a lively discussion.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

    "text": "I would like to thank Deputy Governor Jean Pierre Landau, Benoit Mojon, and the Banque de France for organizing this timely conference on asset price bubbles and monetary policy. And I would like to thank two of our Chicago Fed staffers—Jonas Fisher and Gadi Barlevy—who helped Benoit put together such an interesting program. It's been a pleasure for me to be in the audience, and now, I will share my thoughts with you on this important topic.\n\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe financial crisis we have experienced during the past two years has challenged the conventional view on how monetary policy should respond to asset price movements. Before the crisis, the common view was that a central bank should not react to asset price movements, except to the extent that they affect forecasts for inflation and the output gap. A central bank would instead stand ready to respond if and when a collapse in the prices of some assets threatened its ability to meet its policy mandates. Now, in the aftermath of the crisis, there are increasing calls for central banks to be more proactive in responding to signs that an asset bubble may have emerged. This notion is often described as an imperative to \"lean against a bubble,\" meaning that the central bank should act to lower asset prices that, by historical standards, seem unusually high.\n\nToday, I would like to offer my position on this question. I agree that the severity of the recent crisis argues against simply waiting and mopping up after the fact if and when the prices of some assets do collapse. But the type of proactive response by a central bank that I envision is not well captured by the expression \"leaning against a bubble.\" I prefer to see policy reacting to apparent exuberance in asset markets and the problematic risk exposure this could create, rather than initiating action out of a strong conviction that these particular assets are overvalued. In addition, the expression \"leaning against a bubble\" evokes polices that are aimed at achieving some targeted decline in asset prices. In contrast, I view the goal of intervention as insuring that exuberance in asset markets does not ultimately threaten the financial system or contribute to financial distress.\n\nLet me elaborate. This will help explain why the conventional view of how policy ought to respond to bubbles has changed in the wake of the financial crisis. The original case for why central banks should not respond to bubbles relies on two arguments. The first holds that it is virtually impossible to determine whether an asset is trading above its fundamental value, certainly not in real time and often not even after the fact. 1 The second argument holds that monetary policy as a tool is too blunt to prick bubbles effectively. This is because monetary policy cannot be targeted precisely, and will affect other financial and macroeconomic variables beyond just the set of asset prices in question. In addition, the typical changes in interest rates that a central bank might contemplate are likely to be too small to produce big changes in asset prices. 2\n\nDoes the recent crisis justify revising this view? On the one hand, the crisis has certainly taught us a great deal about asset price booms and busts. We've learned, for example, that we must be attuned to the warning signs that might indicate potential dangers in housing markets. 3 But does this mean we should be more confident in our ability to easily and definitively sort out in real time whether a rapid increase in asset prices is associated with overvaluation? I am skeptical. Each new episode is likely to involve its own idiosyncratic features—enough to bring a new chorus proclaiming that \"this time it is different\" and arguing that we are not in fact facing a bubble. As Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff remind us in their recent book, this pattern has been going on for at least eight centuries. 4 As for the bluntness of monetary policy tools, I don't think the crisis has demonstrated that the typical levers of monetary policy are any less blunt than we used to think.\n\nInstead, it seems it is the severity of the crisis, and the desire to not let one like it reoccur, that has encouraged people to contemplate alternative policy responses. Certainly, the crisis ought to have sobered us to the thought that asset price collapses are always sufficiently manageable after the fact. But if the ultimate desire is to reduce the likelihood of such crises, our policy response should focus on achieving financial stability rather than on identifying and purging asset bubbles per se. An appropriate policy response may entail responding to bubbles, but I would argue that this should only be a means to achieving the broader goal of financial stability, rather than an end in and of itself. Indeed, I am concerned that some policies may not receive enough attention if we frame the lessons from the recent crisis too narrowly in terms of leaning against a bubble.\n\nSo what steps should we take to reduce the chances of another financial crisis? Part of the answer lies in structural prescriptions. The formulation of such frameworks will not be easy, and would greatly benefit from further research on how financial markets interact with real economic activity. Researchers in both macroeconomics and finance have a good deal of work to do on this score. But I am hopeful that this research can help identify which environments might best reduce the chance that financial markets trigger ruinous crises, as well as determine what policy instruments we should add to our toolkit.\n\nAt this point, I think that regulatory policy provides the most promise. For one, it is important to improve resolution procedures for financial institutions in the event of insolvency. This includes requiring firms to formulate contingency plans that would be used in the event of their failure. Doing so should reduce the chances that the collapse of a particular institution will threaten the broader financial system. Just as importantly, these plans also would improve discussions between supervisors and institutions. This would facilitate horizontal reviews and in so doing help first identify and then reduce potential systemic risk exposures.\n\nAt the same time, maintaining financial stability is also likely to involve more-proactive, state-contingent measures, that is, policies that vary with economic conditions. For example, when faced by several indications that asset markets may be exuberant, we might consider increasing capital requirements. This might be either for financial institutions as a whole or for specific institutions that choose to hold assets for which there is concern of a price collapse. These requirements should serve as a cushion if purchases of these assets result in losses. They may also end up putting downward pressure on asset prices and, at some point, even eliminate speculative excesses. Here I have in mind theories of bubbles that are due to so-called agency problems, where those who trade assets are acting as agents on behalf of others and cannot be perfectly monitored. These models, such as the models in the papers presented at the conference by Gadi Barlevy and Xavier Ragot, suggest that forcing agents to stake more of their own resources could provide a strong disincentive for market participants to purchase overvalued assets, possibly deflating a bubble that has already emerged. 5\n\nThat said, it is important to stress that lowering asset prices would not be the direct intent of these policies and, therefore, not the way we should judge their success. We should consider an intervention successful if it helps to safeguard financial institutions and the real economy in the event that asset prices collapse, not if it manages to lower asset prices to better reflect the true worth of the underlying assets. In fact, we are unlikely to ever know if we accomplished the latter.\n\nOne advantage of using financial stability as our metric is that it does not require a central bank to take a stand on whether the assets in question are overvalued. Rather, the responses would be implemented whenever there are concerns that asset prices may experience a sharp decline in the future, regardless of whether this decline is driven by fundamentals or by the bursting of an asset bubble.\n\nI should note that some policymakers have recently expressed openness to the notion of leaning against bubbles. The proposals I just outlined are not out of scope with some of their thinking. This is because they, too, often give regulatory policy a prominent role. 6 Thus, while I might motivate and describe the appropriate policy response somewhat differently, my recommendation does not represent a radical departure from what others have argued.\n\nIn closing, let me return to the broader themes of the conference. In the past, economists used to debate whether bubbles were even possible. The research discussed here shows that there are conditions under which bubbles can unequivocally occur, even among fully rational market participants, and that in some cases it might be desirable to burst them. But what these papers do not show is how central banks can reliably identify bubbles. The best they can offer are useful warning signs, such as those in the paper that Carsten Detken will present tomorrow. 7 As long as we can't detect bubbles with great confidence, it seems unwise to adopt fighting them as a policy objective, even if only sparingly. Instead, it seems better to commit to what central banks are already mandated to do: preserve the safety and soundness of the financial system at all times, including when there is apparent exuberance in asset markets.\n\nI would like to acknowledge the help of the following Chicago Fed staff in preparing these remarks: Dan Sullivan, Spencer Krane, and Gadi Barlevy.\n\n1 For example, in Peter M. Garber, 2000, Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, the author revisits three historical episodes that are commonly described as bubbles. Garber concludes that in all three, price movements can be explained by changes in the expectations of fundamentals by market participants. Ellen McGrattan and Edward Prescott similarly argue that the rise in the stock market prior to the 1929 crash was not a bubble; see Ellen McGrattan and Edward Prescott, 2003, \"Testing for stock market overvaluation/undervaluation,\" in Asset Price Bubbles: The Implications for Monetary, Regulatory, and International Policies, William C. Hunter, George G. Kaufman, and Michael Pomerleano (eds.), Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, pp. 271–276.\n\n2 The notion of a policy being too blunt because it can affect many variables in addition to asset prices is usually attributed to Bernanke and Gertler; see Ben Bernanke and Mark Gertler, 1999, \"Monetary policy and asset price volatility,\" Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Fourth Quarter, pp. 17–51. The notion of a policy being too blunt because it is ineffective has been raised by Greenspan; see Alan Greenspan, 2002, \"Central bank perspectives on stabilization policy—Articles from the bank's Economic Policy Symposium, ‘Rethinking Stabilization Policy,’\" Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Fourth Quarter, pp. 5–12. See also Frederic S. Mishkin, 2008, \"How should we respond to asset price bubbles?,\" speech at the Wharton Financial Institutions Center and Oliver Wyman Institute's Annual Financial Risk Roundtable, Philadelphia, May 15.\n\n3 In a November 2008 speech, Don Kohn offers an insightful discussion of how his view of asset bubbles was informed by the crisis, including whether we can have advance warning that certain markets are subject to bubbles before the prices of these assets decline; see Donald L. Kohn, 2008, \"Monetary policy and asset prices revisited,\" speech at the Cato Institute's 26th Annual Monetary Policy Conference, Washington, DC, November 19.\n\n4 Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, 2009, This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. Reinhart and Rogoff go on to argue that since these episodes are so similar, contrarian claims should be refutable with evidence from various advance indicators of such crises. By contrast, Caballero and Kurlat argue that crises are nearly impossible to predict; see Ricardo J. Caballero and Pablo Kurlat, 2009, \"The ‘surprising’ origin and nature of financial crises: A macroeconomic policy proposal,\" paper at the Economic Policy Symposium, Financial Stability and Macroeconomic Policy, Jackson Hole, WY, August 20–22. This debate underscores the point I wish to make: that making the case that we are facing a bubble is likely to be difficult, since it will always be possible to argue about the relevance of indicators that predicted crises in the past.\n\n5 Gadi Barlevy, 2009, \"A leverage–based model of speculative bubbles,\" paper at Banque de France and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference, Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy, Paris, November 13; and Simon Dubecq, Benoit Mojon, and Xavier Ragot, 2009, \"Risk shifting, fuzzy capital requirements and the build up of financial fragility,\" paper at Banque de France and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference, Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy, Paris, November 13. The original work on bubbles and agency problems was done by Franklin Allen and Gary Gorton, 1993, \"Churning bubbles,\" Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 60, No. 4, pp. 813–836, and Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale, 2000, \"Bubbles and crises,\" Economic Journal, Vol. 110, No. 460, pp 236–255; however, they do not emphasize the role of capital requirements in avoiding bubbles in these papers.\n\n6 See William Dudley 2009, \"Lessons learned from the financial crisis,\" remarks at the Eighth Annual BIS conference, Basel, Switzerland; Gary H.

    "text": "Thank you, Justin. I'm Charlie Evans, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. On behalf of the World Bank and everyone here at the Chicago Fed, it's my pleasure to welcome you to the 12th annual International Banking Conference. Over the years, this conference has served as a valuable forum for the discussion of current issues affecting global financial markets, such as international regulatory structures, the globalization of financial markets, systemic risk, and the problems involved with the resolution of large, globally active banks. Also, we have been fortunate to have leading academics, regulators, and industry executives participate in the various venues—providing valuable perspectives and enriching the discussions on the issues.\n\nThis year's theme is the international financial crisis. If you look back at the past conferences, you will see that the most common theme over the years deals with various aspects of financial crises. After looking over this year's program, I want to compliment the organizers from both the World Bank and the Chicago Fed for putting together a very impressive group of experts in the current debate on how best to reduce the probability of another financial crisis, and, if one should occur, how to respond. I look forward to the next two days and believe you will find the discussion cutting edge and useful for deciding how we as a global financial community should move forward. Again, on behalf of the World Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, enjoy the 12th annual International Banking Conference.\n\nBefore I turn the podium over to Doug, I'd like to offer a few remarks on the theme of this year's conference—financial crisis—with an emphasis on the oversight of financial markets. I should note that my remarks reflect my own views and are not those of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhen thinking about the events of the past couple of years, what comes to mind most often, or the big \"take away\" from all of this, is that we don't ever want to find ourselves in this situation again.\n\nIf we are committed to that outcome, we should ask ourselves, first, how can policies be changed so that in the future, it will be much less likely that systemically important financial institutions will find themselves in crisis situations? And, second, if such crises do occur, how can we best contain them, preventing them from having a major impact on the rest of the economy as in the recent crisis? Surely, prevention should form our first and strongest line of defense and remedial, or containment, policies should form the second.\n\nI recently gave a speech to the European Economic and Financial Center on the issues associated with too-big-to-fail. I argued that in the current regulatory environment it is unrealistic to expect that regulators would allow the uncontrolled failure of a large, complicated, and interconnected financial institution—certainly not if they had the ability to avoid it and if there were systemic ramifications to the failure. If you accept this premise, and I believe the failure of Lehman Brothers is the counterexample that proves it, then it becomes imperative to construct an environment that prevents our economic and financial system from again reaching the crisis state we have seen over this past year.\n\nIn my earlier speech I stressed the need for policy reforms, such as the introduction of an orderly and efficient failure resolution process that would create a credible regulatory environment in which firms and their creditors would not expect rescues or bailouts. This would reduce the moral hazard issues associated with the too-big-to-fail perception. It also would better align the incentives of the stakeholders of financial firms with those of society at large. In addition it would allow a larger role for financial markets to oversee and regulate firm behavior. However, even though I think we can significantly strengthen the role of market discipline, regulation will continue to play a very important role in ensuring financial stability.\n\nThe kinds of events that lead to our recent interventions inevitably occur during periods of financial exuberance. One way or another, asset prices rise beyond conservative fundamental valuations and risk premiums fall well below appropriate compensation levels. We typically use the loose term \"asset price bubble\" to describe such situations. Although I will continue that tradition, we should keep in mind that not all increases in asset prices represent departures from fundamentals, and not all asset bubbles need be disruptive. 1 Definitions aside, it seems clear that we need to find a way to deal with potential exuberance in financial markets if we want to ensure financial stability.\n\nSome seven years ago, at an earlier International Banking Conference, which was also cosponsored by the World Bank, we discussed the implications of asset bubbles. 2 The typical view expressed at the conference, which aligned well with much of the research literature at the time, was that central banks should not use monetary policy tools to \"manage\" or lean against the inflated prices associated with asset bubbles. In the event of a sudden collapse in asset prices, central banks were expected to respond with their standard policy tools to address any adverse impact on real economic activity. In other words, monetary policy should be prepared to \"clean up\" ex post rather than try to prevent ex ante a run-up in asset prices. 3\n\nHowever, given the enormous costs of the recent financial crisis, as well as new research suggesting an increase in the frequency and amplitude of asset price cycles, 4 many commentators are reassessing the proper role of the central bank in monitoring and trying to deflate rising asset prices.\n\nIn reevaluating the effectiveness of monetary policy for this purpose, two approaches are typically considered. One is for the central bank to take an activist role and directly incorporate asset price fluctuations into its monetary policy deliberations—that is, explicitly putting asset prices into the policy response function and \"leaning against the wind.\" As an alternative, policymakers could incorporate asset prices into the price indexes used in determining the future direction of monetary policy.\n\nWhile recent events have indeed imposed significant costs on society, I fear that monetary policy tools may be too blunt for such a fine-tuning policy. 5 Central bankers have imperfect information, and for many asset classes, sudden price declines may have minimal impact on the real economy. 6 So, my concern is that using monetary policy to \"lean against bubbles\" could end up causing more harm to the economy than good.\n\nTo elaborate a bit, taking an activist role would likely have policy aim at explicitly hitting some target range for asset prices or risk premiums. So, we would first have to determine those target ranges. I don't know of any economic theory or empirical evidence we currently have in hand that would give us adequate guidance here. In addition, there is the \"bluntness\" of monetary policy. Using wide-reaching monetary policy to slow the growth of certain asset prices could have significant adverse effects on other sectors of the economy. In normal times, we use our policy instrument, the short-term federal funds rate, to try to achieve our dual mandate goals of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. Adding a third target—asset prices—would likely mean we couldn't do as well on the other two.\n\nThe desirability of incorporating asset prices into the inflation measures targeted by central banks is also not obvious. Some claim that standard consumer price indexes do not adequately incorporate inflationary expectations; rather, they only account for past price adjustments. Certain asset prices, for example, those of equities or real estate, may better incorporate such expectations. Thus, some argue that to the extent these asset prices are predictors of future price changes, including them in the target price indexes provides a reasonable operating procedure that leans against rising asset prices and adds an automatic stabilizer to monetary policy.\n\nOne potential issue with this argument is whether real estate or equity market prices accurately forecast future inflation rates. A bigger question, however, is how to operationalize such an index. What weights should be assigned to asset prices in the aggregate indexes? Index number theory provides the conceptual linkage between utility maximization and the expenditure weights used to construct consumer price indexes. I have not yet seen the theoretical work that says how to include asset prices in an aggregate index. I am open-minded to new research making the case for using monetary policy to address asset inflation. But as of now, I am skeptical. 7\n\nFortunately, monetary policy is not the only tool that central banks have to deal with asset price swings and their potentially disruptive consequences. In my view, redesigning regulations and improving market infrastructure offer more promising paths to increased financial stability. This is the \"prevention\" that forms the first line of defense in our efforts to never be in this position again. Regulation may or may not be sufficient to avoid all of the market events that help to create excessive exuberance, but it should play a very large role in controlling the existence, size, and consequences of any bubble. For example, research suggests that a crisis caused by sudden declines in asset prices is less disruptive to markets when financial systems and individual bank balance sheets are in sound condition before the crisis. 8 Better supervision and a sound regulatory infrastructure can increase the resiliency of markets and institutions, enabling them to better withstand adverse shocks.\n\nHow do we promote such increased resiliency? First, we can make more effective use of our existing regulatory structure, tools, and authority. And second, a number of reforms of our current infrastructure—both market and regulatory—may help us to better address the type of problems we saw emerge during the recent crisis.\n\nWithin the existing structure, regulators have the ability to promote better, more resilient financial markets, either through rule-making or by serving as a coordinator of private initiatives. 9 They can also encourage more and better disclosure of information—a key element of effective risk management.\n\nRegulators and supervisors are also often in positions to foresee emerging problems before they grow into crises. Along these lines, supervisors can do more \"horizontal supervision,\" similar to the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) that was designed for the largest 19 U.S. banks. Using procedures similar to those in SCAP, the likely performance of banks can be evaluated on a consistent basis under alternative stress scenarios. In addition to evaluating resiliency to future conditions, this type of \"stress test\" also enables supervisors to identify best practices in risk management and to push banks with weak risk management to improve. 10\n\nWhen emerging issues or practices that could lead to disruptions are identified, regulators can more effectively use tools such as memorandums of understanding or supervisory directives to dampen the adverse impact of a variety of financial shocks. 11 Indeed, we probably should have been more aggressive in utilizing this supervisory power during the period leading up to the recent crisis. It can be an effective and powerful tool.\n\nAlthough I believe we can use existing regulatory tools more effectively, we may also need to address the shortcomings of current regulations. Already policymakers in the U.S. and elsewhere are exploring a variety of reforms. 12\n\nIntroducing a systemic regulator who can identify, monitor, and collate information on industry practices across various institutions tops most of the reform agendas. While plans for systemic regulation vary in the structures they propose—for example, a single regulator versus a committee of regulators—they all envision macroprudential supervision and regulation as the key mandate of the new regulator. This would be a major component of what I called our first line of defense.\n\nReform proposals also typically include ways in which we can make capital requirements more dynamic and tailor them to the type of risks an institution poses for the financial system. Varying capital requirements and loan loss provisions over the cycle are examples of these proposals. History shows that during boom times, when financial institutions are perhaps in an exuberant state, they may not price risks fully in their underwriting and risk-management decisions. During downturns, faced with eroding capital cushions, increased uncertainty, and binding capital constraints, some institutions may become overcautious and excessively tighten lending standards. Both behaviors tend to amplify the business cycle. Allowing the required capital ratio to vary over the cycle could serve to offset some of this volatility and to partially offset the boom–bust trends we have seen in the past.\n\nVarying loan loss provisions over the cycle is an alternative or complementary way to better cushion firms against sudden declines in asset prices.\n\nCapital requirements also could be adjusted by extending risk-based weighting schemes to account for institutions' contributions to systemic risk. This could involve higher risk weights based on factors such as institution size and the extent of off-balance-sheet activities. It might also include some assessment of the degree to which the institution was interconnected with others. Such adjustments to capital requirements would make the decisions of financial institutions more closely reflect their impact on society. The information needed to account for the new risk factors—for example, the degree of interconnectedness—fits well within the framework of information that would be required by a new systemic regulator, and is now being considered in regulatory reform proposals in the U.S.\n\nSo, in order to fortify our first line of defense, we must make more effective use of the existing regulatory structure and tools, introduce a systemic risk regulator, and reform capital requirements to make them more dynamic and tailored to systemic risks. But adjustments to the current regulations and infrastructure alone are probably not enough. We also need to fortify our second line of defense—containing the disruptive spillovers that result from the failure of systemically important institutions without resorting to bailouts or ad hoc rescues. A necessary element of this is having a mechanism for resolving the failure of a systemically important institution. This is something we currently lack in many cases, though there are proposals now under discussion that would provide this resolution power. 13\n\nAnother reform proposal that I think can play an important role in the resolution process of systemically important institutions is what is typically referred to as a \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan. Under this proposal, systemically important institutions would be required to provide the information necessary to determine how their failures could be handled in a relatively short period of time, as well as to design a plan to efficiently implement such a resolution. 14 I see a number of ways these plans can fortify both our first and second lines of defense.\n\nRequiring systemically important institutions to identify and think through their organizational structure and interactions with various parties can improve the risk-management practices of their institutions. By developing plans to address systemic problem areas ex ante, the need for an ex post \"too-big-to-fail\" action could be reduced.\n\nIn addition, should the first line of defense fail, these plans could provide an initial blueprint for the resolution of large interconnected institutions and, in so doing, improve our second line of defense. Currently, individual institutions may not have an incentive to make such plans—after all, they would bear the costs of the planning and see little of the benefits. 15 But, society as a whole would benefit from such contingency planning. Another way to cushion financial firms against sudden asset price declines would be to require them to hold contingent capital. 16 Under these proposals, systemically important banks would be required to issue \"contingent capital certificates.\" These would be issued as debt securities that would be converted into equity shares if some predetermined threshold was breached. 17 It would provide firms with an additional equity injection at the very time that equity would be difficult to issue, thus enabling firms to better withstand sudden shocks and potential spillover effects.\n\nThese new policy options, while not easy to implement, would enhance the ability of banks and other financial intermediaries to survive shocks—whether from a sudden fall in asset prices or from some other source. I am fully aware that the challenges in reforming regulatory structures and practices are not insignificant. But, given the magnitude of the cost incurred in the wake of the recent crisis and the possible benefits that would arise from making our economy more resilient to such events, it is imperative that we take on these challenges.\n\nThus, I think we need to strengthen our existing regulatory infrastructure and give strong consideration to making the adjustments that could reduce the likelihood of a crisis similar in magnitude to the one we have seen over the past two years. We also need to devise mechanisms to dampen the adverse effects of any disruption that might occur.\n\nThis year, as in others, this conference invites us to examine and discuss financial crises and asks whether the rules of finance have changed. I've argued that in order to avoid a situation like the one we have faced in the past two years; we need to fortify our regulatory lines of defense. We need to have the rules of regulation change. Not necessarily through more regulation, but through better regulation that is more efficient and effective in its design and implementation. I hope this conference serves as a platform to inform your thinking and stimulate good debate about the issues I've laid out.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

Garber, 2000, Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, and Ellen McGrattan and Edward Prescott, 2003, \"Testing for stock market overvaluation/undervaluation,\" in Asset Price Bubbles: The Implications for Monetary, Regulatory, and International Policies , William C. Hunter, George G. Kaufman, and Michael Pomerleano (eds.), Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.\n\n2 See William C. Hunter, George G. Kaufman, and Michael Pomerleano (eds.), 2003, Asset Price Bubbles: The Implications for Monetary, Regulatory, and International Policies , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press (hereafter HKP).\n\n3 See Ben Bernanke and Mark Gertler, 2001, \"Should central banks respond to movements in asset prices?,\" American Economic Review , Vol. 91, No. 2, May, pp. 253–257; Ben Bernanke, Mark Gertler, and Simon Gilchrist, 1999, \"The financial accelerator in a quantitative business cycle framework,\" in Handbook of Macroeconomics , Vol.1C, John Taylor and Michael Woodford (eds.), New York: Elsevier Science-North Holland, pp. 1341–1393. A quick aside, it should be emphasized that policymakers do currently take asset bubbles into account to the extent that they affect the real sector of the economy. Thus, it is not a question of whether policymakers address bubbles. At issue is whether they should or can address asset price increases ex ante to avoid a resulting sudden decline in prices that more adversely affects the real economy than would have occurred without the bubble.\n\n4 For example, see Randall Kroszner, 2003, \"Asset price bubbles, information, and public policy,\" in HKP, pp. 3–12; and Claudio Borio and Philip Lowe, 2003, \"Imbalances or bubbles? Implications for monetary and financial stability,\" in HKP, pp. 247–263.\n\n5 There is broad literature on this issue. See: Friedman, Goodfriend, Meltzer, Mishkin and White, Mussa, and Trichet, in HKP (2003); Kroszner (2003) previously cited in footnote 4; Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999); Bernanke and Gertler (2001) previously cited in footnote 3; Frederic S.

Minsky Conference on the State of the U.S. and World Economies—\"Meeting the Challenges of the Financial Crisis,\" Bard College, New York City, April 16.\n\n6 See Mishkin in footnote 5. Mishkin makes the argument that not all bubbles have the same impact on the real economy. In particular, he argues that bubbles associated with credit booms are more dangerous because they put the financial system at risk and may result in negative spillover effects for the real economy. Thus, these bubbles may deserve a more activist approach.\n\n7 For an alternative discussion of potential problems, see Trichet (2003) in footnote 5.\n\n8 See Frederic Mishkin and Eugene White, 2003, \"U.S. stock market crashes and their aftermath: Implications for monetary policy,\" in HKP, pp. 53–76.\n\n9 An example here would be the central bank serving a coordinative role encouraging banks to address operational risks associated with back-office operations in credit default swap contracts.\n\n10 For a further discussion of SCAP, see Daniel K. Tarullo, 2009, \"Bank supervision,\" testimony before the U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Washington, DC, August 4.\n\n11 For example, memorandums could have addressed the rising role of commercial real estate in bank portfolios, or they could have addressed practices in mortgage lending that may have contributed to poor underwriting.\n\n12 See U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2009, \"Financial regulatory reform—A new foundation: Rebuilding financial supervision and regulation,\" proposal, Washington, DC, June 17, available online . I have previously discussed these policy issues in somewhat more detail: see Charles Evans, 2009, \"Too-big-to-fail: A problem too big to ignore,\" speech to the European Economics and Financial Center, London, July 1. Also see the Squam Lake Working Group proposals, available at Squam Lake Working Group proposals .\n\n13 See U.S. Department of the Treasury (2009).\n\n14 See Raghuram Rajan, 2009, \"Too systemic to fail: Consequences and potential remedies,\" presented at the Proceedings of a Conference on Bank Structure and Competition , Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, May; and see the Squam Lake Working Group proposals, available at Squam Lake Working Group proposals .\n\n15 Not only would the banks not see the benefits of disclosing this information, they could actually benefit from keeping this information from the supervisors. The more opaque the operations and risk of institutions, the more likely they could be considered too-big-to-fail if they encounter difficulties. Thus, the \"shelf plan\" could force these issues to be on the table for discussion.\n\n16 See Mark Flannery, 2005, \"No pain, no gain? Effecting market discipline via reverse convertible debentures,\" in Capital Adequacy Beyond Basel: Banking, Securities, and Insurance , Hal S. Scott (ed.), Oxford: Oxford University Press, chapter 5; see also the Squam Lake Working Group on Financial Regulation, Squam Lake Working Group proposals, available at Squam Lake Working Group on Financial Regulation .\n\n17 This would be somewhat similar to previous proposals to require banks to hold subordinated debt to better discipline bank behavior and to be able to absorb losses when difficulties are encountered. See Douglas Evanoff and Larry Wall, 2000, \"Subordinated debt as bank capital: A proposal for regulatory reform,\" Economic Perspectives, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago , Vol. 24, No, 2, Second Quarter, pp. 40–53. However, the convertibility of the new instrument would most likely occur when the bank is better capitalized, thus augmenting equity capital and providing an earlier cushion against losses. The trigger to convert the debt would most likely also be supervisory instead of market induced.",

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. And thank you, Einar Forsman, [President and CEO of the Rockford Chamber of Commerce], for that kind introduction.\n\nCurrently, we find ourselves in the midst of a serious recession—one that appears headed towards an experience more like the large downturns in the 1970s and 1980s than the moderate contractions of 1990 and 2001. Many manufacturing-intensive communities, like Rockford, have been particularly hard hit. Today I will discuss the events that brought us to this point, the outlook for the economy, and the policy challenges confronting the Fed during these troubling times. I should note that these are, of course, my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nBackground\n\nOver the past 18 months the economy has experienced deteriorating housing markets, large-scale disruptions to our financial services industry, and plummeting consumer and business confidence. These and related developments have resulted in a significant decline in overall spending and production and a rise in the unemployment rate, particularly over the past six months. All of this has occurred despite aggressive actions by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to address difficulties in credit markets and to bolster aggregate demand. As you know, yesterday, the President signed the $787 billion fiscal stimulus bill. And last week, the Treasury recommended new proposals to deal with the financial sector problems. These actions, I believe, will help in addressing the difficulties we face and in moving us toward financial stability and economic recovery.\n\nThese certainly are challenging, if not extraordinary, times. How did we get here?\n\nIn 2007 housing prices peaked, mortgage defaults rose, and strains began to appear in the market for securitized mortgages. The problems in mortgages spilled over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants re-assessed risk, and the prices of many assets declined. This cascading process of re-pricing had a detrimental impact on the liquidity and capital positions of a wide range of financial institutions in the United States and around the world.\n\nBy the spring and summer of 2008, the tightening of credit conditions had begun to weigh on business spending. And by the fall, household spending was affected as well. Spending was also reduced by the protracted weakness in housing markets, declines in financial wealth, softening labor markets, and substantial increases in prices for energy and other commodities. These factors contributed to a contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) beginning in the third quarter of 2008.\n\nA series of solvency and liquidity events also occurred during this period. Many financial firms reported severe losses. Famous names like Bear Stearns, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group (AIG) were on the list. Some of these firms appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by other financial institutions. In the case of Bear Stearns, this involved assistance from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury also were able to arrange loans and guarantees to AIG in order to avoid large-scale disruptions in markets that had exposures to credit default swaps written by AIG. In contrast, when Lehman Brothers experienced especially large losses last September, no sale or loan support could be made at suitable terms. As a result, they went into bankruptcy.\n\nThese developments intensified financial market participants' concerns over the potential losses on a range of assets, as well as the ability of their counterparties to meet contractual obligations. One important sector that was disrupted was the money market industry. Money funds are major suppliers of financing to commercial paper and other short-term credit markets. Worried over losses, investors in money market funds began making redemptions. To meet these, some funds had to liquidate assets into an already depressed market, further lowering the prices of these instruments.\n\nThis process resulted in a marked increase in the cost of issuing all but the safest, shortest maturity of debt that usually rolls through these markets. Even highly rated firms have found it more difficult and expensive to obtain financing. Some have been able to tap bank backup lines of credit. But this substitution just pushes the funding difficulties back into the banking system, squeezing out the ability of banks to make other loans.\n\nActions by the Federal Reserve\n\nIn response to these extraordinary events, the Fed has implemented a number of policies aimed at mitigating the problems in the financial system and their potential fallout on the rest of the economy.\n\nFirst, the Fed turned to its standard monetary policy instrument, the federal funds rate. Since September 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee has lowered the target funds rate 525 basis points, bringing it to essentially zero in December of last year.\n\nAlthough the corresponding injections of broad liquidity helped credit conditions somewhat, it became clear early on that more had to be done to facilitate market functioning.\n\nAt first, we simply made a number of adjustments to make it more attractive for banks to borrow from the discount window—which is the traditional way the Fed lends overnight to depository institutions.\n\nGiven the events of 2008—in which all types of institutions faced liquidity shortfalls—the Fed created a number of facilities to directly provide liquidity to nondepository institutions. The Federal Reserve Act grants us such emergency powers when the economy is faced with \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\"\n\nMost of these facilities have been aimed at the functioning of short-term credit markets. Some lend to broker-dealers that engage in securities transactions with the Fed and have a large-scale presence in short-term funding markets such as the repo market. Others provide a liquidity backstop for commercial paper issuers and facilitate the sale in secondary markets of a number of instruments held by money market funds. As such, these facilities are lending at relatively short maturities—generally not more than 90 days.\n\nMore recent Fed actions, however, have taken some longer-term assets onto our balance sheet. In December, we began purchasing debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). This initiative will help support the flow of credit and lower borrowing costs in mortgage markets.\n\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in dealing with the crisis. The FDIC increased deposit insurance limits and began to offer insurance on some liabilities of eligible depository institutions and financial holding companies.\n\nCongress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which authorized the Treasury Department's Troubled Assets Relief Program, (or TARP). This program has so far provided more than $335 billion in capital injections to the financial system to support the lending capacity of banks.\n\nLast week, Treasury Secretary Geithner outlined the Financial Stability Plan. One element of the Plan is to combine public and private capital in an effort to value illiquid assets and move them off of banks' balance sheets.\n\nWe have seen a number of indications that the traditional easing of monetary policy and the nontraditional policy actions are beginning to help the functioning of credit markets and reduce financial strains. The spreads on the interest rates charged for interbank lending, and on commercial paper relative to the fed funds rate, have come down appreciably since October particularly at the one-month maturity. More than $150 billion of debt has been issued with FDIC guarantees, facilitating medium-term funding by eligible financial institutions. And the rates on conforming mortgages relative to Treasury bonds have declined since the Fed's GSE purchase program was announced.\n\nThat said, market disruptions clearly remain, and most spreads between private lending rates and comparable-maturity risk-free government debt are still quite elevated relative to where they were before the crisis. Of course, we would not expect spreads and other lending terms to return to those prevailing shortly before the crisis—a period when risk was clearly underpriced. Nevertheless, current spreads and terms seem to be well above where the \"new normal\" will end up.\n\nOver the longer run, policy actions and the work being done in the private sector to reassess risks and shore up balance sheets will help move us toward a new benchmark and more stable financial conditions. This will not be an easy process, and it could take time before financial markets function in a manner that fully facilitates the activities of businesses and households. Until they do, we will continue to experience some drag on activity in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nAs we know only too well, the economy currently is contracting at a disturbing pace. Labor markets have deteriorated significantly. The unemployment rate was 4.9 percent when the recession started in December 2007; last month it reached 7.6 percent. Weak labor markets have held back growth in real incomes, and further declines in the stock-market and home prices have led to marked reductions in household wealth. Slowing foreign activity and the higher dollar are reducing demand for our exports. Although there has been a modest improvement in some credit conditions, overall they still remain tight. The more pessimistic outlook for the economy has reduced everyone's confidence. In turn, we've seen a further pullback in risk-taking by investors, households, and businesses. They are particularly reluctant to take on longer-term investment or spending commitments.\n\nTogether, these factors have led to sharp drop offs in business investment, industrial production, and household spending. Overall output, as measured by real GDP, fell at a 0.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter of 2008 and then dropped at a 3.8 percent rate in the fourth quarter—moreover, recent data suggest that the revisions will make this figure even worse. Last quarter business fixed investment declined at a 19 percent annualized rate, residential investment fell at a 22.4 percent rate, and consumer spending dropped at a 3.5 percent pace. These are very large declines—on par with those experienced during the recessions of the mid-1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe factors that produced the sharp decline in output in the second half of last year are still in play today. Although preliminary data for January were positive for retail sales, there continues to be weakness in housing starts, employment, and auto sales. Consequently, I expect real GDP will fall markedly in the first half of 2009. I am currently projecting that GDP will begin to expand later in 2009, but not enough to offset the declines in the first half of the year. In part, this expected pickup reflects the support from both traditional and nontraditional monetary policies, fiscal actions already taken to address the strains in financial markets, and progress that financial markets themselves make in working through their difficulties. In addition, the new fiscal stimulus package will boost output. However, its full impact is still unclear, and our forecast could need some recalibration as we gain knowledge on how the package is affecting the economy. Looking out a bit further, I expect the pace of GDP growth to move back up in the neighborhood of potential as we move through 2010. However, I do not see growth as being strong enough to make much progress in closing resource gaps over this period. Indeed, the unemployment rate—the main resource gap measure in the labor market—is likely to rise into 2010.\n\nOn the inflation front, headline consumer prices have fallen in recent months, and core prices—which exclude the volatile food and energy categories—have changed little. This appreciable reduction in inflationary pressures reflects falling prices for energy and other commodities, declines in import prices, and the increase in resource slack due to diminished economic activity. Looking ahead, futures markets expect some increase in energy prices. However, substantial resource slack and the likelihood of some moderate reduction in inflation expectations should hold back overall price increases.\n\nConsequently, I expect additional slowing in core consumer price inflation in 2009 and a further edging down in 2010. Over the longer-run, with appropriate monetary policy, I see both overall and core inflation averaging somewhere into the neighborhood of 2 percent, which is a rate I see as being consistent with price stability. That said, there is notable risk that inflation will remain a good deal below this range in the medium term.\n\nSome Perspectives on Policy\n\nI am now going to turn to some broader perspectives on the policy picture. The traditional monetary policy action used to combat sluggish economic activity is to lower the fed funds rate. This in turn reduces other borrowing rates and thus stimulates aggregate demand.\n\nIn December the FOMC decided to move the funds rate to near zero and two weeks ago we voted to leave it unchanged. With the fed funds rate near zero, we cannot lower it any further. Yet, clearly, the recession, financial distress, and low inflationary pressures call for more policy accommodation. For the Fed, this means that the Committee will have to focus on other ways to impart monetary stimulus to the economy.\n\nOne way that monetary policy influences financial and economic activity is through the clarity of our intentions and communications. Expectations of likely future outcomes, including those for monetary policy, obviously matter for decisions made by households and businesses today. In this vein, at a time when near-term inflation is likely to be lower than usual, endorsing an explicit numerical objective for inflation could help keep inflation expectations from falling very far. Such an anchor on inflation expectations would help preserve low real inflation-adjusted interest rates.\n\nAnother way to increase monetary accommodation is to work to bring down unusual liquidity and risk premia that are raising private and longer-term borrowing costs. As I discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve has already operated in this arena, adopting a number of nonstandard policies that are providing liquidity support to a range of institutions and markets. And, if necessary, such nontraditional tools can be expanded.\n\nIn this regard, in November we announced another joint program with the Treasury, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. And last week the Fed announced it is prepared to undertake a substantial expansion of the TALF. Although not yet operational, the TALF should be up and running soon. This temporary facility is designed to support the demand for asset-backed securities by reducing the likelihood that future liquidity needs could force investors to sell into a depressed market. Holders of securities that are bundles of student, consumer, and small businesses loans can borrow from the TALF, using the securities themselves as collateral. Other asset-backed securities, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, could also be eligible. The terms on these loans are more costly than those seen during more normal times. Thus TALF loans eventually will become unattractive when conditions improve in markets for traditional sources of funding. Large haircuts on the collateral and TARP funds provide the Fed with credit protection on the facility.\n\nAnother feature of the TALF is that its loans are for three years—medium-term loans that are noticeably longer than at our other lending facilities. So, like our GSE purchases, it can directly affect interest rates further out on the yield curve.\n\nI should also note that, as conditions warrant, we will be expanding existing programs. In addition, we are considering the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities, if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.\n\nA common question I hear is: \"What principles guide the implementation of these new initiatives?\"\n\nLet me step back for a minute and discuss these programs at a more conceptual level. In a well-functioning financial system, arbitrage moves funds across markets and balances out profit opportunities. It thus aligns term and risk-adjusted returns across markets. This is the reason, for example, why our typical moves to lower the short-term risk-free federal funds rate affect borrowing rates over a large range of maturity and risk structures. In such an environment, we can focus on the size of the liquidity injection instead of the particular segment of the market in which the injection occurs.\n\nBut that is not the case today. There is abundant evidence that arbitrage opportunities remain unexploited. Due to balance-sheet capacity limitations, or because uncertainty and risk aversion are so much higher than normal, participants are largely avoiding markets that are undergoing unusual stress. For example, many student loan payments are guaranteed by the federal government. Despite the guarantees, liquidity disruptions have all but shut down the auction rate securities markets that student loan providers had used to obtain a good deal of their funding. Subsequently, they have had substantial difficulty in attracting investors to other types of securities backed by student loans.\n\nOne way of thinking about these developments is that markets have become highly segmented. We do not see funds flowing in to take advantage of apparent profit opportunities with respect to distressed assets. Such an action could ease liquidity pressures in these sectors and help keep some problems from spilling over into solvency concerns.\n\nThe flip side of this segmentation is that liquidity injections aimed directly at a particular distressed market are less likely to leak out to other areas. The injections thus hold open the possibility of improving that market's functioning a good deal, seeding its transition to more normal liquidity and risk valuations. This is the rationale for why our nontraditional policies focus on loans and securities that affect transactions in particular key markets where we see points of stress. But a downside is that markets outside of this segment could experience stress because of the separation.\n\nAs stressed markets improve, more normal functioning of the financial system as a whole can be achieved. Financial firms will become more willing to carry on their usual arbitrage activities, and market segmentation will diminish. As such, both the need and effectiveness of the special programs will diminish.\n\nBecause segmentation will change dynamically, the effectiveness and unintended consequences of credit policies can shift over time and in unexpected ways. This highlights the need for careful design and continuous monitoring of these programs.\n\nMore generally, as economic activity recovers and financial conditions normalize, the use of nontraditional policy tools and the size of the Fed's balance sheet will be reduced, and the FOMC will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate. Some of this wind-down will occur naturally as market conditions improve, given the particular pricing and maturity design features of these programs. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities that have been put in place during the financial turmoil. Fortunately, it is most likely that this dismantling would be associated with better economic and financial performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the U.S. economy faces many challenges. The Fed has been proactive in addressing market liquidity stresses during the financial crisis—first by using our traditional monetary policy tools and later through our nontraditional lending facilities. Moving forward, we will be vigilant in monitoring the risks to growth and price stability. It is also important for us to continue to collaborate with policymakers throughout government and across the globe in the pursuit of financial stability worldwide. We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance. But the policy actions taken by the Fed and other governmental agencies over the course of the financial crisis, and the efforts of the private sector to work through its difficulties, will eventually help support a recovery in economic growth.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

    "text": "Headline unemployment numbers are consistent with the recession\n\nGood morning. It is a pleasure to be with you today. This year’s conference, and the topics being discussed, are of great importance to us all—economists, regulators, market participants and policymakers. We share a common interest in fostering the economic recovery and a return to strong growth in an environment of low and stable inflation. Conferences such as this one bring together diverse perspectives that will help in devising solutions to achieve these goals.\n\nToday I would like to discuss a few challenging issues that the labor market presents for monetary policymaking. For a bit of context, let me say that I approach this from not just the perspective of a Fed bank president, but also of a macroeconomist and former Fed research director. I’ve had the benefit of attending FOMC meetings since 1995. I have observed firsthand some of the conflicts that FOMC members face in addressing the Fed’s dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability even in more normal times. For me, price stability is 2 percent inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) deflator over the medium term. When I became Chicago Fed president in 2007, I never would have guessed that my first 2-1/2 years would have me voting continually for lower interest rates and more policy accommodation. But with the unemployment rate at 9.7 percent and inflation significantly under my benchmark for price stability, there is no conflict between our policy goals, and so the directions for policy have been clear. Today, I will highlight a number of labor market issues that lead me to think this accommodation will likely be appropriate for some time.\n\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI find myself in broad agreement with the view that restrictive bank credit, along with business and household caution, will continue to restrain the recovery’s strength but that these headwinds will abate as we move through 2010. Most business cycle indicators have turned favorable already. Yet many households and businesses remain wary that a full-fledged recovery is in train. That is not surprising. As we all know, employment is often the last piece of the puzzle to fall into place, and until the economy begins to add jobs in significant numbers, for many it will not feel like much of a recovery.\n\nThe latest reports on this front have been mixed. Layoffs are subsiding. Firms are hiring more temporary workers, and after a large decline, the average workweek is showing signs of stabilizing and perhaps reversing course. These developments usually are precursors of a broader scale recovery in labor demand. But, today, employers remain cautious. Job openings are still scarce, and there are few signs, even anecdotally, that permanent hiring has picked up yet. Moreover, even once labor markets turn the corner, there is a long ways to go before they get back to what we would consider to be normal.\n\nThe ongoing weakness in labor markets—and memories of the jobless recoveries from the previous two recessions—have raised concerns that something has fundamentally changed in the way labor markets work. Some worry that they have deteriorated more than would be expected given the declines in output during the recession and, in turn, this additional weakness might impinge on the speed of the recovery moving forward.\n\nThe usual starting point for thinking about this issue is Okun’s famous “law” relating gross domestic product (GDP) growth to the change in the unemployment rate. The usual estimates of Okun’s law imply that the unemployment rate should be at least a percentage point lower than the 9.7 percent we actually saw last Friday.\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes that the association between economic activity and the unemployment rate does not vary across the business cycle. In fact, many employment indicators tend to deteriorate faster during recessions than they improve during expansions. A simple statistical model that uses the historical relationship between GDP growth and unemployment estimated only during recessions can actually account for the sharp rise in the unemployment rate. Figure 1 compares the actual unemployment numbers (the blue line) to their predicted values from models estimated using GDP data only from recessions (the red line). The two lines are just about spot on. But the green line—the prediction from a standard model that does not distinguish between behavior in expansions and recessions—is not capable of capturing the current numbers. Similar “recession-only” models can also explain the rise in broader measures of unemployment and “underemployment” like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ U-6 rate, as well as the declines in payroll employment. 1\n\nBased on these exercises, I think that it is reasonable to conclude that the unemployment rate and employment growth have evolved about as we would expect given the severity of this recession.\n\nOnce you look past the headline numbers, however, some other labor market indicators are unusually weak. In particular, the share of adults who are outside the labor force has increased more, and the average length of a spell of unemployment has grown much longer than predicted by even our “recession-only” models.\n\nI would like to spend some time elaborating on the implications of the increase in unemployment duration. Much of this material will be appearing in a forthcoming article by my colleagues at the Chicago Fed, Dan Aaronson, Bhash Mazumder, and Shani Schechter. The consequences of long-term unemployment on households can be quite severe. Such households, especially those with little or no wealth, are susceptible to sharp falls in consumption. Moreover, long-term unemployment often leads to a significant loss in permanent earnings even after the worker finds a new job.\n\nUnemployment duration has risen at an unprecedented rate over the past year or so. In February, over 40 percent of the unemployed were in the midst of a spell lasting more than six months, by far the highest proportion in the post-World War II era.\n\nYou can see this in Figure 2, which plots from 1948 to the present the relationship between the unemployment rate (x-axis) and the average length of an ongoing spell of unemployment (y-axis). The red dots represent the monthly figures for 2008 and 2009. At the beginning of the recession, the unemployment rate was at 5 percent and the average unemployment duration was about 17 weeks. Duration was already about 4 weeks more than what would be predicted based on the average historical relationship, represented by the black regression line, between the two measures. This divergence is largely accounted for by a secular shift toward longer spells of unemployment due to the aging of the work force and the much stronger labor force attachment of women.\n\nIn the first 15 months of the recession, average duration increased with unemployment at roughly the rate you would have expected. This is indicated by the series of red dots that fall along the top of the blue cloud and are parallel to the black line. But since the first quarter of 2009, average duration has increased much more rapidly than the rise in the unemployment rate would predict.\n\nThe extension of unemployment insurance benefits, while helpful in supporting unemployed households, likely accounts for a portion of the recent rise in unemployment duration. 2 Even so, we view the overall magnitude of the increase as an indicator that labor market conditions are even bleaker than the unemployment rate alone suggests. This weakness may also explain why the share of those outside the labor force has also grown so much—many people have simply stopped searching for jobs given the lack of demand for their services at prevailing wages.\n\nThe rise in long-term unemployment may have ramifications for the economy going forward. The likelihood of finding a job tends to decline as an individual remains out of work for a longer period. Partly this reflects the fact that those who typically have a difficult time finding work will tend to be unemployed longer. In this case, longer spells are a symptom rather than the source of an underlying problem. However, a long unemployment spell could itself cause deterioration in a worker’s skills, leaving some of the long-term unemployed with less bright job prospects even as the economy begins to revive.  This could contribute to high average unemployment duration for some time.\n\nWe can gain some insight into this dynamic from earlier periods. Figure 3 highlights the path of the unemployment rate and duration during the last two severe recessions. As you’d expect, both measures rise in tandem during the recession. But during the recovery phase, unemployment duration remains persistently high for quite some time even as the unemployment rate declines. We expect to see a similar pattern in the near future. And as I noted earlier, long-term unemployment tends to lead to permanent earnings losses, particularly for those who have previously invested heavily in job- or industry-specific skills. So, high unemployment durations could have long-lasting effects on consumer confidence and demand.\n\nTo summarize this discussion of the labor market, headline employment indicators appear to be roughly following a conventional track given the severity of the recession. But these measures may not fully capture the weakness displayed in the rising unemployment duration and the withdrawal of workers from the labor force. These developments thus raise the risk that the recovery in labor markets could be slow even as output returns to a well-established growth path.\n\nThe other side of an economy experiencing growing output but low labor utilization is high productivity growth. Indeed, productivity has been quite strong of late, particularly over the past three quarters. This is often the case in the early stages of a recovery, as firms first meet higher demand for their products and services without expanding their work force.\n\nA key question today is the degree to which the recent productivity surge reflects a temporary cyclical development or a more enduring increase in the level or trend rate of productivity. If the gains are predominantly driven by intense cost cutting, then they may be unsustainable once demand revives more persistently. In this case, we would expect hiring to pick up quickly as the economic expansion takes hold. However, if the level or trend in productivity has risen due to technological or other improvements, then higher average productivity gains will continue.  In this case, the implications for hiring are not clear. Higher levels of productivity will show through in both higher potential and actual output for the economy, and so need not necessarily come at the cost of lower labor input.\n\nThe relative importance of these factors also has consequences for our assessment of the degree to which resource slack exists in the economy. Since a higher level or trend of productivity implies a higher path for potential output, a given level of actual GDP would also be associated with a greater degree of economic slack. That is, the good news on productivity, if sustained, suggests that as of today we have a larger output gap to fill In contrast, some are skeptical that the economy really is operating far below sustainable levels. They argue that much of the drop in output during the recession was the result of a permanent reduction in the economy’s productive capacity, perhaps because certain financial market practices that had for a time enabled additional investments have now been discredited. According to this view, the strong productivity growth of recent quarters only goes a fraction of the way toward offsetting this decline in the level of potential output.\n\nOf course, the unemployment rate gives us another way to infer the degree of slack in the economy. My earlier discussion of the sharp rise in unemployment duration and decline in labor force attachment may lead one to think that slack is even greater than what is implied by the unemployment rate itself.\n\nHowever, it is possible that longer durations and lower labor force attachment could reflect broader structural changes in the economy, such as a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and those demanded by employers. There may also be other impediments that currently prevent workers from shifting to the industries or locations where jobs are available. Under these scenarios, labor market slack might actually be lower than what one might infer from the unemployment rate alone.\n\nI have just given you 2 minutes of classic two-handed economist speak. In the final analysis, however, the sheer magnitude of unemployment today is so large that there is little doubt in my mind that there is considerable slack in the economy. Incorporating alternative views about productivity and labor market behavior do not alter this general conclusion. The debate really boils down to whether the amount of slack in the economy is large or is extremely large.\n\nGiven this large degree of slack, there is a legitimate question of whether monetary policy could, and more fundamentally should, have done more to combat the deterioration in labor markets. As we all know, a lot was done. As the crisis arose, we first used our traditional tools, substantially cutting the federal funds rate and lending to banks through our discount window. As we neared a zero funds rate, we turned to nontraditional tools to clear up the choke points, providing liquidity directly to nonbank financial institutions and supporting a number of short-term credit markets. Finally, we reduced long-term interest rates further by purchasing additional medium- and long-term Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and the debt of government-sponsored enterprises.\n\nThese nontraditional actions helped us avoid what easily could have been an even more severe economic contraction. But the unemployment rate still hit 10 percent this fall.\n\nHad we done more, the most plausible action would have been to expand our Large Scale Asset Purchases (LSAP) program. Precisely quantifying the effect this would have had is difficult. A good place to start, though, is to look at the recent empirical evidence. 3 When significant new asset purchases were announced, our big, fluid financial markets built that information immediately into asset prices. For example, right after the March 2009 Treasury purchase announcement, ten-year Treasury yields fell about 50 basis points. Comparable declines occurred in Option Adjusted Spreads (OAS) on the announcement of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) purchases in November 2008. It might be reasonable to infer that say, doubling the size of the LSAPs might have doubled this impact on rates.\n\nHowever, I would attach more than the usual amount of uncertainty to such an inference. Part of my hesitation reflects our lack of understanding about the interactions between nontraditional monetary policy, interest rates, and economic activity. While research efforts at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere to assess the effects of nonstandard monetary policy have been ramped up considerably, to date we do not have a robust suite of formal models to reliably calibrate interventions of this sort.\n\nMoreover, there are reasons to expect that the impact of recent nontraditional policy actions might not have scaled up so simply. We initially responded to the financial crisis with our highest-value tool—a reduction in the funds rate—and then moved to our best alternative policies as interest rates approached zero. Finally, we turned to the LSAPs, which were designed to further lower long-term interest rates and thus stimulate demand for interest-sensitive spending, such as business fixed investment, housing, and durables goods expenditures. But the influence of lower rates on private sector decision-making may have reached the point of second-order importance relative to the countervailing forces of the housing overhang, business and household caution, and considerably tighter lending standards.\n\nMoreover, although it is impossible to quantify, a portion of the impact of our nontraditional actions may have come simply from boosting confidence. In those very dark times, I believe households, businesses, and financial markets were reassured that policymakers were acting in a decisive manner. Further asset purchases would not have had an additional effect of this kind.\n\nIn addition, on a practical level, the portfolio of future purchases likely would have looked different and therefore their overall effectiveness might have deviated from our recent experience. The Fed’s typical monthly purchases of new issuance MBS were so large that it left very little floating supply for private investors. This could have forced a larger LSAP program to concentrate more heavily in Treasuries or existing MBS. Though the empirical evidence is limited, these assets likely are less close substitutes than new MBS for many of the instruments used to finance spending on new capital goods, housing, and consumer durables. Consequently, the effect of their purchase on economic activity may be less.\n\nFinally, we must also keep in mind that more monetary stimulus also has costs. These could be considerable at higher LSAP levels. Many are already worried about the inflation implications of the Fed’s expanded balance sheet and the associated large increase in the monetary base. Currently, most of the increase in the monetary base is sitting idly in bank reserves—and because banks are not lending those reserves, they are not generating spending pressure. But leaving the current highly accommodative monetary policy in place for too long would eventually fuel inflationary pressures. Likewise, if the monetary base was expanded much beyond where we are today, the risk that such pressures would build as the economy recovers would be significantly increased. Furthermore, policymakers already face the task of unwinding a sizable balance sheet at the appropriate time and pace. Substantially increasing the size of asset purchases could have further complicated the exit process down the road.\n\nThat said, changes in economic conditions could alter the cost–benefit calculus with regard to the LSAP. Hopefully the recovery will progress without any serious bumps in the road and the inflation outlook will remain benign. But, as we have repeatedly indicated in the FOMC statements, the Committee will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.\n\n1 For further details, see Aaronson, Brave, and Schechter (2009).\n\n2 Aaronson, Mazumder, and Schechter (2010) apply estimates from Katz and Meyer (1990) and Card and Levine (2000) of the elasticity of increases in the maximum eligibility time for unemployment insurance benefits on the duration of unemployment to the current context. These calculations suggest that federal extensions may account for between 10 percent and 25 percent of the observed rise in mean durations from July 2008 through December 2009.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nIt's a pleasure to speak to you today. Let me start by thanking the McLean County Chamber of Commerce for inviting me, and Ryan Whitehouse who helped arrange my visit here today.\n\nThe U.S. economy currently faces a number of difficult challenges: These include weakness in the housing market, continued financial market turmoil, and the potential for more persistent inflation emanating from the surge in food and commodity prices. The confluence of these and other factors have added layers of complexity to the management of monetary policy. I recently returned from our regular policy meeting in Washington, where, after considering all of the issues, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to leave the federal funds rate unchanged at 2 percent. Today, I'd like to share with you some of the thinking that shapes my views about policy—namely, my thoughts on the near- and medium-term prospects for growth and inflation, the state of financial markets, and the role of monetary policy in the current environment. Before we begin, though, let me note that the views I express today are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nCurrent Economic Situation\n\nWe are in the midst of a sharp contraction in housing markets that began in 2006. Delinquency rates for residential real estate loans have more than doubled since the troubles began; single-family housing starts are down about two-thirds; and house prices have fallen about 16 percent from their peak, as measured by the Case—Shiller home price index. The inventory of homes for sale remains high. On average, declines in residential investment have subtracted a bit more than 1 percentage point per quarter from real GDP growth over the past two years. Although it is too early to say we are nearing the bottom of the housing cycle, in the most recent quarter residential investment reduced real GDP growth by a smaller magnitude—about two-thirds of a percentage point. As any economist will tell you, \"less bad\" can be a first step toward improvement.\n\nThe downward adjustment in housing activity has been associated with a doubling in the fraction of nonperforming mortgages since 2006. And over the past year, we have seen the deteriorating performance of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities spill over to other segments of financial markets. Market participants have reassessed the risk profiles of other similarly structured assets, and prices of these securities have declined as well. The re-pricing process has had a significant impact on the liquidity and capital positions of financial institutions. Declines in asset prices and the increase in nonperforming loans have eroded banks' capital positions. In response, many banks have taken steps to raise capital by issuing new equity, reducing dividend payments, and by selling certain assets. But, to the extent that capital ratios have continued to be strained, financial institutions have also restricted lending and worked to reduce the riskiness of their portfolios by tightening credit terms and standards. As a result, credit is now more costly and difficult to obtain for many kinds of household and business borrowing.\n\nFinancial turmoil and weakening housing markets are not the only factors weighing on economic activity. Over the past year, we also have experienced substantial increases in food and energy prices. These have reduced the purchasing power of households and increased firms' costs of materials, which have also weighed on economic growth. Labor markets have been weak. Payroll employment has declined steadily over the first seven months of this year, with a cumulative loss of over 450 thousand jobs. The largest job losses have been in the construction and manufacturing sectors. Also, the unemployment rate has risen by over a full percentage point during the past year, reaching 5.7 percent in July. Weak labor markets and high consumer prices have held back growth in real income. This, in conjunction with lower housing prices and stock market wealth, has resulted in a noticeable slowing in growth in consumer spending.\n\nThere are, however, some positive factors that have helped sustain growth. Declines in the dollar and solid growth by many of our trading partners have led to reductions in our trade deficit, adding substantially to real GDP growth in the second quarter. And, importantly, productivity has increased a healthy 2.8 percent over the past year. Productivity measures how much output the nonfarm business sector can produce for each hour of labor input. It is the fundamental determinant of our ability to generate economic well-being. And our workers and businesses have kept productivity on a solid uptrend by continually developing new productive technologies and new ways to use them.\n\nIndeed, in spite of the economic headwinds we face, real GDP was reported to have increased at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the second quarter. And recent data suggest that this figure will likely be revised up. However, this did come on the heels of stalled growth at the end of 2007 and a gain of only 0.9 percent in the first quarter of 2008. So, the strong challenges faced by consumers and businesses have reduced growth. But, last January, I was concerned that things could turn out to be much worse.\n\nIn addition to the challenges regarding growth, we also are dealing with some unfavorable developments with regard to inflation. At the beginning of the year I expected the inflation picture to be better than it is now. The large increases in food and energy prices that I mentioned earlier have contributed to a 4.1 percent increase in the personal consumption expenditures deflator over the past year. Even core inflation, which excludes both food and energy components, is unsettlingly high, growing 2.3 percent over the year ended in June. Indeed, total inflation has exceeded core inflation pretty consistently for over five years, with both measures above 2 percent during much of this time. I view these persistently high rates of overall and core inflation as important concerns for monetary policy.\n\nThis brings me to the discussion of how policy is set against the backdrop of such a challenging economic environment. I will begin with a somewhat general perspective. The Fed functions under a dual mandate to foster financial conditions that promote both maximum employment and price stability. Of course, maximum employment must be sustainable. This is usually interpreted as the level of employment that is consistent with a rate of growth that the real economy can maintain over time without leading to an increase in inflationary pressures. We refer to this rate as potential growth. Price stability, as former Chairman Greenspan often said, occurs when inflation does not significantly distort the economic behavior of households or businesses. Price stability does not mean that individual prices do not change. Inflation, in comparison, entails a widespread increase in prices across a broad spectrum of goods and services. I tend to view price stability as core inflation being in the narrow range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, and the more volatile overall inflation rate also averaging in this neighborhood over longer periods of time.\n\nIn practice there are a number of uncertainties and risks that must be carefully weighed when implementing monetary policy. First, policymakers must carefully assess the rate of potential output growth, in large part by estimating the trends in two of its key determinants, productivity and working-age population growth. In recent years, these two factors suggest potential growth is in the range of 2-1/2 to 3 percent. Second, central bankers rely upon data to evaluate where current growth is relative to potential. But the economy is very complex, and we frequently receive conflicting signals. So, it can be difficult to appraise the current situation and project the economy's likely future course. Third, given the assessment of the outlook, the Fed determines if a more accommodative or more restrictive policy is warranted. Evaluating the sources of risk to growth and inflation is also an important part of this decision. Finally, we need to deal with the fact that monetary policy takes time to influence real economic activity and inflation. So, as new information comes in, we are often put in the position of needing to alter course before the full impact of our past policy actions are completely evident.\n\nThe current monetary policy environment is even more complicated than usual. If we were using battlefield language to describe our situation, this would be a \"three-front conflict.\" Although real activity is weak, we also are simultaneously experiencing bad news on the inflation front in the form of higher energy and commodity prices. This creates the challenge of facilitating the economy's return toward more favorable growth rates without igniting greater inflationary pressures. The financial turmoil and subsequent tightening of credit conditions add another dimension of difficulty to the problem. I will return to this momentarily. But first let me discuss the economic outlook and how it is shaping policy decisions.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nFour times a year FOMC participants provide projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate for the current and following two years. The most recent projections were submitted at the June FOMC meeting. In general, the Committee's opinion was that growth had been somewhat stronger in the first half of the year than had been originally anticipated. Even so, the consensus view was that the economy would expand slowly over the next several quarters. However, participants continued to see significant downside risks to the forecast for growth. The Committee expected higher near-term headline and core inflation, largely due to the effects of recent high prices for energy and other commodities.\n\nSince these forecasts were made, I think the risks for growth have increased and the risks for inflation remain elevated and a concern. The detail underlying the GDP data and recent numbers for July point to some weakness in growth, particularly after the effects of the recent tax rebates recede. Consumption fell in June after adjusting for inflation. U.S. car and truck production and sales declined significantly further this spring, and the figures for July continued this trend. It is difficult, however, to know how much of the declines reflect cyclical economic weakness and how much are related to structural factors such as higher fuel costs and an unfavorable product mix. Financial markets remain under considerable stress. Labor markets have deteriorated further, and the housing market outlook continues to be uncertain. But inventories are in good shape in most industries. And net exports remain a solid positive, although export growth may taper off some given the softer economic outlook for some of our major trading partners. Despite these risks, as we move forward, I see real GDP growth returning near potential by 2010—somewhere in the range of 2-1/2 to 3 percent.\n\nWhile energy and commodity prices have moderated somewhat, both headline and core inflation remain high. Some measures of expectations for future inflation remain uncomfortably elevated. As energy prices level out and economic growth remains modest, I think inflation should moderate over the medium term, with PCE headline inflation declining to around 2 percent by 2010. Clearly, this forecast hinges upon developments in energy and commodity prices, as well as containing expectations of future inflation. Both of these present risks to the outlook.\n\nPolicy Setting\n\nThis environment presents substantial challenges to monetary policy. As you know, since last September, the Fed has lowered the fed funds rate from 5-1/4 to 2 percent. At the time, most forecasters' baseline outlook was for marked sluggishness in real economic activity. But forecasters also recognized the possibility of falling asset prices severely constricting credit and potentially intensifying and spreading the slowdown in the housing market into something much more widespread and acute. The Fed determined it prudent to take preemptive action in response to the unfolding situation. Our 325-basis-point cumulative cut in the funds rate was larger than we otherwise might have done in order to insure against the unlikely event of a severe downturn. That said, even though I think the current 2 percent funds rate is accommodative, it is not especially stimulative. This is because the financial market turmoil has meant that our funds rate reductions have led to less credit expansion to households and businesses than typically would be the case.\n\nIndeed, it has become increasingly clear to me that the fed funds rate alone is neither an adequate nor even an entirely appropriate tool for addressing instability in the financial markets. Further reductions in the fed funds rate could help provide additional liquidity to financial markets as a whole, but not necessarily to the most distressed portions of the market. And, in principle, if pushed too far, excess policy accommodation over an extended period of time would risk igniting inflation expectations. However, the ongoing challenges in financial markets indicate the continued need for substantial liquidity in order to facilitate their functioning and to ensure adequate funding for creditworthy businesses and households.\n\nAccordingly, the Federal Reserve has created several special lending facilities aimed at providing financial markets with liquidity and promoting orderly financial adjustments. Since last August, we have introduced the Term Discount Window, the Term Auction Facility, the Term Securities Lending Facility, the Term Options Program, and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility. Collectively these innovations are designed to increase market liquidity by lengthening Federal Reserve lending terms, by reducing the cost of borrowing relative to the fed funds rate, by expanding the range of eligible counterparties, and by enlarging the pool of eligible collateral. I should note that in order to provide the Fed with a cushion against credit risk, the value of collateral backing the loans at these facilities is set at a discount from the latest market prices for the pledged assets. These facilities have helped stabilize short-term credit markets somewhat and have injected much needed liquidity into the financial system. The success of these facilities—which, I would like to emphasize, should be measured against the list of feasible outcomes they can achieve—should help financial markets work through their problems over time.\n\nAt our meeting this past week the Fed left the benchmark fed funds rate unchanged at 2 percent. Of course, we policymakers must continuously reevaluate our policies to reflect current and forecasted conditions, and to ensure our assessments of risks are aligned to meet our long-term policy objectives. As I just discussed, from the perspective of last January, the real economy has performed better than was predicted. And while the second half of 2008 will likely be extremely sluggish, the risk of a severe slowdown seems less likely today than predicted at the beginning of the year. In addition, as I also noted, there is clearly an increased risk to inflation. Headline inflation has exceeded core inflation for an extended period of time, and even the latter has been above 2 percent for some time.\n\nIn evaluating inflation risks, we must be concerned about energy and food prices being passed through to core inflation. We run the risk of persistent widespread price increases being built into the expectations of households and businesses, and thus producing persistently higher bases for both inflation measures. Some have taken comfort in the fact that inflation has not yet been built into wage growth as evidence that inflationary expectations have not risen. But I am less sanguine because research indicates that by the time we have statistical confirmation that wages are increasing at rates higher than the rate of growth of productivity, a persistent rise in inflation most likely would already be in train.\n\nThere are clearly risks to the inflation outlook if expectations do not remain grounded. Any increase in inflation expectations would pose a risk to achieving our dual goals of price stability and maximum sustainable growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe current economic landscape poses a three-front conflict for policymakers: sluggish economic conditions with depressed housing and auto markets, rising inflation risks with high oil and commodity prices, and financial distress that is restraining credit growth. To date, relatively accommodative monetary policy has taken out insurance against downside risks of disorderly financial adjustment turning into a severe economic downturn. But rising inflation risks at a time of economic weakness present some difficult challenges for policy. At this point many financial market liquidity problems are being addressed through our special lending facilities. These additional tools allow our policy actions with regard to the fed funds rate to focus on broader macroeconomic goals—these are our commitment to price stability and sustainable growth.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood morning and thank you for inviting me to participate in this important discussion.\n\nWe are in the midst of the worst financial crisis of the past 70 years. Extraordinary disruptions in the flow of credit and liquidity have weighed on the economies in the United States, Central and Eastern Europe, and around the world. As events have unfolded over the past 20 months, the Federal Reserve, together with the United States Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), has implemented a broad range of policies aimed at mitigating the problems in our financial system and the fallout on the rest of the economy.\n\nI believe that our interventions are helping to address the difficulties we face and to eventually move the United States back to financial stability and economic recovery. And, as you are all well aware, capital flows are international. So, these efforts should also be positive factors for financial markets and economic activity around the world.\n\nToday I will concentrate my remarks on the Fed's responses to the liquidity and credit shocks that have affected the U.S. financial system. I will also discuss the challenges that lie ahead and our continued commitment to confront them. I should note that these are, of course, my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nCredit and liquidity shocks\n\nTrouble began in 2007, when falling housing prices and rising mortgage defaults produced strains in the market for securitized mortgages. As a result, many financial institutions reported severe losses. Famous names such as Bear Stearns, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group (AIG), were on that list. Some of these firms appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by other financial institutions. In the case of Bear Stearns, this involved assistance from the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury also were able to arrange loans and guarantees to AIG in order to avoid large-scale disruptions in markets that had exposures to credit default swaps written by AIG. In contrast, when Lehman Brothers experienced especially large losses, no sale or loan support could be made at suitable terms. As a result, Lehman went into bankruptcy last September.\n\nLehman Brothers' bankruptcy intensified market participants' concerns over the potential losses on a range of assets, as well as over the ability of their counterparties to meet contractual obligations. One important sector that was disrupted was the money market industry. Worried over losses, investors in money market funds began making redemptions. To meet these redemptions, some funds had to liquidate assets into an already depressed market, further lowering the prices of these instruments.\n\nThe disruptions in the money market industry were the product of two main shocks: a credit shock and a liquidity shock. First, because of deteriorating economic conditions, market participants expected greater losses on commercial paper and other short-term securities. This is what I refer to as a \"credit shock.\" Second, the ease of trading these securities worsened: transaction volumes shrank dramatically, and in some cases it was even difficult to obtain price quotes. This is what I call a \"liquidity shock.\" The two shocks are not independent, as deteriorating liquidity conditions can spillover to produce higher losses among market participants. The interplay between credit and liquidity shocks made it difficult for firms to issue all but the safest and most liquid commercial paper. Only very short-term, often overnight, debt was issued when market conditions were at their worst.\n\nIt is easy to see the role that \"flight to quality\" played in these events. And I would like to underscore that \"flight to liquidity\" alone was sufficiently severe to disrupt the functioning of some markets that were largely immune from credit shocks. For example, in the United States many student loan payments are guaranteed by the federal government. Despite these guarantees, liquidity disruptions have nearly shut down the auction rate securities markets that student loan providers had used to obtain a good deal of their funding. Subsequently, they have had substantial difficulty in attracting investors to other types of securities backed by student loans. A second example is the market for Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). Like other Treasury securities, TIPS benefit from the guarantee of the federal government. Yet, in past months they have traded at a significant discount relative to more liquid (on-the-run) nominal Treasuries.\n\nMonetary policy in exceptional times\n\nThe Federal Reserve has responded aggressively to these extraordinary events. Since September 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has lowered the target for the federal funds rate—our standard overnight interest rate policy lever—bringing it to essentially zero in December of last year. In addition, we have made adjustments to make it more attractive for banks to borrow from the discount window.\n\nHowever, financial distress, the weak outlook for growth, and the prospects for unusually low inflation call for more policy accommodation. With the funds rate near zero, the Fed has had to work to find new ways to inject monetary accommodation into the economy.\n\nOne way to make monetary policy more accommodating is to work to lower the unusual liquidity and risk premia that are raising private and longer-term borrowing costs. In this arena, the Federal Reserve has adopted several innovative policies that are providing liquidity support to a range of institutions and markets.\n\nSome of these policies were aimed at easing the liquidity pressures I spoke about earlier that hit the money market funds and commercial paper markets last fall. Two important ones were the Money Market Investor Funding Facility (or MMIF) and the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF).\n\nMost recently, a new joint program with the Treasury, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, became effective on March 19. The first lending through this temporary facility is designed to make credit available to consumers and small businesses on more favorable terms by facilitating the issuance of new asset-backed securities (ABS) and improving the market conditions for ABS more generally. The TALF is providing financing to investors to support their purchases of certain highly-rated ABS backed by newly and recently originated auto loans, credit card loans, student loans, and small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. Purchasers of these ABS will be able to borrow from the TALF, using the securities themselves as collateral.\n\nThe ABS market has typically played a critical role in providing credit to U.S. consumers and small businesses. However, this market has virtually closed since the worsening of the financial crisis last October. The TALF is aimed at re-opening this market by helping lenders finance new issues. Moreover, the program provides a lending backstop that will enhance the liquidity value of TALF-eligible securities. Since the announcement of the TALF, liquidity conditions in these securities have already improved. It is important to note that the TALF loans are for three years—medium-term loans that are noticeably longer than those available through other Fed lending facilities. So, TALF can impact longer-run interest rates.\n\nAnother important feature of the TALF is that the terms on these loans are attractive during current market conditions but are more costly than those that prevail during more normal times. So, TALF loans will become unattractive when conditions improve in markets for traditional sources of funding. Appropriate haircuts on the collateral and funding from the Treasury provide the Fed with credit protection on the facility.\n\nI should also note that, as conditions warrant, we will be expanding existing programs. For instance, the Fed already is undertaking a substantial expansion of the TALF. Last Thursday we added four new categories to the list of TALF-eligible ABS. And yesterday an expansion of the TALF to legacy assets was announced, with the new assets expected to include non-agency residential and commercial mortgaged-backed securities.\n\nMoreover, on March 18 the FOMC decided to further increase the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet by purchasing up to $1.15 trillion of additional securities, comprising (up to) $300 billion of longer-term Treasuries, (up to) $750 billion more of agency mortgage-backed securities, and (up to) $100 billion more of agency debt. Prices of Treasuries jumped sharply after the FOMC announcement, with the ten-year yield falling nearly 50 basis points over the day.\n\nTogether with the Treasury and the FDIC, the Fed earlier had also taken exceptional measures to attenuate the effect of the credit shock. For example, we provided assistance to JPMorgan Chase in the acquisition of Bear Stearns, and we arranged the ring-fencing of some non-performing assets held by Citi and Bank of America. Moreover, we provided capital to support the purchase of some collateralized debt obligations and the unwinding of AIG's credit default swap positions.\n\nAdditional interventions to deal with the credit crisis are being implemented. For instance, there is the Treasury's Financial Stability Plan. The plan includes a Capital Assistance Program to strengthen U.S. financial institutions so that they have sufficient lending capacity to better support economic recovery. The plan also includes a Public-Private Investment Program, aimed at providing greater means for financial institutions to cleanse their balance sheets of what are often referred to as \"legacy\" assets. Many of the details of this program were released yesterday, including the expansion of the Fed's TALF to legacy assets that I just mentioned.\n\nWhen economic activity recovers and financial conditions normalize, the use of nontraditional policy tools and the size of the Fed's balance sheet will be reduced, and the FOMC will return to its traditional focus on the federal funds rate. Some of this wind-down process will occur naturally as market conditions improve, given the particular pricing and maturity design features of these programs. Still, financial market participants need to be prepared for the eventual dismantling of the facilities that have been put in place during the financial turmoil. Fortunately, it is most likely that this dismantling would be associated with better economic and financial performance.\n\nConceptual motivations for these new initiatives\n\nLet me briefly step back and discuss these programs at a more conceptual level. In a well-functioning financial system, arbitrage moves funds across markets and balances out profit opportunities. It thus aligns term and risk-adjusted returns across markets. This is the reason, for example, why our typical moves to lower the short-term risk-free federal funds rate affect borrowing rates over a large range of maturity and risk structures. When financial markets are functioning well, the Fed can focus on the size of the liquidity injection instead of the particular segment of the market in which the injection occurs.\n\nBut that is not the case today. There is abundant evidence that arbitrage opportunities remain unexploited. Because of balance-sheet capacity limitations, or because of higher-than-normal uncertainty and risk aversion, market participants are largely avoiding markets that are undergoing unusual stress. For instance, as I mentioned previously, liquidity disruptions have made it difficult to attract investors to several types of securities backed by student loans, even in the presence of a federal government guarantee.\n\nOne way of thinking about these developments is that markets have become highly segmented. We do not see funds flowing in to take advantage of apparent profit opportunities with respect to distressed assets. If they were, they could ease liquidity pressures in these sectors and help keep some problems from spilling over into solvency concerns.\n\nThe flip side of this market segmentation is that liquidity injections aimed directly at a particular distressed market are less likely to leak out to other areas. The injections thus can significantly improve that market's functioning, seeding its transition to more normal liquidity and risk valuations. This is the rationale for focusing our nontraditional policies on loans and securities that affect transactions in particular key markets where we see points of stress. But a downside is that markets that are not the particular focus of policy intervention could experience some relative disadvantage because of the segmentation.\n\nAs stressed markets improve, more normal functioning of the financial system as a whole can be achieved. Market participants will become more willing to carry on their usual arbitrage activities, and segmentation will diminish. This will diminish both the need and usage of the special programs we have created.\n\nBecause segmentation will change dynamically, the effectiveness and unintended consequences of credit policies can shift over time and in unexpected ways. This highlights the need for careful design and continuous monitoring of these programs.\n\nThe programs I discussed today will help improve credit and liquidity conditions in U.S. financial markets. Since capital flows are international, these initiatives have the potential to positively impact capital markets around the world as well.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has also worked together with other countries to address pressures in global money markets directly. For instance, the Fed has established temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with several nations' central banks. These facilities are designed to help improve liquidity conditions in global financial markets and to make it easier to obtain U.S. dollar funding.\n\nOther international efforts are in place to provide direct support to countries that have been particularly affected by the financial crisis. For instance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has provided funds to several Central and Eastern European countries, including Latvia, Hungary, Ukraine, and Belarus; and Romania is in talks with the IMF. Moreover, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Investment Bank (EIB) Group, and the World Bank Group recently pledged to provide up to €24.5 billion to support the banking sectors in Central and Eastern Europe and to fund lending to businesses hit by the global economic crisis.\n\nConclusions\n\nModern economic theories usually imply that there is little the public sector can do to offset a cyclical contraction in technology except to offset, to some degree, rigidities that affect the economy's response to the shock. This logic would carry over to financial shocks as well, if we chose to model them as a negative cost shock to an intermediate input.\n\nHowever, there are reasons to believe that policy has a very different role to play in mitigating the impact of financial shocks. For one thing, the Fed and other financial regulators are themselves part of the financial intermediation process. This means there could be alternative policy instruments that might directly affect the way the economy responds to a financial shock.\n\nSince August 2007, the FOMC's policy decisions have been calibrated to deal with the \"adverse feedback loop\" between disruptions to financial market stability and the real economy. This focus has influenced not only the setting of the funds rate, but also the implementation of several new policies aimed directly at the financial shocks, some of which I have discussed today.\n\nI believe these initiatives will help in restoring the normal functioning of the financial system. They will also have a stabilizing effect on markets around the world and will therefore eventually help stimulate worldwide economic recovery.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

    "text": "Today I would like to discuss some of the challenges that the recent turmoil in financial markets poses for research in both financial markets and monetary economics. I am sure that many of you, too, have been struggling with the questions and problems that I will be talking about this evening. And, of course, I need to state from the start that the views I will be expressing are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOver the years, the research community and policymakers have developed a good framework for thinking about monetary policy reactions to real–side shocks. For instance, if we think about the appropriate policy response to an oil shock, there is widespread agreement on the broad outline of models that are useful to answer the question. Typically, we would turn to a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, (DSGE) model, with both nominal and real rigidities; estimate or calibrate the parameters of the model; and then trace out the responses to the real shock under different policy actions—and perhaps under different policy responses. Certainly many details remain disputed, such as the extent of nominal versus real rigidities, or the appropriate form of adjustment costs; these details are very important, but they do not challenge the basic tools we empirical macroeconomists use for policy analysis.\n\nHowever, unlike real shocks, we don't, as yet, have such a well-developed toolkit with which to analyze financial shocks. The events of the past year certainly have reminded us of this point. So tonight I would like to discuss some of the difficulties we face in modeling financial shocks, and do so through the prism of the recent turmoil in financial markets.\n\nLet's step back and think about some of the tough questions I am sure all of us have been grappling with over the past year. Can markets easily work around the disruptions to the credit intermediation process that channels funds from savers to borrowers? Or have we experienced a permanent destruction in something we might want to think about as the financial sector capital stock? If so, does the economy need to develop entirely new infrastructures for some types of intermediation, or perhaps will reviving earlier more traditional approaches suffice once the turmoil has abated? And how will we know when markets settle out to the \"new normal steady state?\" With regard to policy, what—if any—public sector actions can assist this transition? Finally, and most importantly, what are the consequences of this turmoil for the achievement of the Fed's ultimate policy goals—maximum sustainable growth and price stability?\n\nTo answer these questions and provide a better basis for policy prescriptions, we need to be able to model how various disruptions in financial markets affect credit provision, and how these effects, in turn, impact the real economy. Ideally, we would want to analyze these financial developments using a well-articulated and empirically implementable modeling framework. Executing this program is tricky business. And, as I will discuss, I think we still have some work left to do—first in better understanding the fundamentals underlying the current financial shocks and, once we do, in figuring out how to best adjust our empirical models to measure their influence on the macroeconomy.\n\nCharacterizing Financial Shocks in Theoretical Models\n\nAt the Chicago Fed, our initial response to the financial turmoil was to try to classify the financial crisis as a shock that could easily be inserted into a standard DSGE model.\n\nHowever, deciding on the appropriate characterization of the shock has turned out to be a frustrating exercise. Modern macro models have identified and estimated a number of \"standard\" shocks—shocks to total factor productivity (TFP), marginal rates of substitutions, monetary policy, and so on. But less progress has been made with regard to modeling a \"financial infrastructure shock.\"\n\nNow, a term like \"financial infrastructure shock\" can encompass a large variety of episodes. I will focus on the recent troubles experienced by secondary financial markets, evidenced by the large increase in yield spreads for a wide range of structured securities and even the failure of certain assets to trade at any price. Of course, these started in the market for mortgage-backed and related securities and then spread to other types of structured finance.\n\nThe first step is to look at abstract theoretical models. These have shown that asymmetric information, moral hazard, and agency issues can generate an important role for liquid assets in channeling credit between lenders and borrowers.\n\nOne natural starting point is the model of Diamond and Dybvig and the large literature that followed it. 1 These papers consider the problems that information asymmetries pose for the functioning of primary credit markets, the role of liquidity in addressing such problems, and the possibility of speculative runs in such environments. While they traditionally have been applied to the banking sector, they can also be used to think about a broader class of intermediaries that borrow short-term funds to finance less liquid, long-term investments; this broad class may include investment banks, broker-dealers, various off-balance-sheet entities such as structured investment vehicles, and even hedge funds. Accordingly, these models are helpful for thinking about the current situation, in which liquidity shortages have caused a number of markets to seize up and have resulted in run-like activity on some non-bank lenders.\n\nNonetheless, there is a good deal that these models leave unexplained. They simply take as given the illiquidity of long-term investments that are traded in primary capital markets in which borrowers and lenders interact directly. They do not explain illiquidity per se. As such, they fall short in explaining the current turmoil, which in large part reflects the sudden illiquidity of some assets that used to be re-traded in very deep secondary markets. 2\n\nRecently, Kiyotaki and Moore developed a model in which credit frictions operate not only in the primary market but also in secondary markets. 3 They trace out some implications for consumption when liquidity seizes up, and have some interesting policy prescriptions that I will discuss in a minute. That said, they too take as given the degree of liquidity: The shock to liquidity is a primitive in their model, with no explanation why some assets that previously were very liquid suddenly stop being traded. Without knowing this, it is difficult to think about the full effects of the shock on economic activity or the way central bank policy ought to react.\n\nNow I think there are some models that give plausible explanations for certain aspects of the current shock to liquidity. One stems from Akerlof's \"lemons\" paper, which studies markets under adverse selection. The way this story plays out in the current turmoil starts with the downturn in housing markets leading to an increase in mortgage defaults and an associated drastic reassessment of the risks of investing in mortgage-backed securities. Valuation has been made even more difficult by the fact that recently issued loans have had significantly different default profiles from previous vintages. As a consequence, assets that were previously considered fairly homogeneous and reasonably straightforward to price suddenly looked much more diverse. As the degree of informational asymmetry was perceived to widen, financial investors became much more concerned about a lemons problem.\n\nAs Akerlof showed, adverse selection can generate a vicious cycle that could even lead to a complete market shut down: This is because sellers of high-quality securities drop out, and this depresses the market price and leads more sellers to drop out, thus setting off a continuing cycle of price declines and exit of high-quality assets.\n\nI think this story begins to approximate some of the malfunctions in the mortgage-backed securities market. But it leaves open the question of why liquidity dried up in markets that were not tied to housing. One reason may be that the securitization process was similar across a wide spectrum of financial liabilities. This may have led market participants to worry about the potential for similar lemons problems to emerge among a much broader class of asset-backed paper, generating contagion across financial markets.\n\nWhile very useful for organizing our thinking, these models provide only highly stylized characterizations of how liquidity problems arise, and they fall short on modeling how they might feed back onto the consumption and investment decisions of households and businesses. So how can we capture the insights from these models and import them to a broader macro setting? And can we incorporate them into models that could be implemented empirically?\n\nEmpirical Implementations\n\nThe first question to ask is whether we can make some straightforward modifications to an otherwise standard-looking DSGE model and obtain useful policy prescriptions. There have been some important efforts to do so in the literature.\n\nA financial market shock may have some characteristics of a DSGE TFP shock: The cost of producing an intermediate input—credit intermediation—has become more expensive. This is how the shock is modeled in recent research by Curdia and Woodford. 4 In their analysis, a negative financial shock increases the costs of intermediation between savers and borrowers, and increases the spread between the interest rates faced by the two groups.\n\nAlternatively, there is a long history of empirical studies of the effects of credit frictions on output and inflation. Here I am thinking about the VAR and other reduced form models meant to capture the influence of the financial accelerator and the credit channel for monetary policy. 5 Subsequently, some attempts have been made to incorporate these effects into more structural models. Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (BGG) have incorporated credit frictions from an explicit model of asymmetric information into an otherwise standard business-cycle calibration framework; 6 in their model, the borrowers' net worth is an important factor that affects the cost of capital. Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno have enriched Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchirst's setup in a medium-scale macroeconomic model that incorporates more economic variables than BGG and correspondingly includes more shocks. 7 They show that shocks to financial frictions may be very important in explaining the pattern of investment and stock market valuation in the run-up of the late 1990s and the consequent reversal of 2000-02. De Fiore and Tristani also develop a similar model in the paper presented at this conference. 8\n\nThese studies are very important and provide us with a very useful perspective. Yet they are identifying financial shocks largely in a reduced-form manner—either as an exogenous increase in interest rate spreads or net worth or as a shift in the demand for capital due to tightening of credit market constraints. To capture the current situation, we need to have a better idea of how the events in financial markets map into the parameters and shocks identified in these models. My feeling is that this probably requires embedding a richer specification of the financial intermediation process into these empirical frameworks.\n\nOne reason is that there are dimensions along which financial capital is not like the typical intermediate input in a DSGE model. In a number of theoretical models, financial inputs can be subject to discontinuities: Seemingly small changes in the borrowers' net worth or perceived risk can bring about radical consequences in market performance. Perhaps the recent events in the mortgage-backed and related structured security markets are an example of such a breakdown—indeed, one that is of macroeconomic importance.\n\nSuch discontinuities are a challenge for our standard empirical models. These models are typically solved by taking a local approximation around a balanced growth path. This approach is not designed to capture discrete jumps in equilibria. In addition, some of the estimated coefficients in our standard models may not be invariant to the onset of a liquidity crisis. This suggests that a regime-shifting model could be helpful, with a \"normal\" regime alternating with a \"liquidity crisis\" regime. But, still, how should we parameterize the crisis regime? If we observed liquidity crises often, we could estimate these parameters. But we don't experience crises very often, so it's asking a lot of any empirical model to accomplish this identification.\n\nSo my guess is that we can not gain a good deal of insight into when markets will \"return to normal,\" and what \"normal\" will look like from these models' estimated impulse response functions. Indeed, the rarity of crisis events and changes in the structure of markets makes it difficult to use even simple statistics, such as risk spreads and volatility measures, to gauge the path to the \"new normal.\"\n\nPolicy Issues\n\nNow let me turn to the policy dimension of the challenges that I have discussed so far. Modern models usually say there is little the public sector can do to offset a cyclical contraction in technology except to offset, to some degree, rigidities that affect the economy's response to the shock. This implication would carry over to financial shocks if we simply chose to model them as a negative cost shock to an intermediate input.\n\nHowever, there are reasons to believe that financial shocks may be very different when it comes to policy prescriptions. For one thing, the Fed and other financial regulators are themselves part of the intermediation infrastructure. This means that we potentially have a number of alternative policy instruments that might directly affect the way the economy responds to a financial shock.\n\nSince last August, the FOMC's policy decisions have been calibrated in part to avoid a \"adverse feedback loop\" between disruptions to financial market stability and the real economy. This focus has influenced both the setting of the funds rate and the implementation of a number of new policies.\n\nIn this context, the Fed has added a number of new lending facilities: the Term Auction Facility, the Term Securities Lending Facility, and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility. These directly impact the intermediation process independently of the federal funds rate—indeed, we have purposefully sterilized the effects of these facilities on the funds rate.\n\nIn addition, on September 7 the Department of Treasury added a new lending facility for Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). This is aimed at supporting the flow of credit to mortgage markets and the associated liquidity of mortgage-backed securities.\n\nSuch policies do have counterparts in some of the work I cited earlier. As an example, in Kiyotaki and Moore's analysis, efficiency may be enhanced if the central bank offers more liquid assets to the private market in exchange for less-liquid ones. This is the case even though the central bank intervention has no effect on the liquidity of each class of assets. However, this strategy is potentially even more important if adverse selection is in play because here the intervention does affect liquidity. By allowing newly illiquid assets to be used as collateral, the central bank may be setting a floor on their value, which may undo—or at least limit—the vicious cycle that I described earlier in the Akerlof model. This could buy time for information to spread among market players and reinvigorate the intermediation process—perhaps in a different form, though, than how it operated in the pre-turmoil period.\n\nInterestingly, our Term Securities Lending Facility, which the Fed implemented in mid-March, roughly corresponds to the Kiyotaki and Moore recommendations. Our approach with regard to accepting and valuing collateral has been very careful in minimizing the credit risks assumed by the Federal Reserve Banks. Nonetheless, any plan that offers price support, even indirectly, does entail some potential risk to our balance sheet and could have other costs in terms of distorting price signals and moral hazard fallout. Kiyotaki and Moore do not provide any insight into these costs. So, we are left with many questions. How long should the central bank intervention last and how large should it be? What are its effects on the incentives for market participants to acquire information before a crisis unfolds? What markets deserve our attention? After all, Akerlof's original example was about the used car market; I certainly would not want the Fed to start accepting used cars as collateral!\n\nEven once we answer these questions, we have to address the implications of the new policy tools for our ultimate policy mandates of promoting maximum sustainable growth and price stability. This includes accounting for the interaction between the new tools and our traditional instrument of monetary policy—the short-term interest rate. An important component of this analysis is thinking about the degree to which the impaired assets used to be close substitutes for what some may call \"traditional money.\" If they were good substitutes, does a market breakdown that renders these assets illiquid create a potentially deflationary shock? If not, are there inflationary implications from swapping liquid Treasury securities for less-liquid assets or expanding the direct lending facilities that use such assets as collateral?\n\nThis question brings us back to the notoriously difficult issue of identifying the channels through which liquid assets generate price pressures, especially in the short run. And, as an empirical question, we are faced with identifying which credit aggregates or interest spreads best capture the relevant degree of substitutability.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo answer all of these challenging questions, it will be extremely useful to seek a more unified perspective of the role of financial frictions in modern macroeconomic models. In this way, we will be able to identify the independent roles of our traditional monetary policy tools and our new lending facilities, as well as the interaction between the old and new tools. Developing these models is up to the research community—from the research shops at central banks to academic departments to independent think tanks. And we policymakers are eagerly awaiting the results.\n\nNotes\n\n1 Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nI am delighted to be here today to share my thoughts about the economy and the financial circumstances we are currently facing.\n\nThough I have been president for only six months, I have had the extremely useful experience of attending Federal Open Market Committee meetings since 1995 — first, as a senior staffer, and since 2003, as the Bank's research director. Last September, as a newly installed Fed president, I was certainly looking forward with great anticipation to contributing to the discussion of monetary policy at the FOMC meetings. Considering everything that has happened since last summer, the safest comment I can make about this experience is, it's been everything I expected — and more.\n\nToday, I would like to share my thoughts on the state of the economy and the uncertainties over the outlook. I will be giving particular attention to the effects that a number of unusual and complex asset valuation issues may be having on the financial conditions faced by households and firms. As always, my remarks this afternoon represent my own opinions, and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or those of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nReview of the Current Economic Situation\n\nOverall, the U.S. economy grew at a solid pace in 2006 and over the first three quarters of 2007. Real GDP rose at an average annual rate of 2-3/4 percent over this period — which is a bit above my assessment of the economy's long-run sustainable rate of growth. This gain was achieved despite a plunge in residential construction, which reduced growth by an average of 0.8 percentage points over this period. Overall GDP growth remained healthy because the rest of the economy was performing quite well: Business fixed investment and household consumption rose at solid rates, and the trade deficit fell, led by robust increases in exports.\n\nThis resilience of overall economic growth in the face of significant sectoral challenges is part of a long-running story. Since the mid-1980s, the U.S. has been in the midst of what economists call the Great Moderation, in which fluctuations in overall GDP and inflation have been smaller than they were over the previous 40 years. Improvements in productivity, better policy, and some good luck appear to have made aggregate activity more resilient to the shocks that have hit individual sectors of the economy.\n\nBut that resilience continues to be challenged by new developments. Today we are faced with the challenges presented by the recent turmoil in financial markets. By now, this story is familiar to most in the room, but it bears repeating because of its importance.\n\nThe underpinnings for this shock began to form earlier in this decade with the rapid expansion of the subprime mortgage market. Most of these mortgages were sold by their originators to financial entities that bundled them together in mortgage-backed securities. In turn, these securities were restructured into a variety of new securities or used as collateral for other financial instruments. At their most complex levels, the income flows from monthly subprime mortgage payments supported many layers of highly structured securities that were held by a wide range of investors. Of course, such complex financial engineering was not limited to subprime mortgages, but was used to securitize a wide range of lending activities.\n\nHistorically, subprime mortgages had experienced relatively modest default rates, even during the 2001 recession. However, by mid-decade we now know that underwriting standards had become lax and that originations had expanded significantly. Then, in 2006 and 2007, housing markets began to deteriorate and delinquencies and defaults on subprime mortgages increased substantially. As this continued, it became clear that the payment flows on these mortgages would be insufficient to meet obligations to the owners of some bonds and downstream structured securities. Even the highly rated tranches of subprime-related securities turned out to be riskier than investors had thought at the time they were issued.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, a growing number of market participants began to realize the negative implications that these defaults had for the value of subprime-backed debt instruments. Many investors also began to question if they had underestimated the risk of other complex securities, whether they contained subprime-related debt or not. This situation was complicated by the fact that many of these securities had been purchased by special purpose financial institutions that had raised the necessary funds through short-term borrowing in the commercial paper market. These institutions had difficulty rolling over this paper at existing terms. Investors demanded shorter maturities and higher risk premiums to compensate for uncertainty over the valuation of collateral, potential needs for liquidity, and counterparty risks. Liquidity became scarce — as evidenced, for example, by large increases in spreads between overnight and term financing rates.\n\nThese financial challenges began to weigh noticeably on the economy as we went through the fourth quarter. A number of monthly indicators pointed to a slowdown in the pace of growth. Notably, housing fell sharply further in November and December. In part, this reflected fallout from the financial turmoil: Lenders shied away almost completely from originating subprime mortgages; markets also backed off securitizing any mortgage other than those eligible for issuance by government-sponsored agencies. This raised the relative costs of obtaining a jumbo mortgage, even for well-qualified buyers. In addition, labor markets softened — hiring slowed and the unemployment rate rose. Labor income is the most important factor supporting household consumption, and while the level of consumer spending did increase last quarter, it did so at a relatively modest pace.\n\nIn assessing the extent of the current slowdown, I find it useful to look at an index we developed at the Chicago Fed in 2000 to summarize the information in a large number of monthly indicators of economic activity. The index is the Chicago Fed National Activity Index, or CFNAI. An index value of zero is consistent with trend growth in overall GDP. The three-month moving average of the CFNAI fell to -0.67 in December. A study I did back in 2002 suggests that readings like this indicate a greater than 50 percent probability that the economy is in a recession. Although there are reasons to discount this likelihood somewhat, it is clear that the U.S. economy currently faces substantial headwinds.\n\nIn spite of these headwinds, the economy did record positive but very low growth in the fourth quarter of 2007. Real GDP inched up at a 0.6 percent annual rate. For the first quarter of 2008, we have only limited data in hand, but much of these data have been disappointing. Payroll employment edged down in January, motor vehicle sales fell, and some measures of business activity were quite weak. However, some indicators have been a touch more positive. For example, retail sales posted a modest increase in January, and the forward-looking data on orders for capital goods ended last year on a positive note.\n\nIn financial markets, the unusual liquidity pressures have receded some since the turn of the year. Some of the earlier pressure reflected financial firms' desire to show very liquid balance sheets on their end-of-year financial statements. In addition, central banks made special efforts to provide liquidity to the financial system. On the Fed's part, we cut the federal funds rate, our principal policy tool, and also lowered the cost and lengthened the maturity at which banks can borrow from us at the discount window. Furthermore, we instituted a new Term Auction Credit Facility to augment regular borrowing at the discount window. However, despite the improvement in liquidity, overall credit conditions are still strained, and the lending environment is much less receptive to risk-taking than it was prior to last August.\n\nSo we are in the midst of a period of soft economic activity. We also are in a period of heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.\n\nThe Role of Credit Intermediation\n\nThis uncertainty stems from the inherent difficulty in gauging the effects of adjustments in the financial sector on the spending capacity of households and firms. One reason it is so difficult is that the degree of financial turmoil we have experienced over the past few months is a relatively rare occurrence in the modern U.S. economy. We just do not have much historical precedent to go on. Nevertheless, we do know that when financial stress emerges, we must think more thoroughly about the role of credit intermediation in the economy.\n\nAs a general principle, difficulties in the credit intermediation process can arise from several sources. I first want to focus on a source that is a particularly relevant issue for the situation today — that is, the effects of an erosion in the value of assets. Asset devaluation reduces both the ease with which borrowers can borrow and the capacity of lenders to lend. In turn, this can decrease the flow of credit from savers to spenders, resulting in a reduction in economic activity.\n\nThe first assets to consider are houses. The declines in house prices we have experienced reduce housing equity and erode the collateral value of a home against the original loan. Housing-backed loans are now riskier, and so the costs and terms of such borrowing have become more restrictive.\n\nA number of asset valuation issues weigh on the financial sectors' lending capacity. The lower income flows and the drop in valuations for subprime-related securities reduce the ability of such assets to service existing structured debt securities or to support new liabilities aimed at expanding lending capacity. In addition, both for regulatory reasons and to signal their soundness to investors, lenders seek to maintain a certain minimum ratio of capital to assets. These ratios have been under stress for a number of reasons. Losses on subprime-related assets and other securities directly reduce equity capital. In addition, for legal or reputational purposes, some banks were forced to take assets held by stressed special purpose vehicles back onto their balance sheets at a loss. They also found themselves holding loans associated with leveraged buyouts that they were unable to sell.\n\nRestoring capital ratios requires that lenders either raise new equity, sell assets, or cut back on new lending. Selling assets or reducing lending could have adverse effects on the real economy. Fortunately, a number of large banks have successfully raised new capital, with some of the most publicized deals involving investments from sovereign wealth funds. These infusions will help buffer the impact of balance-sheet adjustments on bank lending.\n\nFurthermore, the reduced availability of bank loans may be at least partially offset by increased financing from nonbank lenders, such as insurance companies, hedge funds, and private equity funds. And some high-quality nonfinancial firms have raised substantial funds on the corporate bond market. Indeed, in the recent survey of purchasing managers in nonmanufacturing business, despite a very weak reading on overall activity, only 15 percent of the respondents thought that financial turmoil was hampering their ability to obtain financing.\n\nA second intermediation-related issue revolves around how much the cost of credit has increased. One fallout we have seen from the credit difficulties is a reduced appetite for funding risky investment projects. Lenders are demanding greater compensation for risk, and this has resulted in an increase in the price of credit to many households and nonfinancial businesses. For example, in the Fed's January survey of senior loan officers, there was a notable increase in the number of banks reporting tighter standards and increased spreads on loans to both households and businesses. Risk premiums on corporate bonds, particularly those below investment grade, have increased noticeably, and issuance of high-yield bonds is down a good deal. Similar increases in risk premiums have been seen in the secondary markets for higher-risk bank loans and commercial mortgage-backed real estate.\n\nTo be sure, some of the increase in risk spreads and tighter lending terms represents a typical response to heightened concerns over the macroeconomy as opposed to atypical effects from the intermediation problems. And some of the increase is likely a healthy return to more prudent risk-pricing.\n\nIn addition, the cost of funds has fallen for many low-risk borrowers owing to interest rate declines since August. Monetary policy actions have lowered the federal funds rate 225 basis points; the 30-year conforming mortgage rate has dropped about 100 basis points to 5.7 percent; and rates on investment grade corporate bonds also are down.\n\nA third issue is the potential for asset-related credit intermediation problems to generate a self-reinforcing dynamic that harms the economy. The process of selling assets — whether those repossessed in defaults or those that a financial institution sells to restore its capital position — increases the supply of such assets on the market. This can lead to additional erosion of asset values, further cutbacks in borrowing and lending capacity, and broader softness in spending by households and businesses. Such a downward spiral could have a serious impact on the macroeconomy.\n\nThe FRB-Chicago Outlook\n\nTaking all of this into consideration, our outlook at the Chicago Fed is for real GDP to increase in the first half of the year, but at a very sluggish rate. However, we expect growth will pick up to near potential by late in the year and continue at or a bit above this pace in 2009.\n\nThis outlook takes into account a large number of unusual factors holding back activity. The large overhang of unsold homes will continue to restrain residential investment. Greater caution on the part of businesses and consumers will likely limit increases in their discretionary expenditures. And the strains on credit intermediation and financial balance sheets will likely hold down growth to a degree for some time. Since these financial issues are being worked out against the backdrop of a soft economy, we also have to recognize the risk that interactions between the two might reinforce the weakness in the economy.\n\nIn response to these downside influences, and with inflation expectations contained, I believe a relatively accommodative monetary policy is appropriate. At 3 percent, the current federal funds rate is relatively accommodative and should support stronger growth. Indeed, because monetary policy works with a lag, the effects of last fall's rate cuts are probably just being felt, while the cumulative declines should do more to promote growth as we move through the year.\n\nIn addition, the fiscal stimulus bill the President signed yesterday will likely boost spending in the second half of the year.\n\nThe economy's inherent resiliency and internal adjustment mechanisms also will work to support growth. In the current situation, this adjustment importantly includes the work the financial sector is doing in \"price discovery,\" that is, the process of determining the proper valuation of the assets they hold in light of reevaluations of their expected cash flows and risks to these flows. In addition, intermediaries will do more work in restoring their balance sheets. Together, these activities will eventually reduce the drag from the lending and credit channels on the real economy.\n\nAnother part of the internal adjustment process centers on housing. As house prices fall, more buyers will find it worthwhile to enter the market. Eventually, price adjustments will stabilize supply and demand, and the drag from residential construction on the economy will subside.\n\nFinally, there is productivity. Productivity is the fundamental determinant to growth in the longer run — it determines how we can turn labor and capital inputs into the goods and services we consume and invest. The good news here is that, while it is not as robust as it was in the late 1990s and early this decade, the underlying trend in productivity in the U.S. economy is still solid. This trend provides a sound base for production and income generation to move forward over the longer haul.\n\nAlthough most of the recent concern about the U.S. economy has been focused on growth, we must also be mindful of inflationary pressures. The recent news here has been somewhat disappointing. We have experienced large increases in food and energy prices, and other commodity prices are high; in addition, we are hearing numerous anecdotes of firms passing on cost increases to their downstream customers. The recent numbers on core inflation — that is, inflation excluding food and energy — also have moved up some over the past several months. Core PCE inflation is now at 2.2 percent, a higher rate than I would like to see in the long run.\n\nI want to emphasize here that, while we often talk about inflation in terms of the core measure, we are concerned about maintaining purchasing power over all of the goods and services consumed by households. Accordingly, our goal of price stability must be defined in terms of total inflation. Traditionally, we have found it useful to concentrate on the core measure because it gave us a less noisy reading of longer-run trends in inflation; in turn, this reflected the tendency for food and energy prices to be volatile in the short run, but to generally average out to the same as core over the medium term. However, if outsized increases in food and energy prices persist, then core becomes a less useful medium-term guide to inflation trends. Furthermore, persistent food and energy price increases will find their way into inflation expectations, which in turn would boost core measures. So the recent developments in food and energy prices are a concern that deserve careful monitoring.\n\nThat said, our forecast is for inflation to moderate over the next two years. Slower growth in 2008 will limit price increases somewhat. Furthermore, futures markets point to a peaking of energy and commodity prices. However, they have pointed to lower energy prices for some time now, so we do not want to take too much comfort in their current predictions. Importantly, inflation expectations appear to be contained. If households and businesses expect inflation to be very low over the longer run, they will not build automatic wage and price increases into their plans, helping to keep actual increases in check.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, I think it is important to remember that the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate — working to foster financial conditions that help the economy obtain maximum sustainable employment and price stability. As the Committee noted in the policy statement following the January FOMC meeting, though downside risks to growth remain, we think the policy actions taken in January, in combination with earlier moves, should help promote moderate growth over time and mitigate the risks to economic activity. We also expect that inflation will moderate over time. Looking ahead, my policy views will depend on the evolution of these risks, as well as how developments influence the price stability component of our dual mandate over the medium term.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

Mike is a member of the board of directors of the Detroit Branch of the Chicago Fed. As a board member, he provides us with valuable information on the regional business outlook and credit conditions. This information not only helps us gauge the local economies within the Seventh District but also contributes to our understanding of developments in the national economy. As such, it is an important input into my thinking about the course of the economy and the appropriate course for monetary policy.\n\nToday I will discuss the recent events in financial markets and the Federal Reserve's responses to them. I will also give you my take on the current economic outlook. As always, these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me begin with the financial crisis.\n\nEarly Stages of the Financial Crisis\n\nOver the past year and a half we have witnessed the deteriorating performance of mortgages and a broad array of mortgage-backed securities—some of which, as you know, are highly structured instruments with opaque risk profiles. The problems in mortgages have spilled over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants have reassessed the risk profiles of other complex securities, and the prices of these assets have declined as well. This cascading process of re-pricing has had a detrimental impact on the liquidity and capital positions of a wide range of financial institutions in the United States and around the world.\n\nThe resulting disruptions to financial markets have made credit more costly and more difficult to obtain for many households and businesses. Banks are reluctant to lend even to one another because of concerns over counterparty risk, the desire to preserve liquidity, and limited balance sheet capacity. This has resulted in large increases between the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, and the federal funds rate. LIBOR, of course, is a common benchmark for the interest rate charged on short-term interbank lending. Many banks set their interest rates on loans to households and businesses as a markup over their cost of funds, as measured by LIBOR. Increases in LIBOR, no doubt, have translated into higher borrowing rates for those of you operating a business today. Before this financial turmoil began, the 30-day LIBOR typically hovered about 10 basis points above the level of the fed funds rate that would be expected to prevail over the term of the loan. Since the summer of 2007 the spread has risen substantially, averaging about 50 basis points between August 2007 and August 2008, with a couple of spikes to about 1 percent.\n\nStrains on financial institutions have also spilled over to other markets, like that for commercial paper. Because of concerns over their ability to meet future payments, some financial services firms have had difficulty rolling over commercial paper. They have seen their costs of issuing paper rise substantially. These difficulties are also affecting the availability and cost of commercial paper funding to nonfinancial firms. Nonfinancial firms often issue commercial paper to fund regular operations such as meeting payrolls and buying materials. In addition, finance companies issue commercial paper to support leasing and to extend credit to nonfinancial customers, such as in the provision of car loans and the financing of inventories.\n\nThe tightening of credit conditions has weighed on spending by households and businesses. Their spending capacity was also reduced by the protracted weakness in housing markets, along with earlier increases in prices for energy and other commodities. As a result, aggregate economic activity has deteriorated to the point that the U.S. economy is now in the midst of a substantial downturn.\n\nOver the past couple of months, we have witnessed another wave of large-scale disruptions to the financial services industry. These recent developments reflect a confluence of factors.\n\nAs we moved through the summer, the financial system faced increasing difficulties owing to further deterioration of the economy. Consumption began to contract noticeably and labor markets declined at an accelerating pace. The weakness in economic activity intensified the strains on banks, since not only mortgage loans but also business, car, and credit card loans started to exhibit higher default risks. The deteriorating credit risks led banks to hold on to liquid assets even more and to tighten credit standards even further.\n\nAt the same time that the macroeconomic picture was deteriorating, a number of large financial firms were reporting severe losses. Some institutions—notably Wachovia, Washington Mutual, and Merrill Lynch—appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by large banks. However, the losses at Lehman Brothers were especially large, and a buyer could not be found. Consequently, Lehman had to declare bankruptcy. At almost the same time, American International Group (AIG), one of the most important issuers of credit default insurance, found itself unable to meet its liabilities without a loan from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThese developments dealt a serious blow to market confidence. The problems in these major institutions intensified financial market participants' concerns about the ability of their counterparties to repay debt. This heightened assessment of risk resulted in funding becoming even more difficult and expensive to obtain across a spectrum of markets.\n\nIn the interbank market, LIBOR spreads spiked up again, jumping briefly as high as 335 basis points. This, of course, made many types of bank loans even more expensive. Banks also further tightened their credit standards for new lending to both businesses and households.\n\nIn credit markets, concerns about the loss exposure of normally highly rated firms led to a fall in value of a wide range of debt instruments and derivative products. In commercial paper, this was reflected in a spike in rates for many issues, particularly those for asset-backed securities and the paper of lower-rated nonfinancial firms.\n\nFurthermore, the problems in the commercial paper and other short-term lending markets continued to spread following the initial shock. In part, this reflected a feedback loop between these markets and the money market mutual funds. Money market funds hold commercial paper and engage in repurchase agreements with highly rated firms. Money market mutual funds that held Lehman or other now distressed paper were exposed to potentially significant losses. Indeed, the Reserve Primary Fund, ended up \"breaking the buck,\" meaning its net asset value per share dropped below $1, after suffering losses on its holdings of Lehman debt.\n\nAs a result of such losses, many investors began redeeming funds from money market accounts or shifting funds into Treasury-only accounts. To meet the redemptions, many money market funds had to liquidate assets into an already depressed market. In addition, other commercial paper was downgraded and became ineligible to be purchased by money market mutual funds, exerting further downward pressure on this market. Furthermore, as perceived price risk and redemption risk increased dramatically, there was a marked reduction in the maturity of commercial paper and other debt being rolled through the markets.\n\nAs a consequence of these pressures, even some highly rated firms found it more difficult and expensive to obtain short-term financing through the commercial paper and repo markets. Some of these firms have been able to tap bank backup lines of credit. But this substitution just pushes the money market difficulties back into the banking system. The drawdowns of existing bank revolvers and credit lines increase the size of banks' balance sheets at a time when they are trying to reduce leverage. Thus, they potentially squeeze out the ability of banks to make other loans. This is similar to how the redemptions by the money market funds' customers reduced the funds' capacity to invest in commercial paper that nonfinancial firms then use to fund operations.\n\nActions by the Federal Reserve\n\nThe Fed has implemented a number of policy responses to these extraordinary events, aimed at mitigating the problems in the financial system and their potential fallout on the spending and production capacity of the rest of the economy.\n\nFirst, the Fed turned to its traditional monetary policy instruments, that is, to reductions in the federal funds rate and the discount rate. In August 2007, the Fed reduced the spread of the discount rate over the federal funds rate from 100 basis points to 50 basis points; and last March it was reduced further to 25 basis points. The first funds rate cut occurred in September 2007. The initial moves during the fall of 2007 were measured, but eventually gave way to more aggressive rate cuts. Today, the funds rate is 1 percent, 425 basis points lower than when we began.\n\nAlthough the corresponding injections of liquidity into the overnight interbank market have reduced restrictive credit conditions somewhat, it became clear early on that further and alternative extensions of central bank liquidity would be necessary to restore adequate interbank lending at term and further facilitate market functioning.\n\nEven in normal times, the discount window at the Fed is available to sound depository institutions in order to smooth payment difficulties. Such lending can also help the flow of credit in interbank markets more generally and as early as the fall of 2007, the Fed made a number of substantial changes to the operation of the window to encourage its use. One change was increasing the maximum term of the loans to up to 90 days; traditionally, borrowing at the window was overnight or very short term. And since these changes have been made, we have seen a large increase in lending to depository institutions.\n\nEarlier this year, new market dysfunctions emerged, such as the collapse of the auction rate security market. And then there was the sudden demise of Bear Stearns last March. These episodes clearly indicated that in this strained environment, financial market participants other than depository institutions might face liquidity shortfalls that could have serious, far-ranging repercussions for the economy. This led the Fed to create a number of facilities to directly provide liquidity to nondepository institutions; the Federal Reserve Act grants us such emergency powers when the economy is faced with \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\"\n\nAt first, these measures were aimed at lending to broker-dealers who engage in securities transactions with the Fed and who have a large-scale presence in the repo and other short-term funding markets. Most recently, we have introduced new lending facilities to help work through the disruptions in the money market mutual fund and commercial paper markets. These programs provide a liquidity backstop for commercial paper and facilitate the sale in secondary markets of a number of instruments held by money market funds.\n\nAlthough it is still early, I am hopeful that these programs will have substantial, positive effects on restoring liquidity in the short-term financing market. Indeed, the spreads between commercial paper and the fed funds rate have fallen, retracing most of the run-up that occurred in mid-September.\n\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in dealing with the crisis. The FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) increased deposit insurance limits and put in place special facilities to insure other liabilities of depository institutions. Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which authorized the Treasury Department's Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP. Importantly to many of you, this program has so far provided more than $200 billion in capital injections to the banking system to support the lending capacity of banks. And, as you are aware, these capital injections are made through issuance of preferred stock and also include other features that support the prudent stewardship of taxpayer resources.\n\nMost recently, the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Fed have worked together to avoid further market disruption in a number of ways. In late November we provided guarantees, liquidity access, and additional capital to assist Citigroup through a difficult period.\n\nIn another joint program, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury are establishing a facility to lend to holders of student, consumer, and small businesses credit, using TARP funds to provide credit protection to the facility.\n\nFinally, the Fed is also launching a facility that will purchase debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and other government-sponsored enterprises. The initiative will help support the flow of credit and lower credit in mortgage markets.\n\nI believe that together the actions by the Fed and the other branches of government will help unlock lending capacity and will move us toward financial stability. It will not be an easy process, and it could take some time before financial markets function in a manner that does not impinge on the activities of businesses and households. But we will continue to use all of our resources to preserve the strength of our banking institutions and promote the process of repair and recovery of our financial markets.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nThat brings me to recent developments in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy, as well as the outlook over the next few years.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research declared the U.S. economy peaked in December of 2007 and subsequently entered into a recession. Both income and payroll employment started to fall, with the declines accelerating in recent months. Overall gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been choppy, but in the third quarter GDP fell at an annual rate of 0.5 percent and appears to be headed for a much larger decline in the current quarter. Payrolls, which had been declining slowly, fell sharply in September and October, bringing the year-to-date job losses to 1.2 million. October also brought a sharp rise in the unemployment rate to 6.5 percent. Weak labor markets and rising consumer prices have held back growth in real incomes. These, along with the financial strains, have led to marked weakness in business investment, industrial production, and consumer spending. Indeed, the declines in consumer spending over the past few months have been very large—on par with the drops experienced during the 1990 and 1982 recessions.\n\nAt this time it is very difficult to judge how long the downturn might last and how deep it ultimately will be. As financial markets work through their problems—with important help from government policy—and credit flows improve, we will see a return of growth in spending, production, and employment. But given the magnitude of the problems that we face, we could see activity remaining quite sluggish through much of 2009.\n\nThis thinking shaped the forecast that I submitted at our most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on October 28 and 29. At that time, the central tendency of the forecasts of the Governors and Reserve Bank presidents for GDP growth for 2008 as a whole was a range of 0 to 0.3 percent. Given that GDP growth averaged a little under 2 percent in the first half of the year, you can do the math: These forecasts imply a noticeable decline in real GDP in the second half of the year.\n\nIn explaining their forecasts, many participants noted the weakening data on consumer spending, stock market wealth, consumer confidence, and labor market conditions, as well as the severe dislocations in credit markets. These factors were expected to weigh heavily on household and business spending in 2008 and persist to some degree in 2009. Furthermore, weakness abroad was expected to hold back growth in exports. Accordingly, participants were looking for a relatively gradual recovery, with most of the forecasts for 2009 being somewhere between a one-quarter percent decline and a 1 percent increase in real GDP. The recovery is expected to take hold more firmly in 2010 and 2011.\n\nIn this growth environment, most forecasts had the unemployment rate rising to between 7.1 and 7.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2009 before moving down to between 5-1/2 and 6-1/2 percent by the end of 2011. Such unemployment rates would mean that a substantial degree of resource slack would remain in the economy over the next few years. This slack, along with the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities, should bring down inflation. Increases in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures were projected to fall from the 2-3/4 to 3 percent range in 2008 to between 1.4 and 1.7 percent in 2011. To me, this outcome would be consistent with price stability.\n\nWhen submitting these forecasts, the Committee members also noted that the degree of uncertainty about the outlook was unusually high. In large part this reflects the wide range of possible outcomes for the financial crisis and the associated interactions with the real economy.\n\nPersonally, I thought it was easier to envision the bad outcome scenarios than the good ones. Most of my colleagues agreed, and so viewed the risks to the forecast as being skewed to the downside.\n\nIndeed, since these projections were made, the incoming data, particularly on consumer spending and labor market conditions, have been weaker than I had expected. As I just mentioned, overall activity appears to be contracting markedly this quarter. That said, not all of the news has been bad. The prices for energy and other commodities have come down further. And, as I mentioned earlier, we have seen some declines in spreads on interbank borrowing rates and in the commercial paper market. I am hopeful that we will see continued improvement in financial market functioning and that this will show through in improved credit terms for households and nonfinancial businesses. But, as I noted earlier, it likely will be a while before markets are functioning in a manner that we would characterize as smooth and efficient.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the U.S. economy continues to face many challenges. The Fed has been proactive in addressing market liquidity stress during the financial crisis—first by using our monetary policy tools and later through our improvised lending facilities in response to financial markets. Moving forward, it is important that we be vigilant in monitoring the risks to growth, as well as any risks to the prospects for obtaining price stability. It is also important for us to continue to collaborate with global policymakers in the pursuit of financial stability worldwide. We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance. But the policy actions taken by the Fed and other governmental agencies over the course of the financial crisis, and the effort of the private sector to work through its difficulties, will eventually help support a recovery in economic growth.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood morning and thank you, Diane for that kind introduction. And thanks to Kaarina of the Executives' Club of Chicago for inviting me to speak today. I'm delighted to be here to share my thoughts on non–traditional monetary policies.\n\nFollowing the worst financial crisis of the past 70 years, we are currently experiencing a recession that will likely match or surpass those of the 1970s and 1980s in depth and severity. These exceptional circumstances have posed great challenges for policymakers. For us at the Fed, the response has been to pursue a variety of aggressive and innovative approaches that differ significantly from the standard policies of the past. The programs we have put in place are designed specifically for these exceptional circumstances. As such, they will have to be unwound as our financial system returns to normal and the economy is more clearly headed toward sustainable growth and price stability. This morning I would like to discuss the precepts that underlie these nontraditional policies and some tactical issues we must address in unwinding them. I should note that these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNontraditional policies\n\nIn the current crisis, traditional monetary policy has reached its limits in two ways. One obvious way is that the federal funds target rate, which had been the Fed's traditional policy instrument, has been lowered to essentially zero. This target cannot be reduced below zero even when further accommodation is warranted. The second limit of traditional policy has to do with the functioning of financial markets. Under normal circumstances, participants seeking profit opportunities tend to align risk-adjusted returns across all markets. This allows a change in the Federal funds rate to flow through to other interest rates across the entire range of maturity and risk structures. But during the crisis, disparities in rates across markets have indicated that arbitrage was not taking place as usual. Thus, even before our target was constrained by zero, we found that we could not affect the interest rates that matter to consumers and businesses to stimulate aggregate demand as much as was necessary.\n\nBecause of these limitations, the Fed has turned to nontraditional policies. These can be broadly categorized in three groups. The first group expands on something that has always been a part of our policy toolkit, namely discount window lending through which the Federal Reserve Banks make short-term loans to depository institutions against adequate collateral. Since August 2007, the Fed has taken steps to encourage the use of the discount window as a source of liquidity, including reducing the discount rate and lengthening the terms of the loans. The second group of policies consists of opening new lending facilities to a wide array of participants in financial markets. One can think of it as a sort of discount window for financial actors who are not depository institutions. The third group of policies consists of large-scale purchases of GSE notes. This can be seen as an extension of traditional open-market operations: the Fed still exchanges reserves for bonds, but on a vastly different scale.\n\nWithin these groups, there are a number of particular programs or facilities, each with its own terms and conditions. Taken as a whole, our nontraditional policies might look like a vast array of acronyms—the famous \"alphabet soup\" (TSLF, PDCF, etc.). But there is a method to the madness, and I will highlight three precepts that guide our thinking. The first is insurance: Don't put all your eggs in one acronym. The second is innovation: This is not your grandfather's Fed. And the third is size: In an environment of great uncertainty, as we like to say in Chicago, \"make no little plans.\" I will discuss each of these precepts in turn, before concluding with some thoughts about the return to traditional policies.\n\nInsurance\n\nTo understand the first precept, we have to remember the diversity of risks that emerged in the past two years and the speed at which they emerged. Each risk was a challenge to our mandate of fostering a sound financial system, stable growth, and price stability; and diagnosing each risk raised difficult questions. We saw failures in parts of the financial system. How serious were they, and how would they affect the rest of the economy? We also saw economic activity begin to deteriorate significantly, with month–to–month job losses and sales declines as steep as any in recent memory. Finally, prices declined for the first time in decades. Were we about to slide into an extended period of deflation?\n\nThe diagnosis was surrounded with much uncertainty and included some dire scenarios. But the remedies that we considered brought their own measure of uncertainty as well. By definition, we had little experience with these new policies. Which treatment was appropriate and could be implemented in a timely fashion, particularly given the practical and legal constraints we were facing? Under what circumstances and for how long should it be applied? How should the treatment be scaled back as conditions improve?\n\nThe Fed decided to adopt an approach that would be robust to these multiple dimensions of uncertainty. Rather than rely on any single tool lest it prove inadequate, we have put in place a number of different remedies in quick succession, in the hope that we may learn which ones work best without losing valuable time.\n\nInnovation\n\nI won't retrace the complete list of new programs, as these have been covered extensively in other speeches. But I will discuss one program because it demonstrates our second precept, which is the need to innovate as quickly as circumstances change. Let us look at the Term Asset–Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF.\n\nThe market for asset–backed securities has long played a vital role in funding loans to consumers and small businesses. This market effectively shut down in October 2008 after the failure of Lehman Brothers. In response the Fed announced the formation of TALF in November 2008. With backing from the Treasury, TALF provides loans to investors to finance their purchases of certain highly–rated asset–backed securities, with the securities themselves as collateral for the loans.\n\nAs conditions evolved we modified the facility along multiple dimensions, even before it began its operations at the beginning of April. The first markets targeted by the facility were those for securities backed by relatively simple assets. These securities were familiar to market participants and their pricing was relatively straightforward. Then we moved on to more complex and long–lived instruments.\n\nInitially the only eligible securities were those backed by newly and recently originated auto, credit card, and student loans, and small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. In April, other securities were made eligible, namely, loans backed by mortgage servicing advances, leases of business equipment or vehicle fleets, and dealer inventories. This month, eligibility was broadened to commercial mortgage–backed securities.\n\nWe changed the acceptable origination date as well. Initially, securities were eligible for TALF only if they were backed by new or recently issued loans. The intent was to bring the asset–backed market back to life by directly financing investors willing to purchase the securities, and therefore indirectly funding the loans that backed them. In March 2009, the Fed signaled that TALF could be extended to legacy assets, with the intention of stimulating the extension of new credit generally by easing balance sheet pressures on potential lenders.\n\nFinally, the maximum maturity of TALF loans has been extended from three years to five, and in February the maximum size of the operation was increased from $200 billion to $1 trillion to match the growing list of eligible securities.\n\nAdmittedly TALF has generated two opposite concerns: one is that our credit requirements are too conservative and unlikely to fund large volumes; the other is that the central bank is taking too much credit risk on its balance sheet. I think we have struck a good balance between these concerns. We have taken appropriate action to limit our exposure to credit risk through stringent credit quality requirements on the assets, substantial haircuts, and the direct support of the Treasury. Importantly, TALF is not intended to substitute for the ABS markets as they existed before the crisis, nor is it intended to revive them to their former level of activity solely on the back of the Federal Reserve System. The goal rather is to jump–start these markets back to life by mitigating some of the stresses they are experiencing. In turn, this should allow them to reach their appropriate size in a less disruptive fashion. At this point we see evidence that TALF is working as intended. Spreads on asset–backed securities have come down. And while much of the recent ABS issuance has been supported by TALF loans, some institutional investors are re–entering these markets without that support.\n\nRightsizing\n\nThe third precept relates to size. Until recently, monetary policy tended to change in small steps, a behavior that some have labeled \"policy gradualism.\" Our response to the present crisis has moved beyond gradualism. Our rapid January 2008 cuts in the Fed funds rate were one indication, and the size of our nontraditional policies is another.\n\nLast March, as the Fed gave notice that TALF would be expanded, we also announced a considerable increase in the size of another program, our large–scale asset purchases in which we buy agency debt, agency-guaranteed mortgage–backed securities, and Treasury securities. These actions, taken together, represented a substantial escalation of our nontraditional policies, and they will probably maintain or increase the size of our balance sheet well above what it was until a year ago.\n\nI think this aggressive move was appropriate considering the many risks we were facing, the direness of some forecasts, and the uncertainty surrounding our new tools. Future developments will help us determine if our actions to date have been too much, too little, or just right.\n\nWe moved swiftly to launch nontraditional policies, but some of them have taken time to implement because their proper design required great care. And just as traditional policy is well known to act with long lags, nontraditional policies also take time to affect economic activity. So I expect to see further deterioration in some areas, notably job market conditions, before our policies gain full traction. Weak economic news by itself would not imply that we have misjudged the size of our latest actions. In my view, it would take a significant deterioration relative to our outlook for me to view our current policies as inadequate.\n\nOver time the degree of success of specific programs will let us reconsider the size of our actions. If we find that a given program is not proving as useful as we anticipated, we would be faced with a choice between making its terms more attractive (and taking on more risk) or letting it lapse. We will then need to keep in mind that the same level of aggressiveness may not be warranted by the circumstances of the day. Indeed, the possibility that the economy is close to a turning point is stronger now than just two months ago. Financial market spreads have improved even as long Treasury and mortgage rates have increased. And disinflationary pressures have been weaker than we had feared. Part of rightsizing will be to decide where boldness ends.\n\nBack to normal\n\nOver time, as the economy moves toward sustainable growth and stable prices, the Fed will progressively return to its traditional policies—that is, setting the Fed funds rate—and will reduce its balance sheet in an orderly way.\n\nHow will it do so? Partly on its own. Many of our liquidity programs provide short–term loans, so as these programs come to an end, the loans will mature fairly quickly and our balance sheet will shrink. Also, the pricing of our programs is designed to be unattractive in normal times, and attractive only to those who really need them in these unusual times. As they cease to be useful, they will cease to be used. Indeed, some programs are already being used less and we should see that trend continue as conditions in financial markets improve further.\n\nNonetheless, a significant portion of our balance sheet may not shrink on its own or at the appropriate rate. We need tools to reduce it actively so that monetary policy can be easily recalibrated. In this respect, we can be as creative on the way out as we were on the way in; or, put another way, we can be creative with our liabilities the way we have been creative with our assets.\n\nOne way to manage our balance sheet is to sell the assets. They can be sold outright, or they can be leased through reverse repurchase transactions. Another tool is the payment of interest on reserves, which we began last fall. Without interest on reserves, rates are raised only by restraining the quantity of reserves available to the market, and reaching our target could require sharp reductions in our balance sheet. With interest on reserves, we can raise the interest paid on reserves in tandem with our target rate. This will raise the opportunity cost of banks' lending and keep the Fed funds rate near the target. Finally, as we announced in March, we are seeking with the help of the Treasury additional tools through legislative action. An example of such tools would be the authority to issue interest–bearing debt in exchange for reserves or an expansion of the Supplementary Financing Program.\n\nWhat circumstances might require us to use the tools we have, and those we may have in the future, to reduce our balance sheet aggressively? One clear concern is price stability. Our balance sheet grew very fast in a matter of weeks last fall, and remains large. There are historical precedents for large increases in central bank balance sheets to result in broader credit expansion and to be subsequently associated with inflation. But I want to emphasize the middle link in this chain: inflationary pressures will not arise without broader credit expansion, and there is no evidence for that at present. Nevertheless, these precedents explain why there is concern on this point and why we look after our ability to reverse the growth in our balance sheet.\n\nForecasting inflation is never easy, but these are particularly difficult times for this exercise. All one has to do is look at the remarkable lack of consensus among professional forecasters. The spread between the lowest and the highest inflation forecast for 2010 reported by Blue Chip Economic Indicators is more than twice what it was a year ago for inflation in 2009. Two conflicting forces could come into play to explain such a wide range of opinions. A high unemployment rate and low rates of capacity usage, such as we now have, normally place strong downward pressure on costs and tend to lower inflation. Indeed, some statistical models have pointed to possible deflation risks in the quarters ahead. But inflation has not fallen to the extent we might have feared; and there is another factor that could come into play, namely consumers' and businesses' expectations of future inflation. So far, expectations as measured by surveys have remained relatively stable, which is a bit of a surprise considering the severity of the downturn. But as economic conditions improve consumers and businesses might expect upward pressure on inflation; and experience shows that a rise in inflation expectations, once solidified, becomes embedded in many economic decisions and makes inflation harder to control.\n\nCurrently, with core inflation near 2 percent, I see inflation at a level that would be acceptable under normal circumstances. But these two potentially strong forces work in opposite directions, and the Fed must be in a position to respond, whichever force dominates.\n\nConclusions\n\nThese have been challenging times, and the Fed has met the challenge with an array of innovative programs that depart from traditional policy. We have pursued this approach in a manner that is both commensurate to the size and robust to the variety of risks we faced. The multiplicity of programs should not obscure the fact that, although the means are many, the ends remain unchanged. Both traditional and nontraditional policies are aimed at fostering a stable financial system, sustainable growth, and price stability. As economic conditions improve and we lay the groundwork for an orderly reduction in our balance sheet, these ends remain uppermost in our minds.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon and thank you for inviting me to speak today. It's always a pleasure to have the opportunity to visit Wisconsin, and I am delighted to be here. Let me start by thanking the Fond du Lac Chamber of Commerce and Mike Burch, of National Exchange Bank and Trust, who helped arrange my visit.\n\nToday I'd like to share some thoughts on the extraordinary events that have occurred in the financial markets over the past several weeks. I will also discuss the national and regional economies. Before we begin, though, let me note that the views I express today are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nTurbulent Times\n\nOver the past year, we have witnessed the deteriorating performance of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities spill over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants have reassessed the risk profiles of other similarly structured assets, and prices of these securities have declined as well. This cascading process of re-pricing has had a detrimental impact on liquidity and capital positions in a wide range of financial institutions and markets in the United States and around the world.\n\nAnd over the past few weeks we have witnessed large-scale disruptions to our financial services industry. Policymakers, financial institutions, and nonfinancial borrowers and lenders are struggling with how best to respond to the stressed markets and support economic growth. We are, undoubtedly, in the midst of extraordinarily turbulent times.\n\nThe disruptions to financial markets have made credit more costly and more difficult to obtain for many households and businesses. Banks are reluctant to lend to one another because of concerns over counterparty risk and the desire to preserve liquidity. This has resulted in large increases in the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR—the common benchmark for the interest rate charged on short-term interbank lending. Many banks set their interest charges on loans to households and businesses as a markup over their cost of funds, as measured by LIBOR. Increases in LIBOR, no doubt, have translated into higher bank borrowing rates for those of you operating a business today. Before this financial turmoil began, the 30-day LIBOR rate was typically hovering about 10 basis points above the level of the fed funds rate that would be expected to prevail over the term of the loan. 1 Since the summer of 2007 the spread has risen substantially—and in recent weeks it jumped as high as 300 basis points.\n\nIn the commercial paper (CP) markets, difficulties over some financial services firms' ability to roll over their CP have also strained the markets for other types of CP. This, of course, is affecting both the availability and cost of funding through the CP market to some nonfinancial firms.\n\nAs a result of the restrictive lending procedures of banks, and the strains in other credit markets, consumers and businesses have experienced reduced and more costly access to credit. This, in turn, has weighed on overall spending. In addition, the protracted weakness in the housing markets, along with elevated prices for energy and other commodities, continues to be a drag on the economy; these economic conditions have also reduced the spending capacity of households and businesses.\n\nAnd so, as a consequence of these factors, job creation, consumer spending, and industrial production, have all weakened. Payroll employment declined again in September, bringing the cumulative year-to-date job losses to 760,000. There also has been a sharp rise in the unemployment rate this year—in September it was 6.1 percent, a full percentage point above the level many view as being consistent with \"full employment.\"\n\nWeak labor markets and high consumer prices have held back growth in real incomes, contributing to marked weakness in consumer spending. The average level of real personal consumption expenditures for goods and services in July and August was down more than 2 percent at an annual rate from the second quarter. And the latest data on retail sales point to another decline in spending on goods in September.\n\nConditions in labor markets and high consumer prices also have impacted some manufacturing industries. Industrial production has fallen nearly 2 percent since last December. The most recent information indicates a 3 percent drop in production for the month of September as compared to August. And after changing very little for about a year, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing purchasing managers' index was down sharply last month. One bright spot for the U.S. economy has been exports. In August, real exports were up 10 percent from the previous year. However, the turmoil in global financial markets is reducing the growth of many of our trading partners. So, looking ahead, it may be difficult to maintain the recent pace of export growth.\n\nWe also are concerned about the increased rate of inflation. Inflation has risen partly because of earlier spikes in commodity prices—particularly energy prices. Another reason has been soaring food prices. Even excluding food and energy, so-called core inflation for personal consumption expenditures was up to 2.6 percent (year-over-year) in August. In my opinion, this rate has been high. Looking ahead, commodity prices have fallen from their peaks. Also, the dollar has regained ground from its previous lows, which should moderate import prices. Furthermore, the increased slack in the economy will likely reduce more general cost and inflationary pressures. This channel definitely seems stronger today. Although some risks to the inflation outlook remain, a forward-looking assessment would put less weight on inflation concerns than earlier this summer.\n\nWith that in mind, the outlook for real economic activity likely will result in production, spending, and labor markets being very sluggish in the second half of this year and well into 2009. I expect that such activity will then pick up as the housing and financial markets gain headway in working through their problems. Such progress would be signaled by stabilization in construction and improvement in credit flows.\n\nThere is, of course, a level of cloudiness in any economic forecast. In the current situation, the substantial stress in the financial markets has led to an unusually high degree of uncertainty. This is because it is extremely difficult to assess how the turmoil will influence markets and how policy responses to address the economic unrest will play out over time.\n\nLast week, after considering all of the issues, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to lower the federal funds rate—the primary instrument of monetary policy—50 basis points to 1-1/2 percent. This brings the cumulative decline in the funds rate since last September 2007 to 375 basis points. We at the Federal Reserve continuously reevaluate the stance of monetary policy in light of current and forecasted conditions, as well as our assessments of the risks to our long-term objectives of maximum sustainable growth and price stability. Currently, these risk assessments must factor in the substantial uncertainties in the outlooks for growth and inflation that I just described. These uncertainties certainly pose difficult challenges for policymakers.\n\nIn addition to lowering the fed funds rate, we have also implemented a number of policies aimed at supporting the flow of liquidity through the financial system. Our most recent moves have been to institute lending facilities to support money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market. Collectively, these actions are designed to increase market liquidity by lengthening lending terms, reducing the cost of borrowing relative to the fed funds rate, expanding the range of eligible counterparties, and enlarging the pool of eligible collateral. These actions also have targeted liquidity to those systemically important markets that are experiencing large-scale disruptions in their operations.\n\nOf course, other important policy decisions also are being made. Two weeks ago Congress enacted, and the President signed, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. And earlier this week the Treasury announced details of a plan that would inject significant capital into the banking system. These actions are unprecedented in scope to address the difficulties we face as a nation. I believe they will help unlock lending capacity and will move us toward financial stability. I will be happy to address questions on this topic after my remarks, but let me now turn away from \"breaking news\" and spend a little time on the health of the regional economy and its importance to the national economy.\n\nRegional Economy\n\nTurning to our region's economic performance, the agriculture and manufacturing sectors are of great importance to us in the Seventh Federal Reserve District. Our District includes Iowa and the larger parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. This region makes up 13 percent of both the U.S. population and our gross domestic product. It produces nearly 30 percent of America's vehicles; more than a third of America's steel; more than half of its farm machinery; and almost half of our corn, soybeans, and pork. So, of course, we at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago closely monitor the agriculture and manufacturing sectors.\n\nWisconsin is one of the most diverse agricultural production states in the nation, and it's one of the top ten agriculture states. More than half of the land in our five-state region is either cropland or pasture. The agriculture industry in Wisconsin produces nearly $52 billion annually and employs more than 12 percent of the state's labor force. 2\n\nGiven Wisconsin's strong agricultural tradition, it is not surprising that we at the Chicago Fed are interested in measures of innovation in agriculture that promote increased productivity and an economic boost to the region. Of particular interest are areas that transform agriculture through modern science and significantly improve production operations and overall efficiency.\n\nOne reason that agriculture has been so successful has been the tremendous growth in productivity in the sector. Research and development activities related to agriculture have led to tremendous output growth. Over the past forty years, corn yields in the District have more than doubled, and milk production per cow has increased almost 150 percent. Continued investment in technological innovations and in research and development will, no doubt, result in further production efficiencies, better products, and higher return on investments for agriculture in the Midwest.\n\nManufacturing continues to be the bellwether industry for Wisconsin and for much of the Midwest. As measured by personal income, the Midwest economy derives 60 percent more of its annual gross product directly from manufacturing companies as compared with the remainder of the U.S.\n\nOf course, manufacturing performance varies sharply from sector to sector. Currently, you will not be surprised to hear that production of transportation equipment—which in the Midwest largely means the automotive industry—shows steep declines. In contrast, our machinery sector—which builds a host of capital goods—is holding up much better. By historical standards this deviation is somewhat unusual. It largely reflects strong economic growth by our international trading partners that are demanding items we make, such as tractors, construction equipment, medical devices, generators, and mining equipment.\n\nDifferences in the concentration in specific industrial sectors have influenced the economic performance among the states in the District. Since 2000, the automotive-intensive states of Indiana and Michigan have experienced deteriorating labor markets relative to the national average. In contrast, several metropolitan areas in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa with machinery-intensive manufacturing operations have held up better than in the past. We have a \"tale of two industries\" within the District, with significant stress in many of our automotive-dominated metropolitan areas, but also continued prosperity in many of our machinery-concentrated areas.\n\nMuch like the broader region itself, parts of Wisconsin's economy continue to be tied to the automotive industry. The Janesville area has been adversely affected by high gasoline prices and slowing auto sales. This will, undoubtedly, have a downward effect on other Wisconsin companies that supply parts and machinery to the automotive industry. However, in comparison to the manufacturing sectors in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio, Wisconsin's is more concentrated in capital equipment rather than in motor vehicles. Wisconsin is an important producer of machine tools construction and farm machinery, food processing equipment, electronic control systems, and diagnostic medical systems.\n\nSales growth in these sectors has been holding up well in recent years, as U.S. manufacturers have expanded markets to both customers across the nation and, increasingly, customers around the world. Over the two-year period ending in 2007, Wisconsin's export goods expanded by over 28 percent, reaching over $19 billion annually as of 2007. Nonelectrical machinery topped the list of export product categories for the state, with over $6 billion (2007), followed by electrical machinery and scientific/medical instruments. Nonelectrical machinery grew at a pace of 10 percent annually from 2005 through 2007; the second highest category of exports, electrical machinery, grew by over 20 percent annually.\n\nWisconsin's capital goods orientation largely reflects a national restructuring that has seen a steady shift in the specialization of U.S. manufacturers producing goods and services; it also reflects a continued export growth. Today, The U.S. produces more than 20 percent of the world's manufactured goods—the largest output in the world—with less than 5 percent of the global population. In 2007, manufactured exports made up 6.6 percent of the nation's output—and an estimated 8 percent of the output of the Seventh Federal Reserve District.\n\nWisconsin's long-standing investment in academic excellence is also beginning to spawn new industries. The University of Wisconsin at Madison ranks in the top 20 in receipt of National Institutes of Health funding for health and life sciences research, and the University produces prodigious numbers of graduates in related fields. As a result of this activity, along with close attention to tech transfer and economic development, over 250 biotech, health, agriculture, and life sciences firms are up and running in the footprint of the University around Madison. By their nature, biotech goods and services serve wide national and global markets. While the dollar export levels do not yet approach Wisconsin's mature machinery industries, pharmaceutical products now rank 30th among state export categories, after rising over 3.5 times since 1996.\n\nConclusion\n\nCurrently, the economy faces serious challenges. The housing market is a continuing strain, and we are experiencing disruptions in worldwide credit markets that are without precedent in the post-World War II era. Such challenges call for innovative and vigorous fiscal and monetary policy responses. In response, the Fed and other central banks have implemented a number of nonstandard facilities for injecting liquidity into strained markets, and they have made a coordinated reduction in their monetary policy interest rate targets. Fiscal authorities also have responded to economic challenges. In the U.S., we enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act and instituted programs to insure some debt of financial institutions. These actions complement efforts by other nations to recapitalize their banking systems and facilitate interbank lending.\n\nI believe these efforts will be of great help in unlocking lending capacity, enhancing the flow of credit to consumers and businesses, and moving us toward financial stability. But bringing credit markets back into full functionality won't happen overnight. And when normality is ultimately restored, the \"new normal\" will likely operate through different channels and under different constraints than before the financial turmoil. Yet, the \"new normal\" will represent a substantial improvement from where we are today.\n\nAs credit flows do begin to improve, the risks to growth will diminish, and we will be able to concentrate again on our traditional policy tools, using them in ways that help the economy achieve maximum sustainable growth and price stability.\n\nNotes\n\n1 The expected fed funds rate can be measured by the overnight index swap (OIS) rate.\n\n2 Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation, 2008, web site, available online .\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

    "text": "Thank you for inviting me to speak today and for that very kind introduction. I'm delighted to be here this morning to share my thoughts on the economy during this challenging period. I'd like to say a special thank you to Maria Coons, a former Chicago Fed employee and member of our extended Fed family. I'd also like to extend my personal thanks to Rita and John Canning. Rita serves as a member of Harper's Board of Trustees and John is the Chairman of our Chicago Fed Board of Directors. Maria, Rita, and John all helped to arrange my visit here today.\n\nIn the course of my remarks today, I will address the subject of monetary policymaking during times of financial stress. I would like to note that the views discussed today are my own, and not necessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee or my other colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nPolicymaking\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a dual mandate: We are charged with fostering financial conditions that promote both maximum employment and price stability. We attempt to achieve these goals primarily by setting an appropriate target for the federal funds rate. That's the interest rate at which banks make overnight loans to each other. The fed funds rate influences to varying degrees the entire array of market interest rates, including those paid by businesses and consumers.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, financial markets efficiently channel funds from lenders to borrowers, appropriately supporting the spending capacity of households and businesses. But as we have seen over the past nine months, at times financial disruptions can occur. Such disruptions can hinder the flow of financial capital to creditworthy borrowers and reduce their ability to consume and invest. Accordingly, such situations pose special challenges for policymakers.\n\nAt this point, a review of the recent market turmoil is probably helpful. After a period of rapid increases, by the summer of 2007 home prices had leveled off and were starting to decline in some markets. Subprime borrowers, who may have been counting on rising home equity, began to default in significant numbers.\n\nComplicating these developments were the widespread securitization of mortgages and the repackaging of these securities into highly complex financial instruments known as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Securitization and CDOs have turned out to be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they diversified risk among many lenders. On the other hand, their complexity made it difficult to track losses and properly value the portfolios of many financial institutions. This lack of transparency contributed to the deterioration of financial market conditions, leading to a re-pricing of risk and a widening of credit spreads across a broad spectrum of financial securities. For example, not only did the value of mortgage-backed CDOs fall sharply, but market participants began to question the value of other complex securities, even those with no subprime exposure. Furthermore, many borrowers had to turn to very short-term financing as lenders were unwilling to commit funds at normal terms because of uncertainty over collateral valuation and other counterparty risks.\n\nIn the banking sector, in addition to suffering losses on subprime-related securities, banks were forced to take additional risky assets back onto their books, which further strained their capital positions. This has made them more reluctant to lend.\n\nSo, in summary, in both the bank and securities markets, many creditworthy borrowers have found credit much more expensive or sometimes even unavailable at any reasonable price. In turn, this has weighed on real economic activity.\n\nSetting the Stance of Monetary Policy\n\nI'd like to now turn to how we implement policy. In doing so, I will start by discussing how I evaluate three key factors determining where we set the federal funds rate: These are maximum employment, price stability, and the neutral funds rate. I will then turn to how financial stress impacts our policy decisions.\n\nMaximum Employment\n\nIn order for the economy to achieve maximum employment over the long run, it needs to grow at its maximum sustainable rate, which is also referred to as the rate of growth of potential output. This is the maximum rate of real growth the economy can maintain in the long run without leading to an increase in inflationary pressures. Sustainable growth is determined by the underlying trends in two factors—first, the availability of labor resources, and second, the productivity of those labor resources. Although these underlying trends are unobservable—and can change over time—at the Chicago Fed, our current analysis of them suggests that sustainable growth currently is somewhere in the range of 2-1/2 percent per year. Most other analysts' estimates fall in the 2-1/4 to 3 percent range.\n\nPrice Stability\n\nOur other—and equally important policy goal—is price stability. In some sense, price stability is achieved when inflation does not significantly distort the economic behavior of households or businesses. Recently, the FOMC further improved transparency by reporting forecasts more frequently and extending the forecasts' horizon to three years. As stated in the FOMC minutes, participants' forecasts for this third year are \"importantly influenced by their judgments about measured rates of inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate... and about the time frame over which policy should aim to attain those rates given current economic conditions.\" 1 In January, policymakers' forecasts for 2010 had growth in the range of most economists' views for potential and had inflation—measured by both the total Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, Price Index and the PCE index excluding food and energy—in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent. This suggests that most policymakers view price stability as being somewhere in the neighborhood of 1-1/2 to 2 percent.\n\nNeutral Funds Rate\n\nBefore we go any further, I'd like to describe you how I think about monetary policy in general terms. To evaluate the stance of policy, I start by focusing on the real fed funds rate—that is, the nominal rate less expected inflation—and where it currently stands relative to a hypothetical longer-run benchmark called the neutral real funds rate. The neutral funds rate is the rate consistent with an economy operating at its potential growth path and with stable inflation. There are many factors and uncertainties involved in assessing the neutral rate. With such caveats in mind, I think the neutral long-run real fed funds rate is somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 to 2-1/2 percent.\n\nReal rates above this 2 to 2-1/2 percent neutral point tend to restrict aggregate demand, while real rates below this mark are accommodative and boost aggregate spending. Of course, the real fed funds rate is only one factor affecting liquidity and credit conditions. As we have seen recently, other credit market developments can work to offset or exaggerate the impulse from monetary policy.\n\nCurrent Stance of Monetary Policy\n\nNow that I have provided some background for how I approach monetary policy issues, let's talk about the current situation.\n\nMarket Turmoil\n\nAs I discussed earlier, the disruptions in financial markets that began last August have greatly restricted the flow and increased the price of credit and liquidity. Clearly, this has complicated policymaking. Usually, when we decrease the fed funds rate, all short-term interest rates fall by a similar amount. These in turn feed through and affect interest rates across all maturities. As rates adjust, private markets also update their views on credit risks, and these show through to changes in risk spreads between private borrowing rates and those on risk-free Treasury debt.\n\nFinancial stress alters this mechanism: It has boosted the risk premia built into private borrowing rates and substantially increased the demand for liquid assets that can be easily turned into cash and used to pay liabilities. An important example of these effects can be seen in the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, which is a measure of short-term lending rates between banks. LIBOR is important because it is a common benchmark for many other rates, including those on adjustable rate mortgages and auto loans. The 30-day LIBOR is normally only about 10 basis points above the level of the fed funds rate expected to prevail over the term of the loan. 2 However, the recent financial market stress has pushed its average over 60 basis points above the expected funds rate; also, this spread has been highly volatile and at one point was over 100 basis points. Because of this increased spread, many borrowers have paid higher rates than would ordinarily have been the case given the level of the fed funds rate.\n\nNew Lending Facilities\n\nThe current financial circumstances have added a new dimension to the challenge of monetary policy, and policy has responded in a number of ways. First, we have aggressively reduced the federal funds rate by 325 basis points since September 2007. Second, we have implemented a number of innovative initiatives to increase liquidity in strained financial markets.\n\nThe new policies include changes to the Federal Reserve's discount window, through which depository institutions have always had access to overnight loans. Since 2002, the rate of interest we charge borrowers, the primary credit rate, had been set 100 basis points higher than the target federal funds rate. However, while we don't view use of the window negatively, historically banks have been reluctant to use the facility for fear that it would signal weakness or some operational miscalculation. To encourage use of the window, we reduced the wedge between the primary credit rate and the funds rate and allowed borrowing for terms of up to 90 days. We also instituted the new Term Auction Facility, which is an alternative market-based auction system for depositories to borrow at term from the window.\n\nThe recent disruptions in financial markets also have caused serious liquidity problems for another important conduit for channeling credit, the primary security dealers, which include several major investment banks. To address these problems, the Fed established the Term Securities Lending Facility and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility to lend to them. Since the dealers are nondepository institutions, these loans required the Fed to invoke its authority to lend to nonbanks under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Under this act, such lending is only permissible under \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\" Such loans are the first extensions of credit by the Federal Reserve to nondepository institutions since the 1930s. Our recent actions regarding Bear Stearns were also authorized by this act.\n\nFinally, we have consulted closely with foreign central banks during this period. In particular, we instituted swap arrangements with both the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank to help provide dollar-denominated liquidity to European banks.\n\nTogether, all of these initiatives have lowered short-term market interest rates, reduced the cost and lengthened the maximum term of banks' borrowing directly from the Fed, broadened eligible collateral, and expanded lending to nondepository institutions.\n\nImplications for Traditional Monetary Policy\n\nSo how does all of this affect policy? I think it is helpful at this point to note some similarities to the period following the recession of late 1990 and early 1991. You might recall that after the deregulation of the Savings and Loan industry, many S&Ls made imprudent real estate loans. The ensuing losses substantially reduced the lending capacity of the industry as insolvent S&Ls went out of business and others were forced to recapitalize. In addition, banks were reluctant to lend as they struggled to bring their capital in line with the then new risk-based standards set by the Basel I Accords. These restructurings created financial headwinds that made the recovery from recession frustratingly slow. In fact this period was later characterized as a \"jobless recovery.\"\n\nToday, banks again are recapitalizing after making imprudent loans; and again, they are doing so in the face of a sluggish economy. However, one key difference is that today much more overall lending activity is securitized. This has spread losses among a wider swath of financial institutions and has made it more difficult to quantify losses. As a result, we have seen a broader disruption of credit flows, even than those of the early 1990s. This suggests we may again be in for a period of weak growth.\n\nNow let's consider the stance of policy. Today, the nominal funds rate is at 2 percent. In January, projections FOMC members made for PCE inflation in the medium term were in the range of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent. This means the real fed funds rate is close to zero or perhaps slightly negative. Looking back at the early 1990s, the nominal funds rate bottomed out at 3 percent in 1992. Given the higher inflation expectations at the time, this also translated into a real funds rate that probably was close to zero—just like today.\n\nIn normal times, a real funds rate near or below zero would be considered highly accommodative. However, then, as now, the boost to aggregate demand from the accommodative funds rate was offset to some degree by financial market turmoil. Because we think the disruptions today are more significant than in the early 1990s, this offset also is larger today. In contrast, today we have in place the various additional measures that provide extra liquidity. No such facilities were in place in the early 1990s. It is difficult to weigh the various factors. But with this difficulty in mind, and given my reading today of economic prospects, my judgment is that the current net stance of monetary policy is accommodative—and this is appropriate in order to address the way we currently see the sluggish economy unfolding in 2008. I also believe that the current stance roughly balances out substantial risks to the outlooks for both growth and inflation—which I see as being to the downside for growth and to the upside for inflation.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nLet's now turn to the outlook for growth and inflation.\n\nCurrent Economic Situation\n\nAs you may know, real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of just 0.6 percent in the first quarter of the year. This was the same sluggish rate as in the fourth quarter of 2007. Not surprisingly much of this weakness stemmed from the household sector, as residential investment declined at an annual rate of almost 27 percent and personal consumption grew well below its long-run average. Slower income growth, falling consumer sentiment, higher food and energy prices, lower housing and equity wealth, and tighter credit conditions are all restraining household spending, and are likely to do so in the near term. And, importantly, the labor market has softened. Nonfarm payroll employment fell an average of 80,000 jobs per month in the first quarter and dropped an additional 20,000 in April. And these losses came on the heels of a steady decline in job growth over the course of 2007.\n\nIn the business sector, spending on equipment, software, and structures declined at a 2-1/2 percent rate in the first quarter, reflecting tighter credit conditions and less need to expand capacity in a slower economic environment. One bright spot has been net exports. The weaker dollar, which is down around 25 percent since 2002, as well as continued growth abroad, has kept exports rising at a solid rate; last quarter, they grew 5.5 percent.\n\nInflation, as measured by the year-over-year change in core PCE prices, was 2 percent in the first quarter of 2008. But once we include the volatile food and energy components, total PCE inflation was 3.4 percent.\n\nFuture Economic Outlook\n\nLooking ahead, our outlook at the Chicago Fed is for continued weakness in real GDP over the near term. Activity is likely to remain weak for a number of reasons. Strains on intermediation and financial balance sheets mean that credit conditions will likely continue to restrict spending for some time. Businesses and consumers could limit their discretionary expenditures because of caution over the economic environment. And housing continues to be a downside factor. The unsold inventory of homes will continue to restrain residential investment, and it will take time for this overhang to unwind.\n\nHowever, eventually the cumulative adjustments in house prices will bring more buyers into the market and activity will stabilize. While we don't expect any significant contributions to growth from residential construction for some time, the drag from the sector ought to at least diminish as we move through the rest of this year and next. Similarly, as financial market participants revalue portfolios and repair their balance sheets, the drag from credit conditions ought to diminish over time. Furthermore, even given the financial turmoil, the stance of monetary policy is accommodative and supportive of growth. Productivity growth, although below the lofty rates enjoyed in the late 1990s and earlier this decade, is still solid. Finally, the effects of the fiscal stimulus bill are likely to boost spending in 2008.\n\nSumming all of these factors, we think conditions will improve in the second half of this year, but not enough to prevent economic activity from still running at a relatively sluggish pace. We expect real GDP growth will return close to potential as we move through 2009.\n\nRegarding the outlook for inflation, we project improvement over the medium term, with core inflation in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent by 2010. This forecast assumes that the resource slack being generated by the current weakness in the real economy will work to offset the cost pressures from higher energy and commodity prices. Productivity also is a plus in holding down costs. For example, although compensation increased 3.4 percent over the past year, overall unit labor costs changed very little because workers were quite productive. Productivity, which is the amount of output per hour worked, grew at a quite healthy 3.2 percent rate.\n\nOur forecast also assumes—in line with current readings from futures markets—that energy and commodity prices will stabilize some time over the medium term. Clearly, there are risks to the inflation outlook if this stabilization does not occur. We also could be adversely affected by higher prices for imported goods. Finally, although the persistently high readings of commodity, food, and energy prices do not appear to have had a major impact on longer-run inflation expectations, we have to be mindful of their potential to do so. Any increase in inflation expectations would pose an important risk to the achievement of price stability.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the U.S. economy has experienced some very large shocks since mid-2007, and economic policy, including monetary, fiscal, and financial, has responded aggressively to address the strains in the economy and financial markets. In my opinion, monetary policy is accommodative and appropriately situated to address the substantial risks that remain both for sluggish economic activity as well as unwelcome inflationary pressures.\n\nIt is important to recognize that monetary policy influences economic activity and inflation with a lag. Furthermore, given the challenging financial circumstances, it seems likely that credit conditions will also require adjustment time, as financial institutions reevaluate their portfolios and capital needs. As a result, the level of uncertainty regarding future developments continues to be high and the path forward may be uneven. We must keep this in mind as we evaluate the outlook. I am confident that policymakers will continue to respond to future unexpected changes in the environment for growth and inflation as needed in order to promote sustainable growth and price stability.\n\nNotes\n\n1 Summary of Economic Projections in the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, January 29–30, 2008, page 5.\n\n2 The expected fed funds rate can be measured by the overnight index swap (OIS) rate.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

    "text": "Thanks for inviting me and thanks for that kind introduction. You'll note that I became president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago exactly two years ago. While I can assure you there's no correlation, this period has been among the most interesting and extraordinary in the history of the Federal Reserve System. So much of what the Fed has done in the last two years has been under scrutiny from the government, the media, the general public and various others. And while the debate has been loud and at times far ranging, our mandate from Congress has remained quite clear: the goal of the Fed and its monetary policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is to promote monetary and financial conditions that facilitate the attainment of maximum employment and price stability. For about the last 30 years, there has typically been no conflict in pursuing each of these goals with a single tool—the short-term interest rate. This is because rising inflationary pressures are often accompanied by unsustainably high growth, and economic slowdowns are typically associated with disinflationary pressures.\n\nNevertheless, this simple description of the way monetary policy responds to growth and inflation prospects belies the fact that discussions within the FOMC often touch on a wide range of drivers for inflationary pressures. A small set of relevant factors should include money growth, resource slack, inflationary expectations, energy and commodity price shocks, and assessments of the credibility of future policy commitments. And there is a surprising amount of disagreement and uncertainty over the exact roles forces play. I'm not talking out of school on this issue: A careful reading of FOMC transcripts over the last 20 years will reveal many different views on inflation. Perhaps this is not surprising. The economics community itself continues to debate strongly the importance of different transmission channels for inflation. Policymakers who are informed by these developments—and, in many cases, have contributed to the scholarly research in this area—continue to have a healthy discourse over the issues and facts.\n\nDuring normal times, inflation evolves gradually, and this debate rarely spills over into major disagreements about policy. But, today, we are not in normal times. The inflation debate on the determinants of inflation has broken out on the front pages of newspapers, with major disagreements among distinguished experts. For example, in recent New York Times op-eds Paul Krugman said that large resource gaps have made him worried about deflation, while Allan Meltzer said that massive growth in the monetary base has made him worried about inflation. 1\n\nCertainly, the stakes could not be higher. We have ample evidence of the harm that deflation can cause. The history of the U.S. economy in the 1930s is a case in point, where the price level fell by over 25 percent, 2 contributing to the severity of the Great Depression. But, history also shows us the damage that high inflation can wreak on the U.S. economy. From 1965 to 1980, inflation rose from about 1-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. 3 Many economists refer to this period as the \"Great Inflation.\" The costly process of breaking the Great Inflation and then, subsequently, the achievement of price stability took the better part of the next 17 years. 4 So it is quite disconcerting when highly regarded analysts talk about the possibility of another debilitating deflation while others—just as highly regarded—suggest that even though we have avoided the Great Depression 2.0, the U.S. economy may be facing the Great Inflation 2.0.\n\nThis morning, I would like to frame these two extreme views on inflation risks within the language economists and policymakers use to discuss these issues. After highlighting the terms of these disagreements, I will provide some commentary on the \"lessons learned\" from the historical record on inflation. In brief, I think neither a harmful deflationary episode nor a repetition of the Great Inflation is very likely. Stimulative policies combined with the economy's resilient market forces will, over time, reduce resource gaps. Deflation has been averted. And as the economy continues to improve, and when we see rising inflation pressures, Fed policy will respond aggressively. Having said this, the main threat to these outcomes would be if clear danger signals were ignored or if central bank independence were compromised.\n\nAs always, my remarks today reflect my own views and do not reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the views of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nTwo articles of faith\n\nIt is natural to start by considering the factors that affect inflation. What do economists say? Well, macroeconomists are a contentious bunch. The most accomplished scholars in this field share two overpowering attributes. First, they are highly intelligent; and, second, when the subject is monetary policy and inflation, they appear to agree on very little. Nevertheless, I think that there are two strongly held articles of faith that are, in fact, shared by the vast majority of macroeconomists.\n\nFirst, large, sustained and explosive growth in money is associated with high and variable rates of inflation. The logic and evidence are overwhelming. Economies that are running the printing presses on overdrive, usually to finance unsustainable fiscal deficits, generate great instability in prices and high inflation. We saw this in post-WW1 hyperinflations in Germany and Austria, and, more recently, in high-inflation episodes in Portugal, Italy, and Argentina. In addition, numerous studies have documented that when sustained over long periods of time, even moderately high rates of money growth are often associated with significant inflation. However, it's important to note that over shorter time frames, and at lower rates of money growth, other factors can intervene to significantly weaken the strong positive relationship between money and prices that we see in the high inflation examples and in long run studies. 5\n\nThe second article of faith is that high unemployment rates and slack capacity utilization—which we refer to as resource gaps—are often associated with falling inflation. A prime example of this is the 1981-82 recession, when unemployment rose to nearly 11 percent as the Volcker-led Fed broke the Great Inflation. But, similar to money growth, the evidence regarding the influence of resource gaps on inflation is strongest when considering extreme economic conditions—when there is either a large degree of slack or, on the flip side, an excessive strain on productive capacity.\n\nClearly, these two articles of faith can help frame the current discussion of inflation risks. On the one hand, the explosion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet has led to an enormous increase in bank reserves and the monetary base. Left unchecked, these monetary facts seem to scream \"inflation risks.\" On the other hand, the unemployment rate is 9.7 percent, and manufacturing capacity utilization is currently only 65 percent, which is the lowest level since this statistic started to be computed in 1948. 6 These resource gaps suggest that disinflationary winds are blowing with gale-force effect.\n\nIn trying to assess inflation risks from monetary conditions and resource slack, we must remember that these factors are strong predictors only in relatively extreme cases. So it is the fact that we currently find ourselves in a situation with competing extreme cases—both large resource gaps and big expansions in the monetary base—that leads to today's Great Inflation 2.0 debate.\n\nIn a few minutes I'll return to how I see this conflict turning out. But these two articles of faith provide only a partial understanding of the factors that determine inflation during more usual times. So it is useful to first describe a relatively mainstream view on how inflationary pressures emerge under more typical circumstances.\n\nFirst-order forces of inflation determination\n\nAlthough inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, many factors come in to play when thinking about its evolution over the medium term. The most important ones are: changes in resource costs, wage and price setting behaviors, and inflation expectations. 7 As we'll see, these forces are related to both articles of faith that I just discussed. However, there are disagreements over how much weight to place on each factor, and also how to interpret the fundamentals underlying each of them.\n\nLet me begin with resource costs. When firms set prices for the products they sell, they pass along current and expected future changes in input costs, including labor costs. As a result, market prices and inflation move in the same direction as these resource costs. Resource costs, in turn, move with changes in demand and supply. And everything else equal, expansionary monetary policy will increase demand.\n\nIt's natural to use movements in measures of aggregate resource utilization, such as unemployment and capacity utilization, to capture changes in the supply-demand balance. In this way, resource costs are linked to resource gaps, which was the focus of our second \"article of faith\" about inflation determination. Unfortunately, for a host of theoretical and statistical reasons, these measures of resource utilization are imperfect proxies for supply and demand pressures, and as such, have an uncertain relationship with price determination. As a result, economists will disagree on the importance of these measures for inflation determination at a given point in time. I will return to these uncertainties in a few minutes.\n\nAnother factor affecting inflation is inertia in wage and price setting behavior. Businesses, workers, and households typically make changes to their wages and prices in an orderly fashion. For example, firms tend to stick to their pricing plans, and workers' wages are typically revisited only on an annual basis. This sort of pricing behavior makes inflation inertial. However, these behavioral regularities are not always well understood and we don't really know whether this sort of inertia will continue to characterize inflation in all future economic conditions.\n\nIn addition to direct cost pressures, price setting is influenced by expectations of future underlying inflation. Many things can influence peoples' expectations about the future path of inflation—it is a veritable kitchen sink. In addition to the resource costs I just talked about, other important influences are: changes in money growth, fiscal factors, and central bank credibility and independence. Higher money growth today may lead people to conclude that inflation will increase in the future.\n\nUnchecked fiscal imbalances can also lead to higher expected inflation if the public believes that at least some of the fiscal deficit will be paid off by printing money. And inflation expectations can increase if everyone believes that a central bank will refrain from increasing policy rates for political reasons, even in the face of inflationary pressures.\n\nExpectations are clearly a powerful determinant of inflation, but they are inherently unobservable. Expectations reflect a confluence of both objective market data and subjective beliefs of market participants. Similar to other important economic forces—like the output gap—the lack of observability and difficulty in measuring inflation expectations represent a powerful challenge for monetary policymakers. Here is how I approach the issue. Initially, we can attempt to directly assess each important force for future inflationary pressures. This approach could construct a risk assessment for inflation pressure indicators and would include all of the factors cited above, at a minimum, along with an assessment (or weighting) of their importance. 8 Although there will be disagreements, I find this constructive approach facilitates rigorous and robust debate.\n\nAn alternative approach is to be agnostic about the factors that influence how inflation expectations are formed. Instead, we would simply try to infer expectations from surveys and financial market data. Although this is intriguing, there are limitations in using this approach to the exclusion of more direct measures of inflationary forces. In particular, if monetary policy is so fully credible that everyone believes inflation will not deviate from its goal, inflation expectations will not respond to changes in the economic environment. For example, many believe that the European Central Bank's commitment to price stability over the medium term is so strong that measures of euro-zone inflation expectations rarely move. But this sort of stability in expected inflation does not mean that the central bank can relax its vigilance against inflationary forces. On the contrary, this stability is a consequence of that very vigilance. We cannot rely solely on direct measures of expected inflation without some sort of risk assessment that monitors indicators of inflation pressures. Fortunately, these two approaches for assessing inflation expectations are not mutually exclusive; indeed, they are complementary.\n\nOne of the big questions, however, is to ask what the historical record says about the importance of these different factors. So now would be a good time to turn to a couple of quite salient historical examples.\n\nThe Great Inflation 1.0: 1965-82\n\nThe Great Inflation in the U.S. from 1965 to 1982 provides a good example of how a long, sustained increase in money growth tends to increase both contemporaneous inflation and expectations of future inflation. Over this period the price level more than tripled, with the inflation rate peaking at over 11 percent in 1980. This rise in the price level was accompanied by strong growth in both narrow and broad monetary aggregates. The monetary base, like the price level, more than tripled over this period, with a growth rate peaking at nearly 10 percent. 9 M2, which is a broader measure of transaction money, more than quadrupled during this period, and its growth rate topped 11 percent. 10 It is important to note that this broader measure of money, M2, largely consists of the liabilities of the private banking sector, so an expansion of broad money can be triggered by an increase in base money only if there's an associated growth in bank credit provision. Increased bank lending was a key factor in broad money growth and the Great Inflation.\n\nTo see how this works, note that an expansion of base money implies an increase in both a bank's deposit liabilities and—at least for the moment—its excess reserves at the central bank. Banks may choose to put these excess reserves to work by making loans, which will further increase the aggregate balance sheet of the commercial banking sector through the standard money multiplier story. This increase in broad money, in turn, can increase inflation.\n\nDuring normal times, an increase in the monetary base results in an increase in broad money because banks generally lend out almost all of their excess reserves. But if, for some reason they choose not to do so, then broad money will not increase as fast as the monetary base, and the likelihood of an increase in inflation is greatly diminished. An example of this occurred during the early part of the Great Depression, when base money grew significantly but the broad money stock actually fell by a third. 11 We also find a disconnect today between the monetary base and broad money. Over the past year, the monetary base has nearly doubled as the Fed has rapidly expanded its balance sheet. But, given the sluggish growth in bank credit, broader money has risen much less—by only around 8 percent. So, we'll need to see much more expansive bank lending if the monetary base expansion is to trigger an inflation response. And we have yet to see this happen in the current economic downturn.\n\n1979 to 1982 provides a different example of the tenuous link between money and inflation. Between 1980 and 1982 the inflation rate declined from its peak at 11.6 percent to 4.8 percent. 12 Yet this disinflation was accompanied by an increase in broad money growth, with M2 growth rising from 7.8 to 8.8 percent. 13 It is noteworthy that a decline in money growth was not essential for reducing inflation. The explanation is that this was a period of restrictive credit, with real interest rates soaring to over 10 percent. Partly as a result of this tight credit environment, economic activity weakened considerably, generating substantial resource gaps. Restrictive credit conditions and resource gaps dominated the influence of relatively high rates of money growth. This episode constitutes a caveat for the monetary explanation of inflation pressures: you need to consider both demand and supply pressures for money—you can't ignore the prices of liquidity and credit. Indeed, empirical research has found that outside of extreme cases money growth generally does not have much predictive power for inflation over the short and medium runs. 14\n\nMeasures of resource slack may be misleading\n\nHistory also cautions us about relying purely on resource slack as the sole guide to inflation pressures. For example, although high rates of unemployment are typically viewed as disinflationary, the stagflation of the 1970s serves as a counterexample. A problem here is that measures of resource slack can be misleading. One popular measure of resource slack is the output gap, which is the difference between actual and potential output. Here, potential output is defined as the maximum level of output that can be produced without generating inflationary resource cost pressures. The problem is that potential output changes over time. Furthermore, it is not directly observable and must be estimated. If our estimate for potential output is off, then so is our measure of the output gap. This mismeasurement could confound policy. Athanasios Orphanides argues that something of the sort happened in the 1970s. 15\n\nAccording to his story, economic weakness was interpreted by the Fed as evidence of a substantial output gap. This apparent gap prompted the Fed to expand monetary policy in an effort to attain maximum sustainable growth. But this period of economic weakness coincided with a major structural slowdown in productivity growth and rising structural unemployment. So the sluggish economy represented not so much an output gap as a slowdown in the growth rate of potential output. In effect, the resource and output gaps were overestimated, leading to an overly accommodative monetary policy.\n\nIs this sort of dynamic likely to be a factor in the current situation? Although some of these forces may be present, I am skeptical of their quantitative significance. Recent studies done at the Chicago and San Francisco Feds find little evidence that sectoral reallocation or other factors are increasing the unemployment rate or reducing measured output gaps on a very large scale. 16 So I believe that resource gaps remain substantial today. That's a significant mitigating factor against inflation pressures.\n\nFiscal deficits and weak central banks\n\nBefore concluding, let me turn to the relationship between central bank independence, fiscal policy, and inflation outcomes. Independence of the central bank is always important. Periodically, the central bank at times must take tough actions that are needed for future and medium-term prosperity, even though these actions are painful in the immediate short-term. The classic example is the need to increase policy rates on early signs that inflation could be rising substantially even though the real economy remains weak. In this situation, there may be pressure for the central bank to inappropriately re-weight its dual mandate objectives and postpone the monetary tightening until matters in the real economy improve further. A central bank that lacks independence and therefore opts to postpone tightening policy has effectively abandoned its low inflation goal. As a result, both expected and actual inflation can increase.\n\nFiscal pressures can also pose problems for central bank independence if large deficits are expected into the foreseeable future. Even if the central bank pursues a tight monetary policy, both current and expected future inflation can still increase if the public believes that the central bank will be forced to monetize the government debt sometime in the future. Tom Sargent and Neal Wallace coined the term \"Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic\" for this process. 17 In principle, very large debt levels could compromise the independence of even the strongest central bank if the choice is between monetizing the debt or, inducing a costly monetary contraction.\n\nHere again, the historical link between fiscal pressures and very high inflation is clear. As I noted earlier, the major hyper-inflations in Austria, Hungary, Germany and Poland during the inter-war years, and more recent high-inflation episodes in Argentina, Portugal and Italy, all involved to varying degrees large structural fiscal imbalances combined with some lack of central bank independence. The key take-away is that rising, unsustainable fiscal deficits can derail the low inflation plans of a weak central bank, and can test the souls of the strongest central bankers. Unpleasant monetarist arithmetic argues that fiscal discipline is a necessary component for favorable inflation outcomes. There is no reason to think that this conclusion does not apply to the U.S. While significant fiscal stimulus was an appropriate response to a very large recession, it is essential that the nation show that it has a plan for restoring long-run fiscal balance.\n\nPolicy conclusions\n\nI started today by describing two extreme views for the future of inflation. One view, motivated by the expanding Fed balance sheet, has inflation greatly increasing in the future, while the other view, motivated by a sluggish economy and large resource gaps, has strong disinflationary forces. My view is that large resource gaps have been met by a large growth in reserves: In an effort to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression, the Fed acted quickly and decisively over the past year to provide liquidity to markets and to prevent systemically important institutions from failing. These are things that the 1930s Fed did not do. It is precisely these actions that have greatly expanded our balance sheet. So, the co-existence of the motivating observations for the two extreme inflation views is not very surprising.\n\nNow for the hard part: Just as the Fed acted responsibly to prevent a potential deflation, it will do so to prevent a future increase in inflation above our price stability objective. Unfortunately, this sounds too much like, \"just trust us to do the right thing.\" This is uncomfortable for everyone, but it is a natural dilemma at this point in the economic cycle when it is yet too soon to actually begin removing policy accommodation.\n\nI am confident that the Federal Reserve will achieve the price stability component of our mandate. Our response will embody three principles; prepare, monitor, and act. Chairman Bernanke recently testified on the tremendous preparations that the FOMC is undertaking in order to be sure our balance sheet can be reduced and that appropriately restrictive monetary policies can be implemented when necessary. And the FOMC is monitoring economic and inflation conditions for the signs that adjustments in policy are needed. I hope my comments on inflation expectations and direct assessments of inflationary pressures have been helpful in this regard. Finally, the Fed will act in a timely and appropriate manner to achieve our dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L. Evans and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago or the Federal Reserve System.\n\n1 See Krugman (2008, 2009) and Meltzer (2009).\n\n2 According to Friedman and Schwartz (1963), the implicit price deflator level fell by about 25 percent between 1929 and 1933.\n\n3 The PCE (personal consumption expenditures) chain price index increased 1.7 percent between December 1964 and December 1965 and 10.5 percent between December 1979 and December 1980.\n\n4 Year-over-year PCE inflation did not consistently fall below 2 percent until May 1997. It remained below 2 percent until December 1999.\n\n5 See, McCandless and Weber (1995), Fischer et al (2002), and Stock and Watson (1999, 2003).\n\n6 Manufacturing capacity utilization was 65.4 percent in July 2009, which is the lowest reading since January 1967 when the NAICS-based capacity utilization series start. (NAICS is North American Industry Classification System.) Before 1967, capacity utilization is available on an SIC (Standard Industry Classification) basis; at no time between then and its first reading in January 1948 does this measure fall below 70 percent.\n\n7 These ideas are embodied in macroeconomic analyses from Friedman (1968) and Lucas (1972) to current generations of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models like Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005).\n\n8 These weights could be informed by the performance of formal statistical inflation forecasting models that use these indicators.\n\n9 Between 1971 and 1980, the monetary base grew, on average, about 8 percent per year.\n\n10 Growth in seasonally adjusted M0 from Jan 1965-Dec. 1982 = 238.67 percent; growth in SA M1 over the same period = 195.46 percent; growth in SA M2 over the same period = 346.62 percent.\n\n11 Friedman and Schwartz (1963), p. 299, also Table B-3.\n\n12 These are December-to-December changes in the PCE chain price index.\n\n13 Year-over-year growth in M2 was 8.0 percent in October 1979 and 8.8 percent in October 1982.\n\n14 See Stock and Watson (1999, 2003).\n\n15 See Orphanides and van Norden (2002) and Orphanides (2004).\n\n16 See Valletta and Cleary (2008), Fernald and Matoba (2009), and Rissman (2009).

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. I'm Charlie Evans, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and it's my pleasure to welcome you to today's conference. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss the importance of financial education, a topic that is particularly relevant in light of the subprime crisis and the struggles that many families are facing to stay in their homes.\n\nThis morning I would like to offer some observations on the importance of financial education, which is of particular concern to those of us at the Federal Reserve. I will also discuss the origins of Fed engagement in financial education and some similarities that I see between the economic and political climate that prompted the Fed to ramp up its financial education efforts in the 1970s and where we are today. I will close with some thoughts about the particular strengths that the Fed brings to the financial education arena.\n\nThe Importance of Financial Education\n\nRecent research shows that American consumers have relatively low rates of financial literacy. For example, two-thirds of older Americans do not have a clear understanding of financial concepts like compound interest and inflation. 1 Financial illiteracy is particularly acute among specific demographic groups, including those with low education, women, African-Americans, and Hispanics.\n\nIt is perhaps useful to consider why we think it is important for individuals to be financially literate. To my mind there are (at least) two key reasons. First, if individuals are financially literate, then they will be able to make better financial decisions for themselves and for their families when it comes to budgeting and buying, financing a home, or planning for retirement, for example. Second, when individuals have a better understanding of financial and economic concepts, it is easier for them to appreciate the role of the Federal Reserve and the benefits of the Fed's independence when it comes to monetary policy. When you don't understand what inflation is or the risk that it presents to your financial well-being, then it is difficult to appreciate the importance of a Federal Reserve that can take politically unpopular steps to combat inflation.\n\nSince the 1970s the Federal Reserve has been actively involved in a variety of financial education programs. Of course, it is desirable to know how helpful this instruction is, so we can assess whether programs are cost-effective and perhaps even worthy of being replicated broadly. However, evaluating financial education programs is far from a straightforward task—simply looking at the outcomes of program participants can be misleading, because individuals choose whether or not to participate. For example, enrollees in credit counseling programs might make better mortgage contract choices. But the fact that they choose to enroll reveals their interest in making good decisions about their personal finances. Thus, those particular individuals might have made good choices even without attending a program.\n\nThe gold standard for dealing with such problems is randomized assignment, which ensures that individuals selected for programs do not differ systematically from the target population. There are important examples of this type of work within the Federal Reserve, for example assessments of home ownership education and counseling at the Philadelphia Fed and other research that will be highlighted in the second panel. But randomized assignment evaluations are usually quite costly. They require very careful design, the ability to replicate that design, the political fortitude to exclude populations from treatment, and extensive follow-up. Moreover, most financial literacy programs—for instance, 2 hour credit counseling—offer small treatments that are likely to produce small effects. Detecting such effects requires studying large populations, raising the cost of evaluations even further. So, for some financial literacy programs, such rigorous assessment may simply be impractical. One thing I hope we will get from this conference is a better sense of how we should approach the evaluation of such programs.\n\nOrigins of the Fed's Engagement in Financial Education\n\nI date the beginning of the Fed's engagement in economic and financial education to the mid-1970s.\n\nSo, what did the economic landscape of the mid-1970s look like? The economy had just gone through a severe recession, during which output, income, and employment fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose to 9 percent. At the same time, inflation had been around 3 to 4 percent earlier in the decade, and then soared to more than 10 percent in 1975. The oil export embargo by Arab states and President Nixon's wage and price controls combined to create long lines at the gas pump and restrictions on gas purchases. The oil price shock exacerbated a buildup of inflation and inflation expectations, which was further worsened by rapidly rising prices of agricultural products and other commodities.\n\nDuring this period, there were several Congressional attempts to curtail the Federal Reserve's independence. Sound familiar?\n\nIt was in this environment that the Federal Reserve grew increasingly concerned that the American public was uninformed about the Federal Reserve's statutory responsibilities, especially its monetary policy role. By 1976, a consensus had developed within the Federal Reserve System that an expanded public information program was needed to reach a broader segment of the American public and to dispel misconceptions about the Federal Reserve. This led the Fed to create a more professionally organized public information program at the Board and within the 12 Regional Reserve Banks. The recommended programs were designed to move the Fed from a \"passive\" information stance to a more active posture by expanding the dissemination of information to as wide an audience as possible.\n\nThe education efforts focused initially on improving public understanding of the Federal Reserve's purposes and functions and informing consumers of their rights and lenders of their responsibilities. Documents from the Fed at that time list several diverse groups who would benefit from the Fed's public information and education efforts, including: bankers, members of Congress, representatives of electronic and print media, consumer advocates, educators, students, representatives of organized labor, and the general public. 2 Then as now, the audience was broad and diverse.\n\nAn expansion of public information programs, including economic education programs, began in earnest in the 1980s. During this period, Reserve Banks across the country undertook a burgeoning array of initiatives and activities to facilitate public understanding of the Federal Reserve and developed greater coordination and information exchange throughout the System.\n\nEconomic education also became a specialty within public information programs, supporting the development of publications, curricular materials, programs and Reserve Bank staff activities targeting K-12 educators and students.\n\nOver the past decade, the Fed's education initiatives have broadened to include an additional focus on financial education and literacy. These initiatives concentrate on practical issues, such as: financial skill-building, economics education, bank account ownership, financial planning, wealth accumulation, consumer protection, and foreclosures—issues that affect many people at different stages of their lives.\n\nAs I'm sure you've noticed, there are some similarities between today and the environment of the mid-1970s. While we are tentatively emerging from a severe recession, unemployment remains high; thankfully, inflation and inflation expectations are under control However, there is a similar lack of understanding of the role of the Federal Reserve, threats to its independence and various proposals that would change its functions.\n\nIn some respects, confusion over the Fed's role is quite understandable, given the unconventional steps we have taken over the past two years to ensure liquidity flows in the wake of the financial crisis and the non-traditional monetary policy environment that we are in. At the same time, we have an important responsibility to explain our policy actions to a broad and diverse public. Today, as in the past, the better the public understands the work of the Fed, the easier it will be for us to achieve our mission.\n\nWhat You Will to Get Out of this Conference\n\nToday's conference provides a timely and important opportunity to discuss what the regional Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors are doing to ensure that the public understands the role of the Fed. The conference also offers an occasion for a discussion of what the Federal Reserve System is doing to provide opportunities for consumers to become better prepared to make complicated financial decisions. During the course of the conference, you will have the opportunity to share strategies for designing successful programs and partnerships in financial education, to learn how regional Feds make the most of scarce resources, to hear about research on the effectiveness of various financial education efforts, as well as some of the challenges involved in measuring the impact of financial education programs generally. In addition, you will have the chance to learn from partners and potential partners about strengths and areas for improvement in the Fed's financial education efforts.\n\nOur Comparative Advantages\n\nLet me conclude my remarks by briefly highlighting why I think that the Federal Reserve has a critical and ongoing role to play in the field of financial education. First, as I've mentioned, the Fed has two very important reasons for working to increase financial literacy: wanting consumers to have the information and knowledge necessary to make good financial decisions and wanting the public to have a better appreciation of the role of the Fed.\n\nIn addition, the structure of the Federal Reserve—with the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors—allows us to work effectively on both the regional and national levels. The regional Feds are ideally positioned to develop financial education programs that take into account the needs of their regions. For example, they can respond to variations in state education standards and to regional economic conditions. In addition, they are adept at identifying strong partners in their communities.\n\nAt the same time, by working together with one another and with the Board of Governors, the regional Feds and the Federal Reserve System can impact financial education at a national level. The Federal Reserve System provides an important independent and unbiased source of financial and economic information, as well as a wide variety of opportunities for individuals to build their financial literacy.\n\nLet me now turn the podium over to my colleague here in Chicago, Doug Tillett, who directs our Public Information and Economic Education efforts and is moderating the opening panel of the conference.\n\nThank you again for coming to this timely and important conference. I hope you enjoy the conference and your stay in Chicago.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L. Evans and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nNotes\n\n1 Annamaria Lusardi, 2008, \"Financial Literacy: An Essential Tool for Informed Consumer Choice?,\" Joint Center for Housing Studies, Harvard University, paper, February, No. UCC08-11.\n\n2 Lawrence K.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nGood evening and thank you for the opportunity to address this distinguished group in such an important time for the global economy. The European Economics and Financial Center (EEFC) has a history of engaging practitioners and theorists in the healthy exchange of ideas, promoting closer links between the two groups. Indeed, the type of research and advisory work performed by the EEFC is even more important when policy is addressing interconnected global issues.\n\nAs we all are too well aware, these are turbulent times in financial markets. We are in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. Numerous important financial institutions have either disappeared or survived only with substantial government assistance. Even among those escaping such fates, many have seen their balance sheets significantly damaged by poor risk management over the last decade. As these institutions have deleveraged and recapitalized, there have been substantial disruptions in credit flows, and economic activity around the world has suffered significantly.\n\nThis crisis has revealed some major weaknesses in our financial regulatory framework. If we truly hope to be able to say \"never again,\" we need to act aggressively to address these weaknesses. All around the world, there is a healthy debate currently under way over how best to do this. I believe this debate is valuable. As we adopt new public policies in response to the crisis, we need to be confident in our evaluations of the lessons we've learned and understand how regulatory changes will affect the efficiency of the financial services sector going forward. Here in the UK, you have responded to the turmoil with the passage of the Banking Act of 2009. In the U.S., the Obama administration has just unveiled a plan for financial regulatory reform and sent it to Congress for review. 1\n\nAll the major proposals seek to impose greater discipline on the industry. Such discipline, both from the market and from regulators, should lead to changes in behavior that reduce the likelihood that firms will find themselves on the brink of failure. In practice this is likely to mean new requirements on capital structure, enhanced liquidity management, and perhaps some restrictions on activities. But, no matter how well crafted such policies are, we also have to recognize the risk that financial institutions still may fail. Thus, there appears to be broad agreement on the need for reforms in how we deal with the possible failure of systemically important financial institutions—what people often call the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) problem. That is my topic for this evening.\n\nFor good reason, the development of an orderly process for resolving distressed institutions is a common element of both your Banking Act and the Obama administration's new proposal. I'll argue that having such a mechanism is important not just because some institutions will inevitably fail and thus need resolution, but because without it, market discipline is significantly compromised. For market discipline to be effective, failure has to be a real possibility for all institutions. Meltzer once said: \"Capitalism without failure is like religion without sin.\" And given the events of the last two years, market participants would be justified in at least having some doubts about whether certain firms would be allowed to fail in future crises. Thus, in order to create effective market discipline, we need a regime shift that removes such doubt.\n\nAs I'll discuss, TBTF is a very important, but difficult problem. And one for which important details all too often get overlooked or ignored. However, it is the details that will determine the success of policy in this area. Additionally, there is probably no single adjustment that would resolve the problems associated with TBTF.\n\nRather, it will likely take a multifaceted solution. Tonight, I want to give you my take on some issues related to too-big-to-fail, as well as stress the importance of some of the details and the reasons for a multifaceted approach to the problem. I should note that these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhat is the too-big-to-fail problem?\n\nThe TBTF problem is the perception—and perhaps the reality—that the failure of some institutions would have such large spillovers to other parts of the financial system, and such significant repercussions for the economy, that regulators would need to step in to prevent failure. These interventions could insulate creditors, counterparties, and perhaps even shareholders from losses. Left unchecked, this introduces a classic moral hazard problem: Financial institutions will have incentives to grow too large, to take on too much risk, and to be too slow to recapitalize when they encounter difficulties.\n\nIn the U.S., the TBTF problem first came to prominence with the 1984 failure of Continental Illinois Bank—a bank located directly across the street from the Chicago Fed. In the resolution process, equity holders were wiped out, but there were concerns about the potential spillovers if debt holders were required to take losses. Thus, Continental was deemed TBTF and debt holders were rescued. 2 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took temporary ownership of the bank and did not relinquish it until later in the decade.\n\nAfter the failure of Continental and the heavy losses associated with the thrift industry in the late 1980s, the U.S. Congress was very critical of bank supervisory forbearance. It enacted legislation that dictated \"prompt corrective action,\" or PCA. When a troubled bank's capital falls below successive capital thresholds, it must raise additional capital, restrict activities, restrict interest payments and asset growth, cease payment of dividends, and limit senior executive compensation. 3 With the same legislation, an explicit policy on TBTF was codified in the systemic risk exception to the 1990 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA). The goal was to explicitly minimize the use of TBTF by making the process very public and requiring sign-off by leading regulators and senior officials, including the U.S. President.\n\nWhile PCA worked fairly well in the recent financial crisis, some large commercial banks failed and were liquidated. Others were purchased, some with support from regulatory authorities and some without support. There were, however, some perceived inconsistencies and concerns about ad hoc procedures in certain situations. Two notable cases were the sale of Wachovia Corporation—which, by the way, was the first time the systemic risk exception to FDICIA was ever deployed—and when the FDIC took over management of the day-to-day operations of IndyMac Federal Bank after it was unable to find a buyer.\n\nThe recent financial crisis also revealed new dimensions of the TBTF problem. The systemic risk exception applies only to commercial banks. But recently there have been significant issues regarding the systemic implications from the failure of large nonbank financial firms. Significant problems in the U.S. have occurred surrounding investment banks, and similar concerns are being expressed about insurance companies and hedge funds. There are also issues regarding the relationships between banks and their parent holding companies. For example, significant losses have been imposed on stakeholders of bank holding companies—although the stakeholders were not always clear on whether they owned claims on the bank or on the holding company. More generally, the complicated interconnections between the bank and its holding company have made the resolution of the bank more difficult and costly. 4\n\nThese nonbank financial institutions are organizations for which no formal systemic risk exception exists; their resolution is handled through standard bankruptcy proceedings. 5 Such proceedings do not bring any extra resources to bear to deal with potential spillover effects to other market participants and the real economy. Although the societal costs from such spillovers are difficult to quantify, at times they could be substantial. Concerns about the disruptive aspects of putting a systemically important nonbank through the bankruptcy process has made regulators and others rethink the regulatory infrastructure covering these institutions in a number of ways.\n\nCan regulators \"just say no\"?\n\nLet's discuss some of the means people have suggested to address TBTF problems. One view is rather simple: Let the market work. This view holds that TBTF problems arise only because regulators lack sufficient backbone to let large firms fail. If the authorities would just commit to not undertaking bailouts and let existing financial and bankruptcy laws operate, the resolution process would proceed with losses being allocated according to predetermined priorities. There may be temporary market disruptions, but the claim is that the disruptions will be manageable.\n\nAdvocates of such a hands-off policy argue that the main problems resulting from TBTF are moral hazard and the long-run distortions and inefficiencies associated with it. In this view, problems arise when authorities deviate from a policy of nonintervention, sending mixed signals and confusing markets. This weakens the incentives of firms and their creditors to exercise prudent judgment. If there were no expectation of a government intervention, financial institutions would be compelled to choose a capital structure to withstand market forces, prudently manage risk, and, as a result, lower the probability of a large bank failure.\n\nThe logic of market discipline is certainly compelling. Given adequate transparency, the market has substantial potential to monitor firm behavior, perhaps more closely than a small number of regulators. And in my view, enhanced market discipline is almost certainly an important part of the solution to our regulatory problems. But the shift to a policy of increased reliance on market discipline is not a simple process. Regulators cannot simply decide to \"just say no\" going forward. Their commitment to avoid intervention must be credible, and must be perceived to be credible by the markets. Credibility can take years to develop and can be destroyed quickly by just one instance of forbearance or the provision of exceptional assistance.\n\nPlus there is another issue: It is not obvious that the optimal choice in dealing with the potential failure of a systematically important financial institution is always to \"just say no.\" Let's think about the underlying the decision to let such an institution fail or to provide it with exceptional support.\n\nThe costs of providing exceptional support are increased future risk-taking by other large or highly interconnected (TBTF) institutions without inducing corresponding increases in risk management. Such increased risk-taking would lead to distortions in both the levels and allocation of credit, possibly inducing excessive investment in higher-risk projects or sectors of the economy. This would adversely affect real macroeconomic performance.\n\nAlternatively, the costs of letting a large institution fail in a disorderly way are the macroeconomic consequences of resulting disruptions in financial markets. Creditworthy households and businesses may not be able to fund their ongoing activities. Furthermore, investment in plant and equipment would be distorted, which could also have long-run implications resulting from a suboptimal capital stock.\n\nThe cold calculus of this decision would involve comparing the two costs. This is very difficult to do and intelligent individuals can reasonably disagree on the two magnitudes. Proponents of the \"just say no\" policy will argue that in the moment of crisis, regulators overestimate the cost from current market distortions and discount the future benefits from imposing market discipline. That is human nature. As a result, regulators may occasionally err on the side of providing exceptional assistance. 6 Perhaps. However, it is not at all clear that this has been the case in recent situations.\n\nConsider one of the more prominent episodes during the course of the current crisis. In March of last year, the Federal Reserve provided extraordinary assistance to facilitate the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase. Proponents of the \"just say no\" position argue that this was a mistake. 7 Bear should have been allowed to fail, they argue, with debt holders and counterparties taking appropriate losses. This, in their view, would have sent a clear message that government assistance would not be forthcoming in the future. They claim the consequences for the economy would have been relatively modest and worth the long-term benefits. I disagree.\n\nLet's think about the counterfactual question of what would have happened if we had simply let Bear fail at the outset of the crisis. While it is impossible to know for sure how events would have turned out, I think that it is quite likely that we would have seen markets seize up sooner than they actually did. My thinking is influenced by the events following the failure of Lehman Brothers, when investors became extraordinarily risk averse and withdrew liquidity funding. I think a Bear Stearns failure would have almost surely led to similar risk aversion. For instance, Bear also was prominent in the tri-party repo market, which serves as an important source of short-term funding for large financial institutions. Upon failure, Bear's counterparties would have received collateral, which they either could not or would not want to hold. This could have lead to a dumping of certain asset classes on the market at fire-sale prices and, most likely a general aversion to counterparty risk. Similarly, just like the Reserve Fund held too much of Lehman Brothers' commercial paper when it failed, other mutual funds were likely overexposed to the paper of Bear Stearns. Thus, a Bear failure might also have generated at the time a run on money market mutual funds and commercial paper markets.\n\nFurthermore, the problems in financial markets were already largely in place by the spring of 2008. Losses related to mortgage portfolios were going to be incurred by someone. The credit default swap (CDS) exposure of AIG (American International Group Inc.) had been put in place years before and losses from that exposure were not a result of poor risk management following the demise of Bear Stearns, on March 17. In retrospect, given the massive mortgage-related losses, the downgrade of AIG was likely inevitable based on its investment strategy. The calls for additional CDS collateral were going to be triggered regardless of the decisions on Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers, resulting in the type of liquidity crisis that necessitated loans from the central bank.\n\nIn my view, the conclusion to be drawn from this hypothetical is that not providing exceptional assistance to Bear would have resulted in financial distress and a stock market implosion in March of last year rather than in September. While one cannot say for sure whether the situation would have been worse, I personally doubt it would have been better. Without assistance, the potential for even more widespread disruption seems more plausible to me. A fundamental observation is that large mortgage losses had to be allocated among leveraged investors. This set in motion a scramble to avoid taking losses.\n\nNevertheless, the argument can be made that by letting Bear Stearns enter bankruptcy during a period of financial distress, financial institutions would have realized that they would be subject to market discipline in the future, which would induce more prudent behavior. However, I think it is more likely that we would have seen exactly the opposite reaction. Given the likely severe fallout, regulators would have been sharply criticized. This could have generated a perception that regulators would never again allow such a calamity to occur. Thus the commitment to \"just say no\" would no longer be credible. The market would perceive the potential for using TBTF to actually be greater than before, not less. Indeed, this is the lesson that some draw from the failure of Lehman Brothers and the resulting financial upheaval.\n\nThese concerns about the role of market discipline and its limitations are strongest during times of crisis. The decisions regarding the failure of a single large bank during a more tranquil time could be very different. But the cost–benefit calculus could also be made significantly different, even during times of crisis, if a better infrastructure was in place to resolve problem institutions in a less disruptive manner. We would all prefer such a tilting away from forbearance and public assistance. However, to assume you could \"just say no\" in the environment of March 2008 with the existing infrastructure is somewhat idealistic in my view and overlooks a number of details involved with the resolution process.\n\nTo position ourselves to better utilize market discipline, we need a better resolution process that will address the new dimensions of the TBTF problem. I believe an effective resolution process requires two elements:\n\nThe Obama administration's reform plan provides useful proposals for these concerns. Yet even under the best plan that meets these elements, getting the details right is crucial. Who will decide when the resolution process begins? What should the trigger be? Should prompt corrective action begin at higher levels of capitalization than the current triggers for banks? Is temporary nationalization a necessary component? Will allowing for this potential lead to excessive use of this option? How will a multinational presence complicate the policy alternatives and how can that best be addressed? Details matter, and by getting the details correct, we can hopefully minimize the TBTF problem going forward.\n\nLimiting size and complexity\n\nSome recommendations to address TBTF involve limiting the ability or incentive of financial institutions to become particularly large or complex, thus lessening the odds of adverse spillovers. In other words, to keep institutions from becoming too big to fail, keep them from becoming too big, period. 9 In the U.S., one could possibly achieve this by strictly enforcing national deposit share limits and perhaps tightening those limits over time. One could even consider the breaking up of firms in a manner similar to how Standard Oil was broken up in the U.S. in the early twentieth century. But size is not the only factor that would need to be considered. There would also have to be limits on \"interconnectedness\" and on product complexity. Additionally, there are probably other time-varying dimensions that may prove to be significant. The dynamic and evolutionary features of systemic importance will require continual monitoring.\n\nI'd like to make two points about these policy alternatives. First, one would assume that financial institutions increase their size, develop new financial products, and become interconnected with other firms because doing so creates real economic value. It may be that this went somewhat beyond socially optimal levels in recent years. But at a basic level, growth, new products, and activities that increase interconnectedness can improve welfare. Thus, one needs to be careful to not overly constrain such activities. 10\n\nA second issue involves the market response to regulatory constraints. If we constrain certain behavior, firms will likely develop alternative means to accomplish the same ends. 11 One can argue that many of the off-balance-sheet items and special-purpose vehicles that were created in recent years were at least in part attempts to get around regulatory constraints. This so-called regulatory arbitrage also likely increased the role of the shadow financial sector. 12 Thus, while constraints sound straightforward and simple to implement, they may require significant resources to effectively enforce and may be less effective than expected as firms attempt to get around them.\n\nWhile severe limits on the size and scope of financial institutions may be neither feasible nor desirable, if such activities result in risk to the financial system it may be appropriate to impose special requirements on them. Thus, an alternative proposal to address TBTF is to expand the risk-based capital requirements to explicitly account for contributions to systemic risks. This could involve larger weights on factors associated with systemic risk, such as institution size, off-balance-sheet activities, and the degree of interconnectedness with other institutions. Adjusting capital requirements for these and other systemic factors would make the decisions of financial institutions more closely reflect their impact on society rather than just themselves. This idea of forcing financial institutions to account for the impact of their actions on others is also addressed in the Obama administration's proposal. This approach could fit within our existing Basel capital requirements, as regulators could expand the risk factors to account for systemic risk. Of course, we would still encounter regulatory avoidance. And it also could be particularly difficult to decide on the variables and weights to include in the risk-based capital calculations.\n\nThis incorporation of systemic risk factors would require supervisors to obtain improved measures of interconnectedness and systemic importance. Along these lines, the Squam Lake Working Group on Financial Regulation 13 has recommended the development of a new comprehensive database to be managed by supervisors. All larger institutions would be required to provide systemic-risk-related data at regular time intervals—say, on a quarterly basis—into the central system, as would financial institutions of any size deemed to have operations that would lead to significant spillover effects. One could easily envision this including a broad array of financial institutions (banks, thrifts, insurance companies, hedge funds, government-sponsored enterprises, etc.) and possibly entities outside of the financial sector.\n\nThe goal is to allow regulators and, potentially, the market to better understand the fault lines in financial markets and to more clearly understand the impact of systemic risk. The Squam Lake Working Group stresses the need to share the information among regulatory agencies and to provide it to the private markets, perhaps with a lag, to enable the marketplace to detect trends and tendencies that may otherwise be overlooked. 14\n\nIn addition to modifying the risk weights, there have also been proposals to introduce countercyclical capital requirements. It is typically during boom times that excessive risk taking occurs, as firms get caught up in the good times and seem to assume they will continue forever. Countercyclical capital requirements would tend to lean against the wind to combat this. For example, just to fix ideas for the discussion, to be considered adequately capitalized , tier 1 plus tier 2 capital requirements could be changed from 8 percent across the entire business cycle to perhaps 10 percent during \"good times\" and 7 percent during \"problem times.\" Time-varying requirements would serve as a governor to excessive growth and would allow for the generation of an additional capital cushion that could be utilized when the economy slows. Although this would induce credit restraint if imposed in the middle of a cycle, sufficient planning and credibility would ultimately lead institutions to adopt more risk-prudent capital structures.\n\nWhile I believe there is a place for such revisions to capital requirements, again, the details are crucial. Attempting to force firms to hold capital to reflect the systemic risks they pose is easy to defend in principle, but very difficult to adequately implement. Liquidity problems were a major concern during the recent crisis. How would liquidity be incorporated into changes in capital requirements? Recall that the Basel capital requirements generated concerns about banks gaming imperfections in the relative capital requirements across asset risk categories. Imposing capital requirements on systemic-risk-related factors and weights that vary across the business cycle would be significantly more difficult and would induce a response by the affected firms. Thus, regulators would need to anticipate and react to that response in setting policy. As such, properly setting capital requirements will likely be an ongoing, iterative process.\n\nContingent capital and self-created bankruptcy plans\n\nThe idea of supplementing bank capital during \"good\" times has been taken further by Mark Flannery and members of the Squam Lake Working Group. Fundamentally, the argument is that banks need to hold more capital and they tend to resist holding higher levels because it is expensive. Similarly, existing shareholders are not in favor of issuing new capital because of the associated dilutive effects. To address this problem, the Squam Lake Working Group proposes that systemically important banks should be required to issue new \"contingent capital certificates.\" These securities would be sold as debt liabilities that make standard tax-deductible interest payments. However, unlike conventional debt obligations, they would be converted into equity shares if some predetermined threshold was breached. 15 The triggering mechanism could be based on a number of things including existing capital levels, equity share prices, declaration by the regulators that conditions of systemic stress exist, or a violation of covenants in the debt contract. Conversion would not be optional; rather it would be mandatory once triggered by one of these mechanisms. If all goes well, the bonds are retired with typical cash payments to the debt holders. However, if the bank's position deteriorates, the debt converts into new equity shares, diluting the existing shares and serving to cushion losses. To avoid reaching this point of conversion the bank would likely be more willing to promptly issue new equity when difficulties are encountered. Thus, the new debt instruments could improve risk-taking incentives and provide an additional capital cushion to insulate taxpayers and the deposit insurance fund from costly interventions. Another problem might occur if the supply of funds to these convertible investments is small, and hence, the debt would be expensive. Well, if more capital was in place, the convertible debt would be less likely to convert; hence, it would be less risky and presumably cheaper. For safety and soundness reasons, a better capital structure is a key objective, and these forces help to improve the capital structure.\n\nA related alternative involves enhancing capital cushions by requiring systemically important firms to purchase contingent capital in the form of capital insurance. 16 The general purpose is the same as that for using contingent capital certificates—that is, to provide a source of additional capital during crisis periods. With this proposal it is imperative that the insurance be fail-proof; thus, proposals typically require that the insurance funds be placed in a segregated lock box—perhaps in Treasuries. 17 Targeted issuers of the insurance could include sovereign wealth funds or private equity. The trigger for the insurance payment could be based on the condition of the individual firm or on the condition of the financial industry. Again, the purpose of the insurance is to address catastrophes; thus it would be more commonly associated with deteriorating industry conditions.\n\nA final reform proposal requires that systemically important financial institutions help plan their own resolution process. The idea is to have a \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan that has already considered and addressed problem resolution areas. This may sound somewhat odd, but the firm itself must be in a preferred position to be aware of potential impediments to resolution. 18 Supervisors would require firms to address potential resolution problem areas, such as the transfer of the derivatives book or resolution of foreign subsidiaries. One can envision this plan being stress tested as part of the regular examination process. Such a discussion would yield risk-management benefits for the firms and the supervisor. Requiring such a plan could also somewhat constrain firms from taking on higher-risk activities during boom times and would force them to think about contingent plans and develop them even when financial difficulties seem far removed. Again, the plan sets up ex ante procedures to help avoid conditions that require consideration of TBTF.\n\nAs interesting as these new proposals are, they also have potential implementation problems. Again, details count. For contingent capital there is the matter of deciding on the appropriate conversion trigger. For the \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan, there are potential issues of regulatory avoidance and attempting to hide relevant information. There is also the issue of deciding whether the information should be made public. All these issues need to be carefully evaluated. The quality of the decisions on these details will determine the effectiveness of the new program.\n\nClosing comments\n\nSo where do I come out on these issues? I do believe that we can do a much better job of preventing (albeit, not entirely avoiding) crisis situations and I believe we can be better prepared to address them when they do occur. Much of the current policy discussion on the need for some form of a systemic risk regulator and improved resolution process is most appropriate and should be thoroughly vetted. Both ideas are included in President Obama's regulatory reform proposal that was recently sent to Congress. Obviously, there are a number of details to be addressed, but I hope we can grasp the moment and not let the opportunity to implement meaningful reform pass.\n\nI believe that such policies aimed at influencing the ex ante behavior of the firm are likely to be effective at avoiding crisis situations in the first place. The reinforcement or backup capital created through the contingent capital or catastrophe insurance requirements would better enable firms to ride out the turbulent times. The countercyclical capital requirements and/or the self-created \"shelf bankruptcy\" plan could serve as a governor on risk-taking during boom times, again, serving to decrease the potential for encountering financial crises. It could also lead to a more efficient and effective failure resolution process. I believe these proposals merit careful consideration.\n\nFor a number of reasons, I think it is important to create \"regime-shifting\" reforms. Here, the reform proposals could also be useful in that they announce to the industry that a new regulatory environment exists. Procedures would be in place to dampen the potential need for TBTF policies. There would be fewer costs involved from letting relatively complex firms be resolved without social assistance. Thus, there would be fewer incentives to protect the troubled financial firm. Realizing this, it would be in the financial firm's best interest to more prudently manage risk. Less emphasis would be placed on regulatory experiences from the past. Moral hazard would be reduced.\n\nFinally, while I find a number of these proposals to be interesting, I don't see how any in isolation would fully address all the associated problems. It seems that there is a need for a systemic regulator and a fully developed failure resolution plan for systemically important firms. While these changes are necessary, additional tools are required to alter firm behavior to lower the potential for encountering problems and to make the resolution go smoothly once it becomes necessary. I believe a number of the proposals discussed could serve that purpose, and they would be complementary instead of substitutes. They warrant serious consideration if we are to adequately address the issues associated with TBTF.\n\nNotes\n\n1 See The Banking Act of 2009, available online ; and U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2009, Financial Regulatory Reform, A New Foundation: Rebuilding Financial Supervision and Regulation , Washington, DC, June 17, available online .\n\n2 While Continental Illinois is often associated with the first use of the TBTF policy in the U.S., many of the characteristics of the resolution were not unique and had been utilized before. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had provided assistance in the form of a $325 million loan to First Pennsylvania only four years earlier.

    "text": "Introduction\n\nThanks to the Economic Club of Indiana for inviting me to speak today. I'm delighted to be here to share my thoughts on the economy during this challenging period. I'd like to say a special thank you to Ann Murtlow, who is a member of our Chicago Fed Board of Directors. As a member of the Board, Ann provides us with valuable information on the regional business outlook and credit conditions. This information not only helps us gauge the local economies within the Seventh District, but also contributes to our understanding of developments in the national economy. Ann also supports an important function with respect to monetary and credit policy—the Directors vote on the setting for the Bank's discount rate, which is what we charge banks for borrowing from the Fed. This is, of course, particularly important during the current economic difficulties.\n\nToday, I will discuss the recent events in financial markets and the Federal Reserve's responses to them. I will also give you my take on the current economic outlook. As always, these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet me begin with the financial crisis.\n\nEarly Stages of the Financial Crisis\n\nOver the past year we have witnessed the deteriorating performance of mortgages and a broad array of mortgage-backed securities—some of which, as you know, are highly structured instruments with opaque risk profiles. The problems in mortgages have spilled over to other segments of our financial markets. Market participants have reassessed the risk profiles of other complex securities, and the prices of these assets have declined as well. This cascading process of re-pricing has had a detrimental impact on the liquidity and capital positions of a wide range of financial institutions in the United States and around the world.\n\nThe resulting disruptions to financial markets have made credit more costly and more difficult to obtain for many households and businesses. Banks are reluctant to lend even to one another because of concerns over counterparty risk, the desire to preserve liquidity, and limited balance sheet capacity. This has resulted in large increases between the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, and the federal funds rate. LIBOR, of course, is a common benchmark for the interest rate charged on short-term interbank lending. Many banks set their interest rates on loans to households and businesses as a markup over their cost of funds, as measured by LIBOR. Increases in LIBOR, no doubt, have translated into higher borrowing rates for those of you operating a business today. Before this financial turmoil began, the 30-day LIBOR rate typically hovered about 10 basis points above the level of the fed funds rate that would be expected to prevail over the term of the loan. Since the summer of 2007 the spread has risen substantially, averaging about 50 basis points between August 2007 and August 2008, with a couple of spikes to about 1 percent.\n\nStrains on financial institutions have also spilled over to other markets, like that for commercial paper. Because of concerns over their ability to meet future payments, some financial services firms have had difficulty rolling over commercial paper or have seen their costs of issuing paper rise substantially. These difficulties are also affecting the availability and cost of commercial paper funding to nonfinancial firms. Nonfinancial firms often issue commercial paper to fund regular operations such as meeting payrolls and buying materials. In addition, finance companies issue commercial paper to support leasing and to extend credit to nonfinancial customers, such as in the provision of car loans and the financing of inventories.\n\nThe tightening of credit conditions has weighed on spending by households and businesses. Their spending capacity was also reduced by the protracted weakness in housing markets, along with earlier increases in prices for energy and other commodities. As a result, aggregate economic activity edged down in the third quarter and has since deteriorated to the point that the U.S. economy is now clearly in the midst of a substantial downturn.\n\nOver the past couple of months, we have witnessed another wave of large-scale disruptions to the financial services industry. These recent developments reflect a confluence of factors.\n\nAs we moved through the summer, the financial system faced increasing difficulties owing to further deterioration of the economy. Consumption began to contract noticeably and labor markets declined at an accelerating pace. The weakness in economic activity intensified the strains on banks since not only mortgage loans, but also business, car, and credit card loans started to exhibit higher default risks. The deteriorating credit risks led banks to hold on to liquid assets even more and to tighten credit standards even further.\n\nAt the same time that the macroeconomic picture was deteriorating, a number of large financial firms were reporting severe losses. Some institutions—notably Wachovia, Washington Mutual, and Merrill Lynch—appeared unable to survive on their own and were purchased by large banks. However, losses at Lehman Brothers were especially large, a buyer could not be found, and, consequently Lehman had to declare bankruptcy. At almost the same time, American International Group (AIG), one of the most important issuers of credit default insurance, found itself unable to meet its liabilities without a loan from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThese developments dealt a serious blow to market confidence. The problems in these major institutions intensified financial market participants' concerns about the ability of their counterparties to repay debt. This heightened assessment of risk resulted in funding becoming even more difficult and expensive to obtain across a spectrum of markets.\n\nIn the interbank market, LIBOR spreads spiked up again, jumping briefly to as high as 335 basis points. This, of course, made many types of bank loans even more expensive. Banks also further tightened their credit standards for new lending to both businesses and households.\n\nIn credit markets, concerns about the loss exposure of even normally highly rated firms led to a fall in value of a wide range of debt instruments and derivative products. In commercial paper, this was reflected in a spike in rates for many issues, particularly those for asset-backed securities and the paper of lower-rated nonfinancial firms.\n\nFurthermore, the problems in the commercial paper and other short-term lending markets continued to spread following the initial shock. In part, this reflected a feedback loop between these markets and the money market mutual funds. Money market funds hold commercial paper and repurchase agreements with highly rated firms. Money market mutual funds that held Lehman or other now-distressed paper were exposed to potentially significant losses. Indeed, the Reserve Primary Fund, ended up \"breaking the buck,\" meaning its net asset value per share dropped below $1, after suffering losses on its holdings of Lehman debt.\n\nAs a result of such losses, many investors began redeeming funds from money market accounts or shifting funds into Treasury-only accounts. To meet the redemptions, many money market funds had to liquidate assets into an already depressed market. In addition, other commercial paper was downgraded and became ineligible to be purchased by money market mutual funds, exerting further downward pressure on this market. Furthermore, as perceived price risk and redemption risk increased dramatically, there was a marked reduction in the maturity of commercial paper and other debt being rolled through the markets.\n\nAs a consequence of these pressures, even some highly rated firms found it more difficult and expensive to obtain short-term financing through the commercial paper and repo markets. Some of these firms have been able to tap bank back-up lines of credit. But this substitution just pushes the money market difficulties back into the banking system. The drawdowns of existing bank revolvers and credit lines increase the size of banks' balance sheets at a time when they are trying to reduce leverage. Thus, they potentially squeeze out the ability of banks to make other loans. This is similar to how the redemptions by the money market funds' customers reduced the funds' capacity to invest in commercial paper that nonfinancial firms then use to fund operations.\n\nActions by the Federal Reserve\n\nThe Fed has implemented a number of policy responses to these extraordinary events, aimed at mitigating the problems in the financial system and their potential fallout on the spending and production capacity of the rest of the economy.\n\nFirst, the Fed turned to its traditional monetary policy instruments, that is, to reductions in the federal funds and the discount rate. In August 2007, the Fed reduced the spread of the discount rate over the federal funds rate from 100 basis points to 50 basis points; and last March it was reduced further to 25 basis points. The first funds rate cut occurred in September 2007. The initial moves during the fall of 2007 were measured, but eventually gave way to more aggressive rate cuts. Today, the funds rate is 1 percent, 425 basis points lower than when we began.\n\nAlthough the corresponding injections of liquidity into the overnight interbank market have reduced restrictive credit conditions somewhat, it became clear early on that further and alternative extensions of central bank liquidity would be necessary to restore adequate interbank lending at term and further facilitate market functioning.\n\nEven in normal times, the discount window at the Fed is available to sound depository institutions in order to smooth payment difficulties. Such lending can also help the flow of credit in interbank markets more generally, and as early as the fall of 2007, the Fed made a number of substantial changes to the operation of the window to encourage its use. One change was increasing the maximum term of the loans to up to 90 days; traditionally, borrowing at the window was overnight or very short term. And since these changes have been made, we have seen a large increase in lending to depository institutions.\n\nEarlier this year, new market dysfunctions emerged, like the collapse of the auction-rate security market. And then the sudden demise of Bear Sterns last March. These episodes clearly indicated that in this strained environment, financial market participants other than depository institutions might face liquidity shortfalls that could have serious, far-ranging repercussions for the economy. This led the Fed to create a number of facilities to directly provide liquidity to non-depository institutions; the Federal Reserve Act grants us such emergency powers when the economy is faced with \"unusual and exigent circumstances.\"\n\nAt first, these measures were aimed at lending to broker-dealers who engage in securities transactions with the Fed and who have a large-scale presence in the repo and other short-term funding markets. Most recently, we have introduced new lending facilities to help work through the disruptions in the money market mutual fund and commercial paper markets. These programs provide a liquidity backstop for commercial paper and facilitate the sale in secondary markets of a number of instruments held by money market funds. Although it is still early, I am hopeful that these programs will have substantial, positive effects on restoring liquidity in the short-term financing market. Indeed, the spreads between commercial paper and the fed funds rate have fallen, retracing most of the run-up that occurred in mid September.\n\nOf course, the Federal Reserve has not been dealing with the crisis in a vacuum. Congress also responded by enacting the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. As part of the act, the Treasury has injected significant capital into the banking system. In addition, deposit insurance limits have been increased and the FDIC has put in place special facilities to insure other liabilities of depository institutions.\n\nI believe that together, the actions by the Fed and the other branches of government will help unlock lending capacity and will move us toward financial stability. But it will not be an easy process, and it could take some time before financial markets function in a manner that does not impinge on the activities of businesses and households.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nThat brings me to recent developments in the nonfinancial sectors of the economy, and the outlook for over the next few years.\n\nOver the past year, the U.S. economy has been slowing, and in the third quarter, GDP fell at an annual rate of 0.3 percent. Payrolls, which had been declining slowly since December 2007, fell sharply in September and October, bringing the year-to-date job losses to 1.2 million. There also has been a sharp rise in the unemployment rate—in October, it was 6.5 percent. Weak labor markets and rising consumer prices have held back growth in real incomes. These, along with the financial strains, have led to marked weakness in business investment, industrial production, and consumer spending. Indeed, the declines in consumer spending over the past few months have been very large—on par with the drops experienced during the 1990 and 1982 recessions.\n\nSo, currently, aggregate economic activity is contracting. At this time it is very difficult to judge how long the downturn might last and how deep it ultimately will be. As financial markets work through their problems—with important help from government policy—and credit flows improve, we will see a return of growth in spending, production, and employment. But given the magnitude of the problems that we face, we could see activity remaining quite sluggish through much of 2009.\n\nThis thinking shaped the forecast that I submitted at our most recent FOMC meeting on October 28th and 29th. At that time the central tendency of the forecasts of the Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents for GDP growth for 2008 as a whole was a range of 0 to 0.3 percent. Given that GDP growth averaged a bit under 2 percent in the first half of the year—well, you can do the math—these forecasts imply a noticeable decline in real GDP in the second half of the year.\n\nIn explaining their forecasts, many participants noted the weakening data on consumer spending, stock market wealth, consumer confidence, and labor market conditions as well as the severe dislocations in credit markets. These factors were expected to weigh heavily on household and business spending in 2008 and persist to some degree in 2009. Furthermore, weakness abroad was expected to hold back growth in exports. Accordingly, participants were looking for a relatively gradual recovery, with most of the forecasts for 2009 being somewhere between a 1/4 percent decline and a 1 percent increase in real GDP. The recovery is expected to take hold more firmly in 2010 and 2011.\n\nIn this growth environment, most forecasts had the unemployment rate rising to between 7.1 and 7.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2009 before moving down to between 5-1/2 and 6-1/2 percent by the end of 2011. Such unemployment rates would mean that a substantial degree of resource slack would remain in the economy over the next few years. This slack, along with the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities, should bring down inflation. Increases in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures were projected to fall from the 2-3/4 to 3 percent range in 2008 to between 1.4 and 1.7 percent in 2011. To me, this outcome would be consistent with price stability.\n\nWhen submitting these forecasts, the Committee members also noted that the degree of uncertainty about the outlook was unusually high. In large part this reflects the wide range of possible outcomes for the financial crisis and the associated interactions with the real economy. Personally, I thought it was easier to envision the bad-outcome scenarios than the good ones. Most of my colleagues agreed, and so viewed the risks to the forecast as being skewed to the downside.\n\nIndeed, since these projections were made, the incoming data, particularly on consumer spending and labor market conditions, have been weaker than I had expected. That said, not all of the news has been bad. The prices for energy and other commodities have come down further. And, as I mentioned earlier, we have seen some declines in spreads on interbank borrowing rates and the commercial paper market. I am hopeful that we will see continued improvement in financial market functioning and that this will show through in improved credit terms for households and nonfinancial businesses. But, as I noted earlier, it likely will be a while before markets are functioning in a manner that we would characterize as smooth and efficient.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe U.S. economy continues to face many challenges. The Fed has been proactive in addressing market liquidity stress during the financial crisis—first by using our monetary policy tools and later through our improvised lending facilities in response to financial markets. Moving forward, it is important that we be vigilant in monitoring the risks to growth, as well as any risks to the prospects for obtaining price stability. It is also important for us to continue to collaborate with global policymakers in the pursuit of financial stability worldwide. We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance. But the policy actions taken by the Fed and other governmental agencies over the course of the financial crisis, and the effort of the private sector to work through their difficulties, will eventually help support a recovery in economic growth.\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

    "text": "If I were here to address this group simply as an economic researcher, I might start with something like this. Both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have taken actions recently in order to address exceptional problems in financial markets. Without these moves, the costs to our financial infrastructure and real economy would have soared far beyond those we are experiencing today. But these necessary actions also have the unfortunate consequence of distorting incentives for future behavior. Unchecked, they could lead to costly future problems in the functioning of markets.\n\nSome might say that incurring such future costs would simply be reaping what is being sown today by ignoring the lessons of the \"rules v. discretion\" literature. Although I don't subscribe to this view, it does cause me some concern. But, I think the current environment is also one in which we have to worry about the evil agent in Hansen and Sargent's robust control analyses. Recall that the \"evil agent\" is a parable for how we might end up in states of the world that fall outside of our typical probability distributions and entail huge downside costs to the economy. Robust policy guards against these outcomes, and I interpret the Fed's aggressive and innovative lending programs to be \"robust responses\" to probability distortions caused by a particularly evil agent.\n\nBut, of course, I'm not here to speak simply as an economic researcher so let me give you my perspective as a Fed president instead. As always, these are my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday, the U.S. economic and financial systems are facing their greatest challenges since World War II. Turmoil in the housing market accelerated in the summer of 2007. We have experienced large-scale disruptions to financial intermediation and the destruction of something on the order of ten trillion dollars of U.S. household wealth. 1 We are now a full year into a recession: Many non-financial industries are facing substantial risks of long-term structural impairment; and according to most economic forecasts, the unemployment rate will likely exceed 8 percent this year.\n\nBeyond these serious immediate concerns, the U.S. economy is facing a number of diverse and difficult longer-term challenges. First, significant weaknesses have been revealed in our system of financial regulation. Market discipline did not prevent excessively leveraged portfolios and inadequate risk-management, and a patchwork of regulatory authorities failed to curb excessive risk-taking or detect systemic vulnerabilities. These failures call for a reassessment of the roles of market discipline and our regulatory structures in supporting the efficient functioning of financial markets.\n\nSecond, the Federal Reserve has undertaken policy actions of historic proportion. We have aggressively cut the federal funds rate, our traditional policy lever. We have also created multiple new lending facilities and transformed the asset side of our balance sheet. And, going forward, we will be expanding nontraditional policies now that the fed funds rate is approximately zero. Accordingly, we are faced with the challenge of calibrating these unfamiliar policies and, in the future, determining the appropriate time and methods for winding them down.\n\nThird, public policy responses have increasingly moved toward fiscal interventions. To date, these have mostly been aimed at improving market functioning: the Treasury's TARP program, FDIC guarantees, and the Hope for Homeowners Act, and other programs to re-work mortgages. Looking ahead, we expect large amounts of more traditional types of fiscal stimulus to increase aggregate demand. I believe a big stimulus is appropriate. But it is also sobering to be deploying large amounts of tax-payer funds at a time when our fiscal balance sheet is already coming under significant stress: The federal debt held by the public is 38 percent of GDP, states have large unfunded liabilities, and growing numbers of retiring baby-boomers will further pressure the unfunded liabilities for Social Security and Medicare. Furthermore—especially in light of current economic difficulties—many taxpayers already consider their tax burdens to be very high.\n\nFinally, the monetary and fiscal policy interventions have been fast-moving and complex responses to extraordinary events. As such, they are difficult to communicate succinctly, require periodic re-calibrations as events change, and are often misunderstood—even by well-informed segments of the public. There is a great need for effective communications and transparency in policy-making. This extends beyond communications with financial market participants. Efforts to enhance the general public's understanding of economic and financial issues are essential. In a democracy, an informed public is critical if government officials are to carry out policies for the public good. So it is important that policy makers and informed private citizens—like you in the NABE—continue to enhance communication efforts.\n\nAlthough each of these topics is worthy of an extensive discussion, time will allow me to make only a few modest observations on these long-term challenges.\n\nIf I were here to address this group simply as an economic researcher, I might start with something like this.

So it is important that policy makers and informed private citizens—like you in the NABE—continue to enhance communication efforts.\n\nAlthough each of these topics is worthy of an extensive discussion, time will allow me to make only a few modest observations on these long-term challenges.\n\nThe Future of Market Discipline and Regulation\n\nMarket discipline plays a vital role in testing and validating corporate strategies and business execution. In most cases during normal times, financial markets can assimilate the relevant information to provide these important signals to investors. They then serve as a restraint on individual institutions taking undue risks.\n\nBut I think we've learned from recent events that the force of market discipline can fail in unexpected ways. The mechanisms are not fully clear, but it seems that in the quiescent period before the current crisis, market prices indicated a high value for residential housing and housing-related investments, such as MBSs and CDOs, with little perceived risk. Markets responded to these signals by increasing their provision of these investments, but with little attention paid to risk management. Then, after the crisis hit, market prices swiftly reversed. Now, they signaled what were arguably extremely low values for these same housing-related securities. It's likely that the true value of these securities lies somewhere between the euphoria of 2005 and the pessimism of 2008, but one could not infer this from market signals. Rather, it seems that these abrupt swings in market valuations were due at least in part to equally abrupt changes in market liquidity conditions. I don't claim to fully understand these changes in liquidity conditions. But the high prices earlier this decade may have been associated with the flood of liquidity into U.S. capital markets from abroad. And the current low valuations may derive in part from reduced liquidity due to balance sheet constraints and counterparty concerns surrounding financial institutions that have suffered significant losses. In any case, it appears that at least in extreme cases, market-liquidity distortions can defeat price transparency. This, in turn can inhibit the effect of market discipline on individual firm behavior.\n\nIn times of market stress, price movements are dominated by aggregate risk conditions, rather than the fundamental condition of individual firms. These movements can be driven by many factors. Industries, firms, or financial products which seem unrelated may become unexpectedly interconnected due to deterioration, or simply the perception of deterioration, in the health of one or more key financial intermediaries or market-makers. Separately, financial investors may suddenly reassess the relative risk/return profiles of certain classes of financial instruments and transactions, and may simply adopt a heightened level of risk aversion.\n\nHow might we mitigate some of the potentially adverse consequences of such interconnectedness? The futures and derivatives industry is weighing whether privately negotiated derivatives contracts should be centrally cleared or remain collateralized bilaterally among pairs of counterparties. An increasing number of derivatives contracts are now being multilaterally netted by central counterparties, or clearinghouses. Central clearing of such contracts shifts exposures from particular counterparties' balance sheets to the clearinghouse. For example, a significant effort is underway to begin central clearing of credit-default swaps. This effort is a reaction to the lack of transparency that left market participants not knowing which of their counterparties might be liable for large losses on credit-default swap positions. Arguably, this uncertainty caused many market participants to withdraw from trading a wide spectrum of financial instruments in which counterparty performance might be called into question. Of course, centralized clearing does not eliminate performance risk; it simply concentrates it at the clearinghouse. This means the clearinghouse itself becomes a potential single point of failure. Accordingly, adequate capital, good risk-management and prudential oversight are essential for such clearing facilities.\n\nAlthough forecasting is usually a very difficult task, some forecasts are easier than others. For example, it is not difficult now to predict that financial institutions will face more intense supervision and regulation. Indeed, investment banks and other financial institutions have already agreed to added scrutiny by applying to become bank holding companies. Presumably, the enhanced supervision will take aim at some of the obvious culprits of the recent turmoil. One objective would be to prevent a reoccurrence of imprudent mortgage lending practices: in particular, lending decisions that were not properly based on a borrower's underlying \"ability to pay\" but instead were viable only if housing prices continued to rise. Another aim would be more realistic assessments of firms' exposures to seemingly remote off-balance sheet assets.\n\nWe have also seen that a range of firms and institutions can be systemically important for financial stability. So it seems likely that the scope of financial enterprises subject to \"systemic\" supervision might need to be expanded as well. Here, too, the regulatory decisions will be difficult. Questions about changes in the treatment of clearing houses, exchanges, hedge funds, and private equity investors must be studied carefully. Furthermore, the types of financial entities that are systemically important may change over time. Of course, tighter regulation carries with it risks that must be taken into consideration, including the potential effect on innovation, the higher financing charges to recover the added costs of regulation, and the possibility that riskier activities may simply shift to off-shore jurisdictions. This latter risk highlights the need for international cooperation and coordination on regulatory reforms.\n\nDiscussions about systemic risks lead naturally to the topic of how to respond to asset price bubbles. The first issue in this discussion must be how to identify asset price bubbles. This was the famous question asked by Alan Greenspan in December 1996. It is important to get this right—I continue to be concerned that, as Chairman Greenspan pointed out, an aggressive campaign to fight a perceived asset bubble could entail large downside costs if the assessment proves to be wrong. That said, we are currently bearing enormous downside costs from the fallout from large mortgage-related asset losses, and this fact reinforces the need for changes in policy. My view is that we should concentrate on designing macro-prudential regulatory policies aimed at helping to prevent and protect against the consequences of asset price bubbles. Strong systemic supervision and enhanced market discipline will need to be a part of this design.\n\nFinally, strong supervision and market discipline will periodically determine that a financial institution is no longer viable. So a high-priority issue is the need to design a more efficient and orderly process to resolve the insolvency of large complex non-banking institutions. Such a process should be aimed at reducing the systemic ramifications of an imminent insolvency on the financial system and the economy. This raises a number of questions. What functions and size thresholds should be used to determine which institutions are covered? What are the appropriate triggers to invoke the insolvency resolution process? How should the priority of creditors' claims be established? Should the process include the possibility of a bridge bank type institution established by the regulatory authority? The answers to these questions must also confront the possibility that systemic problems may arise before insolvency, as counterparties may be reluctant to trade with an institution that is in distress.\n\nFiscal Implications of Policy Actions\n\nThe second long-term issue that will influence the future course of monetary and public policy is the quantity of government debt. The Federal Reserve has responded to the financial crisis by establishing a number of lending facilities, which have altered the composition and size of our balance sheet. And the Federal Reserve System has begun outright purchases of GSE debt and mortgage-backed securities to enhance liquidity in those markets and further reduce interest rates. Aggressive fiscal policy responses have also taken place during this recession: the initial tax cut stimulus, the Troubled-Asset Recovery Plan (TARP), FDIC guarantees for senior bank debt, and several programs aimed at delivering relief for troubled homeowners. And more traditional stimulus packages will be coming soon.\n\nFor me, the economic rationale is clear: Without these policy actions, the downturn—and its costs to society—would be even more severe than what we are currently facing. They hold open the promise of mitigating the losses in jobs and output during the downturn. And avoiding unnecessary realignments of financial, physical, and human capital would reduce any permanent impairment to the economy's productive infrastructure. Since most economic forecasters envision the current downturn as rivaling the deep recessions of 1974–75 and 1981–85, I think these fiscal programs must be large in order to be effective and to instill badly needed confidence.\n\nNo matter how necessary these actions may be, there are some devilishly difficult judgments involved. Our profession needs many constructive voices to remind us all of the effects that these public policies may have on the nation's long-term finances.\n\nBy historical standards, our current fiscal debt is not unusually large; but our expected future obligations are enormous. The war on terrorism continues generating great human cost and sacrifice, and mounting government debt. The onset of the baby-boomers' retirement will further pressure intergenerational insurance programs, such as Social Security and Medicare. In addition, many state pension plans are underfunded relative to future obligations. So the value of prudent fiscal management is high.\n\nCommunications and Policy Risks\n\nWith much of my time used up, I now come to one of the most important challenges policymakers face: communications. While we at the Fed pride ourselves on always conducting extensive, thorough analyses of all economic issues, our efforts to analyze the current situation and design appropriate policy initiatives are probably unprecedented in scope. But policymakers face another very important challenge: In a complex and dynamic environment, the public needs effective and transparent communications. As our lending facilities and other policy responses continue to evolve, this is a daunting task.\n\nIt would be nice if we could provide a simple summary of the country's financial predicament. I'll give it a try,—and, you will quickly see that it is inadequate in many ways. Here goes: Many investments and bets were placed on the assumption of ever increasing housing values. These positions were leveraged and amplified by innovative financial engineering based on an overly confident belief that risks could be dispersed to the winds. These beliefs became assurances that were too often accepted by investors, credit agencies, and regulators. All parties failed to see the possibility and extent of systemic vulnerabilities. As the bets turned sour and correlations among seemingly unrelated financial returns increased, losses cascaded into large disruptions to our financial system. These disruptions have negatively affected real economic activity, causing further losses in the financial sector and worsening the disruption. So, policy has responded in a number of new and targeted ways to these financial disruptions with the intention of mitigating the negative impact on economic activity.\n\nAs a communications device for explaining why we have transformed and expanded the Fed's balance sheet, this summary is simple but incomplete. It leaves out many critical details and fails to capture three key issues: complexity, speed, and uncertainty.\n\nMy earlier comments on market discipline and financial product structure have already touched on the complexity issue, but here's another example. Following the use of TARP funds to inject capital into the banking system, a notable public concern has been the absence of any obligation for banks to lend in exchange for this new capital. We have not done a good enough job in communicating that even though analyses of previous banking crises suggest that capital injections are more likely to unlock lending capacity at banks, it is not beneficial to substitute a policymaker's judgment over a banker's judgment with regard to initiating individual loans. We can productively insert judgment in some broad ways—such as on the supervisory side in questioning risk-management practices—but not on the ex ante review of individual lending decisions.\n\nTurning to speed, it is sometimes necessary to address emerging distress with quick action; and the time between that action and the communication of a full explanation of the events can seem uncomfortably long. We have provided a good deal of information to the public. In the past 18 months, Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Paulson have testified before Congress many times, and Federal Reserve officials have given numerous speeches about our policies. The minutes of our FOMC meetings also provide further context for our actions. And we now publish extended forecasts quarterly, with a commentary describing the forces shaping these outlooks. Still, we should strive to do more.\n\nUndoubtedly, the greatest challenge we face is the enormous uncertainty of this situation. Yes, the irony between \"undoubtedly\" and \"uncertainty\" is fully intended here. I discussed the challenges earlier of assessing financial risk from liquidity, credit, solvency or agency sources.\n\nThose are surely large. But I am also thinking of an important observation made by Robert Lucas long ago: As advice-giving profession, we economists are in way over our heads. At any time, this is a sobering and humbling thought to remember. Nevertheless, in the current environment, this reminds me that the pursuit of robust policies in the face of large uncertainties is likely to be most efficacious. A good Bayesian decision maker can't place all of his or her policy bets on a single hypothesized diagnosis when the evidence is still ambiguous. If Hansen and Sargent's evil agent is out there somewhere distorting probability distributions, he is doing a devilishly good job.\n\nThe need to act in the presence of ambiguity and such unusual events certainly adds to our policy and communications challenges. These challenges are further compounded by the fact that in order to restore the best balance between market discipline and government intervention, it is important for all of us to recognize that the current situation is a once in a 100-year event, not to be repeated in our lifetimes (or at least not to be expected sooner).\n\nConsequently, I think the communications response must be to \"never give up.\" We need to work very hard to explain the risks that we are facing and the rationale for why we think our policy actions best address those risks. As I alluded to earlier, much digital ink has been spilled in these attempts so far. More is on the way. If ink were fiscal stimulus, we might see a more rapid economic recovery in 2009.\n\nNote\n\nNote: Opinions expressed in this article are those of Charles L.

    "text": "Today I would like to discuss some of the challenges that the recent turmoil in financial markets poses for research in both financial markets and monetary economics. I am sure that many of you, too, have been struggling with the questions and problems that I will be talking about this evening. And, of course, I need to state from the start that the views I will be expressing are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOver the years, the research community and policymakers have developed a good framework for thinking about monetary policy reactions to real–side shocks. For instance, if we think about the appropriate policy response to an oil shock, there is widespread agreement on the broad outline of models that are useful to answer the question. Typically, we would turn to a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, (DSGE) model, with both nominal and real rigidities; estimate or calibrate the parameters of the model; and then trace out the responses to the real shock under different policy actions—and perhaps under different policy responses. Certainly many details remain disputed, such as the extent of nominal versus real rigidities, or the appropriate form of adjustment costs; these details are very important, but they do not challenge the basic tools we empirical macroeconomists use for policy analysis.\n\nHowever, unlike real shocks, we don't, as yet, have such a well-developed toolkit with which to analyze financial shocks. The events of the past year certainly have reminded us of this point. So tonight I would like to discuss some of the difficulties we face in modeling financial shocks, and do so through the prism of the recent turmoil in financial markets.\n\nLet's step back and think about some of the tough questions I am sure all of us have been grappling with over the past year. Can markets easily work around the disruptions to the credit intermediation process that channels funds from savers to borrowers? Or have we experienced a permanent destruction in something we might want to think about as the financial sector capital stock? If so, does the economy need to develop entirely new infrastructures for some types of intermediation, or perhaps will reviving earlier more traditional approaches suffice once the turmoil has abated? And how will we know when markets settle out to the \"new normal steady state?\" With regard to policy, what—if any—public sector actions can assist this transition? Finally, and most importantly, what are the consequences of this turmoil for the achievement of the Fed's ultimate policy goals—maximum sustainable growth and price stability?\n\nTo answer these questions and provide a better basis for policy prescriptions, we need to be able to model how various disruptions in financial markets affect credit provision, and how these effects, in turn, impact the real economy. Ideally, we would want to analyze these financial developments using a well-articulated and empirically implementable modeling framework. Executing this program is tricky business. And, as I will discuss, I think we still have some work left to do—first in better understanding the fundamentals underlying the current financial shocks and, once we do, in figuring out how to best adjust our empirical models to measure their influence on the macroeconomy.\n\nCharacterizing Financial Shocks in Theoretical Models\n\nAt the Chicago Fed, our initial response to the financial turmoil was to try to classify the financial crisis as a shock that could easily be inserted into a standard DSGE model.\n\nHowever, deciding on the appropriate characterization of the shock has turned out to be a frustrating exercise. Modern macro models have identified and estimated a number of \"standard\" shocks—shocks to total factor productivity (TFP), marginal rates of substitutions, monetary policy, and so on. But less progress has been made with regard to modeling a \"financial infrastructure shock.\"\n\nNow, a term like \"financial infrastructure shock\" can encompass a large variety of episodes. I will focus on the recent troubles experienced by secondary financial markets, evidenced by the large increase in yield spreads for a wide range of structured securities and even the failure of certain assets to trade at any price. Of course, these started in the market for mortgage-backed and related securities and then spread to other types of structured finance.\n\nThe first step is to look at abstract theoretical models. These have shown that asymmetric information, moral hazard, and agency issues can generate an important role for liquid assets in channeling credit between lenders and borrowers.\n\nOne natural starting point is the model of Diamond and Dybvig and the large literature that followed it. 1 These papers consider the problems that information asymmetries pose for the functioning of primary credit markets, the role of liquidity in addressing such problems, and the possibility of speculative runs in such environments. While they traditionally have been applied to the banking sector, they can also be used to think about a broader class of intermediaries that borrow short-term funds to finance less liquid, long-term investments; this broad class may include investment banks, broker-dealers, various off-balance-sheet entities such as structured investment vehicles, and even hedge funds. Accordingly, these models are helpful for thinking about the current situation, in which liquidity shortages have caused a number of markets to seize up and have resulted in run-like activity on some non-bank lenders.\n\nNonetheless, there is a good deal that these models leave unexplained. They simply take as given the illiquidity of long-term investments that are traded in primary capital markets in which borrowers and lenders interact directly. They do not explain illiquidity per se. As such, they fall short in explaining the current turmoil, which in large part reflects the sudden illiquidity of some assets that used to be re-traded in very deep secondary markets. 2\n\nRecently, Kiyotaki and Moore developed a model in which credit frictions operate not only in the primary market but also in secondary markets. 3 They trace out some implications for consumption when liquidity seizes up, and have some interesting policy prescriptions that I will discuss in a minute. That said, they too take as given the degree of liquidity: The shock to liquidity is a primitive in their model, with no explanation why some assets that previously were very liquid suddenly stop being traded. Without knowing this, it is difficult to think about the full effects of the shock on economic activity or the way central bank policy ought to react.\n\nNow I think there are some models that give plausible explanations for certain aspects of the current shock to liquidity. One stems from Akerlof's \"lemons\" paper, which studies markets under adverse selection. The way this story plays out in the current turmoil starts with the downturn in housing markets leading to an increase in mortgage defaults and an associated drastic reassessment of the risks of investing in mortgage-backed securities. Valuation has been made even more difficult by the fact that recently issued loans have had significantly different default profiles from previous vintages. As a consequence, assets that were previously considered fairly homogeneous and reasonably straightforward to price suddenly looked much more diverse. As the degree of informational asymmetry was perceived to widen, financial investors became much more concerned about a lemons problem.\n\nAs Akerlof showed, adverse selection can generate a vicious cycle that could even lead to a complete market shut down: This is because sellers of high-quality securities drop out, and this depresses the market price and leads more sellers to drop out, thus setting off a continuing cycle of price declines and exit of high-quality assets.\n\nI think this story begins to approximate some of the malfunctions in the mortgage-backed securities market. But it leaves open the question of why liquidity dried up in markets that were not tied to housing. One reason may be that the securitization process was similar across a wide spectrum of financial liabilities. This may have led market participants to worry about the potential for similar lemons problems to emerge among a much broader class of asset-backed paper, generating contagion across financial markets.\n\nWhile very useful for organizing our thinking, these models provide only highly stylized characterizations of how liquidity problems arise, and they fall short on modeling how they might feed back onto the consumption and investment decisions of households and businesses. So how can we capture the insights from these models and import them to a broader macro setting? And can we incorporate them into models that could be implemented empirically?\n\nEmpirical Implementations\n\nThe first question to ask is whether we can make some straightforward modifications to an otherwise standard-looking DSGE model and obtain useful policy prescriptions. There have been some important efforts to do so in the literature.\n\nA financial market shock may have some characteristics of a DSGE TFP shock: The cost of producing an intermediate input—credit intermediation—has become more expensive. This is how the shock is modeled in recent research by Curdia and Woodford. 4 In their analysis, a negative financial shock increases the costs of intermediation between savers and borrowers, and increases the spread between the interest rates faced by the two groups.\n\nAlternatively, there is a long history of empirical studies of the effects of credit frictions on output and inflation. Here I am thinking about the VAR and other reduced form models meant to capture the influence of the financial accelerator and the credit channel for monetary policy. 5 Subsequently, some attempts have been made to incorporate these effects into more structural models. Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (BGG) have incorporated credit frictions from an explicit model of asymmetric information into an otherwise standard business-cycle calibration framework; 6 in their model, the borrowers' net worth is an important factor that affects the cost of capital. Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno have enriched Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchirst's setup in a medium-scale macroeconomic model that incorporates more economic variables than BGG and correspondingly includes more shocks. 7 They show that shocks to financial frictions may be very important in explaining the pattern of investment and stock market valuation in the run-up of the late 1990s and the consequent reversal of 2000-02. De Fiore and Tristani also develop a similar model in the paper presented at this conference. 8\n\nThese studies are very important and provide us with a very useful perspective. Yet they are identifying financial shocks largely in a reduced-form manner—either as an exogenous increase in interest rate spreads or net worth or as a shift in the demand for capital due to tightening of credit market constraints. To capture the current situation, we need to have a better idea of how the events in financial markets map into the parameters and shocks identified in these models. My feeling is that this probably requires embedding a richer specification of the financial intermediation process into these empirical frameworks.\n\nOne reason is that there are dimensions along which financial capital is not like the typical intermediate input in a DSGE model. In a number of theoretical models, financial inputs can be subject to discontinuities: Seemingly small changes in the borrowers' net worth or perceived risk can bring about radical consequences in market performance. Perhaps the recent events in the mortgage-backed and related structured security markets are an example of such a breakdown—indeed, one that is of macroeconomic importance.\n\nSuch discontinuities are a challenge for our standard empirical models. These models are typically solved by taking a local approximation around a balanced growth path. This approach is not designed to capture discrete jumps in equilibria. In addition, some of the estimated coefficients in our standard models may not be invariant to the onset of a liquidity crisis. This suggests that a regime-shifting model could be helpful, with a \"normal\" regime alternating with a \"liquidity crisis\" regime. But, still, how should we parameterize the crisis regime? If we observed liquidity crises often, we could estimate these parameters. But we don't experience crises very often, so it's asking a lot of any empirical model to accomplish this identification.\n\nSo my guess is that we can not gain a good deal of insight into when markets will \"return to normal,\" and what \"normal\" will look like from these models' estimated impulse response functions. Indeed, the rarity of crisis events and changes in the structure of markets makes it difficult to use even simple statistics, such as risk spreads and volatility measures, to gauge the path to the \"new normal.\"\n\nPolicy Issues\n\nNow let me turn to the policy dimension of the challenges that I have discussed so far. Modern models usually say there is little the public sector can do to offset a cyclical contraction in technology except to offset, to some degree, rigidities that affect the economy's response to the shock. This implication would carry over to financial shocks if we simply chose to model them as a negative cost shock to an intermediate input.\n\nHowever, there are reasons to believe that financial shocks may be very different when it comes to policy prescriptions. For one thing, the Fed and other financial regulators are themselves part of the intermediation infrastructure. This means that we potentially have a number of alternative policy instruments that might directly affect the way the economy responds to a financial shock.\n\nSince last August, the FOMC's policy decisions have been calibrated in part to avoid a \"adverse feedback loop\" between disruptions to financial market stability and the real economy. This focus has influenced both the setting of the funds rate and the implementation of a number of new policies.\n\nIn this context, the Fed has added a number of new lending facilities: the Term Auction Facility, the Term Securities Lending Facility, and the Primary Dealer Credit Facility. These directly impact the intermediation process independently of the federal funds rate—indeed, we have purposefully sterilized the effects of these facilities on the funds rate.\n\nIn addition, on September 7 the Department of Treasury added a new lending facility for Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). This is aimed at supporting the flow of credit to mortgage markets and the associated liquidity of mortgage-backed securities.\n\nSuch policies do have counterparts in some of the work I cited earlier. As an example, in Kiyotaki and Moore's analysis, efficiency may be enhanced if the central bank offers more liquid assets to the private market in exchange for less-liquid ones. This is the case even though the central bank intervention has no effect on the liquidity of each class of assets. However, this strategy is potentially even more important if adverse selection is in play because here the intervention does affect liquidity. By allowing newly illiquid assets to be used as collateral, the central bank may be setting a floor on their value, which may undo—or at least limit—the vicious cycle that I described earlier in the Akerlof model. This could buy time for information to spread among market players and reinvigorate the intermediation process—perhaps in a different form, though, than how it operated in the pre-turmoil period.\n\nInterestingly, our Term Securities Lending Facility, which the Fed implemented in mid-March, roughly corresponds to the Kiyotaki and Moore recommendations. Our approach with regard to accepting and valuing collateral has been very careful in minimizing the credit risks assumed by the Federal Reserve Banks. Nonetheless, any plan that offers price support, even indirectly, does entail some potential risk to our balance sheet and could have other costs in terms of distorting price signals and moral hazard fallout. Kiyotaki and Moore do not provide any insight into these costs. So, we are left with many questions. How long should the central bank intervention last and how large should it be? What are its effects on the incentives for market participants to acquire information before a crisis unfolds? What markets deserve our attention? After all, Akerlof's original example was about the used car market; I certainly would not want the Fed to start accepting used cars as collateral!\n\nEven once we answer these questions, we have to address the implications of the new policy tools for our ultimate policy mandates of promoting maximum sustainable growth and price stability. This includes accounting for the interaction between the new tools and our traditional instrument of monetary policy—the short-term interest rate. An important component of this analysis is thinking about the degree to which the impaired assets used to be close substitutes for what some may call \"traditional money.\" If they were good substitutes, does a market breakdown that renders these assets illiquid create a potentially deflationary shock? If not, are there inflationary implications from swapping liquid Treasury securities for less-liquid assets or expanding the direct lending facilities that use such assets as collateral?\n\nThis question brings us back to the notoriously difficult issue of identifying the channels through which liquid assets generate price pressures, especially in the short run. And, as an empirical question, we are faced with identifying which credit aggregates or interest spreads best capture the relevant degree of substitutability.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo answer all of these challenging questions, it will be extremely useful to seek a more unified perspective of the role of financial frictions in modern macroeconomic models. In this way, we will be able to identify the independent roles of our traditional monetary policy tools and our new lending facilities, as well as the interaction between the old and new tools. Developing these models is up to the research community—from the research shops at central banks to academic departments to independent think tanks. And we policymakers are eagerly awaiting the results.\n\nNotes\n\n1 Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H.

    "text": "Some Perspectives on Regulatory Reform Proposals\nRemarks at the\nInstitute of Regulation & Risk North Asia\nMarch 30, 2010\nHong Kong, China\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK\nOF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nInstitute of Regulation & Risk North Asia\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIntroduction\nThank you for that kind introduction and for making me feel welcome in Hong Kong.\nThough I've been here only a short time, I find it easy to see why this unique city has\nbecome so important to the financial services industry throughout the world. I'd also like\nto thank Christopher Rogers and the Institute of Regulation & Risk for their kind\ninvitation. It was that invitation that prompted my thinking in putting together this two-\nweek visit to China. I know other Federal Reserve presidents have participated in this\nevent in the past, and I am pleased to add my name to that list and the list of\ndistinguished panelists who have joined us here tonight.\nWe are slowly emerging from the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. The hardships\ncreated by these exceptional circumstances for households and businesses are well\nknown. Governments and regulators around the world have responded to the crisis with\na variety of aggressive and innovative policy actions, including giving special assistance\nto specific institutions.\n\nNow, as we slowly emerge from the crisis, we are engaged in a vigorous debate on how\nbest to address the major weaknesses in our financial regulatory framework that were\nrevealed by the crisis. Our goal, clearly, is to avoid another crisis of this magnitude.\nFinancial reform will not be easy. We face complex problems that will require a\ncomprehensive, multi-pronged approach. But reform is critical for ensuring our long-\nterm economic stability.\nToday, I would like to offer my thoughts on some of the reform proposals that are being\ndiscussed. I should note that my remarks reflect my own views and are not those of the\nFederal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\nTo highlight some of the changes that are being considered, there are proposals that\nwould assign monetary policy a more active role in fighting asset bubbles; proposals\nthat would strengthen current microprudential regulations; proposals that would\nintroduce a systemic regulator and macroprudential regulations; and proposals that\nwould create resolution authority – particularly for systemically important financial\ninstitutions.\nTime does not permit me to discuss the specifics of each of these proposals today.\nInstead, I would like to offer my thoughts on some of the challenges we are likely to face\nin implementing even the most well-thought-out policies.\n\nLet me be clear. I don’t bring up these potential challenges as roadblocks to the healthy\ndebate that is underway. Rather, I offer them as issues we need to consider as we build\na better financial infrastructure.\nOne preemptive action that is being debated concerns the role of monetary policy in\ncombating asset bubbles. Given the rapid rise in some asset prices prior to the recent\ncrisis, there are increasing calls for central banks to be more proactive in responding to\nsigns that an asset bubble may be emerging and to raise their target rates in order to\nlower asset prices that, by historical standards, seem unusually high. In previous\nforums, I have discussed why I view these proposals with skepticism.1 I won’t cover the\nsame ground here again. Instead, let me just note that I am skeptical about our ability to\neasily and definitively sort out in real time whether a rapid increase in asset prices is\nassociated with overvaluation. That is, how confidently can we state that we are in the\nmidst of a bubble? I also think that monetary policy is too blunt a tool for pricking\nbubbles: It can’t be targeted precisely and it will affect other financial and\nmacroeconomic variables in addition to the suspected bubble asset. In addition, the\ntypical changes in interest rates that a central bank might contemplate are likely to be\ntoo small to produce big changes in asset prices.\nFortunately, monetary policy is not the only tool that policymakers have to deal with\nfinancial exuberance. In my view, redesigning regulations and improving market\ninfrastructure offer more promising paths. Regulation may or may not be sufficient to\navoid all of the events that create crises, but it should go a long way toward doing so.\n11 For instance, see Evans (2009a and 2009b).\n\nBetter supervision and a sound regulatory infrastructure can also increase the resiliency\nof markets and institutions and their ability to withstand adverse shocks that do occur.\nHow do we promote such resiliency?\nWithin the existing structure, regulators have the ability to promote better, more resilient\nfinancial markets, either through rule-making or by serving as a coordinator of private\ninitiatives. They can also encourage more and better disclosure of information—a key\nelement of effective risk management. A number of initiatives along these lines have\nbeen taken and additional ones are being considered.2\nWe can use existing regulatory tools more effectively, but we also need to address the\nshortcomings of current regulations. The ongoing work of the Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision regarding the possible introduction of liquidity standards and\nadjustments to the existing capital requirements are examples of such efforts.\nWhile such enhancements to micro-prudential regulations are necessary, I would argue\nthat they are not close to being sufficient to address the complex issues we faced during\nthe recent crisis. Success in preventing and controlling potential risks requires very\nearly and courageous action by policymakers. Typically, risks and problems in the\nfinancial system build over a number of years. There is an awful amount of uncertainty\n2 For instance, in recent years, regulators have actively supported the development of the Trade\nInformation Warehouse (a central repository for trade reporting of over-the-counter credit derivatives\ncontracts) and clearing houses for credit default swaps, such as ICE Trust.\n\nas to whether risks are developing; how they will be perpetuated; and when to take\naction. Microprudential regulations alone are not likely to resolve these issues.\nLet me illustrate the sort of problems a microprudential regulator faces with a specific\nexample. As you know, the problems with residential mortgages, particularly with\nsubprime mortgages, were one of the key areas that precipitated the current crisis.\nCurrently, the U.S. financial system faces problems with commercial real estate (CRE)\nloans. At the end of 2009, depository institutions in the U.S. held over $1.5 trillion in\ncommercial real estate and construction loans on their books. In addition, there are\ncurrently nearly $800 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)\noutstanding. Over the past two years, delinquencies on these loans and securities have\nbeen rising at an uncomfortably rapid rate [link to slide 1]. Of the over $1 trillion in\ncommercial real estate loans held by depository institutions today, nearly 4 percent are\nnoncurrent.3 This ratio was about 0.5 percent before the crisis (June 2007). The picture\nis even worse for the riskier construction and land development loans. While these\nloans total less than $0.5 trillion, the noncurrent portion had risen from 1.5 percent at\nthe end of June 2007 to nearly 16 percent by the end of last quarter. For CRE loans\npackaged into securities, serious delinquencies represent 4 percent of all CMBS\ncurrently outstanding, up from nearly zero before the crisis.\nDoes such a fast rise in CRE and CMBS delinquencies mean that bank examiners\nmissed clear signs of forthcoming problems and failed to take action? Commercial real\nestate loans are a key problem area for the banks in my District. I went to my\n3 Noncurrent loans are those that are 90 days or more past due plus loans in nonaccrual status.\n\nsupervisory staff and said: “I know you are struggling with commercial real estate loan\nportfolios. What are the difficulties? What do you think we needed to have done in the\npast in order to avoid the current problems?”\nI have to admit that their response made me pause. They said “You know, Charlie, if we\nwanted to avoid the current situation, we needed to act very, very early – probably in\n2004 or 2005.” That is a full two to three years before the onset of problems in the\nsector. Clearly, we needed to act very early. But at that time, it would have been difficult\nto argue convincingly in favor of reigning in this lending. The economy was coming out\nof the jobless recovery and just beginning to gain traction. And the banking industry had\nproven it could maintain profits through a recession, it had reduced problem loans back\nto historically low levels, and it appeared to have more than sufficient capital to cushion\nagainst potential losses.4\nGiven previous problems with commercial real estate loans, my supervisors understood\nthe potential risks. Here is a typical situation they faced. Imagine you are an examiner\nand you go out to review a large financial institution in 2005. The institution is\nwarehousing commercial real estate loans prior to securitization during a period when\nCMBS issuance is just taking off and, for every $1,000 in CRE loans, only $6 are\nnoncurrent. Nonetheless, as an examiner, you have a discussion with the bank\n4 At the end of 2004, return on equity at all commercial banks in the U.S. was 13.08 percent, near its\nhistorical peak of 16.23 percent in the second quarter of 1993. Return on assets were similarly high, and\nnet charge-offs accounted for only 0.68 percent of total loans, well below 1.31 percent reached at the end\nof 2001.\n\nmanagers and you learn about their lending practices, and you kind of wonder, “How\nwell-controlled is all of this?”\nThe loan officers will give you some very good arguments about what their business is\nand how the risks are being controlled. First, they are not really storing the loans on\ntheir books. They are underwriting the loans with the full intention of packaging them\ninto securities. They have to build up a critical mass before securitization, but they are\nnot going to keep the loans.\nFrom the banks’ perspective, they are not in the storage business. They are in the\ntransportation business. It is rather short term – 60, 90 days. Presumably, the risk is\nonly proportional to how long they are holding on to it – which is not very long.\nFurthermore, during this period, real estate prices are going up, delinquencies are\nnegligible, and banks have a variety of hedges in place. They look at commercial real\nestate prices and think, if needed, they can get out of their portfolio at little cost. And\neven if some losses materialize, they have adequate capital.\nI have some interesting people on my staff who can push back in a pretty challenging\nfashion. But at the end of the day, after carefully considering the banks’ arguments, they\nthink: “All right, I guess the loan officers are looking at this pretty reasonably and are\nprotecting their institution.” And the risk to the deposit insurance fund from all this\nactivity seems pretty small. So, you end up being convinced that the activity is probably\nOK.\n\nToday, with hindsight, we know that while most of the micro risks appeared very small\nat the time, their sum was far less than the macro risk that was silently building up.\nThat’s the key thing: A collection of negligible micro risks can add up to a far greater\nmacro risk. Focusing on individual institutions and controlling risks on a firm-by-firm\nbasis are not enough for detecting and controlling systemwide stress points.\nThat is why we need macroprudential supervision and regulation.\nSuppose for a particular class of assets, values decline on an economy-wide basis. This\nmeans losses are going to be taken at the macro level. Perhaps managers at a few\nindividual banks can be smart, foresee the price declines, and liquidate their positions in\ntime to avoid large losses at their institution. But the macro economy has to take these\nlosses, and that’s where we get stuck. Not everyone can get through the exit door at\nonce; someone has to end up bearing the macro losses.\nThis is why macroprudential regulations that aim to assess and control systemwide risks\nshould play a critical role in our regulatory structure.\nFor instance, dynamic capital requirements and loan loss provisions that vary over the\ncycle can temper some of the boom–bust trends we have seen in the past. History\nshows that during boom times, when financial institutions are perhaps in an exuberant\nstate, they may not price risks fully in their underwriting and risk-management decisions.\n\nDuring downturns, faced with eroding capital cushions, increased uncertainty, and\nbinding capital constraints, some institutions may become overcautious and excessively\ntighten lending standards. Both behaviors tend to amplify the business cycle. Varying\nrequired capital loan loss provisions over the cycle could serve to offset some of this\nvolatility.\nWe saw the advantages of a systemic, macroprudential approach firsthand during the\nimplementation of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) – the so-called\n“stress tests.” Last spring, the Federal Reserve led a coordinated examination of the\nlargest 19 U.S. banks. We reviewed the institutions simultaneously, applying a common\nset of assumptions and scenarios across all of them. Such an approach provided us\nwith a view of these banks in their totality, as well as the financial condition of individual\ninstitutions on a stand-alone basis. The horizontal view was essential in assessing how\nrisks taken individually by each bank are correlated and how they can add up to more\nthan the sum of individual components. The review also had a forward-looking element\nthat assessed the likely condition of the banks under a specific set of adverse economic\nconditions and determined the amount of capital the banks would need under these\n“stress” conditions. Such procedures also enable supervisors to identify best practices\nin risk management and to push banks with weak controls to improve and adopt these\nindustry best practices. Indeed, supervisors at the Federal Reserve have already begun\nto adopt such an approach.\n\nHowever, even with such macroprudential strategies, we are going to face challenges.\nLet’s think about what, as a hypothetical macroprudential regulator, we would have to\ndo. What should be the early call focus? What should we be looking at? When should\nwe be looking at it? How confident are we that that we are actually going to be able to\nidentify the problem? A macroprudential regulator is confronted with the same type of\nquestions a microprudential regulator faces, but at a systemwide level.\nConsider these questions within the context of commercial real estate. The facts are,\ntoday, CMBS and CRE loans have large delinquencies. Could anyone have made this\ncall confidently in time to arrest the problems we face today?\nOn this slide [link to slide 2], on the top panel, you see that the outstanding volume of\nCMBS ramps up in 2004, 2005. At the same time, commercial real estate prices (shown\nin the middle panel) continue to rise well into 2007. On the bottom panel, we see the\nperformance of loans originated during this period, depending on when the loans were\nmade. Loans originated later in the credit cycle are performing worse than older loans.\nFor instance, loans underwritten in 2005 did not reach a 1 percent delinquency rate until\nabout 42 months (3.5 years) after origination. In contrast, loans made in 2008 reached\nthe 1 percent delinquency mark only six months after origination. The progressively\nworsening performance of loans originated later in the credit cycle is likely due to looser\nunderwriting standards that supported the issuance boom.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I can point to the inflection point in volume and say “I\nshould have put my finger on that right then.”\nAt that point in the credit cycle, “shouting” would have been an important part of risk-\ncontrol, as it would have emphasized potential risks to the market players.\nBut I can’t imagine that supervisors’ concerns would have been taken seriously in 2005\nor 2006 -- even if they started going out and shouting to the heavens that there is a big,\nbig problem and we need to do more about it. Recall that, at that time, real estate prices\nwere ramping up and delinquencies were low. Indeed, in 2007, the Federal Reserve,\nalong with other bank regulators, issued a supervisory guidance on concentrations in\ncommercial real estate. 5 We also gave a number of speeches prior to the crisis about\nrisk pricing and about market exuberance – to little avail. These warnings were largely\nignored and we got a lot of push-back from banks. During boom periods when risks are\nsilently building up, there are a lot of people with a lot of money at stake who will come\nout against such pronouncements. So, if policymakers do not follow words with actions,\nthen we are not likely to make much progress. Shouting and supervision – together –\nare essential.\nI raised some potential issues with both micro- and macro-prudential regulations.\n5 See, “ SR 07-1 Interagency Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate” available at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/2007/SR0701.htm. More recently, the Federal Reserve\nissued a supervisory guidance on managing interest rate risk (“SR 10-1 Interagency Advice on Interest\nRate Risk,” available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/2010/sr1001.htm) and\nhighlighted it in speeches (for instance, see Kohn (2010)). In addition, the Federal Reserve – along with\nthe other Federal banking agencies – issued a policy statement on funding and liquidity risk management\non March 17, 2010 (available at: http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20100317a.htm).\n\nHow do we address these issues? This is where we would take full advantage of our\nmulti-pronged approach to regulatory reform. If we are not certain that a particular\napproach may not be as effective as we would like, we can put more pressure on other\nlevers to obtain a desired amount of risk control. So, if we think that macroprudential\nregulations may have some potential operational issues, we would need to implement\nmore stringent capital and liquidity requirements than we would otherwise to overcome\nthese issues.\nThis is why we need a multi-pronged approach to a robust regulatory structure: a\nstructure that takes full advantage of the existing tools supervisors have ; a structure\nthat supplements the existing one with dynamic capital requirements and a\ncomprehensive approach to risk management ; a structure that includes a\nmacroprudential supervisor than can monitor and assess incipient risks across\ninstitutions and markets and, when necessary, impose higher regulatory requirements\non firms that pose systemic risks.\nHowever, even with such a structure, it would be hubris on the part of policymakers to\nassume that we would be able to prevent financial stress at all financial institutions.\nTherefore, we also need to contain the disruptive spillovers that result from the failure of\nsystemically important institutions without resorting to bailouts or ad hoc rescues. A\nnecessary element of this is having a mechanism for resolving the failure of a\n\nsystemically important institution.6 This is something we currently lack in many cases,\nthough there are proposals now under discussion that would provide this resolution\npower.\nAnother issue that arises in the regulatory reform debate is whether the central bank\nshould be entrusted with supervision and regulation responsibilities. There are many\nsynergies between monetary policy and supervision and regulation that I and others\nhave discussed in previous speeches.7 Let me point out a couple of reasons why it\nmight be optimal for a central bank to have a key role in financial stability and\nregulation.\nThe reality is that central banks have the unique ability to act as the lender-of-last-resort\nduring financial crises. The central bank cannot use this tool effectively if it is not\nknowledgeable about the financial condition of the institutions it might lend to,\nparticularly if such loans need to be made at very short notice.\nThe lender-of-last-resort role inevitably thrusts the central bank into efforts to promote\nfinancial stability and avoid crises. If, however, central banks have no supervision and\nregulation tools, they are constrained to act with the only tool at their disposal –\nmonetary policy.\n6 See Evans (2009c) for my views on the advantages of resolution authority and the issues it would\naddress.\n7 For instance, see Bernanke (2010), Evans (2010), Kashyap (2010), and Volcker (2010).\n\nI already mentioned that I am skeptical about using monetary policy to control financial\nexuberance. But without supervisory powers, there may be no choice. We know that\ntime consistency issues can lead a central bank to choose inflationary outcomes in the\nshort run, even though there is no long-run tradeoff between output growth and price\nstability. Ken Rogoff pointed out that one way to deal with this issue would be to appoint\na conservative central banker who would be tougher than the public. This would ensure\nthat appropriate decisions would be made and appropriate actions would be taken.\nNow, consider the reaction function of a central banker that has the additional\nresponsibility for financial stability – but not the additional tools provided by a\nsupervision and regulation role. Such a central banker might have to act against\nexuberance in financial markets more actively than it would otherwise. That would be\nentirely necessary and appropriate to preserve financial stability. However, that policy\nmay not be the most appropriate one at that time for addressing the traditional goals of\nmonetary policy of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. A central bank\nwith three goals and only one lever is a recipe for producing some difficult policy\ndilemmas.\nTo sum up, it is clear that, in order to avoid a situation like the one we have faced in the\npast two years, we need to fortify our regulatory lines of defense. We need to change\nthe rules of regulation to be more efficient and effective in their design and\n\nimplementation. But we also need to openly acknowledge the challenges policymakers\nand regulators are likely to face in containing potential financial crises. Despite all the\nchallenges, I believe that we can design a more effective regulatory structure through\ndiscussions such as the one we are having today.\nThank you.\n\nREFERENCES:\nBernanke, Ben S., 2010, The Federal Reserve’s Role in Bank Supervision, Testimony\nbefore the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC, March 17.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100317a.htm\nEvans, Charles L., 2009a. “The International Financial Crisis: Asset Price Exuberance\nand Macroprudential Regulation.” Remarks given at the 2009 International Banking\nConference on September 24, 2009 in Chicago, IL.

    "text": "Can VARs Describe Monetary Policy?\nCharles L. Evans\nKenneth N. Kuttner\n(cid:3)\nApril 22, 1998\nAbstract\nRecent research has questioned the usefulness of Vector Autoregression (VAR)\nmodels as a description of monetary policy, especially in light of the low correlation\nbetween forecast errors from VARs and those derived from Fed funds futures rates.\nThispaperpresentsthreefindingsonVARs’abilitytodescribemonetarypolicy. First,\nthe correlation between forecast errors is a misleading measure of how closely the\nVARforecast mimics the futures market’s. In particular, the low correlation is partly\ndue to a weak positive correlation between the VAR forecasts and the futures market\nerrors. Second, Fedfunds rate forecasts from common VARspecifications dotend to\nbe noisy, but this can be remedied by estimating more parsimonious models on post-\n1982data. Third,timeaggregation problems causedbythestructure oftheFedfunds\nfutures market can distort the timing and magnitude of shocks derived from futures\nrates,andcomplicate comparisons withVAR-basedforecasts.\n1 Introduction\nHow does monetary policy affect the economy? To answer that question requires solving\nabasicsimultaneityproblem: monetarypolicyaffects theeconomywhileat thesametime\nresponding endogenously to changing macroeconomic conditions.

A more common approach,\nhowever, is the Vector Autoregression technique developed by Sims (1972), (1980a) and\n(1980b). In this procedure, changes in the monetary policy instrument that are not ex-\nplained by the variables included in the model are interpreted as exogenous changes in\npolicy,orpolicy“shocks”. Christiano,EichenbaumandEvans(1997)providesasurveyof\nthislineofresearch.\nOne unresolved question is how well simple econometric procedures, like VARs, can\ndescribe the monetary authority’s response to economic conditions, and by extension, the\npolicy shocks used to identify policy’s effects on the economy. There are several reasons\nto be skeptical of the VAR approach. VAR models (indeed, all econometric models) typi-\ncally includea relativelysmall numberof variables, while the Fed is presumed to “look at\neverything” in formulating monetary policy. By assuming linearity, VARs rule out plausi-\nble asymmetries in the response of policy, such as those resulting from an “opportunistic”\ndisinflation policy. VARs’ coefficients are assumed to remain constant over time, despite\nwell-documentedchangesin theFed’s objectivesand operatingprocedures.\nThe goal of this paper is to assess VARs’ accuracy in predicting changes in mone-\ntary policy, and the shock measures derived from those predictions, using forecasts from\nthe Federal funds futures market as a basis for comparison. Section 2 reviews the VAR\nmethodology, and its putative deficiencies. Section 3 shows that the correlation between\ntheVAR and the futures market forecast errors can givea misleadingpictureofthe VAR’s\naccuracy,andsuggestslookinginsteadattherelationshipbetweentheforecaststhemselves.\nThe results in section 4 show that profligacy per se doesn’t hurt the VAR’s performance,\nbut reducing the number of lags and estimating the model over a more recent subsample\ncan improvethemodel’sforecast accuracy. Section 5 discussesthetimeaggregationprob-\nlems inherent in extracting policy surprises from Fed funds futures data. The conclusions,\nsummarized in section 6, are that VARs mimic the futures market’s forecasts reasonably\nwell, but that it would be misleading to use futures market forecasts as the only basis for\ncomparison.\n2 VARs: the technique and its critiques\nThe reduced form of a VAR simply involves the regression of some vector of variables, x,\non lagsofx:\nx\nt\n=\nA\n(\nL\n)\nx\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n+\nu\nt\n:\n(1)\n2\n\nA\n(\nL\n)\nis a polynomial in the lag operator, and u is a vector of disturbances, where\nt\nE\n(\nu u\nt 0 t\n) =\nW . In monetary applications, the x vector would include one (or more) indi-\nt\ncators of monetary policy, along with the other macroeconomic and financial variables.\nThe widely-used model of Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (CEE) (1996a), includes\nthe Federal funds rate, r , logarithmsof lagged payroll employment(N), thepersonal con-\nt\nsumption deflator (P), nonborrowed reserves (NBR), total reserves (TR), and M1, and the\nsmoothedgrowthrateofsensitivematerialsprices(PCOM).1 Thefundsrateequationfrom\ntheCEE modelis:\nr\nt\n=\nb\n0\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n1\n1 ;\nr\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n2\n1 ;\nlnN\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n3\n1 ;\nlnP\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n4\n1 ;\nPCOM\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n5\n1 ;\nlnNBR\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n6\n1 ;\nlnTR\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n7\n1 ;\nlnM1\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\nu\nt\n;\naregressionoftheFedfundsrateonlaggedvaluesofallthevariablesincludedintheVAR.\nIn the“structural”VAR,\nx\nt\n=\nB x\n0 t\n+\nB\n(\nL\n)\nx\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n+\ne\nt\n;\n(2)\nthe shocks and feedbacks are given economic interpretations. The covariance matrix of\nthe e innovations is diagonal, and contemporaneous feedback between elements of x is\ncaptured by the B matrix. The equation involving the monetary policy instrument (the\n0\nFedfundsrate, forexample)isofteninterpretedasareactionfunctiondescribingtheFed’s\nresponse to economic conditions. By extension, the innovation to this equation is taken\nto represent “shocks” to monetary policy. A great deal of research and debate has cen-\ntered on the identifying assumptions embodied in the choice of B . Examples include\n0\nBernanke (1986), Sims (1992), Strongin (1995), Bernanke and Mihov (1995), Christiano,\nEichenbaum and Evans (1996b), and Leeper, Sims and Zha (1996). The typical focus of\nthis research is the impulseresponse functions of macroeconomic variables in response to\nmonetarypolicyshocks,andhowthespecificidentifyingassumptionsaffecttheresponses.\nThis paper does not deal with the identification issue, but focuses instead on a more\nbasic question: whether the reduced form of the VAR, and the monetary policy equation\nin particular,generate sensibleforecasts.

Several authors, notably Rudebusch (1997),\nPagan and Robertson (1995), and McNees (1992), have emphasized parameter instability\nas a possible explanation. Rudebusch cites the VARs’ profligate specification as another\ncandidate. NonlinearitiesintheFed’sreactionfunction,suchasthosearisingfrom“oppor-\ntunistic” disinflation a` la Orphanides and Wilcox (1996) are another possibility, and Mc-\nCarthy (1995) provides some evidence supporting this view. In addition, the VAR leaves\nout variables that might help forecast monetary policy.

Perhaps because of the recent emphasis\n1 t\non policy shocks, however, assessments of VARs’ performance have often involved the\nforecast errors rather than the forecasts themselves; see, for example, Rudebusch (1997),\nBrunner(1997)and Christianoet al. (1997).\nAt first glance, the correlation between shocks would seem to be a sensible basis for\ncomparison; if the two procedures yielded the same forecasts, the shocks would be iden-\ntical, and the correlation would be 1.0. Closer scrutiny shows that this measure can give\na misleading picture, however; the covariance between the shocks has little to do with the\ncovariancebetween the forecasts. The correlation between shocks can therefore makebad\nforecasting modelslookgood,and goodmodelslookbad.\nA comparisonbetween theVARand anaive“no change”forecast forcefully illustrates\nthis point. Because the Fed funds rate is well described as an I(1) process, forecasts of\nthe rates themselves will tend to be very highly correlated; the correlation between the\nforecast changesin theFed funds rate, f\n1\n;\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n(cid:0)\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\nand rˆVAR\n1 t\n(cid:0)\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\n, willtherefore bemore\n1\ninformative. As reported in the first line of table 2, the correlation between the forecast\nchangeintheFedfundsrateis0.43,andtheshockcorrelationis0.35. Samplinguncertainty\nassociated with theestimated VARcoefficients (readily apparent as “noise”in the forecast\nplotted in figure 3) will increase the variance of the VAR forecasts, however, which will\nreduce the correlation between forecasts. One way to eliminate the effect of parameter\nuncertainty is to replace the variance of rˆVAR\nt\n(cid:0)\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\nin the denominator of the correlation\n1\ncoefficient withthevarianceof f\n1\n;\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n(cid:0)\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\n.

The implied change from this forecast is, of course, zero. Consequently, the\n“no change” model’s forecast of the change in the Fed funds rate is uncorrelated with\neverything,includingtheforecasts from theFed fundsfutures rate and thefundsrate itself\n(hence the zeros in the second line of table 2). On this criterion, obviously, the VAR\nprovidesthebetterdescriptionofmonetarypolicy.

Judgedonthiscriterion,therefore, the“nochange”\nforecast describes monetarypolicythan theVAR.\nHow can the“no change” forecast errors be more highlycorrelated with theFed funds\nfutures surprises than the VAR’s, when the VAR’s forecasts are closer to the futures mar-\nket’s? Theanswer, it turnsout,isthat thecorrelation between shockssaysvery littleabout\nhow well the VAR describes monetary policy, and a lot more about small deviations from\nefficiency intheFed fundsfutures market.\n9\n\n3.1 Anatomy of a correlation\nThecorrelationbetweenFedfundsfuturessurprises,u\n(cid:3)\n,andforecasterrorsfromanecono-\nt\nmetricmodel(e.g., aVAR),uˆ , can bewrittenas\nt\nr\n(\nuˆ\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n) =\nCov\n(\nu\n(cid:3) t\n;\nuˆ\nt\np\n)\nVar\n(\nu (cid:3) t\n)\nVar\n(\nuˆ t\n)\n:\nSince the variance of the Fed funds futures surprise is the same for each uˆ we consider,\ndifferences in the correlation between shocks must be attributable either to differences in\nthe covariance between the shocks, or to the variance of the estimated errors. Substituting\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\nrˆ foruˆ , thecovariancetermin thenumeratorcan bewrittenas\nt t\nCov\n(\nu\n(cid:3) t\n;\nuˆ\nt\n) =\nCov\n(\nr\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\n(cid:0)\nCov\n(\nrˆ\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n) ;\norinterms ofthechangeinr,\nCov\n(\nu\n(cid:3) t\n;\nuˆ\nt\n) =\nCov\n(\nD r\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\n(cid:0)\nCov\n(\nc\nD r\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n) ;\nwhere\nc\nD r\nt\n=\nrˆ\nt\n(cid:0)\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\n. Writing the covariance term in this way reveals two important fea-\n1\ntures.\nFirst, the covariance between the realized change in the Fed funds rate and the futures\nmarket surprise, Cov\n(\nD r\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\n, mechanically builds in a positive correlation between the\ntwo shocks. Justas important,this contributionto thecovarianceis whollyindependentof\nthe model’s forecasts. In fact, it will be positiveeven if the model is of no use whatsoever\ninforecastingtheFed fundsrate, asinthecaseofthe“nochange”modeldiscussedabove.\nThe second key observationis that a positivecovariancebetween themodel’s forecast,\nc\nD r , and the futures market surprise, u\nt (cid:3)\nwill reduce the covariance between the shocks.\nt\nMarket efficiency implies a zero covariance between u (cid:3) and elements of the t t\n(cid:0)\n1 infor-\nmation set. In practice, however, it is highly unlikely that the sample covariance will be\nzero even if the market is efficient. Indeed, Krueger and Kuttner (1996) found that this\ncovariance,whilenonzero,was generally statisticallyinsignificant.\nTaken together, these two observations explain the “no change” forecast’s surprisingly\nhigh correlation with the futures market surprises. As reported in table 3, the covariance\nbetween D r and u\nt (cid:3)\nis 127.1, while the covariance between\nt\nc\nD r and u\nt (cid:3)\nis identically zero.\nt\nDividingbytherelevantstandarddeviationsyieldsthecorrelationof0.52—wellinexcess\noftheCEE model’s,despitethezero correlation betweentheforecasts themselves.\n10\n\nTable3: Componentsoftheshockcorrelation\nModel r\n(\nuˆ\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\nCov\n(\nc\nD r\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\nr\n(\nc\nD r\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n) p\nVar\n(\nuˆ\nt\n)\nNo change 0\n:\n52 0 0 18\n:\n7\nCEE 0\n:\n32 39\n:\n5 0\n:\n14 21\n:\n1\nT-bill 0\n:\n62\n(cid:0)\n34\n:\n9\n(cid:0)\n0\n:\n12 19\n:\n9\nModified CEE 0\n:\n37 24\n:\n7 0\n:\n09 21\n:\n3\nNotes: The standard deviation of the Fed funds futures shock,\np\nVar\n(\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\n, is 13.1, and the\ncovariance between the change in the Fed funds rate and the Fed funds futures surprise,\nCov\n(\nD r\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\n, is 127.1. Units are basis points. Statistics are not adjusted for degrees of\nfreedom.\nAn analogous breakdown for the CEE model reported on the second line of table 3\nshowsthatapositivecovariancebetweentheVAR’spredictionsandthefuturesmarketsur-\nprises partially accounts for the model’s small shock correlation. The relevant covariance\nis 39.5; subtracting this number from 127.1 and dividing by the relevant standard devia-\ntions yields the correlation of 0.32 (without a degrees-of-freedom adjustment). Had the\nFed funds futures surprises been orthogonal to the VAR forecast, the correlation would\nhavebeen 0.46.\nOne interpretationofthisresult is thatthefutures market is not efficient. Theviolation\nimplied by this result is not quantitativelyor statistically significant, however. The regres-\nsion of the futures market surprise onto the VAR forecast has an R2 of only 0.019, and the\nt-statistic on the CEE forecast’s coefficient is only 1.41. But because standard deviations\noftheshocks,ratherthantheinterestrate(oritschange)appearsinthedenominator,avery\nsmallcovariancecan haveapronouncedeffect on theshockcorrelation.\nTheforecastsfromasimplemodelinvolvingtheT-billrateprovideanotherillustration\nof the perverse properties of the shock correlation.

Since the T-bill rate pre-\nsumably incorporates expectations of subsequent months’ Fed funds rate, it comes as no\n9The regression uses last-day-of-the-month T-bill rate data, and it is estimated over the January 1961\nthroughDecember1997sample.\n11\n\nsurprisethatthisequation’sforecastsarehighlysimilartothosefromtheFedfundsfutures\nmarket;infact,theregressionoftheformeronthelattergivesacoefficientof0.99.

Consequently, the correlation\nbetweenthefuturesmarketsurprisesandtheVARforecastsmaybeanartifactoftheVAR’s\ninformationadvantage.\nTo see what impact this might have on the correlations, we re-ran the CEE equation\nwithadditionallagsonpayrollemploymentandconsumerprices.

The dissection of the correlation coefficient also revealed a sec-\nondculprit: thevarianceoftheshocksfromtheVARisconsiderablyhigherthanthefutures\n10Thelaggedfuturesrateisitselfweakly(negatively)correlatedwiththefuturesmarketsurprise.\n11Forthisreason,KruegerandKuttner(1996)werecarefultointroduceadditionallagswhentestingfutures\nmarketefficiency.\n12\n\nmarket surprises. Sincethesquareroot ofthisvarianceappears in thedenominator,it, too,\nwillreducethemeasured correlation.\nWhat accounts for the VAR’s inflated shock variance? One possibility is the VAR’s\ngenerous parameterization— 85 parameters in themonthlyCEE specification.

A model estimated over a sample that in-\ncluded the1979–82 M1 targetingregime, for example,will almostsurely be inappropriate\nfor later periods when the Fed’s weight on monetary aggregates is smaller — if not zero.\nThespuriousinclusionofM1couldthereforeintroducenoiseintotheforecastsforlaterpe-\nriods. Other research has turned up significant time variation along these lines. Friedman\nand Kuttner (1996) estimated a time-varying-parameter version of a funds rate equation,\nand found significant variation in the coefficient on the monetary aggregates correspond-\ning to the shifts in targeting regimes. Instability has also been documented by Pagan and\nRobertson(1995).\nTable 4 reports the results of shortening the lag lengths and estimating the CEE model\nover shorter sample periods.12 Comparing the twelve-lag to the six-lag results for the full\nsample shows that greater parsimony increases the shock correlation slightly, presumably\nby reducing the covariance between futures market surprises and the VAR forecasts. (Ob-\nviously,eliminatingallright-hand-sidevariablesdrivethiscovariancetozero.) Butgreater\nparsimony actually reduces the correlation between the forecasts, and the forecast RMSE\nfalls only slightly. The reduction in the number of coefficients to be estimated shrinks the\nstandarderror drastically,however.\nTheresultsimproveconsiderablywhentheestimationperiodisrestrictedtotheJanuary\n1983 through July 1997 sample. For one thing, the forecasts are now much less noisy.\nAt 16.2 basis points, the standard deviation of the estimated one-month-ahead shocks is\nnow only slightly larger than the futures market’s.13 The correlation between the shock\nmeasures rises to 0.54, but again the positivecovariance between the model’s forecast and\nthefuturesmarketsurprisesagainpreventsitfromrisingevenhigher.

The VAR does even\nbetter at longer horizons. At three months, the estimated bˆ for the forecasts is 0.75, and\nforecast errors’ correlation is 0.60. The forecasts and shocks plotted in figure 4 confirm\nthat the VAR approximately mimicsthe systematicand unsystematicchanges in the funds\nrateimpliedbyFed funds futuresrates.\n5 Time aggregation\nThetimingofthesurprises extracted from monthlyorquarterly VARs is, ofcourse, some-\nwhat ambiguous. Atfirst glance, itwouldseemthat shocksderivedfrom theFed fundsfu-\nturesratewouldbefreeofsuchambiguity. Thatturnsoutnottobetrue,however. TheFed\nfunds futures contract’s settlement price is based on the monthlyaverage of the overnight\nFed funds rate, which creates a time aggregation problem. Consequently, the timing and\nmagnitudeofpolicyshocksbased onthefuturesrate arealso ambiguous.\nToillustratethisproblem,considerthefollowingscenario.

OnApril16,thedayofthesurprise,thefuturesratefortheMaycontract\nwillriseto6%,reflectingtheexpectationthatthe6%ratewillprevailthroughoutMay. But\nsince the April contract is settled against April’s average funds rate, the futures rate for\nthe April contract will rise to only 5.5%. The paths of the futures rates are depicted in the\nleft-hand columnofthesecondand thirdrowsoffigure 5.\nThe Fed’s action on April 16 represents an unexpected increase of 100 basis points\nrelative to expectations on April 15 and before. How should the Fed funds surprise be\nmeasuredusingmonthlyfuturesmarketdata? Conceptually,thisissimplytherealizedFed\nfunds rate minusits conditionalexpectation as measured by thefutures data. But thereare\ntwo complications. First, the futures contract is settled against the monthly average of the\ndaily Fed funds rate; consequently, the realized Fed funds rate is taken to be the monthly\naverage of the daily Fed funds rates.

And yet, the example states clearly that the 100 basis point increase\nis a complete surprise on April 16. Last-day-of-month futures data, therefore, will tend to\nunderstatethemagnitudeofthetrueshock.\nAn alternative way to measure the Fed funds surprise is to use the monthly average of\na contract’sfutures rate, depictedin theright-hand columnofthesecond and third rowsof\nfigure 5, for the conditional expectation. This measure of the Fed fund surprise preserves\nthe size of the shock’s cumulativeimpact, but spreads it out over two consecutivemonths.\nAs summarized in the bottom panel of table 5, the April surprise is computed as the April\naverage fed funds rate (5.5%) minus the March daily average of the April contract rates\n(5.0%), which is a 50 basis point surprise. The May surpriseis the May average fed funds\nrate (6%) minus the April daily average of the May contract rates (5.5%), yielding a 50\n18\n\nbasis point surprise. More generally, the surprise based on average futures rates will be a\nconvexcombinationofthetrueshocks,\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\nf¯\n1\n;\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n=\nq u\nt\n+ (\n1\n(cid:0)\nq\n)\nu\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n;\nwhichimpliesan MA(1)structurefortheaverage shocks,\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\nf¯\n1\n;\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n= (\n1\n+\nf L\n)\ne\nt\n;\nwhere f\n= (\n1\n(cid:0)\nq\n) =\nq and e\nt\n=\nq u .14 Econometric methods, like those of Hansen and\nt\nHodrick (1980) and Hayashi and Sims (1983), exist to deal with the resulting moving-\naverage error structure in market efficiency tests, but recovering the original “true” shock\nfrom thetime-averaged datais generallynot possible.\nIn theexamplesdescribed so far, themonthlyvalueoftheFed fundsrate istaken to be\nthe monthly average of the daily rates. How would the calculation be affected if the Fed\nfunds rate from a single day were used in place of the monthly average? In this example,\ntheApril30FedFundsrate(6.0%)minustheMarch31FedfundsfuturesratefortheApril\ncontract(5.0%)givesthecorrect 100basispointsurprise. However,otherexampleswould\ngenerate problems with this calculation. Suppose that data were released in the first week\nofAprilthatindicatedtheFOMC’snormalresponsewouldbetoincreasetheFedfundsrate\nby50basispointsto5.5%;andthenonApril16theactualpolicymovewas100basispoints\nto6%. Inthiscase,50basispointsisanticipated,andtheother50basispointsisasurprise.\nBut the calculation above is unaffected by the first week’s data release, so the surprise is\noverstated by the amount of the mid-month’s revision to anticipated policy. Finally, since\nthe settlement price of the Fed funds futures contract is based upon the monthly average,\nthere’s little reason to believe the futures rates would satisfy conditions of unbiasedness\nand efficiency relativeto thelast-day-of-the-monthFed fundsrate.\nOne way to reconstruct the “true” April shock is to rescale the first measure of the\nsurprise. Specifically, compute the surprise as the April average Fed funds rate (5.5%)\nminus the March 31 Fed funds futures rate for the April contract (5%), and multiply the\nsurprisebythefactorm\n=\nt ,wheremisthenumberofdaysinthemonthandt isthenumber\nofdaysaffectedbythechange.

If there were an FOMC meeting two days before the\nend of the month, for example, and if the monthly average Fed funds rate turned out to be\n1 basis point above the target, the rescaling will result in a spurious 15 basis point shock.\nTo reduce the effect of this noise, the average target Fed funds rate can be used in place\nof the effective rate. This procedure will distort the size of the shocks only to the extent\nthat market participants expect the average effective rate to deviate from the target. Using\nthe target rate, the standard deviation of the rescaled policy shocks is 19.7 basis points,\ncompared withonly8.9fortheunscaledshocks.\nAn alternative way to gauge the effect of time aggregation on the magnitude of funds\n15Theonlyexceptiontothiswasthe25basispointincreaseinthetargetinApril1994.\n20\n\nratesurprisesistousethe“spotmonth”contract’sprice,whichisbasedontheaverageFed\nfunds rate prevailing in the current month. Again, suppose that changes in the target Fed\nfunds rate only occur immediately following an FOMC meeting, and, as in the example\nabove, suppose that the FOMC meeting occurs on April 16. The difference between the\nApril 16 and April 15 futures rates for the April contract would reflect the change in the\nexpected path of the Fed funds rate over the April 16 to April 30 period. In the scenario\ndescribedabove,thespotmonthfuturesrateonApril15wouldhavebeen5.0%,consistent\nwith the “no change” expectation. On April 16, after the increase to 6.0%, the spot month\nfutures rate would be 5.5%, since the contract’s settlement price is based on an average\nthat includes the first 15 days of the month, when the Fed funds rate was only 5.0%.

Theapproach isnotwithoutitspitfalls,however. Onehazard involvestheinterpre-\ntation of the correlation between Fed funds futures surprises and VAR shocks. This corre-\nlation contains little meaningful information relevant for assessing the VAR’s description\nof monetary policy. As shown above, small deviations from the orthogonality condition\nimpliedby marketefficiency can haveabigeffect on thecorrelation.\nThis is not to say that VARs’ description of monetary policy is perfect. Their fore-\ncasts are imprecise and noisy, and there is some evidence to suggest parameter instability.\nShorterlag lengthsand a morejudiciousselectionof startingdatecan mitigatetheseprob-\nlems, however, and the results presented here suggest more research along those lines is\nwarranted.\nOne importantcomplicationarising in comparisonsbetween VARs and futures-market\n21\n\nforecasts is time aggregation. This problem can distort the timing and magnitude of the\nestimated policy surprises: point-in-time futures rate data gets the timing right, but atten-\nuates the magnitude, while average data gets the magnitude right but distorts the timing.\nThis observationhas importantimplicationsfor attempts to draw inferences about the size\nofpolicyshocksfrom futures marketdata.\nWhile the distortion created by time aggregation may have significant effects on the\ncontemporaneous correlation between shocks, it is unlikely that it would affect the econ-\nomy’s estimated response to those shocks. Because an impulse response function can be\nthought of in terms of a regression of the relevant variable on a set of mutually uncorre-\nlated shocks, merely shifting the shocks’ dating a month — or even a quarter — in one\ndirection or another may alter the timing of the response but have little effect on its shape\nor size. Consequently, the timing ambiguities identified above are probably irrelevant for\nmeasuringthereal effects ofmonetarypolicy.\n22\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S. 1986.

    "text": "Economic Outlook and Policy\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nEvanston Civic Leaders Breakfast\nEvanston, Ill.\nOctober 19, 2010\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nEconomic Outlook and Policy\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nI’m delighted to be here today to share with you my thoughts on the economy and offer\nmy perspective on monetary policy. Before I proceed further, let me stress that I will be\nsharing my personal views with you, and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\nWith four quarters of positive growth under our belt and employment beginning to rise,\nthe economic recovery from the recession that ended in June 2009 is certainly\nunderway. However, the pace of recovery in both output and employment has slowed\nrecently. Real GDP (gross domestic product) rose at an annual rate of just 1.7 percent\nin the second quarter, down markedly from 3.7 percent growth in the first quarter. I\nexpect slightly stronger growth going forward — in the range of 2.0 to 2½ percent in the\nsecond half of the year, and 3.0 to 3½ percent next year.\nThis is a quite moderate pace of growth given the severity of the recession we\nexperienced and in comparison with the economy’s potential growth rate. We need\nstronger growth for some time before we return to a more normal level of economic\nactivity.\nNotably, at 9.6 percent in September, the unemployment rate remains well above the\nlevel I consider to be consistent with the Fed’s mandate of maximum employment. To\nbring the unemployment rate down substantially, the economy needs to grow\nsubstantially above the potential rate. But given my outlook for only moderate growth\nover the next two years, I don’t see unemployment falling below 8 percent by the end of\n2012.\nPerhaps slower job growth is a new feature of recoveries. Following the two prior\nrecessions, many measures of economic activity showed improvement well before the\nunemployment rate started to decline. But, in the current environment, slow job growth\nis symptomatic of a generally weak recovery.\nTo offer some perspective, let me remind you of the aftermath of the deep 1981 to 1982\nrecession. In the eighteen months following that recession, growth averaged nearly 8\npercent and the unemployment rate declined by 3½ percentage points. In contrast, after\n15 months of recovery from the recent recession, growth has averaged only 3 percent\nand the unemployment rate is only marginally lower than at its peak of 10.1 percent in\nthe fall of 2009. Even after more solid growth materializes, unemployment will likely\nremain stubbornly high. Discouraged workers will resume searching for jobs, adding to\nthe large number of those already looking for work. Furthermore, the number of long-\nterm unemployed is extremely high, and such workers typically have a more difficult\ntime finding a job.\n2\n\nThe housing market will also be a factor constraining employment gains by reducing the\nmobility of homeowners who owe more on their home than it is worth. New construction\nand home sales remain well below their historical averages; and, supply and demand\nconditions could continue to weigh on real estate markets for some time. Low mortgage\nrates and more attractively priced homes suggest housing market conditions will get\nbetter as we move further into the expansion, but improvement is likely to be only\ngradual.\nRecently, many observers have questioned what more monetary policy can do to\naddress the very high unemployment rate. Some have suggested that the financial\ncrisis and the accompanying recession precipitated structural change in the demand for\nlabor, raising the economy’s natural rate of unemployment. They suggest that it has\nbecome significantly more difficult to match job seekers with job vacancies over the past\ntwo years. If this is true, then monetary policy is not the appropriate tool to address the\nramifications of such a change. If, however, structural factors can only explain a modest\npart of the rapid rise in unemployment, then monetary policy may be able to play a more\nconstructive role.\nThere are reasons to think that the natural rate of unemployment has indeed risen over\nthe last couple of years. The extension of unemployment insurance benefits during the\nrecession helped to cushion unemployed workers from the adverse effects of lost\nincome. But it also might have reduced the incentive for some workers to seek out new\nemployment, or kept others from leaving the labor force. It is also conceivable that the\nrecession affected different regions and sectors of the economy unevenly or severed an\nunusually large number of long-term employment relationships, factors making for an\nespecially difficult transition for affected workers.\nThe historical relationship between unemployment and job vacancy rates is a useful tool\nfor addressing this issue.1 When labor markets are functioning well, an increase in job\nopenings is accompanied by a decrease in unemployment. It has only been since the\nbeginning of this year that we have seen an improvement in job openings that was not\nmatched by a correspondingly large reduction in unemployment. Based on this, some\nhave suggested that most of the increase in the unemployment rate over the past two\nyears is due to a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and those needed by\nemployers.\nHowever, there are problems with this view, including the dearth of sectors reporting\nstrong demand for hard-to-find skilled workers and the continued presence of\ndisinflationary pressures that we would not expect to observe if the natural rate were\nhigher and resource slack were smaller. Even if we take the job vacancy data at face\nvalue, the size of the deviation from its historical relationship with unemployment is not\nlarge enough to suggest an increase in the natural rate to anything like the current rate\n1 This relationship is often referred to as the “Beveridge curve.”\n3\n\nof unemployment.2 Therefore, the 8 percent unemployment rate I expect to see by the\nend of 2012 still leaves us with a very large amount of resource slack.\nAt the same time, measures of consumer price inflation continue to under-run the 2\npercent level that I consider consistent with price stability. With inflation expectations\nstable, inflation is likely to remain below desirable levels for some time. It is not\nunreasonable to expect 1 percent inflation in 2012. Unless the actual conditions turn out\nto be very different from my forecast, inflation of less than 1½ percent in 2013 is a\nstrong possibility.\nThe magnitude of resource slack, combined with the fact that inflation has been running\nbelow the level I consider consistent with long-term price stability, suggests to me that it\nwould be desirable to increase monetary policy accommodation. Normally, this would\ninvolve lowering the target federal funds rate based on the economic outlook and the\nhistorical relationship between policy actions and their impact on the economy.3\nHowever, at roughly zero, the fed funds rate is as low as it can go. As a result, the\ncurrent economic environment poses unusual challenges for policymakers.\nA key aspect of the current situation that concerns me is the growing evidence that we\nare in what economists call a “liquidity trap.” In a liquidity trap, the supply of savings\ncontinually outstrips the demand for investment, but interest rates near zero can’t fall to\nequate supply and demand. Liquidity traps are exceedingly rare. The last time the U.S.\neconomy was in a liquidity trap was during the Great Depression, some 80 years ago.\nThere’s a lot of evidence that we’re in a liquidity trap. Despite the accommodative\nstance of monetary policy, the amount of credit flowing to households and businesses\nhas yet to expand. Undoubtedly, some of the decline in lending reflects tighter lending\nstandards. However, standards for most loan types are no longer tightening, and\nanecdotal evidence suggests that credit is more readily available.\nRather, it seems to me that part of the reason for sluggish credit flows is that\nbusinesses aren’t particularly interested in increasing spending. As I assess the\nincoming data and talk to my business contacts, the impression I get is that executives\nare very cautious in their outlook and spending plans. They appear to be content to post\nstrong profits generated by unprecedented cost-cutting, rather than grow their top-line\nrevenues by expanding capital investment and hiring. Even after substantial\nimprovement in financial conditions, firms are sitting on the cash generated by profits\nand the funds raised in capital markets. Some of our business contacts explain their\nreluctance to invest by pointing to uncertainties raised by regulatory actions and\ngovernment policies. Yet, most admit they would increase spending if demand were\nstronger.\n2 Making some plausible assumptions, my staff estimates that the level of unemployment consistent with\nrecent data on job openings taken from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Job Openings and Labor\nTurnover Survey is likely to be between 6 and 7 percent.\n3 A convenient summary of this relationship is given by the “Taylor rule,” first expressed in Taylor (1993)\nand later developed further in Taylor (1999).\n4\n\nTo be certain, some forms of business spending are already reviving. Inventory\nrebuilding contributed strongly to growth in previous quarters; but this process is nearing\nan end, as firms have made substantial progress aligning inventories with sales.\nBusiness fixed investment also increased at a solid pace earlier this year, with firms\nupgrading IT systems and replacing capital equipment in order to maintain\ncompetiveness and profitability. Recent data, however, suggest that the surge in\nreplacement demand is beginning to subside. Absent further improvement in consumer\ndemand, business spending is likely to be more moderate going forward.\nConsumers also remain reluctant to spend, adding to their savings nearly in proportion\nto increases in disposable income. The personal savings rate in August, at 5.8 percent,\nis well above the near 2 percent savings rate that we saw prior to the recession. In fact,\npersonal savings continue to rise even though there is very little interest income to be\nearned. This suggests that the high savings rate reflects elevated risk aversion caused\nby the millions of jobs lost during the recession, as well as the $13 trillion wealth loss\nthat accompanied it. Such an increase in households’ propensity to save is\naccompanied by a decrease in their rate of consumption.\nSo we have all the ingredients for a liquidity trap: Businesses are cautious about new\ninvestment and households are too worried to meaningfully increase consumption. And\ninterest rates can’t fall in the way needed to increase investment and consumption\nbecause short-term rates are already at zero: They’ve fallen as far as they can go. If this\nstate of affairs continues, it could very well stifle any reasonably robust recovery.\nUnemployment would remain unacceptably high, and disinflationary pressures would be\nreinforced — clearly an undesirable outcome.\nThese rare occasions of liquidity traps are very different from typical economic\nrecessions. Consequently, they require a unique monetary policy response. Economic\ntheory tells us that in such circumstances monetary policy should aim to lower the real,\nor inflation-adjusted, rate of interest by temporarily allowing inflation to rise above its\nlong-run path. My preferred way of doing so is to implement an approach called price-\nlevel targeting. Simply stated, under this approach, the central bank strives to hit a\nparticular price-level path within a reasonable period of time. For example, if the rate of\nchange of the price-path is 2 percent and inflation has been under-running the path for\nsome time, monetary policy would strive to “catch-up” so that inflation would be higher\nthan the inflation target for a time until the path was regained. This higher inflation rate\nwould decrease the real interest rate, raising the opportunity cost of holding money.\nThis would provide an incentive for banks and corporations to release funds for\ninvestment, and in the process spur job creation.\nIn my opinion, such a strategy is entirely appropriate. The Fed has a mandate from\nCongress to encourage conditions that foster both price stability and maximum\nemployment. Recently the Fed has missed on both dimensions of this dual mandate,\nwith inflation running below the 2 percent level I associate with price stability, and with\nunemployment staying well above any reasonable estimate of the natural rate.\n5\n\nPractically speaking, price-level targeting in the current environment would call for a\nseries of large-scale asset purchases to recover the shortfall in inflation. At the same\ntime, we would continue to carry a large balance sheet in order to maintain low interest\nrates for an extended period. Most important, we would clearly communicate the path\nfor prices that we expect to attain, in order to enhance the public’s understanding of the\nFed’s intentions.\nThere are operational aspects of a price-level target policy that require much more\nelaboration and study, including the precise price-level target and how to achieve it.\nThere are also potential challenges that we should be prepared to address. For\ninstance, given the initial uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the new policy\napproach, inflation may at first continue to be very low. Sustaining our commitment to\nachieving the price-level target would be critical if we are to achieve success in this\ncase. Conversely, we’d need careful advance planning to ensure that if inflation ran at a\nmore elevated level than expected, we could bring the price level back to the target\npath. The tools we developed over the last two years to drain reserves from the banking\nsystem will prove useful in this regard. It would also be of utmost importance to\nappropriately use the Federal Reserve’s authorities of macroprudential supervision and\nregulation during this period to avoid the emergence of financial market imbalances.\nFor many, my proposal will be a hard pill to swallow. Central bankers generally loathe\nthe idea that even a temporarily higher inflation rate could be beneficial for, or\nconsistent with, price stability over the longer term. We do not want to lose what the Fed\nunder Chairmen Volcker and Greenspan won for the American people by fighting\ninflation and achieving price stability. The current circumstances, however, require that\nwe fight a different battle — namely, the extraordinary instance of liquidity trap\nconditions not seen since the 1930s. With potentially beneficial policies that are well\ngrounded in rigorous economic analysis available to us, I cannot stare at our current\nprojections for high unemployment and low inflation and think that they are consistent\nwith the best policies to address the Fed’s dual mandate responsibilities. 4\nReferences\nAuerbach, Alan J., and Maurice Obstfeld, 2005, “The Case for Open-market\nPurchases in a Liquidity Trap,” American Economic Review, Vol. 95, No. 1, March, pp.\n110–137.\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, 2003, “The Zero Bound on Interest\nRates and Optimal Monetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 34,\nNo. 1, pp. 139–211.\nKrugman, Paul R., 1998, “It’s Baaack: Japan’s Slump and the Return of the Liquidity\nTrap,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 137–187.\n4 Academic studies of the benefits of price-level targeting given liquidity trap conditions include Krugman\n(1998), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), Svensson (2003) and Auerbach and Obstfeld (2005).\n6\n\nSvensson, Lars E.

    "text": "Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Environment:\nDeveloping a State-Contingent Price-Level Target\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nth\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston 55 Economic Conference\nBoston, Mass.\nOctober 16, 2010\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nMonetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Environment:\nDeveloping a State-Contingent Price-Level Target\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIntroductory Remarks\nI would like to thank Eric Rosengren, Jeff Fuhrer and the organizers for giving me the\nopportunity to speak on this panel today. I would like to use this opportunity to expand\nthe discussion about additional communications tools available to central banks in a\nlow-inflation environment. In a nutshell, I think there are special circumstances when\nprice-level targeting would be a helpful complement to our current and prospective\nstrategies in the U.S. Clearly communicating an expected path for prices would help\nguide the public’s understanding of the Fed’s intentions while we carry a large balance\nsheet and promise continued low interest rates for an extended period.\nThere are quite a number of academic studies of liquidity trap crises that find either\nprice-level targeting or temporary above-average inflation to be nearly optimal policies;1\nand yet, central bankers and the public generally loathe the idea that even a temporarily\nhigher inflation rate could be beneficial or be consistent with price stability over the\nlonger term.\nNevertheless, with potentially beneficial policies so well grounded in rigorous economic\nanalysis, I cannot stare at our current projections for high unemployment and low\ninflation and think that these projections are consistent with the best monetary policies\nto address the Fed’s dual mandate responsibilities. Today, I want to expand the\ndiscussion of these tools. After all, debate on the merits is healthy.\nOf course, these are my views only and not those of my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nRationale: Much More Accommodation Is Appropriate\nLet me be very clear about the setting for this proposal. In my opinion, much more\npolicy accommodation is appropriate today. In a speech two weeks ago,2 I stated that I\nbelieve the U.S. economy is best described as being in a bona fide liquidity trap. This\nbelief is not a new development for me; instead, it is a dawning realization. Risk-free\nshort-term interest rates are essentially zero. Both households and businesses have an\nexcess of savings relative to the new investment demands for these funds. With\nnominal interest rates at zero, market clearing at lower real interest rates is stymied.\n1 An essential reference list would begin with Krugman (1998), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), Svensson (2003),\nand Auerbach and Obstfeld (2005).\n2 Evans (2010). See also my interview with The Wall Street Journal in Hilsenrath (2010).\n2\n\nIn this setting, even a moderate expansion without a double dip will not lead to\nappropriate labor market improvement.3 Accordingly, highly plausible projections are 1\npercent for core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE) inflation at the\nend of 2012 and 8 percent for the unemployment rate. For me, the Fed’s dual mandate\nmisses are too large to shrug off, and there is currently no policy conflict between\nimproving employment and inflation outcomes. The economic theories that central\nbankers rely on for evaluating appropriate monetary policy suggest to me that we need\nlower short-term real interest rates than the current real federal funds rate of –1 percent.\nIndeed, if the federal funds rate were positive, I would advocate substantial nominal\nreductions. But we are effectively at zero.\nA variety of typical linear Taylor rules suggests around –4 percent. In addition, some\ncalculations for optimal monetary policy simulations I have seen indicate that real rates\nof –3 or –4 percent between now and the end of 2012 would boost aggregate demand\nenough to deliver substantially lower unemployment by the end of 2012. If you reach the\nconclusion that we are in a liquidity trap, or even near a perilous liquidity trap, more\naccommodation is not data-dependent or a close call.\nHow Does Price-level Targeting Help with Policy Communications?\nIf the Federal Reserve decided to increase the degree of policy accommodation today,\ntwo avenues could be: 1) additional large-scale asset purchases, and 2) a\ncommunication that policy rates will remain at zero for longer than “an extended period.”\nA third and complementary policy tool would be to announce that, given the current\nliquidity trap conditions, monetary policy would seek to target a path for the price level.\nSimply stated, a price-level target is a path for the price level that the central bank\nshould strive to hit within a reasonable period of time. For example, if the slope of the\nprice path, which I will refer to as P*, is 2 percent and inflation has been underrunning\nthe path for some time, monetary policy would strive to catch up to the path: Inflation\nwould be higher than 2 percent for a time until the path was reattained. I refer to this as\na state-contingent policy because the price-level targeting regime is only intended for\nthe duration of the liquidity trap episode. I will be more concrete in just a moment, but\nfirst, where does such a policy come from?\nA policy that targets a price-level objective emerges from analyzing standard—modern\nmacroeconomic theory. The desirable properties of the price-level target (or temporarily\nabove-average inflation) become most apparent in analyses that consider liquidity traps.\nFigure 1 displays the simplest example of a price path P* and its essential attributes.\nThe reader must judge for herself whether this policy could be communicated\nstraightforwardly and transparently to the public; my personal viewpoint is that it is\nhorribly cynical to think that good communication is beyond our ability, especially if that\nis the best policy. Here are some key elements:\n3 In the speech cited earlier, I also discussed the relevant evidence on job mismatch and the Beveridge curve. I find\nunconvincing the argument that the natural rate of unemployment has risen enough to deter additional substantial\npolicy accommodation.\n3\n\n• The first policy component consists of announcing a state-contingent entry\ninto the P* policy. I think most of us imagine liquidity traps with double-digit\nunemployment rates to be relatively rare events, on the order of twice a\ncentury or less. Under such circumstances where the central bank is missing\nboth components of its dual mandate by a large margin, there is justification\nfor targeting a higher price-level path in an effective, disciplined, and limited\nfashion. A credible announcement of the policy is clearly crucial for\nstimulating the correct expectations by the public.\n• The second policy component is to select the parameters for the price-level\npath: the initial date when the index-path begins and the slope of the path.\nGiven the recognition delay in understanding the implications of the liquidity\ntrap, it seems reasonable that the path would begin at some date in the past.\nMy preference would be to select December 2007, in part because it is the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) peak of the business cycle.\nWith regard to the slope, for the sake of concreteness, I will illustratively\nsuggest 2 percent for the average inflation rate; this rate corresponds to the\nmode of FOMC participants’ forecast endpoints for PCE inflation.4 With this\ndefinition of the P* path, it is easy to see an emerging “inflation deficit” to\ndate.\n• The third policy component is to communicate regularly and often to the\npublic that the intention of the FOMC’s policy actions is to achieve this path\nwithin a reasonable period of time. At a minimal level, this could simply be a\ndisciplined guarantee regarding how long policy rates will be held at zero; it is\nan elaboration of what the current “extended period” language means. Other\naccommodative policies could be used to further build the public’s confidence\nthat the Fed is pursuing this price-level path. The task of communicating\nmany operational details would follow the announcement. Indeed, even\nbefore reaching the P* path, closing the gap would set the stage eventually\nfor adjustments in operational policy, such as altering the size of the Fed’s\nbalance sheet, taking reserve-draining actions along the way, and increasing\nthe rate of interest on excess reserves (IOER), among others.\n• The fourth policy component is to clearly state the terms for the final, state-\ncontingent exit from the P* policy. Determining that the price-level path has\nbeen achieved with confidence is a critical determination. Presumably,\nspending a few months at the price-level path would be more important than\nsimply the first achievement of the path. Once the price-level path is achieved\nwith confidence, the forward-looking monetary policy strategy would return to\nfocusing on 2 percent inflation over the medium term. Future policy misses on\neither side of 2 percent would be “bygones.” Policy would continue to strive\nfor price stability over the medium term, which would be 2 percent PCE\n4\nFor the remainder of my comments, I will take 2 percent to be the FOMC’s explicit inflation objective over the\nmedium term. This is not a decision that has been taken by the FOMC. I simply use 2 percent to facilitate the\ndevelopment of my comments.\n4\n\ninflation. The past inflation misses would be used to simply inform current\nanalyses of inflation pressures and improve future projections and policy\nresponses.\nWhat Might the Experience with P* Look Like? Some Favorable Cases\nLet me spend some time discussing alternative outcomes from this state-contingent\nprice-level targeting regime. Remember, the regime is one where policy actions like\nlarge scale assets purchases (LSAPs), communications actions, etc., strive to increase\nmonetary accommodation to hit the P* path within a reasonable period of time. Figure 2\nshows the implied inflation rates for a 2 percent P* path where the current price gap is\nclosed by the end of 2012. Given current forecasts for inflation, this would be a rapid\nturnaround in the inflation picture. Many questions regarding operational responses\nduring this adjustment would need to be addressed:\n• The inflation rates are relatively modest: 2.2 percent core inflation in 2011 and\n2.9 percent in 2012. For a policymaker with a symmetric loss function around 2\npercent, 2.9 percent is about the same loss as 1 percent. This is not a significant\nchange from current expectations of policy losses. Of course, ensuring\ncommitment to the policy exit is presumably crucial for achieving 2 percent in\n2013.\n• If short-term interest rates remain near zero during this adjustment, real interest\nrates would be between –2 and –3 percent. Perhaps that would be enough to\nimprove labor markets and aggregate demand sufficiently, but I personally put\nmore faith in analyses that suggest the liquidity trap is larger than this.\n• Consequently, in this scenario at the end of 2012, if resource slack remains\nsubstantial and inflationary pressures are returning toward 2 percent over the\nmedium term on account of credible policy commitment, then a standard Taylor-\nrule prescription may still call for a relatively low federal funds rate. And the size\nand composition of the Fed’s balance sheet might also be consistent with\naccommodation. How much? The ultimate decisions for monetary policy would\ncontinue to focus on our dual mandate responsibilities; but inflation would be\nnearer our goal of price stability and aggregate demand would be stronger.\nAs I mentioned, a 2 percent P* policy that achieves the target path by the end of 2012\nmight leave unemployment still relatively high given the implied real rates. Figure 3\ndisplays a more aggressive P* policy that is assumed to close by the end of 2013. This\npath rises at a 3 percent rate from December 2007 until December 2012, and then\nreverts to the 2 percent slope, taken as price stability. This path incorporates what\nSvensson (2003) refers to as an initial “price gap to undo:” It allows the eventual price\nadjustment to incorporate a lower real rate if that is what the economic analysis\nsuggests is most useful to increase aggregate demand. Over the course of this\nhypothetical adjustment, inflation is about 3, 4, and 3 percent from 2011 through 2013.\nThus, policy can generate –3 and –4 percent real rates: This achieves a substantially\n5\n\nhigher opportunity cost of holding on to cash-like assets rather than lending and\ninvesting excess reserves in productive activities and workforces.\nAgain, credible commitment to the price path P* is, of course, critical to achieving the\ninflation endpoint of 2 percent over the medium term. In this regard, a reduction in the\nsize of the Fed’s dual mandate shortfalls would reinforce the public’s perception that the\nFed’s incentives are appropriately aligned with exiting the P* policy with medium-term\nprice-stability in sight.\nWhat Might the Experience with P* Look Like? Some More Challenging Cases\nThere are many operational aspects of a P* policy that require much more elaboration\nand study. Nevertheless, let me mention three clear situations that require more\ncomplicated responses. It is a hallmark of the uncertain times that we face that these\nare at polar extremes.\nDelayed inflation\nThe first challenge is to imagine that inflation continues to remain very low even after an\nannouncement that monetary policy is following a price-level path. As inflation delay\ncontinues, the “inflation deficit” account builds. That is, the price gap gets larger, and\nimplied future inflation to attain the P* path grows. This would clearly be nerve-wracking\nfor policymakers, and the credibility of our commitment to ever growing inflation rates\nwould be crucial for the success of the policy. If our resolve is credible, well-functioning\nfinancial markets should get the message. After all, investors and lenders sitting on\ncash-like assets would be building up an exposure to adverse future real interest rates.\nAnd I would expect the financial press to help communicate these investment risks on a\nregular basis. (I know I’ve felt that sting already.)\nAs cash moves out of investment portfolios into the general economy, inflation will rise\nas required by the price-level targeting policy.\nSmaller resource slack and greater inflation pressures\nThe second challenge is to imagine that the degree of resource slack in the economy is\nmuch smaller than many presume. One example would be if the structural rate of\nunemployment was upward of 8 percent. In this case, more accommodation could lead\nto higher inflation and a rapid closing of the price gap.\nAs it turns out, this is not a challenge for the P* policy: A quicker closing of the price gap\nharkens the exit of the state-contingent price-level policy. The fact that unemployment\nwould remain high would be a signal that increasing aggregate demand alone is not\nenough to address this problem. But monetary policy would have succeeded in moving\ncloser to price stability with the attending benefits from achieving that policy goal.\nConfidently switching to the post-P* policy would enhance credibility for price stability\nover the medium term. And we would have done all that we could to address the\nemployment situation—which would also enhance Fed credibility, in my judgment.\n6\n\nAccelerating inflation once the price gap has been closed\nThe third challenge would be if inflation was surprisingly high at the point when the price\ngap was eliminated and policy reverted to targeting 2 percent inflation over the medium\nterm. I regard this case as extremely unlikely. Recall that we are embarking on this\nprice-level targeting policy in an environment of huge resource gaps, with minimal\ninflationary pressures. (I actually think that the greater difficulty will be getting inflation\ngoing in the first place.) But in the unlikely occurrence that inflation accelerates beyond\nthe levels we anticipate, we have the tools to deal with it. Specifically, relative to initial\nbaseline scenarios, the Fed could more aggressively increase the federal funds rate\nand interest on excess reserves (IOER), as well as drain liquidity from our balance\nsheet. Furthermore, any higher inflation would almost surely be associated with stronger\neconomic growth and job creation, so these stronger “exit strategy” actions would be\nentirely appropriate.\nConcluding Remarks\nMy objective today has been a simple one: to discuss a policy tool that has received\nalmost zero discussion, though it regularly comes out of careful analyses of mainstream\neconomic models that we use to assess monetary policy options. We should put this\npolicy tool on the table and debate its suitability to the current situation in the U.S.\nMost critiques I have heard of this type of policy tool involve the risk of runaway inflation\nexpectations or the loss of hard-earned credibility. My response is to continually fall\nback on the discipline of the state-contingent exit plan. A central bank exercising this\npolicy would have to credibly convey to the public that this policy will end when the price\ngap is closed. An important risk would be the temptation to keep policy easy if the labor\nmarket has not reached the vicinity of full employment. Depending on the parameters of\nthe P* path, inflation expectations and the size of resource slack, the price gap could\nclose before unemployment is reduced toward 6 percent or lower. Nevertheless,\ncredibility requires exiting the P* policy at this point. Doing so ensures that this is a\nconservative policy, with prudent risk-mitigants against outcomes that monetary policy is\nunable to improve upon.\nBut I am more hopeful for this policy’s potential to improve upon our current liquidity trap\neconomic conditions. I hope that my comments have helped expand the debate over\nthe past few weeks.\n7\n\n8\n\nReferences\nAuerbach, Alan J., and Maurice Obstfeld, 2005, “The Case for Open-market Purchases in a\nLiquidity Trap,” American Economic Review, Vol. 95, No. 1, March, pp. 110–137.\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, 2003, “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and\nOptimal Monetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 34, No. 1, pp. 139–211.\nEvans, Charles L., 2010, “A Perspective on the Future of U.S. Monetary Policy,” Speech at a\nconference sponsored by the Bank of France, The Future of Monetary Policy, Rome, Italy,\nOctober 1, available at\nhttp://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/speeches/2010/10_01_bank_of_france_spee\nch.cfm\nHilsenrath, Jon, 2010, “Q&A: Chicago Fed’s Evans Elaborates on His Call for Aggressive Fed\nAction,” Real Time Economics: Economic Insights and Analysis from The Wall Street Journal,\nblog, October 5, available at http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/10/05/qa-chicago-feds-\nevans-elaborates-on-his-call-for-aggressive-fed-action/\nKrugman, Paul R., 1998, “It’s Baaack: Japan’s Slump and the Return of the Liquidity Trap,”\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 137–187.\nSvensson, Lars E.

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK\nOF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\nPage 1 of 12\n\nIL Wesleyan University Associates Business Luncheon\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nThank you for that kind introduction. I'm delighted to be back in Bloomington Normal\nand at Illinois Wesleyan. Certainly, in a University town, this is the time of year when\ntalk of the economy seems most relevant. As we approach graduation day, students\ntend to focus intently on jobs and careers and perhaps for the first time, they seem\nespecially keen on finding a way to put what they've learned to good and productive\nuse.\nSo, I'm pleased to be here to have the opportunity to explain how I see the economy\nevolving and to express my views on some of the key issues we face today. At the end\nof these talks, when I open the floor for discussion, I find myself being asked the same\nsorts of questions over and over again. So I’d like to address some of those questions in\nmy remarks today and then give you an opportunity to follow up with questions of your\nown.\nPage 2 of 12\n\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s begin with the question I hear most often: What are the prospects for the\neconomy? In short, the economy is recovering from the recession, and I am optimistic\nthat it will continue to do so. My forecast is that real gross domestic product (GDP) will\ngrow about 3-1/2 percent this year. In fact, we have been hearing many more upbeat\nbusiness reports, and we recently nudged up our outlook accordingly. But the “for sale”\nsigns posted in yards, empty storefronts, and long waits for job seekers are powerful\nreminders of how serious the recession was and how far below our potential we still are.\nWe need to experience a good deal of growth before we return to the more normal pace\nof economic activity and levels of unemployment that we enjoyed in late 2007. And the\n3-1/2 percent pace of growth I anticipate is quite moderate given the depth of the\nrecession. To offer some perspective, in the first year and a half following the deep\n1981 to 1982 recession, growth averaged nearly 8 percent.\nLet me give you some of the details underlying this assessment of the economy. The\nrecent GDP numbers—the value of overall production of goods and services in the\neconomy—are the broadest indication that the economy is growing again. GDP fell\nsharply—3.7 percent all told—during 2008 and the first half of 2009. But GDP has\nincreased in each of the past three quarters, with growth averaging a 3.7 percent\nannual rate.\nPage 3 of 12\n\nWhere did this growth come from? Some of it reflected the federal government stimulus\npackage passed in 2009. This raised economic activity a good deal in the second half of\nlast year, and should be a continued solid boost to spending through much of 2010.\nBut government stimulus is hardly the whole story. Unmistakably, private spending has\nbeen reviving. One area is inventory investment by businesses. During the recession,\nfirms aggressively cut inventories to very lean levels. By avoiding an overhang of\nexcess stocks, they are now increasing orders for newly produced goods to meet\nincoming demand—and we’ve seen manufacturing production increase accordingly. We\nhave also seen an increase in business spending on capital equipment, most notably on\nhigh-tech items, as firms replace and upgrade their IT systems and other equipment in\norder to maintain competiveness and profitability.\nEven consumers have increased spending, although concerns remain about the\nsustainability of the recent strength. Job worries and losses in household wealth had\ncaused consumers to cut back on spending appreciably during the recession. But they\nhave now begun to reopen their pocketbooks. During the first quarter of 2010 total\npersonal consumption expenditures increased at a 3.6 percent annual rate.\nSignificantly, these increases were distributed across many different types of goods and\nservices. Even in the hard-hit automobile sector, sales have averaged 11.0 million units\nso far this year—up over 17 percent from a year ago, though still well below the 16.6\nmillion unit pace that prevailed before the recession.\nPage 4 of 12\n\nIn contrast, housing continues to struggle. During the second half of 2009, both sales\nand new construction lifted off from the recession low points seen around the turn of the\nyear. But sales fell back after the expiration last November of the first round of tax\ncredits for first-time home buyers, and starts have not shown much discernible\nimprovement over the past several months.\nWe currently are seeing a bit of a pickup in housing markets. But this is likely a\ntemporary boost as buyers rush to beat the end-of-April expiration date for the\nextension of the home buyer tax credits. More fundamentally, supply conditions\ncontinue to weigh on real estate markets, and they could for some time as foreclosures\nadd to the overhang of unsold homes. But with the improving economy, low mortgage\nrates, and more attractively priced homes, housing market conditions will get better as\nwe move further into the expansion.\nWhat about labor markets? In general, many measures of economic activity show\nimprovement early in a recovery well before the jobs picture starts to get better. This\nwas especially true following the two previous recessions. I am concerned that this may\nbe the case during this expansion as well. As the economy entered the most recent\nrecession, businesses quickly cut their work forces. And even as the economy grew\nduring the second half of 2009, job destruction outpaced the extremely low levels of\nhiring.\nPage 5 of 12\n\nMore recently, there has been a modest improvement in the jobs picture. Over the first\nfour months of the year, excluding temporary hiring for the U.S. Census, on average\nabout 109 thousand jobs per month were added to the economy.\nBusinesses are being cautious about adding permanent staffing. They continue to strive\nto produce more with fewer people. But they can increase output for only so long\nwithout adding to payrolls. As the recovery takes hold and businesses become more\nconfident in the future, employment will increase on a more consistently solid basis.\nIndeed, there are signals that we currently are near such a turning point. There is the\npickup in the jobs numbers I just noted. Underlying those recent employment numbers,\nlayoffs are down substantially. Some of those businesses that cut employment most\naggressively at the beginning of the recession have begun to rehire. And others who are\ntaking a more wait-and-see attitude are hiring temporary workers to fill their staffing\nneeds. In fact, temporary worker employment has increased solidly in each of the past\nseven months.\nNonetheless, even after more solid employment gains materialize, unemployment may\nremain stubbornly high. Discouraged workers will resume searching for jobs, adding to\nthe number of those already looking for work. In addition, the number of long-term\nunemployed is extremely high, and such workers typically have a more difficult time\nfinding a job. Consequently, the outlook for these workers is challenged. So I anticipate\nthat the rate and length of unemployment will improve relatively slowly.\nPage 6 of 12\n\nWith consumer spending accounting for roughly two-thirds of GDP, the economic forces\nat work here are key factors underlying the moderate projections for overall growth.\nSome historical context is helpful. Over the fifteen years or so before the most recent\nrecession, productivity growth had been quite robust. This growth supported solid\nexpansion in asset values and disposable income. Believing these factors would persist,\nconsumers borrowed heavily: Households entered this recession with high net worth but\nalso with low levels of savings and high levels of debt.\nWhen faced with a temporary loss of income, households can maintain spending only\nby drawing down assets, borrowing more, or reducing savings. But as the recession\ntook hold, households faced mounting job losses, stark reductions in the value of their\nhousing and equity assets, and little in the way of liquid savings. So it is little wonder\nthat consumers sharply retrenched on spending.\nThe need for households to repair their balance sheets will moderate growth in\nconsumer spending going forward. In addition, we are seeing reduced availability of\nhousehold credit. And, importantly, muted gains in employment will hold back growth in\nwages and salaries. All of these factors contribute to an outlook for relatively modest\ngrowth in consumer spending, which, in turn, restrains the forecast for overall GDP\ngrowth.\nIn addition to consumer lending, the availability of bank credit remains a significant\nheadwind for many small- and medium-sized companies. Both supply and demand\nPage 7 of 12\n\nconsiderations are at work here. Some of the decline in bank lending last year reflects\nweak demand for loans by businesses wary of taking on new debt burdens in an\nuncertain economic environment. But at least some of the reduced lending arises from\nbanks’ tighter lending standards. These tighter standards appear to reflect concerns of\nbanks about their own capital levels and also the credit quality of borrowers. More\ngenerally, credit flows are being reduced because both borrowers and lenders are still\ndealing with losses from the recession, especially the busts in residential and\ncommercial real estate. I expect banking conditions to improve and better support\ngrowth, but this is likely to take some time.\nWhile I’ve mentioned a number of factors that we think will dampen growth, we could be\nsurprised on the upside. Increases in confidence could turn into higher spending sooner\nthan we now think. And productivity growth has remained strong. Technology continues\nto advance, and firms continue to create new products and find new ways to produce\nmore efficiently. These factors will lead to higher incomes in the longer term. And even\nover the shorter term, the higher profits and incomes generated by productivity can help\nrestructure balance sheets and support spending.\nWell, that was a long answer to a short question. The second question I’m often asked\nis a two-parter concerning inflation. The first part is: Isn’t inflation about to explode? The\nsecond part is: Are you concerned about deflation? The answer is no in both cases: I\nthink inflation will remain relatively stable.\nPage 8 of 12\n\nBoth camps have clear arguments. The current low rates of resource utilization strongly\npoint to lower inflation. At 9.9 percent, the unemployment rate is quite high. Similarly,\nmanufacturing capacity utilization is quite low. Such resource slack reduces cost\npressures and makes firms less able to push through price increases. These factors\nhave significantly contributed to lower inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of core\ninflation—the deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, excluding food\nand energy—has fallen from 2.7 percent in August 2008 to 1.3 percent in March 2010.\nThat is a large decline for a relatively stable data series.\nThose who press me on higher inflation point to the Fed’s accommodative policy and\nexpanded balance sheet. We all know that too much money chasing too few goods will\ngenerate inflation. But, currently, most of the funds used to increase our balance sheet\nare sitting idly in bank reserves. And because banks are not lending those reserves,\nthey are not yet generating spending pressure. But, of course, leaving the current highly\naccommodative monetary policy in place for too long would eventually fuel such\ninflationary pressures.\nWith core inflation at 1-1/4 percent, I see the opposing forces of resource gaps and\naccommodative monetary policy as roughly balancing out over the medium term. As\nresource slack abates in a recovering economy, I expect inflation to move up to about 1-\n3/4 percent by 2012.\nPage 9 of 12\n\nWhat does all of this mean for monetary policy? Currently, policy is, appropriately, very\naccommodative. But, eventually, we will have to return to a more normal stance.\nJudging the appropriate timing and pace for reducing accommodation poses a\nsignificant challenge for policymakers over the next couple years. On the one hand,\nremoving too much accommodation prematurely could inhibit the recovery. On the other\nhand, as I noted, if the Fed leaves the current level of accommodation in place too long,\ninflationary pressures will eventually build. The Fed’s decisions will be based on careful\nmonitoring of business activity and an alert eye out for signs of changes in the inflation\noutlook. In addition, the FOMC is making sure that it has the technical tools it will need\nwhen it decides to reduce monetary accommodation. Overall, I am confident that\nmonetary policy will both support economic growth and bring and keep inflation near my\nguideline of 2 percent over the medium term.\nAs you can imagine, the crisis and recession have kept us busy. But we have also\ndevoted a good deal of energy reflecting on events of the past several years. This is, in\nlarge part, because of the importance of the last question I am regularly asked: What\nhave you at the Federal Reserve learned about how to guard against future financial\ncrises? There are, of course, a number of lessons. I’d like to touch on a couple of them\nnow.\nOne lesson is that responding effectively during times of crisis may require innovative\nand targeted policy tools. As the crisis unfolded, we lowered our traditional policy tool,\nthe federal funds rate, to zero—as low as it could go. But credit markets remained\nPage 10 of 12\n\nfrozen and macroeconomic conditions were deteriorating. We thus turned to\nnontraditional tools to clear up the choke points. These included providing liquidity\ndirectly to nonbank financial institutions and supporting a number of short-term credit\nmarkets. We also purchased longer-duration assets that further reduced long-term\ninterest rates. These nontraditional actions helped us avoid what easily could have been\nan even more severe economic contraction.\nOf course, in the future it would be best to reduce the chances of facing financial crises\nin the first place. Until recent events, our approach to preventing financial crises has\nrelied on the microprudential supervision and regulation of individual banks. Since the\nGreat Depression, this approach appeared to suffice, even as our financial system\nbecame more dependent on nonbank financial intermediaries, such as broker–dealers,\nhedge funds, and other institutions beyond the regulatory reach of the Fed and the other\nbanking regulators. Nevertheless, the scale and scope of the past few years’ events\nhave exposed the weaknesses of a bank-by-bank regulatory approach. I believe that an\nimportant safeguard will be the creation of a systemic risk regulator charged with\nmonitoring and addressing risk across the wide range of financial institutions.\nSetting up more pre-established systematic risk controls is important as well. As part of\nthese, we need to ensure that no financial institution, bank or nonbank, is “too big to\nfail.” Many of the unprecedented interventions undertaken by the Fed, the FDIC, and\nthe U.S. Treasury occurred because we lacked alternatives that would have allowed for\nthe orderly unwinding of these large, complex financial institutions. While mechanisms\nPage 11 of 12\n\nalready exist to address large banking failures, we also need an effective process to\nresolve failing nonbank institutions that limits market disruption and minimize moral\nhazard. These situations should not be dealt with on an ad hoc basis. The need for an\nadvance plan is imperative.\nI’d like to conclude at this point, but I hope you’ll recall that the answers to our three\nquestions about future growth, inflation, and the financial crisis were three-and-a-half,\nno, and we’ve learned a lot. Of course, the details behind these short answers are key\nto understanding how we put the pieces together to create a picture of the economy and\nthe workings of our financial system. I hope I have been able to convey some of that to\nyou today.\nI look forward to your questions.\nPage 12 of 12",

Evans*\nAbstract\nThis paper examines the ability of a simple stylized general equilibrium model that\nincorporates nominal wage rigidity to explain the magnitude and persistence of the Great\nDepression in the United States. The impulses to our analysis are money supply shocks. The\nTaylor contracts model is surprisingly successful in accounting for the behavior of major\nmacroaggregates and real wages during the downturn phase of the Depression, i.e., from\n1929:3 through mid-1933. Our analysis provides support for the hypothesis that a monetary\ncontraction operating through a sticky wage channel played a significant role in accounting\nfor the downturn, and also provides an interesting refinement to this explanation. In\nparticular, both the absolute severity of the Depression’s downturn and its relative severity\ncompared to the 1920-21 recession are likely attributable to the price decline having a much\nlarger unanticipated component during the Depression, as well as less flexible wage-setting\npractices during this latter period. Another finding casts doubt on explanations for the\n1933-36 recovery that rely heavily on the substantial remonetization that began in 1933.\nKeywords: Dynamic General Equilibrium Model, Sticky Wages\n* Bordo is a professor of economics at Rutgers University and NBER fellow\n(bordo@rci.rutgers.edu), Erceg is a staff economist in the Division of International Finance of\nthe Federal Reserve Board (ercegc@frb.gov), and Evans is an assistant vice president and\neconomist in the Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n(cevans@frbchi.org).

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nREO & Vacant Properties Summit\nDay One Closing Remarks\nWashington, D.C.\nSeptember 1, 2010\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nRemarks at the Summit\nREO and Vacant Properties:\nStrategies for Neighborhood Stabilization\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nGood afternoon. I am pleased to be here today to share a few comments as we close\nout the first day of this excellent conference on REO and Vacant Property Strategies for\nNeighborhood Stabilization. Most of you already have some appreciation for the work\nthat the Federal Reserve System has been doing to address financial and economic\ninstability. What is less well known is that the Federal Reserve also has been working\nhard to respond to the foreclosure crisis on “Main Street.” We have leveraged our\nresearch, community affairs and supervision and regulation functions to support\ninnovative foreclosure prevention and neighborhood stabilization strategies at the local\nlevel.\nI’d like to talk about that important work, especially a Fed program called MORE, or the\nMortgage Outreach and Research Effort; but before I do that, I’d like to discuss some of\nthe larger issues that relate to homeownership and foreclosure mitigation. As a nation\nwe have come to value homeownership because of the many benefits it brings, for both\nfamilies and communities. Perhaps foremost is its potential for building household\nwealth. In addition, however, communities with high levels of homeownership tend to\nhave greater involvement in school and civic organizations, higher graduation rates,\nlower housing turnover and higher home values. Simply stated, homeowners tend to put\ndown deeper roots, and that is good for communities, as well as for families.\nRecognition of these benefits has made encouraging homeownership a national priority.\nTax incentives, FHA mortgage insurance and sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac all contributed to a long rise in the U.S. homeownership rate—from 45 percent in\n1940 to a peak of 69 percent in 2004. Of course, homeownership is only good for\nfamilies and communities if it can be sustained. Home purchases that are very highly\nleveraged or unaffordable subject the borrower to a great deal of risk. There's no\nguarantee, as we've learned recently, that house prices will rise. Moreover, even in a\nstrong economy, unforeseen life events and risks in local real estate markets represent\nvulnerabilities for highly leveraged borrowers.\nThus, it was very destructive when, in the early part of this decade, dubious\nunderwriting practices and mortgage products inappropriate for mass consumption\nbecame more common. It is difficult to understand how loose underwriting, high degrees\nof leverage and the broad marketing of exotic and often very high-cost mortgage\nproducts could promote sustainable homeownership. In fact, these practices took us in\nthe other direction, and homeownership began to decline even while mortgage\nunderwriting standards continued to loosen. Moreover, partly as a result of these\n2\n\npractices, we've seen an unprecedented housing market collapse that contributed to a\nvery deep recession marked by many lost jobs. And homeownership has now declined\nfor six straight years.\nAlthough there are some signs of general economic recovery and some evidence of\nhome price stabilization, we are certainly not out of the woods. Projections suggest\nforeclosed housing units in the U.S. could reach as high as 3 million in 2010.\nThe public policy response to the housing market collapse has become increasingly\naggressive as the severity and extent of the collapse have become clearer. One might\nexpect lenders to modify mortgages, making them more affordable for borrowers, rather\nthan accepting large losses on foreclosed properties. However, for various reasons, the\nnumber of modifications has been lower than we might have hoped. Thus federal\ngovernment efforts such as the Home Affordable Mortgage Program, or HAMP,\ncontinue to evolve, and the search for solutions goes on. The Federal Reserve has had\na longstanding interest in these issues, but our work has taken on added significance\nsince the advent of the housing meltdown and recent financial crisis.\nMy direct involvement in mortgage and foreclosure issues began fairly recently when I\nbecame President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and sponsor of a Federal\nReserve Initiative called MORE, or the Mortgage Outreach and Research Effort. Prior to\nthat, I had worked with our Community Affairs staff as they partnered with community\norganizations across our District to address foreclosures issues.\nIn Chicago, one of our most successful partnerships has been with Neighborhood\nHousing Services of Chicago (NHS). Much of this work started in the late 1990s,\nculminating in a program called HOPI, the Homeownership Preservation Initiative, in\n2003. The NHS, with our support, has pioneered many techniques to combat the ill\neffects of foreclosures. The HOPI has been instrumental in saving hundreds of families\nfrom foreclosure, hosting loan modification and counseling events, completing HAMP\nmodifications for borrowers and creating strategies for reclaiming vacant properties.\nAs part of the MORE initiative, the Chicago Fed, together with Federal Reserve Banks\naround the country and the Board of Governors in Washington, is also addressing\nforeclosure mitigation and neighborhood stabilization efforts—through outreach,\nresearch and meetings with industry experts.\nPerhaps most important so far has been our work to bring resources to the hardest hit\ncities and regions of the country. Home buyer counseling, for example, is a critical need\nin certain areas. Under the MORE program, we’ve helped many of our community\ndevelopment partners organize day-long “mega events” that have served thousands of\ntroubled borrowers. Moreover, we’ve partnered with and brought together housing\nadvocates, lenders, academics, and key government officials to discuss foreclosure\nissues and develop solutions. In some cases, alliances have been formed right on the\nspot to create and implement programs to keep people in their homes.\n3\n\nThe MORE program also has included a partnership with the U.S Departments of Labor\nand the Treasury and the HOPE NOW Unemployment Taskforce to assist unemployed\nhome owners at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure. This collaboration led to the\ncreation of an online tool that allows homeowners and servicers to document\nunemployment insurance benefits as income to qualify for federally sponsored\nmortgage modification programs. In 2008, each Reserve Bank within the Federal\nReserve System created an online Foreclosure Resource Center. These websites\nprovide local constituents and consumers with easy access to information on\nforeclosure-related resources. Features of our Foreclosure Resource Center include an\nenhanced Foreclosure Mitigation Toolkit, which provides detailed steps and information\nfor localities seeking to develop foreclosure prevention activities of their own, and a new\nForeclosure Recovery Resource Guide, which seeks to assist consumers who have\ngone through the foreclosure process.\nA number of Federal Reserve research projects have been initiated as part of the\nMORE program. They include several studies focusing on foreclosure prevention,\nfinancial education and adverse neighborhood effects resulting from foreclosures.\nIn this latter category, Community Affairs researchers across the Federal Reserve\nSystem launched a study in 2009 of the planning and early implementation stages of\nthe federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program. The research team conducted a series\nof interviews with more than 90 recipients of HUD's NSP funds in the fall of 2009, they\nwill release a report based on these interviews and other data in late 2010. This report\nwill provide the first nationwide examination of the impact of the NSP.\nIn order to leverage the work of MORE and to make information available to\npractitioners in the field, we have been active in sponsoring several conferences. In\naddition to the conference held here today, the FRS and the FDIC are co-hosting a two-\nday conference this fall that will highlight policy-oriented research focused on the U.S.\nhousing and mortgage markets. The first day of the conference will be dedicated to\nmortgage foreclosures, including research on the current situation and outlook,\nneighborhood spillover effects, and evaluations of efforts to mitigate foreclosures. The\nsecond day of the conference will present research on the future of housing finance.\nAll of the initiatives I have described as part of our MORE program serve to help\nsupplement work being done on foreclosure prevention and neighborhood stabilization,\nboth locally and nationally. My hope is that all of you here today will draw upon this\ninformation and the success of the MORE program to explore new and creative ways to\naddress these important challenges. At the Fed, we will continue to do our part to\nencourage further research, participate in the dialogue, and coordinate concerned\ngroups that want to work toward sustainable housing markets.\nThank you.\n4",

    "text": "Wecloming Remarks\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nThirteenth Annual International Banking Conference\nChicago, Ill.\nSeptember 23, 2010\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nWelcoming Remarks\nThirteenth Annual International Banking Conference\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nGood morning. I'm Charlie Evans, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nChicago. It’s my pleasure to welcome you to the 13th Annual International Banking\nConference.\nOver the years, this conference has served as an important forum for the discussion of\ncurrent issues affecting global financial markets. Past conferences have emphasized\nsystemic risk, the globalization of financial markets, international regulatory structures,\nthe problems involved with the resolution of globally active banks and financial crises\nmanagement.\nWe have been fortunate to have leading scholars, regulators and industry executives\nparticipate over the years and provide their valuable perspectives on topical policy\nissues. Our co-sponsor this year is the International Monetary Fund (IMF). I want to take\nthis opportunity to offer a special note of thanks to our IMF colleagues for helping to\norganize what I believe is an impressive program addressing an important policy issue\nhere in the United States and around the world.\nThis year we examine the role of macroprudential regulation of financial markets.\nHistorically, financial supervision and regulation has taken a microprudential approach.\nThe typical assumption had been that the financial system as a whole could be made\nsafe by ensuring that individual firms were made safe. While there was widespread\nknowledge that markets and firms were interconnected—in fact, that was the root of\n“too-big-to-fail” concerns—that interconnectedness was not a driving force behind\nfinancial supervision and regulation. And though we have learned many things from the\nrecent financial crisis, nothing has been more important than understanding that the\nactions of individual firms can generate significant externalities that can adversely affect\ngeneral market conditions, other institutions and, ultimately, the overall economy.\nIndeed, this reality helped make clear the critical need to change the way we supervise\nand regulate financial firms and markets.\nWe have recently seen a number of changes within the regulatory environment to\naddress the shortcomings of the past supervisory model. Under the Supervisory Capital\nAssessment Program (SCAP), U.S. regulators tested the ability of the largest\ninstitutions to withstand adverse macroeconomic shocks and continue to maintain\naggregate system lending. The regulators’ stress tests had characteristics of both\nmicroprudential and macroprudential supervision, with a goal of enhancing system\nstability. The stress tests yielded many benefits—perhaps none more important than\nrestoring public confidence in the largest institutions’ ability to withstand future worse-\nthan-expected economic scenarios.\n2\n\nTogether with other regulators, the Federal Reserve has also been heavily involved in\nthe Basel III process, which includes major revisions to global capital standards and the\nintroduction of new quantitative liquidity standards. The Federal Reserve System is also\ndeveloping processes to better enable it to identify and address emerging risks,\nparticularly risks with systemic implications. This “quantitative surveillance mechanism”\n(QSM) will incorporate data from markets, individual firms, and supervisors, and it will\naccommodate the results of stress testing in the future.\nIn the United States, the role of macroprudential regulation has been elevated\nsignificantly with the recent passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act. The act represents a paradigm shift in the American financial\nregulatory environment: We are moving toward a new regulatory landscape with an\nemphasis on financial system stability.\nThe act introduces a Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of representation\nfrom the various financial regulatory agencies, with an explicit financial stability\nmandate. The council will be responsible for monitoring the financial system to identify\nsystemic risks and regulatory gaps. It will identify systemically important firms (both\nbank and nonbank institutions), and these will be subject to more stringent prudential\nstandards. The heightened standards will involve new liquidity and capital requirements,\nstress testing, prompt corrective action, and reporting requirements. If necessary, the\nselected firms may also be subject to contingent capital requirements, enhanced public\ndisclosures, short-term debt limits, and other prudential standards.\nFurthermore, the act requires additional regulation of certain payments, clearing, or\nsettlement systems deemed to be systemically important. All of these reforms are aimed\nat protecting the financial system as a whole instead of just the individual financial\ninstitutions.\nWhile the Dodd–Frank Act stresses the important role of macroprudential regulation, it\nleaves many of the implementation details to the regulatory agencies. The following\nquestions are left for them to answer:\n• What are the determinants and appropriate levels of capital required of\nsystemically important firms?\n• How should they vary over the business cycle?\n• Should contingent capital be required?\n• What instruments will qualify as contingent capital?\n• And what data is needed to allow adequate monitoring of the activities of\nsystemically important institutions?\nThese are just a few of the important questions that must be addressed within the new\nregulatory landscape. As we have seen during the recent global crisis, the\ninterconnectedness of financial markets goes beyond our domestic borders. It is\nobvious that we need to do a better job of identifying cross-border linkages and their\n3\n\nassociated risks. Greater coordination across regulatory frameworks could be\ntremendously helpful in this effort. We hope that forums like this one will aid in that\nprocess.\nAgain, I’m pleased to welcome you to Chicago. I look forward to the next two days of\nstimulating discussion about how we as a global financial community should proceed\nwith macroprudential regulation. I think you will find this conference both informative and\nuseful.\n4",

Clearly, higher prices of food and energy end up in the broadest measures\nof consumer price inflation, such as the Consumer Price Index.

Evans*\nAbstract\nThis paper examines the ability of a simple stylized general equilibrium model that\nincorporates nominal wage rigidity to explain the magnitude and persistence of the Great\nDepression in the United States. The impulses to our analysis are money supply shocks. The\nTaylor contracts model is surprisingly successful in accounting for the behavior of major\nmacroaggregates and real wages during the downturn phase of the Depression, i.e., from\n1929:3 through mid-1933. Our analysis provides support for the hypothesis that a monetary\ncontraction operating through a sticky wage channel played a significant role in accounting\nfor the downturn, and also provides an interesting refinement to this explanation. In\nparticular, both the absolute severity of the Depression’s downturn and its relative severity\ncompared to the 1920-21 recession are likely attributable to the price decline having a much\nlarger unanticipated component during the Depression, as well as less flexible wage-setting\npractices during this latter period. Another finding casts doubt on explanations for the\n1933-36 recovery that rely heavily on the substantial remonetization that began in 1933.\nKeywords: Dynamic General Equilibrium Model, Sticky Wages\n* Bordo is a professor of economics at Rutgers University and NBER fellow\n(bordo@rci.rutgers.edu), Erceg is a staff economist in the Division of International Finance of\nthe Federal Reserve Board (ercegc@frb.gov), and Evans is an assistant vice president and\neconomist in the Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n(cevans@frbchi.org).

    "text": "Opening Remarks\nPublic Policy Symposium on OTC Derivatives Clearing\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nPublic Policy Symposium on OTC Derivatives Clearing\nChicago, Ill.\nSeptember 3, 2010\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nOpening Remarks\nPublic Policy Symposium on OTC Derivatives Clearing\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nThank you, Ed. Good morning. On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, I\nwould like to thank you for joining us today at this Public Policy Symposium on OTC\nDerivatives Clearing. I’m delighted to be here to welcome you and provide some brief\ncomments that, I hope, will help frame the discussion of the important issues related to\nthe central clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.\nThe Chicago Fed has had a long-standing interest in clearing and settlement issues. In\nparticular, we have an obvious interest, since Chicago is home to the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange and its clearinghouse, The Options Clearing Corporation and ICE\nClear U.S. We are proud of our role in producing cutting edge research relating to\nclearing and settlement and facilitating dialogue among academics, policymakers and\nfinancial industry participants.\nIn 1996, we co-sponsored a conference on derivatives and public policy at which the\nNobel laureate Merton Miller explored the competitive boundary between exchange-\ntraded and over-the-counter derivatives and the impact of new technologies that were\nthen changing the financial landscape. Miller recognized even then how clearing and\nsettlement functions were central to the operation of financial markets.\nMany of you will no doubt recall that we co-sponsored a conference on central\ncounterparty clearing with the European Central Bank in 2006. That event, like today’s,\nbrought together industry leaders, policymakers and academics in a multidisciplinary\ndiscussion of key legal, risk-management and public policy issues relating to central\ncounterparty clearing. In addition, the Chicago Fed has actively participated in the\nongoing work of the OTC Derivatives Regulators’ Forum since its formation in 2009.\nWe recently experienced the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. As we emerge\nslowly from that crisis, we have become engaged in a vigorous debate on how best to\naddress the major weaknesses in our financial regulatory framework—and the issue of\ncentralized clearing of derivatives has taken a prominent role. As you all know, the\nDodd-Frank bill seeks to address these weaknesses and put forward a structure that will\nhelp prevent another crisis of this magnitude.\nNotwithstanding the amount of work that has already been completed, making financial\nreform work will not be easy. We face complex problems that will require a\ncomprehensive, multipronged approach. But make no mistake; reform is critical for\nensuring our long-term economic and financial stability. And much of that reform will\naddress the implications of the increasing interconnectedness of the global payment,\n2\n\nclearing and settlement infrastructure that supports financial market operations today. In\na 2008 report titled The Interdependencies of Payment and Settlement Systems, the\nCommittee on Payment and Settlement Systems said:\nThe development of tighter interdependencies has helped to strengthen\nthe global payment and settlement infrastructure by reducing several\nsources of cost and risk. Yet, tightening interdependencies have also\nincreased the potential for disruptions to spread quickly and widely across\nmultiple systems and markets.i\nThe clearing of derivatives through central counterparties, or CCPs, is one important\nmanifestation of the interdependencies in the financial system. CCPs interpose\nthemselves between the counterparties to financial contracts by becoming the common\nbuyer to each seller and the seller to each buyer. The centralization of clearing functions\nat the clearinghouse has obvious benefits, including multilateral netting and the\ncentralization of the information needed to manage risk exposures in a robust manner.\nHowever, policymakers also recognize that central clearing concentrates risk and\nresponsibility for risk management in the CCP.\nThis means the clearinghouse itself becomes a potential single point of failure.\nAccordingly, adequate capital, good risk management and prudential oversight are\nessential for such clearing facilities. The events of the recent financial crisis have\ncertainly reinforced our recognition of the importance of these post-trade institutions.\nAs you know, the central clearing of over-the-counter derivatives is a core feature of the\nlegislation recently enacted to reform financial market regulation—a development that\nhas important implications for market structure. Interest in this topic isn’t merely local or\neven national—in fact, it’s global, as is evident from the attendance at this event.\nToday’s symposium has brought together leaders from industry, the policy and\nregulatory communities and academia from around the world to have an open and frank\ndiscussion on issues related to central counterparty clearing. Four questions will\ndominate the discussion:\n• Who should own and control a central counterparty?\n• Who should participate in central clearing?\n• What is the appropriate capital structure for a central counterparty?\n• What should the market structure look like?\nThese are all difficult questions. I doubt that a consensus will be reached quickly on all\nof the relevant issues. But it is important for us to understand each parties’ perspective\nand to consider the costs and benefits of the policies that are being implemented for the\nregulation of these markets. Good policymaking depends upon this interaction.\nThis symposium has been organized to take full advantage of the collective wisdom and\nbody of expertise that exists in this room. The panelists’ remarks are designed to initiate\nthe discussion of each set of topics and then open the discussion to all. Thank you all\n3\n\nfor coming. I look forward to a good discussion and further debate on the importance of\nOTC derivatives clearing and settlement.\ni Bank for International Settlements, Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, 2008, The Interdependencies\nof Payment and Settlement Systems, Basel, Switzerland, June, p. 1.\n4",

    "text": "A Perspective on the Future of U.S. Monetary Policy\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nThe Future of Monetary Policy\nBank of France Conference\nRome, Italy\nOctober 1, 2010\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nA Perspective on the Future of U.S. Monetary Policy\nBank of France Conference\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nThank you for that kind introduction. It’s a great pleasure to be here. Over the past three\nyears, we have been dealing with a crisis that has reverberated around the world,\ninflicting severe damage to financial markets and economies. The response of\npolicymakers in the U.S. and elsewhere was swift and unprecedented in its scope and\nmagnitude. It was also well coordinated across the community of central banks. We set\nup swap lines to ease liquidity strains throughout the world and lowered target rates\njointly at the height of the crisis. Such coordinated action was very helpful in stabilizing\nthe global financial system.\nToday, as we progress with economic recovery, policymakers in all countries are faced\nwith a new set of challenges and issues. Recognizing that they face a distinct set of\nchallenges, I look forward to hearing my co-panelists discuss the issues facing\nEuropean policymakers as they deliberate the future of monetary policy. For my part, I\nwould like to give you my perspective on some of the issues we face in the U.S. Before I\nproceed further, let me stress that I will be sharing my personal views with you, and not\nnecessarily offering the views of my colleagues on the FOMC, or the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nThe U.S. was the epicenter of the financial crisis and the deep recession that followed.\nThe decline in our economic activity and the damage to financial markets in the past\nthree years are a reflection of the magnitude of the shock. Over the course of the\nrecession, U.S. real GDP declined by more than 4 percent, over 8 million jobs were lost,\nthe unemployment rate doubled within two years and the household sector – which\naccounts for the lion’s share of the U.S. economy – lost more than $13 trillion in wealth.\nOver the past year, however, we’ve seen significant improvements. Financial markets\nhave stabilized and have progressed toward full repair. Aided by accommodative\nmonetary policy, fiscal stimulus and improvements in financial markets, real GDP has\nrecorded four quarters of positive growth and employment has begun to rise. However,\ngiven the depth of the recession, we still have a long road ahead before we catch up to\nthe level of activity we would have achieved in the absence of the crisis, or any other\nshock. Moreover, we appear to have lost some of our forward momentum in recent\nmonths. Real GDP growth slowed markedly from an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the\nfirst quarter to 1.6 percent in the second quarter. More recent data suggest that growth\nin the second half of the year will be similarly weak – and softer than what I had\nexpected just a few months ago. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation\n2\n\nhave fallen to very low levels -- levels that are below the 2 percent level that I, and most\nFed policymakers, consider to be consistent with effective price stability.\nLooking ahead, I expect output growth will strengthen in 2011 and 2012. Nonetheless,\nthe pace of growth I currently anticipate is quite moderate given the severity of the\nrecession we experienced and the potential growth rate of output. As a result, I expect\nthe unemployment rate to remain well above its pre-crisis level over the next two to\nthree years. Given the current and the anticipated future level of resource slack and\nsubdued long-term inflation expectations, I also expect inflation to remain below\ndesirable levels over any reasonable forecast horizon.\nWith such an outlook for the economy, as a macroeconomist and policymaker, I think\nwe face two key issues in the near and medium term. First, to what extent do structural\nfactors explain the very high unemployment rate we currently have? Some have\nsuggested that the financial crisis and the accompanying recession precipitated a\nseismic shift in the structure of labor markets, raising the natural rate of unemployment\nsignificantly above its pre-crisis level. If, as they suggest, labor market frictions rose\ndramatically over the past two years, then monetary policy is not the appropriate tool to\naddress the ramifications of such a change. If, on the other hand, structural factors can\nonly explain a modest part of the rapid rise in the unemployment rate, and aggregate\ndemand deficiencies account for remainder, then monetary policy may be able to play a\nconstructive role.\nThis brings me to the second key issue facing policymakers. If further monetary policy\naccommodation is desirable, what is the appropriate policy action when short-term\ninterest rates are already at zero? Has extreme risk aversion by businesses and\nconsumers put us in what can be described as a liquidity trap? And if so, what can we\ndo about it?\nLet me first elaborate on the unsatisfactory progress in employment gains, and what it\nimplies for monetary policy. There are several reasons to think that the natural rate of\nunemployment has risen over the last couple of years. It is possible that the extension\nof unemployment insurance benefits during the recession, while cushioning unemployed\nworkers from the adverse effects of lost income, might have reduced some workers’ job\nsearch intensity, or kept others from leaving the labor force. To the extent that such\nincentives are present, the natural rate of unemployment would increase while the\nextended benefits are in effect. However, reasonable estimates of the effect of the\nextension of unemployment benefits range one-half to one percentage points – far from\nsufficient to explain the nearly 5 percentage point increase over the past two years.\nMoreover, given the current schedule for the expiration of these benefits, the resulting\nincrease in the natural unemployment rate will fade away over the next two years –\nleaving us still with an unsatisfactorily high rate of unemployment at the end of my\nforecast horizon.\nIt is also possible that the shocks that reverberated through the economy created a\nmismatch between the skills sought by employers and the skills the unemployed\n3\n\nworkers have. For instance, it is conceivable that the recession affected the different\nregions and sectors of the economy unevenly. Moreover, the recession may have\nsevered an unusually large number of long-term employment relationships, making for\nan especially difficult transition for affected workers. The unusually long spells of\nunemployment experienced during the recent recession and potential erosion of skills\nduring that time are additional factors that might have magnified labor market frictions.\nThe sharp decline in home values and tight credit conditions might have reduced the\nability of unemployed workers to sell their homes and move to regions where jobs are\navailable. Taken together, these developments might have eroded the efficiency of\nmatching between workers and jobs, and raised the natural rate of unemployment.1\nThe key question is: Are these possible structural changes in the labor market sufficient\nto explain the current unemployment rate? The Beveridge curve that describes the\nrelationship between the unemployment rate and the job vacancy rate is a useful tool for\naddressing this question. The unemployment-vacancy relationship through the end of\n2009 is captured very well by a simple, stable Beveridge curve and a constant-returns\nCobb-Douglas matching function. So, the relationship between job openings and\nunemployment through the end of 2009 has been relatively stable, and does not\nsuggest a dramatic increase in labor market frictions. It is only recently that we have\nseen an improvement in job openings that was not matched by a correspondingly large\nreduction in unemployment. Based on these data, some have suggested that most of\nthe increase in the unemployment rate over the past two years is due to skills mismatch.\nHowever, it seems likely that much of the apparent conflict between unemployment and\nvacancy data may be purely an issue of timing. At this stage of an economic recovery, it\nis not unusual for the vacancy rate to increase ahead of reductions in the\nunemployment rate – we have often seen such loops in the Beveridge curve at the end\nof past recessions.\nBut even if we take the job openings data at face value, it doesn’t suggest an increase\nin the natural rate to anything like the current rate of unemployment, which stands at 9.6\npercent. Making some plausible assumptions, my staff estimates that the typical level of\nunemployment associated with a stable Beveridge curve passing through the recent\ndata is likely to be about 7 percent. This includes the effects of increased\nunemployment insurance benefits that I already discussed.2\nI am not suggesting that 7 percent is a good estimate of the current natural rate. As I\nsaid, there are reasons to discount some of the recent improvement in the vacancy\ndata. Rather, I want to point to out that, even if one takes the vacancy data at face value\nand accepts that the natural rate has risen to 7 percent, we are still left with a very large\n1 See Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) for a review of aggregate matching functions in labor markets and\nthe related literature.\n2 As I noted before, unless unemployment insurance benefits and the Emergency Unemployment\nCompensation program are extended further, they are scheduled to expire in 2011, at which point any\nimpact they had on the natural rate of unemployment will begin to fade away.\n4\n\namount of slack relative to the current rate of unemployment and the rate most analysts\nexpect to see at the end of 2012.3\nThe size of the unemployment gap, combined with the fact that inflation has been\nrunning below the level I consider consistent with long-term price stability, suggests that\nit would be desirable to increase monetary policy accommodation to boost aggregate\ndemand and achieve our dual mandate .\nShould the FOMC judge that further monetary policy accommodation is appropriate\nbased on our economic outlook, what is the optimal level of additional accommodation\nand what policy tools should be employed to deliver the additional stimulus?\nDuring a typical period of policy accommodation, the answers to these questions would\nbe straightforward. The FOMC would lower the target federal funds rate based on our\neconomic outlook and the historical relationship between policy actions and their impact\non the economy. For instance, were the current fed funds rate at 3 percent, my forecast\nwould call for a substantial decline in the target rate. Such a reduction in the nominal fed\nfunds rate would be consistent with several versions of the Taylor rule, which would call\nfor negative interest rates.4 However, at roughly zero, the fed funds rate is as low as it\ncan go.\nAs a result, the current economic environment poses unusual challenges to\npolicymakers. In assessing the current state of the economy and considering the\noptimal policy response, a key issue that concerns me is the possibility that we might be\nin a liquidity trap.\nAs I assess the incoming data and talk to my business contacts, I see that executives\nare very cautious in their outlook and spending plans. They appear to be content to post\nstrong profits generated by unprecedented cost-cutting, rather than growing their top-\nline revenues by expanding capital investments and hiring. Very conservative attitudes\nreign and cash is still king – even after the improvements in financial markets and\nstrong bond issuance by businesses. Firms are sitting on the cash generated by profits\nand funds raised in capital markets. Very few are planning to grow their workforce.\nAlthough some contacts point to uncertainties raised by regulatory actions and\ngovernment policies to explain their reluctance to invest, most admit that they would\nincrease spending if stronger demand conditions prevailed.\n3 There are other challenges for the view that the increase in the unemployment rate over the past two\nyears reflects primarily structural factors: the dearth of sectors reporting strong demand for hard-to-find\nskilled workers; the lack of inflation pressures that we would expect to observe if the natural rate were\nhigher and resource slack were smaller; and the unusually low quit rates and job-to-job transitions during\nthe recession that are indicative of weak labor markets (De Wolfe and Klemmer, 2010; unpublished\nupdates of the employment-to-employment transitions in Fallick and Fleischman, 2004).\n4 For instance, the guideline suggested by Taylor (1999) would call for the federal funds rate to be\nnegative 3.5 percent given the current CBO output gap of negative 6 percent and core CPI inflation rate\nof 1 percent, assuming that the FOMC considers 2 percent inflation to be consistent with price stability.\nThe guideline outlined in Taylor (1993), which puts a smaller weight on the current output gap, would\nsuggest that the federal funds rate target should be negative 0.5 percent.\n5\n\nHouseholds are similarly cautious and gun-shy in their spending. Given the millions of\njobs lost during the recession, the job insecurity faced by those employed, trillions of\ndollars in lost wealth and the balance-sheet repair that households have undertaken,\nconsumers are displaying significant risk aversion. They have raised their savings rate,\neven though those savings earn very little interest income.\nThese are the classic symptoms associated with a liquidity trap: the supply of savings\nthat outstrip the demand for investment even when short-term nominal rates are at zero.\nThe modern economic theory of liquidity traps indicates that the optimal policy response\nat zero-bound is to lower the real interest rate, almost surely by employing\nunconventional policy tools. Theory also indicates that, in the absence of such policy\nstimulus, the factors that generate high risk aversion could very well stifle a meaningful\nrecovery, keep unemployment high and reinforce disinflationary pressures – clearly an\nundesirable equilibrium.\nSo, in the coming weeks and months, as I assess the incoming data, update my\nforecast and deliberate on the best monetary policy approach, I will be pondering two\nkey issues: How much more should monetary policy do to reduce the shortfalls in\nmeeting our dual mandate responsibilities for employment and price stability; and what\ntools should we use?

    "text": "Panel Comments for the\nBank of Korea International Conference 2010\nRemarks for the\nBank of Korea International Conference 2010\nJune 1, 2010\nSeoul, Korea\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK\nOF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nPanel Comments for the\nBank of Korea International Conference 2010\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve is charged with promoting financial\nconditions that provide for maximum employment and price stability. During normal\ntimes, when small to moderate adjustments in policy are appropriate, our primary policy\ntool has been a market interest rate, the federal funds rate. Indeed, to address just\nabout all of the deviations of employment and inflation from their goal values, a policy of\nadjusting the short-term market rate—though sometimes by hundreds of basis points—\nhas been sufficient. Of course, in the nearly three years that I have been Chicago Fed\npresident, economic and financial fluctuations have been far from typical. Today, I\nwould like to comment on monetary policy strategies for responding to unusually large\nrisk-events.\nCentral banks must always be on guard against risks that are relatively rare, but have\npotentially large and disruptive effects. Or, to put it another way: Central banks must\nalways monitor economic conditions for potentially large disruptions in the economic\ninfrastructure. Such disruptions might lead to structural impediments to previously\n2\n\nsustainable growth rates, long periods of disinflation, or stagflationary conditions, to\nname just a few possible negative outcomes. In my discussion, I will take it for granted\nthat inflation scares and loss of central bank credibility must be included on this list of\ninfrastructure disruptions.1\nOne major disruption occurred in the 1970s when the Federal Reserve arguably did not\nappreciate the persistence of the productivity slowdown and monetary policy\nunintentionally generated destructive inflationary pressures.2\nOther disruptions have been associated with financial crises. I think of the problem\nposed by these in the following way. At some point in time, circumstances arise that\ncreate large real losses for investors, businesses, and households. These losses are\nreal in the sense that now the current and future production possibility set is smaller or\nconsumption possibilities are more limited. Just to be completely clear, production\npossibilities may be smaller if everyone’s previous assessments are shown to be\nexaggerated. And lower expected consumption follows naturally from any decline in\npermanent income and wealth. For a central bank, with no ability to eliminate these\nunderlying real losses, the challenges in assessing the situation are threefold:\n1. Will these real losses increase further? How much of the losses are\nalready in train and when will they end?\n1 See Marvin Goodfriend, 1993, “Interest rate policy and the inflation scare problem: 1979–1992,” Economic\nQuarterly, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Vol. 79, No. 1, Winter, pp. 1–23.\n2 See Athanasios Orphanides, 2002, “Monetary policy rules and the Great Inflation,” American Economic Review,\nVol. 92, No. 2, May, pp. 115–120.\n3\n\n2. Will leverage and zero-sum hedging activities result in concentrations of\ndistress that disrupt systemically important financial intermediation?\n3. Will these losses and collateral financial consequences negatively impair\nthe economy’s infrastructure, capital stock, and labor force in ways that\namplify the effects?\nI think it is safe to say that we have yet to develop realistic macroeconomic models\nincorporating a rich enough array of financial markets and frictions to provide definitive\npolicy analysis.3 But the history of central banking and most monetary analyses suggest\nto me the following policy directions to address these three challenges. First, when an\neconomy has accumulated real losses that limit production and consumption\npossibilities, a central bank cannot eliminate those primary losses with its access to the\nprinting press, even if it is a twenty-first-century printing press.4 Second, however, well-\ndesigned lending facilities may be able to mitigate amplification and knock-on effects\nassociated with wholesale increases in the risk aversion of private liquidity-providers. In\nthis way, these programs may limit the effects of these losses on unaware agents and\ncollateral economic sectors. Third, limiting the effects of increased perceptions of\nliquidity risks may avoid additional destruction of economic infrastructure. However, an\n3 See Charles L. Evans, 2008, “Challenges that the recent financial market turmoil places on our macroeconomic\ntoolkit,” speech by Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President and Chief Executive Officer at the Swiss National\nBank Research Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 19.\n4 Here I have in mind innovative approaches that channel liquidity to markets for newer financial products. The\nTerm Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is one example, which directed liquidity to the market for asset-\nbacked securities. That being said, in another way there is little “new” about this avenue for money creation—\nliquidity injected through programs like the TALF will still show up on the liability side of the central bank’s balance\nsheet as an increase in high-powered money.\n4\n\nimportant caveat is that central bank actions must strike a balance between reasonable\nrepair and unreasonable liquidity expansions that misdirect activities into unproductive\nareas, create larger incentive problems, or ultimately fuel inflation scares.\nIt is easy to describe this balancing act, but difficult to draw bright lines. Nevertheless, in\nmy judgment, there can be substantial scope for central bank action in the face of a\nfinancial crisis. Here are a few examples.\nIn the U.S. in the early 1930s, there was a string of bank failures that the Fed failed to\ncontain. These hobbled the real economy in a period when firms were heavily\ndependent on bank lending. Moreover, the effective destruction of bank expertise in\nunderwriting loans and originating credit increased the real cost of credit intermediation,\nadding to the length and severity of the depression.5 During the recent episode, we also\nsaw something akin to a series of runs—liquidity runs—that multiplied the impact of the\ninitial losses. This time the liquidity runs were not on standard commercial banks.\nInstead they were on institutions in the “shadow” banking system, especially those that\nsupport securitization. This was of great concern because in the U.S., securitization\nplays a critical role in the ultimate provision of credit to households and nonfinancial\nbusinesses.\nThis time, the Fed responded aggressively. We eased access to our ordinary discount\nwindow. In a departure from normal practice, the Fed made loans available to financial\n5 See Ben S. Bernanke, 1983, “Nonmonetary effects of the financial crisis in the propagation of the Great\nDepression,” American Economic Review, Vol. 73, No. 3, June, pp. 257–276.\n5\n\ninstitutions other than commercial banks. Our programs also supported money market\nfunds and the commercial paper market. And in an effort to revive lending that had been\ndependent on securitization, we cooperated with the Treasury to lend to purchasers of\nasset-backed securities.\nIn 2008, the Federal Reserve also cooperated with many foreign central banks to help\naddress liquidity strains. Institutions in other countries also had financed asset\npurchases—many of them U.S. based—with short-term dollar-denominated borrowing.\nSome of the same spillovers that had affected U.S. credit markets also pressured these\nforeign financial firms and put further demands on dollar liquidity in U.S. markets, with\npossible negative consequences for our economy. Accordingly, the Fed set up dollar-\nswap facilities with foreign central banks.\nThe Federal Reserve recently reopened these swap lines. This step seems prudent as\nthe dramatic repricing of the sovereign credit risk of some peripheral European\ncountries has the potential to create dollar funding pressures in world markets. As we\ndid earlier, the Federal Reserve today offers dollars in exchange for foreign currency\ncollateral—at a fixed exchange rate and a penalty rate. In this way foreign central banks\ncan extend dollar liquidity support to creditworthy financial institutions facing temporary\nliquidity strains in foreign credit markets.\n6\n\nWith respect to many of our lending programs, some have described our actions as\ntaking the place of the private sector while the private sector was incapacitated. In fact,\nit was a partial and incomplete step in that direction. The central bank’s difficult job is to\nprovide liquidity, without taking on undue credit risk. So, we never went as far as\noffering funding on the same terms that private institutions previously did in credit\nmarkets. Believe me, I heard that often and repeatedly from some of my financial sector\ncontacts! We lent only against higher-quality assets and priced our loans and haircut\ncollateral at what in normal circumstances would have been hefty penalty rates. The\nexceptions to this were the special assistance offered to specific institutions during the\nBear Sterns demise and AIG assistance. In these cases, taking on some credit risk was\na necessary cost of preventing further intensification of the financial crisis.\nMy time is running short, but I would like to make just some quick comments on\nquantitative easing. While the liquidity support we provided the economy was very\nhelpful, it was clearly not enough. Given the huge resource gaps, and low and declining\ninflation, more monetary accommodation was appropriate. Under any version of the\nTaylor Rule, the funds rate should have been quite negative during the darkest period of\nthe recession. But policy was constrained by the zero-bound on interest rates. So we\nincreased accommodation by turning to large-scale purchases of long-term assets. We\nultimately purchased $1.7 trillion of GSE debt, MBS, and long-term Treasuries. The idea\nwas that significant purchases of these assets would lower term risk premia through a\nportfolio balance effect. In addition, in the case of MBS, our purchases likely lowered\nliquidity premia.\n7\n\nI think the jury is still out on exactly how much additional monetary accommodation\nthese purchases have provided. By some empirical estimates, these purchases\ndecreased term premia on long-term assets somewhere in the 30 to 100 basis point\nrange.6 Although even the smallest effect would be helpful to the economy, I suspect\nthe larger beneficial effects were nonlinear. Back in March 2009, every business contact\nI spoke with was extremely concerned that the downward spiral might turn into a\ncomplete financial meltdown. It may be easy to dismiss that concern today—ex post,\nsort of like surviving a cancer scare or a sharp pain in your chest—but it was a very real\nrisk at that time. And I think that by announcing unprecedented monetary policy actions\nduring this time, in conjunction with substantial fiscal stimulus, that everyone understood\ntoday’s twenty-first-century public policymakers were committed to doing everything in\ntheir power to avoid the worst-case events that befell the U.S. economy in the 1930s.\nMy time has undoubtedly expired. So I’ll save any further commentary on exit strategies\nto the general panel discussion.\n6 See Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack, 2010, “Large-scale asset purchases by the\nFederal Reserve: Did they work?,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, staff report, No. 441, March. Gagnon et al.\n(2010) conclude, “The overall size of the reduction in 10-year term premium appears to be between 30 and 100\nbasis points, with most estimates in the lower and middle third of this range.”\n8",

    "text": "Some Thoughts on the Current Economic Situation\nRemarks for the\nUniversity Club of Chicago\nJune 8, 2010\nChicago, IL\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK\nOF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nUniversity Club of Chicago\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nThank you, Madlyn, for that kind introduction and very warm welcome. I'd also like to\nextend a special thank you to Greg O'Leary for helping to arrange my visit to the\nUniversity Club and the Civic Affairs Society Breakfast Forum. I'm especially pleased to\nbe here this morning to explain what I see happening in the economy and express my\nviews on some of the key issues we face today. Over the past couple of years I have\nbeen asked many times to speak about the Federal Reserve’s role in addressing the\nfinancial crisis. Usually, at the end of the talk, when I open the floor for discussion, I find\nmyself being asked the same sorts of questions over and over again. So I’d like to\naddress some of those questions in my remarks today and then give you an opportunity\nto follow up with questions of your own.\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s begin with the question I hear most often: What are the prospects for the\neconomy?\n2\n\nIn short, the economy is recovering from the recession, and I am optimistic that it will\ncontinue to do so. My forecast is that real gross domestic product (GDP) will grow about\n3-1/2 percent this year. In fact, we have been hearing many more upbeat business\nreports over the past several months, and have nudged up our outlook accordingly.\nThat said, we still need to experience a good deal of growth before we return to the\nmore normal pace of economic activity and levels of unemployment that we enjoyed in\nlate 2007. And the 3-1/2 percent pace of growth I anticipate is quite moderate given the\nseverity of the recession. To offer some perspective, in the first year and a half following\nthe deep 1981 to 1982 recession, growth averaged nearly 8 percent.\nLet me give you some of the details underlying this assessment of the economy.\nFirst, consider the recent GDP numbers, which measure the value of all of the goods\nand services produced in the economy. GDP fell sharply—3.7 percent all told—during\n2008 and the first half of 2009. But GDP has increased in each of the past three\nquarters, with growth averaging a 3.6 percent annual rate.\nWhere did this growth come from? Some of it reflected the federal government stimulus\npackage passed in 2009. This raised economic activity a good deal in the second half of\nlast year, and should be a continued solid boost to spending through much of 2010.\n3\n\nBut government stimulus is hardly the whole story. Unmistakably, private spending has\nbeen reviving. One area is inventory investment by businesses. During the recession,\nfirms aggressively cut inventories to very lean levels. By avoiding an overhang of\nexcess stocks, they are now increasing orders for newly produced goods to meet\nincoming demand—and we’ve seen manufacturing production increase accordingly. We\nhave also seen an increase in business spending on capital equipment, most notably on\nhigh-tech items, as firms replace and upgrade their IT systems and other equipment in\norder to maintain competiveness and profitability.\nConsumers also have increased spending. Job worries and losses in household wealth\nhad caused consumers to cut back on spending appreciably during the recession. But\nthey have now begun to reopen their pocketbooks. During the first quarter of 2010 total\npersonal consumption expenditures increased at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate.\nSignificantly, these increases were distributed across many different types of goods and\nservices. Even in the hard-hit automobile sector, sales have averaged over 11 million\nunits annual rate so far this year—up over 17 percent from a year ago, though still well\nbelow the pace of 16.6 million units that prevailed before the recession.\nIn contrast, housing continues to struggle. During the second half of 2009, both sales\nand new construction lifted off from the recession low points seen around the turn of last\nyear. But sales fell back after the expiration last November of the first round of tax\ncredits for first-time home buyers, before receiving another boost this spring, as buyers\nrushed to beat the end-of-April expiration date for the extension of the home buyer tax\n4\n\ncredits. The increase in housing starts also stalled later in 2009 before showing some\nmodest renewal during the past several months. Still, the rates of sales and starts are\nfar below historical norms. Fundamentally, supply conditions continue to weigh on real\nestate markets, and they could for some time as foreclosures add to the overhang of\nunsold homes. But with the improving economy, low mortgage rates, and more\nattractively priced homes, housing market conditions will get better as we move further\ninto the expansion.\nWhat about labor markets? In general, many measures of economic activity show\nimprovement early in a recovery well before the jobs picture starts to get better. This\nwas especially true following the two previous recessions. I am concerned that this may\nbe the case during this expansion as well. As the economy entered the most recent\nrecession, businesses quickly cut their work forces. And even as the economy grew\nduring the second half of 2009, job destruction outpaced the extremely low levels of\nhiring.\nMore recently, there has been a modest improvement in the jobs picture. Over the first\nfive months of the year, excluding temporary hiring for the U.S. Census, on average\nabout 86,000 jobs per month were added to the economy. Last Friday's data were\ndisappointing, but they are only one month's numbers.\nBusinesses are being cautious about adding permanent staffing. They continue to strive\nto produce more with fewer people. But they can increase output for only so long\n5\n\nwithout adding to payrolls. As the recovery progresses and businesses become more\nconfident in the future, employment will increase on a more consistently solid basis.\nIndeed, there are signals that we currently are near such a turning point. There is the\nmodest pickup in the jobs numbers I just noted. Underlying those recent employment\nnumbers, layoffs are down substantially. Some of those businesses that cut\nemployment most aggressively at the beginning of the recession have begun to rehire.\nAnd others that are taking a more wait-and-see attitude are hiring temporary workers to\nfill their staffing needs. In fact, temporary worker employment has increased solidly in\neach of the past eight months.\nNonetheless, even after more solid employment gains materialize, unemployment may\nremain stubbornly high. Discouraged workers will resume searching for jobs, adding to\nthe number of those already looking for work. In addition, the number of long-term\nunemployed is extremely high, and such workers typically have a more difficult time\nfinding a job. Consequently, the outlook for these workers is challenged. So I anticipate\nthat the rate and length of unemployment will improve relatively slowly.\nWith consumer spending accounting for roughly two-thirds of GDP, the economic forces\nat work here are key factors underlying the moderate projections for overall growth.\nHouseholds entered this recession with high net worth but also with low levels of\nsavings and high levels of debt. When faced with a temporary loss of income,\nhouseholds can maintain spending only by drawing down assets, borrowing more, or\n6\n\nreducing savings. But as the recession took hold, households faced mounting job\nlosses, stark reductions in the value of their housing and equity assets, and little in the\nway of liquid savings. So it is little wonder that consumers sharply retrenched on\nspending.\nThe need for households to repair their balance sheets will moderate growth in\nconsumer spending going forward. In addition, we are seeing reduced availability of\nhousehold credit. And, importantly, muted gains in employment will hold back growth in\nwages and salaries. All of these factors contribute to an outlook for relatively modest\ngrowth in consumer spending, which, in turn, restrains the forecast for overall GDP\ngrowth.\nIn addition to consumer lending, the availability of bank credit remains a significant\nheadwind for many small- and medium-sized companies. Both supply and demand\nconsiderations are at work here. Some of the decline in bank lending last year reflects\nweak demand for loans by businesses wary of taking on new debt burdens in an\nuncertain economic environment. But at least some of the reduced lending arises from\nbanks’ tighter lending standards. These tighter standards appear to reflect concerns of\nbanks about their own capital levels and also the credit quality of borrowers. More\ngenerally, credit flows are being reduced because both borrowers and lenders are still\ndealing with losses from the recession, especially the busts in residential and\ncommercial real estate. I expect banking conditions to improve and better support\ngrowth, but this is likely to take some time.\n7\n\nWhile I’ve mentioned a number of factors that we think will dampen growth, we could be\nsurprised on the upside. Increases in confidence could turn into higher spending sooner\nthan we now think. And productivity growth has remained strong. Technology continues\nto advance, and firms continue to create new products and find new ways to produce\nmore efficiently. These factors will lead to higher incomes in the longer term. And even\nover the shorter term, the higher profits and incomes generated by productivity can help\nrestructure balance sheets and support spending.\nWell, that was a long answer to a short question. The second question I’m often asked\nis a two-parter concerning inflation. The first part is: Isn’t inflation about to explode? The\nsecond part is: Are you concerned about deflation? The answer is no in both cases: I\nthink inflation will remain relatively stable.\nBoth camps have clear arguments. The current low rates of resource utilization strongly\npoint to lower inflation. At 9.7 percent, the unemployment rate is quite high. Similarly,\nmanufacturing capacity utilization is quite low. Such resource slack reduces cost\npressures and makes firms less able to push through price increases. These factors\nhave contributed significantly to lower inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of core\ninflation—the deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, excluding food\nand energy—has fallen from 2.7 percent in August 2008 to 1.2 percent in April 2010.\nThat is a large decline for a relatively stable data series.\n8\n\nThose who press me on higher inflation point to the Fed’s accommodative policy and\nexpanded balance sheet. We all know that too much money chasing too few goods\neventually will generate inflation. But, currently, most of the funds used to increase our\nbalance sheet are sitting idly in bank reserves. And because banks are not lending\nthose reserves, they are not yet generating spending pressure. But, of course, leaving\nthe current highly accommodative monetary policy in place for too long would eventually\nfuel such inflationary pressures.\nWith core inflation at 1-1/4 percent, I see the opposing forces of resource gaps and\naccommodative monetary policy as roughly balancing out over the medium term. As\nresource slack abates in a recovering economy, I expect inflation to move up to about 1-\n3/4 percent by 2012.\nWhat does all of this mean for monetary policy? Currently, policy is, appropriately, very\naccommodative. But, eventually, we will have to return to a more normal stance.\nJudging the appropriate timing and pace for reducing accommodation poses a\nsignificant challenge for policymakers over the next couple years. On the one hand,\nremoving too much accommodation prematurely could inhibit the recovery. On the other\nhand, as I noted, if the Fed leaves the current level of accommodation in place too long,\ninflationary pressures will eventually build. The Fed’s decisions will be based on careful\nmonitoring of business activity and keeping an alert eye out for signs of changes in the\ninflation outlook. In addition, the FOMC is making sure that it has the technical tools it\nwill need when it decides to reduce monetary accommodation. Overall, I am confident\n9\n\nthat monetary policy will both support economic growth and bring and keep inflation\nnear my guideline of 2 percent over the medium term.\nAs you can imagine, the crisis and recession have kept us busy. And we are constantly\nalert to issues that may cause us to reassess our outlook. With this in mind, I’d like to\naddress a question that I have been asked a lot lately: How will recent events in Europe\naffect the U.S. economy?\nThere are a few channels through which the European sovereign debt problems could\ninfluence us here. European efforts to lower debt will likely weigh on their economic\ngrowth over the medium term. This will translate into less demand by Europeans for\nU.S. products. In addition, the dollar already has appreciated relative to the euro. This\nmeans that European consumers find our products to be relatively more expensive than\nbefore. At the same time, prices for European goods in terms of the dollar have fallen,\nboosting our demand for European imports. All of these channels work in the direction\nof lowering U.S. net exports, which, all else being equal, would tend to reduce the\noutlook for U.S. GDP growth.\nHowever, a couple of factors suggest that these trade effects of the European fiscal\nsituation on the U.S. economy are likely to be limited. Although the euro-11 economy is\nlarge, it represents only about 15 percent of U.S. exports. In comparison, our single\nlargest trading partner, Canada, accounted for over 19 percent of domestic exports last\nyear. And while the dollar has appreciated almost 18 percent relative to the euro since\n10\n\nlate November, the broad dollar exchange rate that is a trade-weighted average across\nall currencies has appreciated only 5.1 percent over the same period.\nNonetheless, if events in Europe evolve so that they have a more severe and broad\nimpact on financial markets, then the scope of the problems for the U.S. could be\nmagnified. Fortunately, our direct exposure to European debt is limited. But an\nintensification of liquidity or solvency problems in Europe and some related spillover\nlosses in U.S. markets could cause a marked increase in investor risk aversion. More\nlenders could pull back on intermediation, restricting the flow of credit to fund worthy\nspending projects of U.S. firms and households.\nTo date, though, this doesn’t seem to have occurred. Notably, the spreads between\nriskier and safer assets have risen some, but they are still nothing at all like the spreads\nwe observed during the height of the financial panic. But this is a risk to monitor\ncarefully.\nIndeed, recognizing the importance of providing liquidity to stressed financial markets,\nthe Fed recently re-opened currency swaps with the European Central Bank (ECB) and\nother major central banks. This step seems prudent as the events in Europe have the\npotential to create dollar funding pressures in world markets. As we did earlier, the\nFederal Reserve today offers dollars in exchange for foreign currency collateral—at a\nfixed exchange rate and a penalty rate. In this way foreign central banks can extend\n11\n\ndollar liquidity support to creditworthy financial institutions facing temporary liquidity\nstrains in foreign credit markets. To date, these lines have not been tapped much.\nI’d like to conclude at this point, but I hope you’ll recall that the answers to our three\nquestions about future growth, inflation, and the European debt crisis were three-and-a-\nhalf, no, and probably not much, but we are being vigilant. Of course, the details behind\nthese short answers are key to understanding how we put the pieces together to create\na picture of the economy. I hope I have been able to convey some of that to you today.\nI look forward to your questions.\n12",

Introduction\nEmpirical research with vector autoregressions (VARs) typically ignores issues associated\nwith data revisions and economic agents(cid:146) access to only real-time data releases. An example\nof this is the literature on monetary policy shocks in VARs (for example, Bernanke and\nBlinder (1992), Sims (1992), Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1996, 1999), Sims and Zha\n(1996)andBernankeandMihov(1998)). Eachofthesestudiesisbaseduponsomedataseries\nthat were not known to anyone during the period of the empirical analysis. Speci(cid:222)cally, the\ndata used in these studies, and other macroeconomic time series research, have been revised\nrelative to the data known at that time. Since government agencies and private sources do\nnot provide these data conveniently, these shortcuts are rarely even questioned.1 The real-\ntime data collected by Croushore and Stark (2001), however, allowresearchers to explore the\nempirical robustness of many existing macroeconomic results to this issue. Armed with the\noriginaldatareleasesthatwereknownatthattimetobusinessanalysts, marketparticipants,\npolicymakers, and the rest of the interested universe, the econometrician can answer the\nquestion, how much of a difference does this make to empirical analyses of monetary policy\nshocks?\nAddressingthisquestioniscomplicatedbythefactthatsomedataarealwaysrevised,and\nhence the true underlying economic concept is never observed fully. For example, aggregate\neconomic activity in the United States is not directly observable, but data on real GDP\nare reported and revised by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The monetary policy shock\nliterature has focused on how real GDP (for example) is affected by an exogenous shock to\nmonetary policy. This is an interesting question when real GDP is taken to be an accurate\nmeasure of aggregate economic activity, but the focus should instead be on the impact\nof monetary policy shocks on economic activity. Consequently, when data revisions are\naccounted for in empirical VAR analyses, the unobserved true variable must be modeled.2\nIn standard OLS estimates of autoregressions, this will induce errors-in-variables biases.\nErrors-in-variables issues raise another econometric problem for identi(cid:222)ed VAR analyses,\nnot simply the literature on monetary policy. Structural shocks are identi(cid:222)ed based upon\nthe covariance structure of the VAR innovations. The standard method of estimating VAR\ninnovations from the residuals, however, will include data revisions (or measurement noises).\nIn general, the revision components will be correlated across the equations in the system.\n1DieboldandRudebusch(1991)investigatethisissuefortheindexofleadingindicators. Rudebusch(1998)\ncriticizes VAR-based estimates of monetary policy reaction functions for ignoring this issue. Orphanides\n(1998) empirically assesses the importance of this issue for Taylor rule estimates.\n2Sargent and Sims (1977) provide an early example of this environment. Sargent (1989) and Stock and\nWatson (1989) discuss how Kalman (cid:222)lter methods can be used tractably to estimate these models.\n1\n\nIdentifying the economic shocks fromthe measurement noises requires more structure on the\nmeasurement process. In our empirical example, conditional on having the complete data\nset, the identi(cid:222)cation and estimation of the monetary policy equation is simpler than for\nother equations because the policy instrument is set based on observable data.\nThis paper considers two approaches to addressing the fact that econometricians(cid:146) macro-\neconomic data sets are changing over time because of data revisions. The (cid:222)rst approach is\nto assess the sensitivity of VAR estimates across different data vintages. For example, how\ndo monetary policy reaction function estimates change when the sample period is (cid:222)xed at\n1960-1983, but the data vintages are updated every year? This analysis does not explicitly\nconsider how the data revision process takes place. The second approach considers a statis-\ntical model of data revisions and implements an alternative, real-time estimation strategy\nto overcome the errors-in-variables biases. Our method assumes that output, the price level,\nand monetary aggregates are latent variables that the data collection agency never measures\nprecisely. Given a standard set of restrictions to identify policy and nonpolicy shocks in the\nabsence of measurement noises, our analysis with these noises is able to identify the shocks\nand compute impulse responses.\nOur empirical analysis of the Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1996) system suggests\nthat many results from the VAR literature on monetary policy are robust to these issues\nof real-time data availability. Speci(cid:222)cally, our analysis of the 1960-83 estimation period\nusing alternative data vintages (Section 3) uncovers only minor differences in monetary\npolicy shock measures and impulse responses. Our real-time analysis of the 1968-93 period\n(Section 5) also (cid:222)nds only small differences in the estimated policy shocks between the real-\ntime estimates and 1998-vintage estimates. The estimated effects of monetary policy shocks\non variables in the system are somewhat smaller in the real-time system, but qualitatitvely\nare remarkably similar. The estimated effects of other orthogonalized shocks are also similar\nin the real-time system for the (cid:222)rst three to (cid:222)ve years of responses. After this length of\ntime, however, the price variables in the real-time system exhibit trending behavior, while\nthe 1998-vintage responses seem to revert to zero. So, estimated impulse responses may be\nsensitive to data revisions.\nOur analysis of Gal(cid:237)(cid:146)s (1992) identi(cid:222)cation strategy indicates that real-time data issues\npresent more difficulties in fully-simultaneous VAR systems. When monetary policy and\n(cid:222)nancial market data respond to data revisions, the Gal(cid:237) IS, monetary policy, and money\ndemand shocks are not identi(cid:222)ed separately from the data revisions without additional re-\nstrictions. Gal(cid:237)(cid:146)sSupply shockisidenti(cid:222)edbylong-runrestrictions,andthesearenotaffected\nby the data revisions. Our estimated impulse response functions following a Supply shock\nare qualitatively similar across both the real-time and a 1998-vintage system.\n2\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the relationship between the VAR\nliterature on monetary policy and real-time information sets. Section 3 investigates the\nrobustness of two VAR studies to using alternative data vintages in the estimation over the\nperiod 1960-83. Section 4 discusses difficulties raised by real-time data issues in an example,\ntwo-variableautoregression; andproposesanestimationstrategy. Section5reportsempirical\nresults for this method applied to the Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1996) system.\nSection6examinesthedifficultiesofidenti(cid:222)cationinthenon-recursivesystemofGal(cid:237)(1992).\nSection 7 concludes.\n2. The literature and real-time data issues\nThe empirical literature that quanti(cid:222)es the effects of exogenous monetary policy shocks\non the economy proceeds along the following lines. The monetary authority has a policy\ninstrument S that is set as a function of the state of the economy. A general speci(cid:222)cation\nt\nof the Fed reaction function is\nS = f (Ω )+ε (2.1)\nt t t\nwhereΩ istheFed(cid:146)sinformationsetattimetandε isanexogenousshock. Thisspeci(cid:222)cation\nt t\nis embedded in the approaches of Gal(cid:237) (1992); Bernanke and Blinder (1992); Christiano,\nEichenbaum, and Evans (1996, 1999); Sims and Zha (1996); Leeper, Sims and Zha (1997);\nand Bernanke and Mihov (1998). The points of departure in these studies are the choices\nof the policy instrument S , the variables included in the information set Ω , as well as the\nt t\ndifferent functions f( ), and the correlation structure between the exogenous shock ε and\nt\n•\nthe information set Ω .\nt\nA common approach in these studies, however, is the use of a macroeconomic data set\nthat was not consistently available during the entire period of the analysis. Each study uses\na data set whose variables have been revised over time, following the original data release.\nFor example, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1996) use a data set that was collected\nin mid-1993 and included real GDP data through the fourth quarter of 1992. Although\nthe real GDP data for 1992:Q4 had only been revised twice (no benchmark revision), the\nhistorical data going back through 1960 had been revised many times. As we noted in the\nintroduction, the empirical VAR literature has neglected the effects of data revisions.3 This\nomission is apparent in the monetary policy rule (2.1) since it does not re(cid:223)ect the vintage\n3Rudebusch(1998)criticizesthemonetarypolicyshockliteratureforignoringthis. However,inprinciple,\ntheproblemispervasiveinmacroeconomictimeseriesstudiesgenerally. SeeCroushoreandStark(2002)for\nexamples.\n3\n\nof the data in the information set. Let T re(cid:223)ect the date of the data set(cid:146)s construction by\nthe econometrician. Period T will often be the (cid:222)nal observation in the data set, although\nthis does not need to be the case. In this setting, the empirical policy rule in the existing\nliterature should be restated as\nST = f ΩT +εT (2.2)\nt t t\n¡ ¢\nOne reaction to this criticismis to estimate f ( ) using Ω\nTj\nfor various data vintages T to see\nt j\n•\nif the estimates differ, while holding the full-sample period (cid:222)xed. Using this approach, we\nprovideevidenceontherobustnessoftwoVARstudiesinsection3(Christiano, Eichenbaum,\nand Evans (1996) and Gal(cid:237) (1992)).\nA further criticism of most macroeconomic, time-series studies is that the data contained\nin ΩT for t < T were not known at time t. In most cases, the data have been revised;4\nt\nthis critique also holds for the approach using Ω\nTj.\nConsequently, even with certain knowl-\nt\nedge of f ( ), εT will differ from the true policy shock (see Rudebusch 1998 and Christiano,\n• t\nEichenbaum, and Evans 1999). Assuming that the monetary authority uses a time-invariant\nfunction f ( ) to set the policy instrument, the reaction function is\n•\nSt = f Ωt +ε (2.3)\nt t t\n¡ ¢\nThe notation with superscript t here indicates that the monetary authority sets the policy\ninstrument S on the basis of information that is actually available to it during period t.\nt\nAre data revisions large enough that the distinction between these different informa-\ntion sets (ΩT versus Ωt) matters for the determination of monetary policy? Research by\nt t\nCroushore and Stark (2001, 2002) shows that both long-run views of the data and short-run\nviews can change sharply because of datarevisions. Average annual real output growth over\n(cid:222)ve-year periods sometimes changes by as much as 0.5 percentage point; for example, real\nGDP growth from 1984:Q4 to 1989:Q4 averaged 3.0 percent according to the NIPA data set\nin November 1995, but was 3.5 percent according to the NIPA data set in November 2001.\nOver the same period, in(cid:223)ation (measured using the percent change in the GDP de(cid:223)ator)\naveraged 3.6 percent in the November 1995 data set but 3.1 percent in the November 2001\ndata set. So, one(cid:146)s view of trend growth in output and in(cid:223)ation may be changed dramat-\nically by data revisions. In the short run, even larger revisions occur. For example, the\ngrowth rate of real output for 1977:Q1 was initially released as 5.2 percent; in today(cid:146)s data\n4Almost all seasonally adjusted, macroeconomic time series data are revised for a substantial period of\ntime.\n4\n\nset it is 5.0 percent. But in between it changed from 5.2% to 7.5% (July 1977 NIPA data\nrelease) to 7.3% (July 1978) to 8.9% (July 1979) to 9.6% (December 1980) to 8.9% (July\n1982) to 5.6% (December 1985) to 6.0% (December 1991) to 5.3% (January 1996) to 4.9%\n(July 1997) to 5.0%(March 2000). Because our measures of monetary shocks depend on the\nestimated relationship between the policy instrument and output growth as measured in a\nparticular data vintage, it is clear that those measures may change considerably across data\nvintages when the underlying data on output are revised this dramatically. Thus research\ninvestigating monetary policy shocks using (cid:222)nal revised data is potentially problematic.\nThecon(cid:223)ictbetweentheempiricalinvestigationofmonetarypolicyandtheactualsetting\nof policy is troubling in principle.

In most cases, computing impulse response functions from a monetary policy\nshock requires estimating the VAR equations for the other variables.5 Although monetary\npolicymayplausiblyrespondtoeachnewdatarevisionasdescribedin(2.3), thisassumption\nis somewhat more problematic for real GDP. Should we really expect that true output will\nbe affected directly by the government(cid:146)s announcement that last month(cid:146)s announced (cid:222)gure\nfor real GDP was half a percentage point too high? Further assumptions about the non-\npolicy equations are required: assumptions about the data revision process over time and\nthe information available to economic agents at any point in time. As the discussion in\nsection 4 indicates, the problems posed by data revisions range beyond the monetary policy\nshock literature. Third, how is the identi(cid:222)cation of non-monetary policy shocks affected by\ndata revision issues? Simple examples below suggest that VAR innovations estimated using\nrevised data will include revision errors. Since identi(cid:222)cation of exogenous shocks is achieved\nby factoring particular covariance matrices of VAR innovations, the presence of additional\ncovariation due to revision errors cannot be ignored, in principle.\n5An exception is the two-step strategy described in Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1999) for a\nparticular recursively identi(cid:222)ed policy rule. Although the two-step strategy is asymptotically justi(cid:222)able\nfor any impulse response function, it does require a time series on the exogenous shock. If the exogenous\nshock can only be identi(cid:222)ed with the aid of another variable(cid:146)s innovation, then the other equation must\nbe estimated. The identi(cid:222)cation strategies of Sims and Zha (1996), Gal(cid:237) (1992), and Bernanke and Mihov\n(1998) require these additional restrictions.\n5\n\n3. Monetary policy estimates with different data vintages\nIs there a simple way to see if data revisions really matter for the identi(cid:222)cation of monetary\npolicy shocks? One way to answer this question is simply to investigate how changes in the\nvintage of the data affect the size of monetary policy shocks or impulse response functions.\nPotentially, this issue could be important. In examining the robustness of empirical\nmacroeconomic studies, Croushore and Stark (2002) found that some empirical results were\nstronglyaffectedby datarevisions. Forexample, someof theempirical resultsofHall (1978)\nandBlanchardandQuah(1989)changeddramaticallywhenalternativevintagesofdatawere\nused. In both cases, the sample period used in the empirical work was not changed, only\nthe date on which the data were measured.\nTo investigate the robustness of VAR results for measuring monetary policy shocks, we\nuse the real-time data set of Croushore and Stark (2001), and rerun the empirical work of\nChristiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1996) and Gal(cid:237) (1992), using four alternative vintages\nofthedata. Wethenexaminethedegreetowhichthesealternativedatasetsleadtodiffering\nmagnitudes for monetary shocks and the impulse responses to monetary shocks. We look at\ndatasetsthatspan15years. Thedata, especiallyNIPAdata, havebeenrevisedsigni(cid:222)cantly\nacross that span, and thus could potentially have a large impact on the empirical results.\n3.1.

The federal funds rate and commodity price variables are not revised, but the other\nfour variables were revised substantially over this period, including such major revisions as\nswitching from GNP to GDP and changing from (cid:222)xed-weight real output and de(cid:223)ator to\nchain weighting. We maintain a common sample period for all four vintages of data, using\njust data from the sample that is common to all four data sets, 1960Q1 to 1983Q3.\nTheVARis estimatedandthe monetary policy shocks are takentobethe orthogonalized\ninnovations from the federal funds rate equation.

But much recent empirical work has used economic theory to impose\nstructure on the VAR, using short-run and long-run restrictions to provide identi(cid:222)cation.\nOne such model is that of Gal(cid:237) (1992). The Gal(cid:237) model is a VAR in four variables, with\nthe growth rate of real output (Y), the quarterly change in the interest rate (∆FF), the\nreal interest rate, which equals the interest rate minus the quarterly in(cid:223)ation rate in the\nconsumer price index (P), and the growth rate of the real money supply (MONEY), which\nequals the log of the nominal money supply (M1) minus the log of the price level. The\nonly difference between our data and Gal(cid:237)(cid:146)s is that we use the federal funds rate, while he\nused the interest rate on three-month T-bills, but that difference should matter little for the\nempirical results.\nImposingidentifyingrestrictionsontheVARallowsonetocalculatestructuralshocksand\ntogenerateimpulseresponsefunctions. Gal(cid:237)imposesthreelong-runrestrictionsontheVAR:\nmoney supply shocks do not affect output, money demand shocks do not affect output, and\nspending shocks do not affect output. He also imposes three short-run restrictions: money\nsupply shocks do not affect output contemporaneously, money demand shocks do not affect\noutput contemporaneously, and the price level does not enter the money supply equation\ncontemporaneously.\nTheshockstomonetarypolicy,showninFigure3.3,areagainquitesimilaracrossvintages\nof the data. The only surprise is that the 1988 vintage of the data shows somewhat larger\nshocks than the other three vintages. But the timing of all the shocks is identical; they\ndiffer only in magnitude.\nThe impulse responses in the Gal(cid:237) model, shown in Figure 3.4, differ a bit across vintages\nas well. Again, though, they are qualitatively the same in terms of their general paths. The\nrevisions seem to affect the impulse response to real money balances the most.\n9\n\n7.5\n5.0\n2.5\n0.0\n-2.5\n-5.0\n1961 1963 1965 1967 1969 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983\n1983 1993\n1988 1998\nFigure 3.3: Gal(cid:237) Monetary Policy Shocks\nThe(cid:222)guredisplaysestimatedmonetarypolicyshocksfromfourVARsusingdifferentdatavintages:\n1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998.

Each VAR was estimated over the sample period 1960-1983.\n11\n\n4. Estimating a recursively identi(cid:222)ed VAR with real-time data\nTo investigate the in(cid:223)uence of real-time data issues for estimating VARs, we specify a two-\nvariable, recursively identi(cid:222)ed example and impose structure on the data revision process.\nThe methods adopted here for estimating and analyzing the two-variable system extend\neasily to higher order systems. The VAR includes two distinct types of variables. The (cid:222)rst\ntype is (cid:222)nancial data, like the federal funds rate (FF), that are set on the basis of real-time\ndata and do not get revised. The second data type is revised over time, like real GDP (Y):\nits time-series law of motion is speci(cid:222)ed in terms of an underlying, latent variable that is\nmeasured imperfectly. In one respect, the real-time policy and (cid:222)nancial variable equations\nare the simplest to estimate: given the actual real-time data and recursiveness assumptions,\ntheseequationscanbeestimatedbyordinaryleastsquares. Byplacingsufficientstructureon\nthe historical data revision process, we deduce an instrumental variables estimation strategy\nfor the nonpolicy/(cid:222)nancial equations.\n4.1. A recursively identi(cid:222)ed VAR\nIn this example, we take the true data-generating process to be a two-equation identi(cid:222)ed\nVAR. The monetary authority sets the federal funds rate FF on the basis of its own past\nt\nhistory, and the data reported for Y at time t. We will refer to Y as output, but it can just\nas easily be a vector of data. The law of motion for the true, unobserved output series Y is\nt∗\ndistinct from the data reporting process. The system of equations is:\nFF = A (L)FF +A (L)Yt +a Yt +ε (4.1a)\nt FF t 1 Y t 1 Y t 1t\n− −\nY = B (L)FF +B (L)Y +ε (4.1b)\nt∗ FF t 1 Y t∗1 2t\n− −\nSpecifying the policy reaction function in real time requires explicit assumptions about the\nway data revisions in(cid:223)uence policy. Equation (4.1a) is based upon data known at time t,\nnamely, Yt;FF ,Yt ;FF ,Yt ,; etc.6 Equation (4.1a) makes a strong assumption: FF\nt t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2\n− − − −\nwill respond systematically to changes in the reported data even when the underlying Y\n∗\ndoes not change. The assumption may be reasonable because Y is not directly observed.\n∗\nEquation (4.1b) is the law of motion for Y and has two features worth noting. First,\nt∗\nthe data revisions in(cid:223)uence Y indirectly through their effects on FF and monetary policy.\n∗\n6Superscripts refer to the reporting vintage of the data, while subscripts refer to the observation period.\nNotice that the lag operator L operates on the observation date only, and not the data(cid:146)s vintage date.\n12\n\nSecondbutmorecritical,thelatentvariableY dependsuponitsownhistoryandnotdirectly\n∗\nonthehistoryofreal-timedatareleases. Thisrelationshipmightemergeinaneconomywhere\nagents seethe true economic allocations, while the monetaryauthority sees only error-ridden\nmeasures. Although this may be a questionable assumption, the alternatives may be worse.\nThe assumption could be questionable because central banks expend many resources to\nmeasure and understand the state of their economies each period. Considering the fact that\ntheFederalReservealreadypurchasescertaintypesof(cid:222)nancialdatafromprivatecompanies,\nthey would clearly pay to observe Y if private agents actually knew that information. An\nt∗\nalternative line of reasoning might assume that no one in the economy observes Y . This\n∗\ncould be accommodated by also including Yt ,s 0 in equation (4.1b), or simply its\nt s\n− ≥\nrevisions. In this case, however, it is difficult to think about state-contingent allocations,\n© ª\nmarket-clearing, or prices. This approach is worth investigation, but has not been pursued\nhere.\nThis system of equations is written as a recursively identi(cid:222)ed VAR, with the ε and ε\n1t 2t\nshocks assumed to be exogenous, and uncorrelated with the other right-hand-side variables.\n0\nThe vector of exogenous shocks ε t = ε 1t ε 2t has a diagonal covariance structure.\nµ ¶\nEach period the output data are revised. The data revision process has the following\nform:7\nYt = Y g (4.2a)\nt t∗ − t∗\nYt+s = Yt+s 1 +ht+s, s > 0, t (4.2b)\nt t − t ∀ ∀\nY = YT +hT , T = latest release date.

Each period t+s, the previously released data are revised\nt∗ t∗\nby ht+s according to (4.2b). Equation (4.2c) speci(cid:222)es how the latest data release YT is also\nt t\nan imperfect measure of the unobserved, true output variable Y . This speci(cid:222)cation readily\nt∗\nadmits furtheranalysis with alaterdatarelease YT+1, and thuscaptures the notionthat hT\nt ∗\nrepresents a permanent wedge between measuring and observing true output Y .

Consequently, we\nneed to assume that these revisions take place with respect to the log of the series.\n13\n\n4.2. Estimation difficulties with period T-vintage data\nSuppose an econometrician uses the most recent data releases to estimate equations (4.1a)\nand (4.1b) by OLS. Often these data are referred to as (cid:147)(cid:222)nal, revised data(cid:148); but since the\ndata continue to be revised, we refer to these data as period T-vintage data on YT. Using\nt\nthe revised data YT in place of Yt and Y , the system of equations becomes\nt t t∗\nFF = A (L)FF +A (L)YT +a YT +wT (4.3a)\nt FF t 1 Y t 1 Y t 1t\n− −\nYT = B (L)FF +B (L)YT +wT (4.3b)\nt FF t 1 Y t 1 2t\n− −\nThe critical questions revolve around the correlation structure of the error terms wT and\n1t\nwT and their relationship to ε and ε .8 Given the revision process and the true laws of\n2t 1t 2t\nmotion, it can be shown that\nT t T t\n− −\nwT = ε a ht+s A (L) ht+s\n1t 1t − Y t − Y t 1\n−\ns=1 s=1\nX X\nwT = ε hT +B (L)hT\n2t 2t t ∗ Y t ∗1\n− −\nWhen the econometrician estimates equations (4.3a) and (4.3b) with OLS, the estimated\nregression coefficients are likely to be biased. In general, the error terms wT and wT are\n1t 2t\ncorrelated with the regressors in both equations. Note that wT contains revisions to date\n1t\nt variables, date t 1 variables, and so on, which are correlated with the right-hand-side\n−\nvariables in equation (4.3a), YT and YT , j = 1,2, ..., except under special assumptions.\nt t j\n−\nSimilarly, wT contains measurement wedges (cid:150) differences between the latest measure of\n2t\nthe variable and its latent value (cid:150) which will in general be correlated with the right-hand\nvariables in equation (4.3b).\nBecause OLS estimators are biased, we look for alternative estimation methods, the use\nof which depends on the manner in which the data are constructed. Polar cases of data\nconstruction include: (1) methods by which revisions to data incorporate news, which is the\ncase when the data agency uses all available data (not just its own sample measuring the\ndata in question) to construct an optimal estimate of the data series in question; and (2)\nclassical measurement error, in which revisions to the data reduce noise, which is the case\nwhen the data agency draws an unbiased sample, uses only that sample in constructing its\n8See Rudebusch (1998) for a discussion of these issues with respect to the monetary policy equation.\n14\n\ndata series, but fails to account for correlations between its data series and other data (not\nincluded in its sample) that are available at the time. Of course, data reporting agencies do\nnot directly state which category their reporting method belongs to. Key tests of the extent\nto which data represent noise or news were undertaken by Mankiw, Runkle, and Shapiro\n(1984), Mankiwand Shapiro (1986), and Croushore and Stark (2002). The Croushore-Stark\nresults suggest that for most macroeconomic variables, revisions between the initial release\nand one year later are best characterized as containing news, while revisions after one year\ncannot be easily characterized(cid:151)they are a mix of news and noise.\nBased on the outcome of the tests for news and noise, we develop consistent estimators\nfor the parameters in equations (4.3a) and (4.3b). Clearly, the consistency of these estimates\nwill also depend on the validity of the auxiliary assumptions about the data revision process.\n4.3. Using real-time data to estimate the real-time policy equation\nSuppose that the econometrician has the original data for each period, as it was initially\nreleased and subsequently revised. For the monetary policy reaction (4.1a),\nFF = A (L)FF +A (L)Yt +a Yt +ε\nt FF t 1 Y t 1 Y t 1t\n− −\nthe econometrician can estimate this equation precisely with the vintage data Yt ,s 0 .\nt s ≥\n−\nOwing to the recursiveness assumption, OLS is consistent. That is, since Yt = Y g\n©t t∗\n−\nªt∗\nand E[Y ε ] = E[g ε ] = 0, all of the right-hand-side variables are orthogonal to ε .\nt∗ 1t t∗ 1t 1t\nConsequently, the exogenous monetary policy shock ε can be recovered without being\n1t\npolluted by data revisions.\n4.4. Using different data vintages as instruments\nA major stumbling block in estimating equation (4.3b) is that true output Y is never fully\nt∗\nrevealed in the period T-vintage revisions. The error term wT includes the wedge terms\n2t\nhT . If instead YT were to reveal Y for some T sufficiently large relative to t, then the\nt ∗ t t∗\nmeasurement errors hT would disappear from wT completely. In that case, OLS estimation\nt ∗ 2t\non the output autoregression would recover the true parameters asymptotically as well as\nthe exogenous shocks.\nOf course, data revisions never come to a (cid:222)nal conclusion. For example, even though no\nnew source data is being collected for 1959 real GDP, those data do get revised periodically.\n15\n\nSpeci(cid:222)cally, when the base year is changed, or the concept is altered (usually slightly), there\naredatarevisions. But it seems plausible toassume that there is some date beyondwhich all\nthe data revisions are insubstantial. That is, real GDP continues to be revised substantially\nas new income tax information comes in over the years. Also, seasonal adjustment proce-\ndures continue to alter the stochastic seasonals for many years. But beyond some threshold,\nit seems reasonable to assume that the adjustments are completely random with respect to\npreviousyearsofbenchmarkrevisions(whichisconsistentwiththeCroushore-Starkresults).\nWithin a benchmark revision, however, the measurement errors may be serially correlated\nbecause of interpolation and spreading of annual source data information to quarterly mea-\nsures.\nThis discussion is intended to motivate the following statistical model of benchmark data\nrevisions:\nYt+s = Y ηt+s, s J. (4.4)\nt t∗ − t ≥\nAfter the threshold J periods have elapsed, the reported data Yt+s measure the true Y up\nt t∗\nto a measurement error ηt+s which is independent of Y and ηt+s 0 (where s = s). This\n−\nt t∗ t 0\n6\nmodel of benchmark revisions allows us to construct an instrumental variables estimator for\nthe output equation (4.3b). In the period T-vintage data, let(cid:146)s restrict the sample period to\nthe YT observations with ηT measurement errors, so that the error term wT is\n2t\nwT = ε hT +B (L)hT\n2t 2t − t ∗ Y t ∗1\n−\n= ε ηT +B (L)ηT , t T J\n2t − t Y t 1 ≤ −\n−\nIn this part of the sample, ηT revisions are correlated with YT and the standard mea-\nt s t s\n− −\nsurement error bias result obtains. However, the ηT are orthogonal to Y , and hence the\nt s t∗s\n− −\nearlier vintage errors embedded in FF from the policy reaction function.\nt j\n−\nSince FF is a valid regressor, an instrumental variables approach needs to deal with\nt 1\n−\nonly the Y data. To this end, notice that the revision errors hT are orthogonal to many\nt ∗\nother revision errors, once enough time has elapsed from the initial release of the data to\nensure that all remaining revisions are orthogonal noise (across benchmark revisions). Given\nthe data vintage denoted by YT, select another data vintage YT 0. The (cid:222)nal time period\nT 0 < T, by assumption (just a normalization). In practical terms, YT and YT 0 may be from\nthe July 1998 and July 1996 releases of the National Income and Product Account data,\nrespectively. Let the estimation period range from observations 1 to T J; this means that\n0\n−\nall of the data have entered the stage of independent benchmark errors. Consequently, YT 0\nt s\n−\n16\n\nis a valid instrument for YT .

However,\nthe errors are independent of each other. The variance of ε can be estimated by the\n2t\nsample covariance of these two residuals, and instrumental variables methods can be used\nto construct impulse response functions.\nThis model of benchmark revisions does have testable restrictions. An implication of\nequation(4.4)isthatthecross-covariancesofthegrowthratesshouldbeequal,∆YT∆YT 0 and\nt t j\n−\n∆YT ∆YT 0.10 Table 1 reports generalized method of moments estimates of the (cid:222)rst four au-\nt j t\n−\ntocorrelations of ∆Y using eight moment conditions implied by\nt∗\nρ = E ∆YT∆YT 0 = E ∆YT ∆YT 0 ,\nj t t j t j t\n− −\nh i h i\nas well as four restrictions to estimate the just-identi(cid:222)ed means and variances of ∆YT and\nt\n∆YT 0. The data vintages are July 1996 and July 1998 releases (recorded as the August 1996\nt\nand August 1998 vintages in the Philadelphia Fed(cid:146)s real-time data set, as the NIPA releases\ncome out at the end of the month and the real-time data set records vintages mid-month).\nThe autocorrelation patterns are not surprising for the latent variables. Output growth and\nin(cid:223)ation are positively auto-correlated. The strong persistence in in(cid:223)ation suggests wide\ncon(cid:222)dence bounds on any valid inference regarding I(0) or I(1) behavior. The autocorre-\nlation properties in nonborrowed and total reserves are similar. More interestingly, there\nis little evidence against the overidentifying restrictions as reported by the J statistic.\n−\nConsequently, the empirical evidence provides support for implementing the IV estimation\nstrategy using 1996 and 1998 vintage data.\n9It should be apparent that YT and YT0 are not weak instruments for each other in this estimation\nt t\nstrategy.

Empirical results for recursive identi(cid:222)cation in a real-time VAR\nTo investigate the implications of using real-time data in a VAR, we estimate the 6-variable\nCEE system described in Section 3. We use the Croushore-Stark real-time data set. The\nvariables are real GDP (Y), the implicit GDP de(cid:223)ator (P), an index of commodity prices\n(PCOM), the federal funds rate (FF), nonborrowed reserves (NBR), and total reserves\n(TR). The data are in logs, except for FF. The two data vintages to be used as instruments\nfor the latent variables are T = 1996:3 and T = 1998:3. We take the benchmark threshold\n0\nJ = 12 quarters, so our estimation period runs from 1968:1 through 1993:3; the starting\ndate is determined by the availability of real-time data and the ending date by the size of\nJ and the (cid:222)rst vintage used as an instrument. As described in Section 4, the federal funds\nrate equation is estimated with real-time data (equation 4.1a), while the other equations are\nspeci(cid:222)ed as latent variables (similar to equation 4.1b speci(cid:222)ed for a vector of data). The\norder of orthogonalization for studying nonpolicy shocks is Y,P,PCOM,FF,NBR,TR.12\nFigure (5.1) displays the estimated FF policy shock using real-time data and an FF\npolicyshockestimatedfromthe(cid:222)xed1998:3-vintagedataset(asatypicalVARisestimated).\nOverall, theseriesareremarkablysimilar.

The standard deviations of the two shocks\nare 75 and 87 basis points for the real-time and 1998:3-vintage data measures, respectively.\nNevertheless, there are some notable differences. First, in the third and fourth quarters of\n1974, the 1998:3-vintage data overstates the volatility of exogenous monetary policy, relative\nto the VAR based on data available to policymakers. Romer and Romer (1989) selected\n11In a previous draft, we allowed the revisions to depend on the identi(cid:222)ed shocks ε and ε , perhaps\n1 2\nbecause of optimal statistical (cid:222)ltering rules studied by Sargent (1989). The qualitative results from that\nanalysis were similar to the ones reported here.\n12Thecontemporaneoustermsinthemultivariatecounterpartsto4.1aand4.1baretreatedinthestandard\nway with a recursive structure. We have alsoestimated the PCOM equations using real-time data by OLS\n(that is, treating PCOM as a function of measured output rather than latent output). Those results are\nsimilar to the ones reported below.\n19\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n1970 1976 1982 1988\nReal-time 1998 vintage\nFigure 5.1: CEE Federal Funds Shocks\nThe (cid:222)gure displays estimated monetary policy shocks from two VARs estimated over the sample\nperiod 1968-1993.

The real-time VAR residuals indicate that\nthis was a period when the FOMC was responding in a rather typical fashion to the data\nthey were given. Second, the three large contractionary shocks in 1980:4, 1981:2, and 1982:1\nare overstated in the 1998:3 vintage data by 120, 60, and 70 basis points, respectively, when\ncompared with the VAR based on data the FOMC had access to. Third, the two series\nappear to become less contemporaneously aligned since the stock market decline in 1987.\nThe real-time exogenous tighteningin 1988 leads the 1998:3vintage by a quarterthroughout\nthe year, and the subsequent exogenous easing through 1989 is similarly misaligned. In spite\nof this, the general assessment of exogenous monetary policy as being tight or loose over the\ncourse of a four quarter period will not differ appreciably across these two measures.13\n13Rudebusch (1999) (cid:222)nds that FF residuals from a monthly VAR are quite different from forecast errors\n20\n\nFF --> Y* FF --> FF\n0.2 0.96\n0.1 0.80\n0.64\n-0.0\n0.48\n-0.1\n0.32\n-0.2\n0.16\n-0.3\n0.00\n-0.4 -0.16\n-0.5 -0.32\n2 6 10 14 18 2 6 10 14 18\nReal-time PLUSLIST(1) Real-time PLUSLIST(4)\n1998 vintage MINLIST(1) 1998 vintage MINLIST(4)\nFF --> P* FF --> NBR*\n0.16 1.00\n0.75\n0.00\n0.50\n-0.16\n0.25\n-0.32 0.00\n-0.48 -0.25\n-0.50\n-0.64\n-0.75\n-0.80\n-1.00\n-0.96 -1.25\n2 6 10 14 18 2 6 10 14 18\nReal-time PLUSLIST(2) Real-time PLUSLIST(5)\n1998 vintage MINLIST(2) 1998 vintage MINLIST(5)\nFF --> PCOM* FF --> TR*\n1.0 0.9\n0.5\n0.6\n0.0\n-0.5 0.3\n-1.0\n-1.5 0.0\n-2.0\n-0.3\n-2.5\n-3.0 -0.6\n2 6 10 14 18 2 6 10 14 18\nReal-time PLUSLIST(3) Real-time PLUSLIST(6)\n1998 vintage MINLIST(3) 1998 vintage MINLIST(6)\nFigure 5.2: Recursively-identi(cid:222)ed FF Shock\nThe solid lines are the point estimate and 95 percentile bands for the impulse responses estimated\nusing real-time data.

The similarity across the two VAR systems is striking. Relative to the 1998:3\nvintage estimates, the real-time FF response displays slightly less persistence. The real-\ntime output price and commodity price responses are a bit shallower than the revised data\nestimates. To informally assess the uncertainty surrounding these point estimates, there are\ntwo obvious metrics. First, the reported bootstrap con(cid:222)dence bands around the real-time\nimpulse responses typically cover the response paths around the 1998 vintage estimates.\nExceptions to this are the second year responses of Y and PCOM , and the (cid:222)rst year\n∗ ∗\nresponses of FF. The percentile bands are somewhat wider than Christiano, Eichenbaum,\nand Evans (1999, Figure 2) report in a similar system for quarterly data. Nevertheless,\ninferenceabout theeffects of amonetarypolicy shockis largelyunaffected. Acontractionary\npolicy shock reduces Y and PCOM signi(cid:222)cantly in the (cid:222)rst two years, while P most\n∗ ∗ ∗\nlikely falls (but with very little precision in the estimates). The liquidity effect on impact\nis signi(cid:222)cantly different from zero, but its persistence is a bit less than CEE (cid:222)nd in their\nanalysis, which ignores data revisions. A second metric for assessing uncertainty focuses on\nthe 1998 vintage estimates. Unreported 95 percentile bands around the 1998 estimates cover\nthe real-time impulse responses. Taking account of this joint uncertainty, the real-time and\n1998 vintage analyses appear to be similar.\nFigure (5.3) displays the system(cid:146)s response from an exogenous shock to true output\nY . Except for the commodity price and de(cid:223)ator paths after 3 years, the responses are\nt∗\nquite similar across estimation methods. The 95 percentile bands cover the 1998 vintage\nresponses in most cases. The largest discrepancies involve the responses of P and PCOM\n∗ ∗\nin Figure (5.3). The real-time estimates seem to be estimating a trending response from Y\n∗\nshocks to prices, while the 1998 vintage estimates revert to a stationary path. This could\nbe the case if the real-time data estimation is more closely estimating a unit root for the\nprice variables, than for the revised vintage data. Not surprisingly, the error bands offer no\npersuasive evidence on the signi(cid:222)cance of these long-horizon responses. Similar observations\ninferred from the Federal funds futures market over the period 1989-1996. In addition to the difference\nin information sets across the two analyses, futures market participants do not necessarily presume that\nmonetary policy follows a linear, time-invariant feedback rule. Consequently, evidence from futures market\ndata do not directly shed light on the effect of real-time data for VAR policy shock measures.\n14Bootstrapcon(cid:222)dencebandsareconstructedinastraightforwardmanner.

For the CEE\n∗ ∗\nrecursive identi(cid:222)cation of monetary policy shocks and other orthogonalized shocks, there is\nlittle evidence that using real-time data in the estimation alters the literature(cid:146)s conclusions\nabout the effects of monetary policy shocks on the U.S. economy during this period.\n6. Gal(cid:237) empirical results\nReal-time data issues can pose daunting identi(cid:222)cation issues for nonrecursive systems of\nsimultaneous equations. Although Gal(cid:237)(cid:146)s (1992) assumptions are sufficient to identify four\neconomic shocks when real-time data issues are ignored, vintage measurement issues defeat\nGal(cid:237)(cid:146)s identi(cid:222)cation of all but the long-run supply shock. Simultaneity from (cid:222)nancial market\ndata generally creates identi(cid:222)cation difficulties unless further restrictive assumptions are\nmade about the time series properties of measurements.\n6.1. Simultaneity creates identi(cid:222)cation problems\nThe essence of the real-time data problem comes from the contemporaneous correlation\nbetween real allocations and (cid:222)nancial market data that respond to measurement errors.\nAlthough the four-variable Gal(cid:237) (1992) system shares these problems, the previous example\nis simpler and can be augmented to reveal the problem:\nFF = A (L)FF +A (L)Yt +a Yt +ε (6.6a)\nt FF t 1 Y t 1 Y t 1t\n− −\nY = B (L)FF +B (L)Y +a FF +ε (6.6b)\nt∗ FF t 1 Y t∗1 FF t 2t\n− −\nYt = Y +h (6.6c)\nt t∗ ∗t\nNonzero values for a and a imply a nonrecursive system (cid:150) that is, a fully simultaneous\nY FF\nsystem.

Identi(cid:222)cation of the Gal(cid:237) Supply Shock\nInterestingly, the problems of simultaneity with real-time data do not defeat identi(cid:222)cation\nthrough the long-run restrictions in the Gal(cid:237) system. Recall that the structural equation for\noutput growth can be written as\nM\n∆Y = A (L)∆Y +A (L)∆FF +A (L)∆ t∗ +A (L)(FF ∆P )+εsupply (6.7)\nt∗ 11 t∗ − 1 12 t 13 P t∗ 14 t − t∗ t\nSimultaneity and the contemporaneous values of ∆FF , ∆M t∗, and (FF ∆P ) defeat the\nt P t∗ t − t∗\nconsistency of OLS estimation. But the long-run restriction that only the supply shock can\npermanently affect Y implies a root on the unit circle in the polynomials A (z), A (z),\nt∗ 12 13\nand A (z), where z is a complex variable. This leads to an instrumental variables estimator\n14\nM\nusing the differences of ∆FF , ∆ t∗, and (FF ∆P ). Although the latent variables are\nt P t∗ t − t∗\nnot observable, the 1998 and 1996 vintage estimation can be used to identify εsupply.\nt\nFigure(6.1) displays theimpulse responsesfromtheestimatedreal-timesystemfollowing\na supply shock, as well as a 1998 vintage impulse response.

Thesystematic\n∗\nresponse of monetary policy modestly constrains real activity following a technology shock:\nthe real interest rate is primarily positive after two quarters.

Most importantly, apart from adding a good deal of\nadditional uncertainty from the wider error bands, the real-time system is not very different\nfrom a 1998 vintage estimate.\nInspiteofthesimilaritybetweentheseresponses, thelackofidenti(cid:222)cationforamonetary\npolicy shock, IS shock or money demand shock in a real-time data system stands in sharp\ncontrast to the typical identi(cid:222)cation which ignores real-time data issues. To assess whether\nthose identi(cid:222)cations are robust to real-time data revisions requires placing more structure\non the measurements. That is a subject for further research.\n7. Conclusions\nEmpirical VAR and time series research often ignores issues associated with data revisions\nand economic agents(cid:146) access to only real-time data releases. Since government agencies and\nprivate sources donot provide these dataconveniently, these shortcuts are rarely questioned.\nThe real-time datacollected by Croushore and Stark (2001) allows researchers to explore the\nempirical robustness of many existing macroeconomic results to this issue, but additional\nstructure must be placed on the data revision process and assumptions regarding the infor-\nmationthat economicagentshaveaccessto. Ourempiricalanalysesindicatethataccounting\nfor data revisions has only a modest effect quantitatively on the recursively-identi(cid:222)ed mon-\netary policy shock measures and impulse responses we consider. Similarly robust (cid:222)ndings\nwere obtained for a particular long-run identi(cid:222)cation. All of these results are conditional\non our assumptions about data revisions and the latent structure of the economy. A neg-\native (cid:222)nding of this analysis revealed that many fully-simultaneous VAR systems that are\nidenti(cid:222)ed when real-time data issues are ignored are actually not completely identi(cid:222)ed when\nvintage measurement issues are considered. More research that allows for alternative mea-\nsurement noise and data revision processes is needed to shed more light on the role of data\nrevisions.\n27\n\nReferences\n[1] Bernanke, Ben, 1986, Alternative Explanations of the Money-Income Correlation,(cid:148)\nCarnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy 25: pp. 49-100.\n[2] Bernanke, Ben and Alan Blinder, 1992, (cid:147)The federal funds rate and the channels of\nmonetary transmission,(cid:148) American Economic Review 82: pp.\n901-21.\n[3] Bernanke, Ben and Ilian Mihov, 1998, (cid:147)MeasuringMonetary Policy,(cid:148) Quarterly Journal\nof Economics 113 (August): pp. 869-902.\n[4] Blanchard, OlivierJean, andDannyQuah.(cid:147)TheDynamicEffectsofAggregateDemand\nand Supply Disturbances.(cid:148) American Economic Review 79 (September 1989), pp. 655-\n73.\n[5] Blanchard, Olivier Jean, and Mark Watson, 1986, (cid:148)Are Business Cycles All Alike?(cid:148) in\nRobert J.

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIntroduction\nThank you. It is truly a pleasure to be here today and have the opportunity to speak to\nthe Detroit Economic Club. And it is a particular pleasure to be introduced by Carl\n(Camden, president and chief executive officer of Kelly Services). This past December,\nCarl completed his service as the chair of the Detroit Branch of the Chicago Fed after\npreviously serving as a member of our board and on our advisory council. Carl has\nalways been exceedingly generous in sharing his time and perspective on a wide range\nof issues. We are very grateful for his contributions, and it’s terrific to be able to\ncontinue that association through events like this. There are also a number of our\ncurrent and former Detroit directors in the audience today, and it is great to see you all\nas well.\nWe have made much progress since the financial crisis began and the economy\ndropped into a deep recession. Since 2008, short-term interest rates have been near\nzero and are likely to remain at that level for some time. Over that period, the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet has expanded more than fourfold to over $4 trillion. Yet, in\nrecent months, we’ve seen growth in economic activity gain some additional traction,\nand the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has begun to taper its asset\npurchases. This afternoon, I would like to discuss our recent policy actions and some of\nthe issues we face. As always, I will be giving my personal perspective, which is not\nnecessarily shared by my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\nIn a refreshing departure from the past several years, growth in economic activity in\n2013 actually did not fall short of our forecasts made at the beginning of the year. Labor\nmarkets improved substantially, and the economy is entering 2014 with much better\nmomentum. In light of this improved performance, the Federal Reserve began in\nDecember to adjust the mix of its monetary policy tools modestly. We started to taper\nour asset purchases, but we indicated that the fed funds rate would be near zero for\nquite some time — quite likely well into 2015. Barring any changes to our outlook, this\nwould translate into seven years in which short-term interest rates would be at their zero\nlower bound. But policy likely will need to remain highly accommodative for such a time\nto ensure we make adequate progress toward maximum employment and price stability\n— the two congressionally mandated goals for U.S. monetary policy.1\n1 Four times a year, participants in the FOMC submit their economic projections, including projections for\nthe future path of the federal funds rate under their assessments of appropriate monetary policy. In the\nlatest projections, published on December 18, 2013, 15 of the 17 participants anticipated that the first\nincrease in the target federal funds rate would not be warranted until 2015 or later.\n2\n\nThe deep recession, financial distress and prolonged slow recovery clearly called for\nsuch unusually accommodative monetary policy. Nonetheless, we need to be wary of\nany potential risks that might accompany the prolonged period of low interest rates.\nMost critical analysts often highlight two risks: unacceptably high inflation and financial\nexuberance that leads to instability. These are legitimate risks to consider. By my\nassessment, the risk of high inflation is fairly remote. In fact, today inflation in the U.S.\nand other advanced countries is too low, and I am concerned that inflation will run too\nlow for too long. Regarding potential financial instability risks, I think the scenarios are\nmore nuanced. But by my reading, these risks currently do not warrant altering the\nstance of monetary policy.2 In fact, altering the current trajectory of monetary policy in\norder to mitigate these risks would likely degrade progress toward achieving maximum\nemployment and price stability. If broad risks to financial stability were to become more\nprominent, the Federal Reserve has more effective tools to contain them than adjusting\ninterest rates.\nRecent Monetary Policy Actions\nIn my remarks this afternoon, I will discuss recent monetary policy actions and financial\nstability risks. Let me begin with recent economic developments and monetary policy.\nAs you all know, in response to the unusual economic circumstances generated by the\nfinancial crisis and the Great Recession, the FOMC brought down the target federal\nfunds rate, its traditional policy tool, to near-zero levels — as low as it can go — and\nhas kept it there since 2008. With the fed funds rate constrained at this lower bound and\neconomic conditions requiring additional policy accommodation, the Committee also\ndeployed nontraditional policy tools to stimulate activity: namely, large-scale purchases\nof long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, as well as\nforward guidance about how long short-term interest rates would essentially remain at\ntheir lower bound of zero.\nWhile large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance are unconventional tools, their\neffect on interest rates and real economic activity is quite conventional. Both tools are\naimed at stimulating economic activity through lower long-term rates. Through arbitrage\nand portfolio rebalancing, lower rates in one market — whether it’s the fed funds market\nor the Treasury and mortgage-backed securities markets — are transmitted to other\nrates faced by investors, nonfinancial firms and consumers, as well as across the asset\nand maturity spectrum. There is significant evidence that the FOMC’s policies have\nbeen helpful in lowering rates paid by firms and consumers and, more generally, in\nsupporting aggregate demand in the face of the substantial headwinds the economy\nhas faced over the past six years.\nMost recently, economic activity picked up momentum in the second half of 2013.\nOverall, real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at over a 3-1/2 percent rate in the\nsecond half, up from an average pace of growth of about 2 percent over the previous\n2 Recently, the FOMC conducted a survey of the participants regarding the marginal costs and marginal\nefficacy of asset purchases. Most participants judged the marginal benefits of the program to outweigh\nthe costs. The survey results are summarized in Federal Open Market Committee (2013)..\n3\n\nthree years. Moreover, we’ve seen a marked pickup in consumer spending, which\nshould provide further impetus to overall growth this year. In the labor market, job\ngrowth has been solid and the unemployment rate is down to 6.7 percent — well below\nthe 8.1 percent rate that prevailed when we instituted the latest round of large-scale\nasset purchases in September 2012.\nHowever, we aren’t out of the woods yet. Balance sheet scars from the financial crisis\nare still weighing on the economy. Fiscal policy is a restraint on economic growth. And\neconomic activity abroad is not robust. The good news is that all of these headwinds\nappear to be dissipating. But risks remain. And we still have large resource gaps — for\nexample, the unemployment rate is still well above the 5-1/4 percent rate I think it\nshould be in the long run. At the same time, inflation is only 1 percent — well below the\nFOMC’s longer-run target of 2 percent. Accordingly, monetary policy is highly\naccommodative, and needs to remain so for some time.\nGiven these developments, the FOMC adjusted the mix of its tools in December and\nlast week, but maintained the overall highly accommodative stance of policy. The\nCommittee modestly reduced the pace of its monthly asset purchases from $85 billion\nto $65 billion in two separate $10 billion steps. In addition, the FOMC strengthened its\nforward guidance on the future path of short-term interest rates by emphasizing that\nrates are likely to remain at very low levels well past the time the unemployment rate\ndeclines below the 6-1/2 percent threshold that was established in December 2012 —\nespecially if inflation is expected to run below the 2 percent target.\nNotwithstanding these modest changes to the mix of tools, monetary policy will remain\nhighly accommodative for some time. Asset purchases have expanded our balance\nsheet more than fourfold to over $4 trillion dollars. Moreover, by the time rates increase,\nthey will have been near zero for about seven years, according to the FOMC’s\nprojections and the latest market expectations. These are startling facts and certainly\nget your attention. As prudent policymakers, we would be AWOL if we failed to carefully\nassess potential risks that might arise from these unusual and extraordinary policies.\nAs the FOMC’s communications indicate, the Committee has fully reviewed the\npotential costs of its policies and assesses them regularly. I think that the benefits of our\npolicy choices continue to far outweigh the potential risks. However, we must repeatedly\nthink long and hard about two risks that are mentioned often — namely, that our\nexpanded balance sheet and prolonged period of low rates raise the risk of financial\ninstability and also the risk of producing higher inflation. What can go wrong? Do we\nhave the appropriate infrastructure and tools to adequately assess and manage the\nrisks? To address these questions, we must evaluate these risks within the context of\nthe goals of monetary policy and the current state of the economy and financial\nmarkets.\n4\n\nInflation Risks\nLet me start with the risk of high inflation. As far back as mid-2009, Fed critics warned\nthat our zero policy rate and trillions of dollars in asset purchases risk generating very\nhigh inflation. On several occasions to underscore this risk, I have been presented with\n$100 trillion Zimbabwe notes (which I can assure you are worth less than the $20 gift\nlimit we have as Federal Reserve employees). The monetary policy mandates of the\nFederal Reserve are clear: to foster monetary and financial conditions that support\nmaximum employment and price stability. Since January 2012, the Fed has set an\nexplicit goal for inflation of 2 percent, as measured by the price index for total personal\nconsumption expenditures, or PCE. So, how are we doing with respect to this 2 percent\ntarget and the risk for high inflation?\nDespite many earlier predictions of unacceptably high inflation, total PCE inflation has\nbeen hovering around just 1 percent. Other inflation measures, like the well-known\nConsumer Price Index (CPI), are also well below their related benchmarks.3\nForecasters often look at core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices,\nbecause it is a better predictor of where overall prices are headed than total inflation.\nOur progress toward the 2 percent target is not noticeably faster by this metric either.\nCore PCE inflation was just 1.2 percent over the past year and has stayed at this rate\nsince last spring. Most private sector forecasts and survey measures of inflation\nexpectations have remained well anchored and do not ring any alarms of high inflation.\nExpectations embedded in asset prices tell a similar story. Sophisticated models that\nextract inflation expectations from the yield curve4 show that investors’ inflation\nexpectations at the three-year horizon are below 2 percent and have been below 2\npercent for several years.\nAll told, the potential risk of high inflation seems very low. In fact, I am concerned that\ninflation will not pick up quickly enough. As I noted, we have been stuck at 1 percent\ninflation since early 2013, and there is little indication of a pickup in the recent data. Low\ninflation is just as economically costly as high inflation. When we set an inflation target\nof 2 percent, we need to hit our target without too much delay. Simply put, we need to\naverage 2 percent inflation over the medium term. Accordingly, the current 1 percent\ninflation situation calls for extended policy accommodation. More restrictive monetary\npolicy conditions would work to reduce inflation to further unacceptably low levels.5\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\nIt is easy and most natural for a Fed policymaker to talk about inflation. Price stability is\none of the explicit goals of monetary policy as mandated by Congress. Financial stability\nrisks are more complicated. How does financial stability dovetail with the Fed’s dual\n3 Because of some differences in product coverage and statistical methodologies, total CPI inflation tends\nto average one-quarter to one-half percentage points higher than total PCE inflation. Hence, the FOMC’s\n2 percent target on total PCE inflation would translate to a 2.3 percent to 2.5 percent target for total CPI\ninflation.\n4 The yield curve is the line plotting the interest rates of assets of the same credit quality but with differing\nmaturity dates at a certain point in time.\n5 I recently discussed the costs of too-low inflation and the implications of having a 2 percent inflation\ntarget in a January 15 speech; see Evans (2014).\n5\n\nmandate? There is clearly an interdependent relationship between them. A strong and\nrobust economy with low inflation provides a key stabilizing force for beneficial credit\nintermediation and robust financial markets. At the same time, stable and well-\nfunctioning financial markets are essential for achieving maximum employment and\nprice stability. Our global experience since 2008 reinforces this critical interplay between\nmonetary and financial conditions.\nHowever, beyond these basic principles, what is the appropriate monetary policy stance\nfor achieving both financial stability and the dual mandate?\nWith inflation running well below our 2 percent long-run target and the unemployment\nrate still well above its long-term normal level, appropriate monetary policy dictates that\nlow real interest rates should prevail until the economy is further along a sustainable\npath to its potential level. This assertion is made from a mainstream macroeconomic\nperspective. Nonetheless, it is common to hear the argument that these highly\naccommodative monetary policies might sow the seeds of financial instability.\nThe fear is that excessive and persistently low interest rates would lead to excessive\nrisk-taking by some investors. For instance, some firms, such as life insurance\ncompanies and pension funds, are under pressure to meet a stream of fixed liabilities\nincurred when interest rates were higher.6 (And perhaps these liabilities were offered at\nsomewhat generous terms to begin with.) To meet commitments like these in the\ncurrent low interest rate environment, the incentive exists to reach for yield by investing\nin excessively risky assets. Furthermore, with the costs of borrowing at historically low\nlevels, other investors might simply decide that this is a good time to cheaply amplify the\nrisk and return in their portfolios by taking on more leverage.\nSo, one could reach the conclusion that historically low and stable interest rates pose a\nthreat to financial stability. This creates a seeming paradox for policymakers. The\nexisting large shortfalls in aggregate demand call for highly accommodative monetary\npolicies and historically low interest rates. Yet, such policies have the potential to raise\nthe likelihood of financial instability in the future.\nSo, the questions that I’m often asked regarding these matters are as follows: Do the\nregulators and the Fed have adequate safeguards in place to mitigate this potential\nfinancial risk? If not, should the FOMC step away from what we thought was the best\nmonetary policy with respect to our dual mandate? Should we discard our\nnonconventional tools and raise the fed funds rate in order to reduce the possibility of\nundesirable financial imbalances in the future?\nI don’t believe that such monetary policy adjustment is the right approach. I think the\ninference that persistently low interest rates pose a danger to financial stability is based\non a narrow view of the economy and is unlikely to survive a broader analysis that takes\n6 I should note that increases in interest rates since last spring have increased discount factors and thus\nlowered the present value of pension fund and other fixed nominal liabilities. For instance, see Fitch\nRatings (2013).\n6\n\ninto account all the interactions between financial markets and real economic activity. If\nmore restrictive monetary policies were pursued to generate higher interest rates, they\nwould likely result in higher unemployment and a sharp decline in asset prices, choking\nthe moderate recovery. Such an adverse economic outcome is unlikely to set a\nfavorable foundation for financial stability. Moreover, our short-term interest rate tools\nare too blunt to have a significant effect on those pockets of the financial system prone\nto inappropriate risk-taking without, at the same time, significantly damaging other\nmarkets, as well as the growth prospects for the economy as a whole. Therefore,\nstepping away from otherwise appropriate monetary policy to address potential financial\nstability risks would degrade progress toward maximum employment and price stability.\nThis approach would be a particularly poor choice when other tools are available, at\nlower social costs, to address financial stability risks.\nLet me be clear. I am not saying that financial stability concerns are not relevant for the\neconomy or that policymakers should not take decisive action against developments\nthat threaten financial stability. Rather, I am saying that the macroprudential tools\navailable to policymakers are better-suited safeguards to addressing financial risks\ndirectly. These macroprudential actions can be dialed up or down given the appropriate\nsetting of monetary policy tools, so undesirable macroeconomic outcomes are less\nlikely than if we were to resort to premature monetary tightening. After all, any decision\nto rely on more-restrictive interest rate policies to achieve financial stability at the\nexpense of poorer macroeconomic outcomes must pass a cost–benefit test. Such a test\nshould clearly illustrate that the economic outcomes from more-restrictive interest rate\npolicies — which could include much higher unemployment and even lower inflation\nthan at present — would be better and more acceptable to society than the outcomes\nthat can be achieved by using enhanced supervisory tools alone to address financial\nstability risks.\nMacroprudential Tools\nLet’s discuss some of these macroprudential tools.\nOne simple but important tool is enhanced monitoring. Even before the recent financial\ncrisis, central bankers were well aware of the key role played by stable financial markets\nin economic activity. Since the crisis, however, the analysis of financial stability issues\nhas been greatly expanded and given a more prominent role in the FOMC’s\ndeliberations. We comb through reams of data looking for evidence of incipient risks to\nfinancial stability.\nThe Federal Reserve also has revamped its approach to bank supervision substantially\nto expand the focus on macrofinancial risk. Traditional bank supervisory tools are being\nused more intensively, and new tools have been developed. Bank capital stress tests\nare one well-known addition to our supervisory toolkit. Another is the augmentation of\ntraditional microprudential supervisory efforts that analyze individual institutions with a\nwide-angle view of the banking industry. Supervisors look to identify common trends\nacross institutions and emerging concentrations of risks that might pose systemic\nthreats to the financial system. This broad view also allows supervisors to better identify\n7\n\nsound practices among firms and incorporate them into supervisory reviews and the\nfeedback provided in them.\nThe Federal Reserve has greatly expanded its surveillance efforts to financial markets\noutside of the traditional banking sector, such as the insurance industry and the\nfinancial market utilities. These more intense monitoring efforts are not confined to\nfinancial institutions per se, and reach a range of activities that might pose a potential\nthreat to financial stability. For instance, staff members from the Chicago Fed are\nactively engaged in assessing the role of high-frequency computerized trading in\nsecurities and derivatives markets and issues that arise associated with it.\nThese are just a few examples of regulatory tools available to monitor and promote\nfinancial stability. And there are a host of other instruments in our toolkit, such as\nresolution plans, liquidity requirements and single counterparty credit limits. All are\nexamples of improvements in supervisory practices aimed at reducing the likelihood of\nsystemic disruptions and containing the impact should such disruptions occur.\nConclusion\nLet me reiterate that I currently expect that low inflation and still-high unemployment will\nmean that the short-term policy rate will remain near zero well into 2015. In this\nenvironment, some have questioned the ability of these supervisory and regulatory tools\nto adequately address potential financial stability risks, arguing that a broad interest-rate\npolicy might be more effective in catching incipient risks that might fall through the\ncracks. It is certainly true that higher interest rates would permeate the entire financial\nsystem. But this is just another way of saying that raising interest rates is a blunt tool.\nHigher interest rates would reduce risk-taking where it is excessive; but they also would\nresult in a pullback in economic activity in sectors where risk-taking might already be\noverly restrained. That’s how a blunt tool works.\nIf you believe that financial stability can only be achieved through higher interest rates\n— interest rates that would do immediate damage to meeting our dual mandate goals at\na time when unemployment is still unacceptably high — then we ought to at least ask\nourselves if the financial system has become too big and too complex. This conclusion\nis particularly vexing if supervisory, macroprudential and market-discipline tools are\ninadequate. If the only way we can achieve financial stability is to raise interest rates\nabove where the forces of demand and supply in the real economy put them, then the\ncost–benefit calculus of our policy choices becomes much more complex. The possible\nbenefit of such a restrictive rate move would be to reduce risks that might potentially be\nforming in the nooks and crannies of a highly complex financial system. But the cost\nwould be higher unemployment; a risk of choking off the economic recovery; even lower\ninflation below our objective; and, somewhat paradoxically, the introduction of new\nfinancial risks by reducing asset values and credit quality. When weighing the costs and\nbenefits of alternative policy actions under these circumstances, I would have to\nquestion whether the financial system has become too complex — perhaps complex\nenough to generate negative marginal social value. Rather than degrading our\nmacroeconomic performance through suboptimal monetary policies, I also would have\n8\n\nto consider whether we should contemplate big changes to the financial system — a lot\nmore rules, substantially higher capital requirements for all institutions and maybe even\nfewer financial products.\nHowever, I have a more favorable view of the social value of our financial system and\nthe efficacy of supervision and regulation. Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve\nhas expanded its macroprudential toolkit and enhanced its microprudential tools. We\nhave also reoriented our approach to supervision to take full advantage of the Federal\nReserve System staff’s wide-ranging expertise on macroeconomic and financial\ndevelopments and risks. I believe that these regulatory efforts can effectively minimize\nthe risks of another crisis and increase the resiliency of the financial system. We can\nachieve these objectives without having to resort to wholesale changes to the financial\nsystem and without degrading our monetary policy goals. Maintaining the effectiveness\nof the financial system for generating stronger and more robust economic growth\ncontinues to be a crucial objective for public policy. Thank you for your time, and I would\nbe happy to take your questions.\nReferences\nEvans, Charles, 2014, “Recurring themes for the new year,” speech at the Corridor\nEconomic Forecast Luncheon, Coralville, IA, January 15, available at\nhttp://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/speeches/2014/01_15_14_themes_n\new_year.cfm.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2013, meeting minutes, December 17–18, available\nat http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20131218.htm.\nFitch Ratings, 2013, “Fitch: U.S. corporate pension plans underfunded status improves,”\npress release, New York, August 15, available at\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/detail.cfm?pr_id=799535.\n9",

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nInforming the Future of Housing Finance: Lessons from the Recent Past\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIt’s a pleasure to be here this morning. Since the start of the financial crisis, the Federal\nReserve System has undertaken a series of unprecedented actions to help stabilize the\nfinancial markets and promote economic recovery. What is less well known is that the\nFederal Reserve has also been working to respond to the foreclosure crisis on Main\nStreet, leveraging its research, community affairs and supervision and regulation\nfunctions to support innovative foreclosure prevention and neighborhood stabilization\nstrategies at the local level. Today, I want to focus my remarks on some of those efforts\nas well as on other public policies that have been used to address the foreclosure crisis.\nFinally, I’d like to offer a few thoughts on policy alternatives that may prevent similar\nproblems from occurring in the future.\nAs a nation we value homeownership because of the many benefits it brings, for both\nfamilies and communities.1 Perhaps foremost is its potential for building household\nwealth. In addition, communities with high levels of homeownership tend to have greater\ninvolvement in school and civic organizations, higher graduation rates, lower housing\nturnover and higher home values. Simply stated, homeowners tend to put down deeper\nroots, and that is good for communities as well as families.\nRecognition of these benefits has made encouraging homeownership a national priority.\nTax incentives, FHA mortgage insurance and sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac all contributed to a long rise in U.S. homeownership—from 45 percent in 1940 to a\npeak of 69 percent in 2004.\nOf course, homeownership is only good for families and communities if it can be\nsustained. Home purchases that are very highly leveraged or unaffordable subject the\nborrower to a great deal of risk. There’s no guarantee, as we’ve learned recently, that\nprices have to rise. Moreover, even in a strong economy, unforeseen life events and\nrisks in local real estate markets represent vulnerabilities for highly leveraged\nborrowers.\nThus it was very destructive when, in the early part of this decade, dubious underwriting\npractices and mortgage products inappropriate for mass consumption became more\ncommon. It is difficult to understand how loose underwriting, high degrees of leverage\nand the broad marketing of exotic and often very high-cost mortgage products can\npromote homeownership. In fact, these practices actually took us in the other direction,\nas homeownership began to decline even while mortgage underwriting standards\ncontinued to loosen. Moreover, partly as a result of these practices, we’ve seen an\n2\n\nunprecedented housing market collapse that contributed to a very deep recession\nmarked by many lost jobs. And now homeownership has declined for six straight years.\nAlthough there are some encouraging signs of general economic recovery and some\nevidence of home price stabilization, we are certainly not out of the woods. Projections\nsuggest foreclosed housing units could reach as high as 3 million in 2010 with over a\nmillion lender repossessions. Mortgage distress is not limited to those with subprime\nloans. For example, in the state of Indiana, the inventory of subprime foreclosures\nactually decreased by about 4 percent from 2008 to 2009, while the inventory of prime\nforeclosures rose by over 36 percent. This is because job loss and unemployment are\nnow causing more defaults than imprudent lending.\nPublic policy response to the housing market collapse has become increasingly\naggressive as its seriousness and difficulty has been more fully recognized.\nForeclosures are very costly for borrowers, lenders and communities. Prices of\nforeclosed homes often drop dramatically, implying big losses for lenders. Values of\nnearby homes are also affected, so large clusters of foreclosures can be devastating to\ncommunities.\nOne might expect lenders to modify mortgages, making them more affordable for\nborrowers, rather than accept large losses on foreclosed properties. However, the\nsecuritization process appears to have created conflicts between the interests of\nservicers and lenders. These and other impediments have kept the number of\nmodifications lower than we might have hoped. The desire to see more modifications\nand fewer foreclosures has led to federal efforts, such as the Home Affordable\nMortgage Program, or HAMP. To date, the number of successful modifications remains\nrelatively small compared with the scale of the problem. Thus the search for solutions\ngoes on. Some recent additions to HAMP include assistance for unemployed\nhomeowners, more principal write-downs and plans to launch the FHA Refinance\nOption later this year. While the number of loan modifications are small compared with\nthe number of foreclosures, one success the industry cites is that the programs have\nbrought some standardization and consistency to the market.\nIn addition to federal interventions, many local and state agencies, as well as local\npractitioners have worked to lessen the effects of the crisis. They have pursued\nstrategies ranging from land banking to court prescribed mediation between borrowers\nand lenders. The Chicago Fed has been very happy to partner with other organizations\nin many of these efforts, lending its resources to assist throughout the Seventh Federal\nReserve District.\nWe’ve convened meetings of the key groups working toward mitigating the effects of the\ncrisis. We have participated in research efforts to identify gaps in resources needed for\nforeclosure mitigation. And we’ve formed work groups to bring resources to the hardest\nhit areas. Home buyer counseling is a critical need in hard-hit areas, and we’ve helped\nmany of our community development partners to organize daylong “mega-events” that\nhave served thousands of troubled borrowers. Moreover, we’ve partnered with and\n3\n\nbrought together housing advocates, lenders, academics and key government officials\nto discuss foreclosure issues and develop solutions. In some cases, alliances have\nbeen formed right on the spot to create and implement programs to keep people in their\nhomes.\nHere in Indiana, the Chicago Fed has had a long-standing working relationship with the\nIndianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership (INHP) on affordable housing and\nhomeownership preservation issues. We’ve also worked with others throughout Indiana,\nsuch as the Mortgage Fraud and Foreclosure Task Force, the Indiana Mortgage\nBankers Association and the Indiana Foreclosure Prevention Network. We regularly\nparticipate in homeownership preservation seminars, which provide delinquent\nborrowers with access to their mortgage lenders for the purpose of finding options for\nstaying in their homes. And, as job loss has become a leading cause of foreclosures,\nwe’ve been working with a number of organizations in Indiana to help promote\nemployment in local communities.\nIt’s easy to be discouraged about the outcomes of efforts to deal with the mortgage\ncrisis. While we can point to efforts that have saved thousands of homeowners from\nforeclosures, millions are still losing their homes. But, while we could always hope for\nmore, I think the groups like INHP that have worked on this very difficult problem have a\nlot to be proud of.\nI’d now like to talk briefly about the question of what can be done to prevent problems\nlike this from recurring in the future—a topic that I think is informed by some recent\nresearch done at the Chicago Fed, including on a paper on a program run by INHP. The\nmortgage crisis was caused in part by the use of inappropriate mortgage products.\nWhile economists usually give great respect to individual choice, in this case it seems\nthat many borrowers made poor choices and that at least some lenders abetted those\npoor choices. People who had no business getting exotic mortgages, such as those\nwithout amortization, not only got them, but got them without having their income and\nability to pay verified.\nHow might public policy respond to evidence of people being put into inappropriate\nnonstandard mortgage products?2 One possibility would be to impose very stringent\nregulatory oversight that eliminates such products all together. Such a policy would\ncertainly prevent unqualified borrowers from obtaining high-risk mortgage products.\nHowever, such specialized products may actually be appropriate for certain people, so\nsuch a policy would have some real costs.\nAn alternative approach would be to place few restrictions on the choices available to\nborrowers and rely instead on better educating them about homeownership and\nmortgages. That would make borrowers better prepared to make informed financial\ndecisions. Such an approach might keep those who shouldn’t be in exotic mortgages\nfrom getting them while leaving such mortgages available to the small group of people\nfor whom they are appropriate. A big question, however, is whether financial education\ncan work.\n4\n\nStaff members at the Chicago Fed have recently undertaken a thorough review of\nstudies evaluating the effects of financial education.3 What they find is that the evidence\non the effectiveness of education and counseling is rather mixed. Some financial\neducation programs improve financial outcomes, and some portion of this effect is due\nto increased financial literacy. However, other programs are less successful. More\nrigorous evaluation of specific programs is necessary to understand what can be done.\nMy take is that financial education can work, but the programs must be very well\ndesigned and rigorous for financial education to be truly effective. Whether such\nprograms can be implemented on a wide scale at reasonable costs is an open question.\nOne of the programs our staff evaluated was that of the INHP.4 As many of you know,\nthe INHP program serves low- and moderate-income households, on a strictly voluntary\nbasis. The goal is to prepare borrowers for homeownership by shoring up their finances.\nClasses and one-on-one counseling sessions cover money management, budgeting,\ncredit score maintenance and home buying mechanics.\nThe program can take up to two years, and clients are considered successful if they are\nable to satisfy underwriting guidelines of external lending partners or the INHP lending\ncommittee. The program has strict requirements, and clients that cannot keep up may\nbe asked to leave. Importantly, INHP continues to work with the client after the home\npurchase and is actively involved with the client if problems occur.\nPrevious research showed that INHP clients improved their credit scores during\ncounseling, better preparing them for the mortgage application process.5 Our\nresearchers evaluated whether this translated into better loan performance. The answer\nappears to be that it did. Compared with other borrowers, INHP clients on average\nstarted with significantly lower FICO scores and incomes. They also typically had lower\ndown payments. Yet, despite entering the mortgage process in worse financial shape\nrelative to other borrowers, INHP clients had a lower default rate over a 12-month\nperiod—they had a rate of 3.8 percent versus 6.3 percent for other borrowers.\nImportantly, after controlling for an array of additional influences, the difference between\nthe default rates of the two groups appears even stronger—the 12-month default rate\nwas typically 8–9 percentage points lower for INHP clients than for comparable\nborrowers not participating in the program. This is impressive and I want to recognize\nthe INHP for its efforts.\nThat said, the success of counseling is certainly not guaranteed. Our researchers also\nevaluated the effects of a mandatory counseling program introduced in Chicago as a\nresult of a controversial piece of legislation called Illinois House Bill 4050.6 This law\ngrew out of concerns that predatory lenders were taking advantage of naïve, less\nsophisticated borrowers in certain markets. It required low FICO score applicants or\nthose taking out nontraditional, high-risk mortgages in certain zip codes to go through a\nbrief counseling session with a HUD-accredited counselor prior to the contract closing.\nThe purpose was to discuss the contract terms and whether the loan product was a\ngood fit for the mortgage applicant. This session typically occurred a few days prior to\n5\n\nthe closing. Our researchers found that such counseling had little effect. This is perhaps\nunsurprising given its extent and when it took place. Increasing participants’ financial\nsophistication is not easy.\nThe ineffectiveness of the program’s counseling did not, however, mean this program\nhad no impact. In fact, our researchers found that the introduction of the mandatory\ncounseling program significantly changed the behavior and performance of borrowers.\nSpecifically, fewer high-risk loans were originated because some lenders, concerned\nabout having their mortgage terms scrutinized by counselors and being accused of\npredatory lending, chose to exit the market. Additionally, borrowers were able to avoid\nthe counseling sessions by taking alternative mortgage products that did not require\nfinancial counseling. While one can argue that this decrease in the supply of mortgages\nhad a downside in terms of decreasing borrowers’ choices, the analysis found that the\nborrowers who were able to obtain mortgages performed significantly better than similar\napplicants in zip codes without the counseling requirement.\nThese two programs each affected the performance of loans, but they did so in quite\ndifferent ways. In the case of INHP, the counseling apparently affected the behavior of\npotential borrowers and helped applicants better perform on their mortgage\narrangements. In the Chicago program, a positive impact resulted from some lenders\navoiding the new environment and borrowers choosing products that did not require\ncounseling.\nThese findings fit quite well with the principles of a relatively new school of thought\nknown as behavioral economics, which recognizes that people frequently make\nsubstantial mistakes in their economic decisions. In fact, these mistakes are so\nsystematic that it is possible to alleviate many of their worst consequences by\nmarginally adjusting the context in which the decisions are made. The costs resulting\nfrom the adjustment may be relatively minor and less costly, for example, than the\nconsequences of prohibiting certain products altogether. In mortgage markets,\nprohibitions of products intended to “protect” borrowers could result in significant\nreductions in the availability of credit. This could prove costly as it would preclude some\nqualified customers from obtaining higher-risk mortgage products that they readily\nunderstand and can repay.\nAdditionally, behaviorists would argue that mass-scale counseling to promote informed\nfinancial decision-making may be very difficult and costly. A behaviorist’s approach\nwould be to give consumers choices, but to incent them to make what policymakers\nwould consider most likely the proper choice more frequently. For example, in the\naffected Chicago markets, the borrowers were free to choose among alternative product\nofferings, but had to participate in the counseling program if they took out a high-risk\nmortgage product. Thus this relatively low-cost incentive to avoid the high-risk product\nwas quite effective at “nudging” borrowers toward the low-risk product option—usually\nthe “proper choice” from a public policy perspective. We may look to behavioral\neconomics more often as we evaluate new policy options aimed at avoiding the\nmortgage market problems we have seen in the recent past.\n6\n\nIn summary, I’ve discussed the public policy response, including the role of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago, as the housing market crisis has evolved. I have also\ndiscussed the means to protect against future foreclosure problems by better preparing\nloan applicants for the homeownership process. While financial education and\ncounseling can be effective in generating more knowledgeable homeowners, they must\nbe administered in a way that is timely and appropriate for both the borrower and the\nlender. Obviously, effective programs require significant time and effort if they are to\nresult in significant changes in behavior and financial performance. Alternative\napproaches that attach small costs to choices that are likely to be risky are, I think, also\nwell worth considering. At the Fed, we will continue to do our part to encourage further\nresearch, participate in the dialogue and coordinate concerned groups that want to work\ntoward sustainable housing markets, whatever form they may take.\nThank you.\n1 See, for example, Daniel Aaronson, 2000, “A note on the benefits of homeownership,” Journal of Urban\nEconomics, Vol. 47, No. 3, May, pp. 356–369; Robert D.
