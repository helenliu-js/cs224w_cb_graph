    "text": "Some Perspectives on Regulatory Reform Proposals\nRemarks at the\nInstitute of Regulation & Risk North Asia\nMarch 30, 2010\nHong Kong, China\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK\nOF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nInstitute of Regulation & Risk North Asia\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIntroduction\nThank you for that kind introduction and for making me feel welcome in Hong Kong.\nThough I've been here only a short time, I find it easy to see why this unique city has\nbecome so important to the financial services industry throughout the world. I'd also like\nto thank Christopher Rogers and the Institute of Regulation & Risk for their kind\ninvitation. It was that invitation that prompted my thinking in putting together this two-\nweek visit to China. I know other Federal Reserve presidents have participated in this\nevent in the past, and I am pleased to add my name to that list and the list of\ndistinguished panelists who have joined us here tonight.\nWe are slowly emerging from the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. The hardships\ncreated by these exceptional circumstances for households and businesses are well\nknown. Governments and regulators around the world have responded to the crisis with\na variety of aggressive and innovative policy actions, including giving special assistance\nto specific institutions.\n\nNow, as we slowly emerge from the crisis, we are engaged in a vigorous debate on how\nbest to address the major weaknesses in our financial regulatory framework that were\nrevealed by the crisis. Our goal, clearly, is to avoid another crisis of this magnitude.\nFinancial reform will not be easy. We face complex problems that will require a\ncomprehensive, multi-pronged approach. But reform is critical for ensuring our long-\nterm economic stability.\nToday, I would like to offer my thoughts on some of the reform proposals that are being\ndiscussed. I should note that my remarks reflect my own views and are not those of the\nFederal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\nTo highlight some of the changes that are being considered, there are proposals that\nwould assign monetary policy a more active role in fighting asset bubbles; proposals\nthat would strengthen current microprudential regulations; proposals that would\nintroduce a systemic regulator and macroprudential regulations; and proposals that\nwould create resolution authority – particularly for systemically important financial\ninstitutions.\nTime does not permit me to discuss the specifics of each of these proposals today.\nInstead, I would like to offer my thoughts on some of the challenges we are likely to face\nin implementing even the most well-thought-out policies.\n\nLet me be clear. I don’t bring up these potential challenges as roadblocks to the healthy\ndebate that is underway. Rather, I offer them as issues we need to consider as we build\na better financial infrastructure.\nOne preemptive action that is being debated concerns the role of monetary policy in\ncombating asset bubbles. Given the rapid rise in some asset prices prior to the recent\ncrisis, there are increasing calls for central banks to be more proactive in responding to\nsigns that an asset bubble may be emerging and to raise their target rates in order to\nlower asset prices that, by historical standards, seem unusually high. In previous\nforums, I have discussed why I view these proposals with skepticism.1 I won’t cover the\nsame ground here again. Instead, let me just note that I am skeptical about our ability to\neasily and definitively sort out in real time whether a rapid increase in asset prices is\nassociated with overvaluation. That is, how confidently can we state that we are in the\nmidst of a bubble? I also think that monetary policy is too blunt a tool for pricking\nbubbles: It can’t be targeted precisely and it will affect other financial and\nmacroeconomic variables in addition to the suspected bubble asset. In addition, the\ntypical changes in interest rates that a central bank might contemplate are likely to be\ntoo small to produce big changes in asset prices.\nFortunately, monetary policy is not the only tool that policymakers have to deal with\nfinancial exuberance. In my view, redesigning regulations and improving market\ninfrastructure offer more promising paths. Regulation may or may not be sufficient to\navoid all of the events that create crises, but it should go a long way toward doing so.\n11 For instance, see Evans (2009a and 2009b).\n\nBetter supervision and a sound regulatory infrastructure can also increase the resiliency\nof markets and institutions and their ability to withstand adverse shocks that do occur.\nHow do we promote such resiliency?\nWithin the existing structure, regulators have the ability to promote better, more resilient\nfinancial markets, either through rule-making or by serving as a coordinator of private\ninitiatives. They can also encourage more and better disclosure of information—a key\nelement of effective risk management. A number of initiatives along these lines have\nbeen taken and additional ones are being considered.2\nWe can use existing regulatory tools more effectively, but we also need to address the\nshortcomings of current regulations. The ongoing work of the Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision regarding the possible introduction of liquidity standards and\nadjustments to the existing capital requirements are examples of such efforts.\nWhile such enhancements to micro-prudential regulations are necessary, I would argue\nthat they are not close to being sufficient to address the complex issues we faced during\nthe recent crisis. Success in preventing and controlling potential risks requires very\nearly and courageous action by policymakers. Typically, risks and problems in the\nfinancial system build over a number of years. There is an awful amount of uncertainty\n2 For instance, in recent years, regulators have actively supported the development of the Trade\nInformation Warehouse (a central repository for trade reporting of over-the-counter credit derivatives\ncontracts) and clearing houses for credit default swaps, such as ICE Trust.\n\nas to whether risks are developing; how they will be perpetuated; and when to take\naction. Microprudential regulations alone are not likely to resolve these issues.\nLet me illustrate the sort of problems a microprudential regulator faces with a specific\nexample. As you know, the problems with residential mortgages, particularly with\nsubprime mortgages, were one of the key areas that precipitated the current crisis.\nCurrently, the U.S. financial system faces problems with commercial real estate (CRE)\nloans. At the end of 2009, depository institutions in the U.S. held over $1.5 trillion in\ncommercial real estate and construction loans on their books. In addition, there are\ncurrently nearly $800 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)\noutstanding. Over the past two years, delinquencies on these loans and securities have\nbeen rising at an uncomfortably rapid rate [link to slide 1]. Of the over $1 trillion in\ncommercial real estate loans held by depository institutions today, nearly 4 percent are\nnoncurrent.3 This ratio was about 0.5 percent before the crisis (June 2007). The picture\nis even worse for the riskier construction and land development loans. While these\nloans total less than $0.5 trillion, the noncurrent portion had risen from 1.5 percent at\nthe end of June 2007 to nearly 16 percent by the end of last quarter. For CRE loans\npackaged into securities, serious delinquencies represent 4 percent of all CMBS\ncurrently outstanding, up from nearly zero before the crisis.\nDoes such a fast rise in CRE and CMBS delinquencies mean that bank examiners\nmissed clear signs of forthcoming problems and failed to take action? Commercial real\nestate loans are a key problem area for the banks in my District. I went to my\n3 Noncurrent loans are those that are 90 days or more past due plus loans in nonaccrual status.\n\nsupervisory staff and said: “I know you are struggling with commercial real estate loan\nportfolios. What are the difficulties? What do you think we needed to have done in the\npast in order to avoid the current problems?”\nI have to admit that their response made me pause. They said “You know, Charlie, if we\nwanted to avoid the current situation, we needed to act very, very early – probably in\n2004 or 2005.” That is a full two to three years before the onset of problems in the\nsector. Clearly, we needed to act very early. But at that time, it would have been difficult\nto argue convincingly in favor of reigning in this lending. The economy was coming out\nof the jobless recovery and just beginning to gain traction. And the banking industry had\nproven it could maintain profits through a recession, it had reduced problem loans back\nto historically low levels, and it appeared to have more than sufficient capital to cushion\nagainst potential losses.4\nGiven previous problems with commercial real estate loans, my supervisors understood\nthe potential risks. Here is a typical situation they faced. Imagine you are an examiner\nand you go out to review a large financial institution in 2005. The institution is\nwarehousing commercial real estate loans prior to securitization during a period when\nCMBS issuance is just taking off and, for every $1,000 in CRE loans, only $6 are\nnoncurrent. Nonetheless, as an examiner, you have a discussion with the bank\n4 At the end of 2004, return on equity at all commercial banks in the U.S. was 13.08 percent, near its\nhistorical peak of 16.23 percent in the second quarter of 1993. Return on assets were similarly high, and\nnet charge-offs accounted for only 0.68 percent of total loans, well below 1.31 percent reached at the end\nof 2001.\n\nmanagers and you learn about their lending practices, and you kind of wonder, “How\nwell-controlled is all of this?”\nThe loan officers will give you some very good arguments about what their business is\nand how the risks are being controlled. First, they are not really storing the loans on\ntheir books. They are underwriting the loans with the full intention of packaging them\ninto securities. They have to build up a critical mass before securitization, but they are\nnot going to keep the loans.\nFrom the banks’ perspective, they are not in the storage business. They are in the\ntransportation business. It is rather short term – 60, 90 days. Presumably, the risk is\nonly proportional to how long they are holding on to it – which is not very long.\nFurthermore, during this period, real estate prices are going up, delinquencies are\nnegligible, and banks have a variety of hedges in place. They look at commercial real\nestate prices and think, if needed, they can get out of their portfolio at little cost. And\neven if some losses materialize, they have adequate capital.\nI have some interesting people on my staff who can push back in a pretty challenging\nfashion. But at the end of the day, after carefully considering the banks’ arguments, they\nthink: “All right, I guess the loan officers are looking at this pretty reasonably and are\nprotecting their institution.” And the risk to the deposit insurance fund from all this\nactivity seems pretty small. So, you end up being convinced that the activity is probably\nOK.\n\nToday, with hindsight, we know that while most of the micro risks appeared very small\nat the time, their sum was far less than the macro risk that was silently building up.\nThat’s the key thing: A collection of negligible micro risks can add up to a far greater\nmacro risk. Focusing on individual institutions and controlling risks on a firm-by-firm\nbasis are not enough for detecting and controlling systemwide stress points.\nThat is why we need macroprudential supervision and regulation.\nSuppose for a particular class of assets, values decline on an economy-wide basis. This\nmeans losses are going to be taken at the macro level. Perhaps managers at a few\nindividual banks can be smart, foresee the price declines, and liquidate their positions in\ntime to avoid large losses at their institution. But the macro economy has to take these\nlosses, and that’s where we get stuck. Not everyone can get through the exit door at\nonce; someone has to end up bearing the macro losses.\nThis is why macroprudential regulations that aim to assess and control systemwide risks\nshould play a critical role in our regulatory structure.\nFor instance, dynamic capital requirements and loan loss provisions that vary over the\ncycle can temper some of the boom–bust trends we have seen in the past. History\nshows that during boom times, when financial institutions are perhaps in an exuberant\nstate, they may not price risks fully in their underwriting and risk-management decisions.\n\nDuring downturns, faced with eroding capital cushions, increased uncertainty, and\nbinding capital constraints, some institutions may become overcautious and excessively\ntighten lending standards. Both behaviors tend to amplify the business cycle. Varying\nrequired capital loan loss provisions over the cycle could serve to offset some of this\nvolatility.\nWe saw the advantages of a systemic, macroprudential approach firsthand during the\nimplementation of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) – the so-called\n“stress tests.” Last spring, the Federal Reserve led a coordinated examination of the\nlargest 19 U.S. banks. We reviewed the institutions simultaneously, applying a common\nset of assumptions and scenarios across all of them. Such an approach provided us\nwith a view of these banks in their totality, as well as the financial condition of individual\ninstitutions on a stand-alone basis. The horizontal view was essential in assessing how\nrisks taken individually by each bank are correlated and how they can add up to more\nthan the sum of individual components. The review also had a forward-looking element\nthat assessed the likely condition of the banks under a specific set of adverse economic\nconditions and determined the amount of capital the banks would need under these\n“stress” conditions. Such procedures also enable supervisors to identify best practices\nin risk management and to push banks with weak controls to improve and adopt these\nindustry best practices. Indeed, supervisors at the Federal Reserve have already begun\nto adopt such an approach.\n\nHowever, even with such macroprudential strategies, we are going to face challenges.\nLet’s think about what, as a hypothetical macroprudential regulator, we would have to\ndo. What should be the early call focus? What should we be looking at? When should\nwe be looking at it? How confident are we that that we are actually going to be able to\nidentify the problem? A macroprudential regulator is confronted with the same type of\nquestions a microprudential regulator faces, but at a systemwide level.\nConsider these questions within the context of commercial real estate. The facts are,\ntoday, CMBS and CRE loans have large delinquencies. Could anyone have made this\ncall confidently in time to arrest the problems we face today?\nOn this slide [link to slide 2], on the top panel, you see that the outstanding volume of\nCMBS ramps up in 2004, 2005. At the same time, commercial real estate prices (shown\nin the middle panel) continue to rise well into 2007. On the bottom panel, we see the\nperformance of loans originated during this period, depending on when the loans were\nmade. Loans originated later in the credit cycle are performing worse than older loans.\nFor instance, loans underwritten in 2005 did not reach a 1 percent delinquency rate until\nabout 42 months (3.5 years) after origination. In contrast, loans made in 2008 reached\nthe 1 percent delinquency mark only six months after origination. The progressively\nworsening performance of loans originated later in the credit cycle is likely due to looser\nunderwriting standards that supported the issuance boom.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I can point to the inflection point in volume and say “I\nshould have put my finger on that right then.”\nAt that point in the credit cycle, “shouting” would have been an important part of risk-\ncontrol, as it would have emphasized potential risks to the market players.\nBut I can’t imagine that supervisors’ concerns would have been taken seriously in 2005\nor 2006 -- even if they started going out and shouting to the heavens that there is a big,\nbig problem and we need to do more about it. Recall that, at that time, real estate prices\nwere ramping up and delinquencies were low. Indeed, in 2007, the Federal Reserve,\nalong with other bank regulators, issued a supervisory guidance on concentrations in\ncommercial real estate. 5 We also gave a number of speeches prior to the crisis about\nrisk pricing and about market exuberance – to little avail. These warnings were largely\nignored and we got a lot of push-back from banks. During boom periods when risks are\nsilently building up, there are a lot of people with a lot of money at stake who will come\nout against such pronouncements. So, if policymakers do not follow words with actions,\nthen we are not likely to make much progress. Shouting and supervision – together –\nare essential.\nI raised some potential issues with both micro- and macro-prudential regulations.\n5 See, “ SR 07-1 Interagency Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate” available at\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/2007/SR0701.htm. More recently, the Federal Reserve\nissued a supervisory guidance on managing interest rate risk (“SR 10-1 Interagency Advice on Interest\nRate Risk,” available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/2010/sr1001.htm) and\nhighlighted it in speeches (for instance, see Kohn (2010)). In addition, the Federal Reserve – along with\nthe other Federal banking agencies – issued a policy statement on funding and liquidity risk management\non March 17, 2010 (available at: http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20100317a.htm).\n\nHow do we address these issues? This is where we would take full advantage of our\nmulti-pronged approach to regulatory reform. If we are not certain that a particular\napproach may not be as effective as we would like, we can put more pressure on other\nlevers to obtain a desired amount of risk control. So, if we think that macroprudential\nregulations may have some potential operational issues, we would need to implement\nmore stringent capital and liquidity requirements than we would otherwise to overcome\nthese issues.\nThis is why we need a multi-pronged approach to a robust regulatory structure: a\nstructure that takes full advantage of the existing tools supervisors have ; a structure\nthat supplements the existing one with dynamic capital requirements and a\ncomprehensive approach to risk management ; a structure that includes a\nmacroprudential supervisor than can monitor and assess incipient risks across\ninstitutions and markets and, when necessary, impose higher regulatory requirements\non firms that pose systemic risks.\nHowever, even with such a structure, it would be hubris on the part of policymakers to\nassume that we would be able to prevent financial stress at all financial institutions.\nTherefore, we also need to contain the disruptive spillovers that result from the failure of\nsystemically important institutions without resorting to bailouts or ad hoc rescues. A\nnecessary element of this is having a mechanism for resolving the failure of a\n\nsystemically important institution.6 This is something we currently lack in many cases,\nthough there are proposals now under discussion that would provide this resolution\npower.\nAnother issue that arises in the regulatory reform debate is whether the central bank\nshould be entrusted with supervision and regulation responsibilities. There are many\nsynergies between monetary policy and supervision and regulation that I and others\nhave discussed in previous speeches.7 Let me point out a couple of reasons why it\nmight be optimal for a central bank to have a key role in financial stability and\nregulation.\nThe reality is that central banks have the unique ability to act as the lender-of-last-resort\nduring financial crises. The central bank cannot use this tool effectively if it is not\nknowledgeable about the financial condition of the institutions it might lend to,\nparticularly if such loans need to be made at very short notice.\nThe lender-of-last-resort role inevitably thrusts the central bank into efforts to promote\nfinancial stability and avoid crises. If, however, central banks have no supervision and\nregulation tools, they are constrained to act with the only tool at their disposal –\nmonetary policy.\n6 See Evans (2009c) for my views on the advantages of resolution authority and the issues it would\naddress.\n7 For instance, see Bernanke (2010), Evans (2010), Kashyap (2010), and Volcker (2010).\n\nI already mentioned that I am skeptical about using monetary policy to control financial\nexuberance. But without supervisory powers, there may be no choice. We know that\ntime consistency issues can lead a central bank to choose inflationary outcomes in the\nshort run, even though there is no long-run tradeoff between output growth and price\nstability. Ken Rogoff pointed out that one way to deal with this issue would be to appoint\na conservative central banker who would be tougher than the public. This would ensure\nthat appropriate decisions would be made and appropriate actions would be taken.\nNow, consider the reaction function of a central banker that has the additional\nresponsibility for financial stability – but not the additional tools provided by a\nsupervision and regulation role. Such a central banker might have to act against\nexuberance in financial markets more actively than it would otherwise. That would be\nentirely necessary and appropriate to preserve financial stability. However, that policy\nmay not be the most appropriate one at that time for addressing the traditional goals of\nmonetary policy of maximum sustainable employment and price stability. A central bank\nwith three goals and only one lever is a recipe for producing some difficult policy\ndilemmas.\nTo sum up, it is clear that, in order to avoid a situation like the one we have faced in the\npast two years, we need to fortify our regulatory lines of defense. We need to change\nthe rules of regulation to be more efficient and effective in their design and\n\nimplementation. But we also need to openly acknowledge the challenges policymakers\nand regulators are likely to face in containing potential financial crises. Despite all the\nchallenges, I believe that we can design a more effective regulatory structure through\ndiscussions such as the one we are having today.\nThank you.\n\nREFERENCES:\nBernanke, Ben S., 2010, The Federal Reserve’s Role in Bank Supervision, Testimony\nbefore the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, Washington, DC, March 17.\nhttp://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100317a.htm\nEvans, Charles L., 2009a. “The International Financial Crisis: Asset Price Exuberance\nand Macroprudential Regulation.” Remarks given at the 2009 International Banking\nConference on September 24, 2009 in Chicago, IL.

    "text": "Can VARs Describe Monetary Policy?\nCharles L. Evans\nKenneth N. Kuttner\n(cid:3)\nApril 22, 1998\nAbstract\nRecent research has questioned the usefulness of Vector Autoregression (VAR)\nmodels as a description of monetary policy, especially in light of the low correlation\nbetween forecast errors from VARs and those derived from Fed funds futures rates.\nThispaperpresentsthreefindingsonVARs’abilitytodescribemonetarypolicy. First,\nthe correlation between forecast errors is a misleading measure of how closely the\nVARforecast mimics the futures market’s. In particular, the low correlation is partly\ndue to a weak positive correlation between the VAR forecasts and the futures market\nerrors. Second, Fedfunds rate forecasts from common VARspecifications dotend to\nbe noisy, but this can be remedied by estimating more parsimonious models on post-\n1982data. Third,timeaggregation problems causedbythestructure oftheFedfunds\nfutures market can distort the timing and magnitude of shocks derived from futures\nrates,andcomplicate comparisons withVAR-basedforecasts.\n1 Introduction\nHow does monetary policy affect the economy? To answer that question requires solving\nabasicsimultaneityproblem: monetarypolicyaffects theeconomywhileat thesametime\nresponding endogenously to changing macroeconomic conditions.

A more common approach,\nhowever, is the Vector Autoregression technique developed by Sims (1972), (1980a) and\n(1980b). In this procedure, changes in the monetary policy instrument that are not ex-\nplained by the variables included in the model are interpreted as exogenous changes in\npolicy,orpolicy“shocks”. Christiano,EichenbaumandEvans(1997)providesasurveyof\nthislineofresearch.\nOne unresolved question is how well simple econometric procedures, like VARs, can\ndescribe the monetary authority’s response to economic conditions, and by extension, the\npolicy shocks used to identify policy’s effects on the economy. There are several reasons\nto be skeptical of the VAR approach. VAR models (indeed, all econometric models) typi-\ncally includea relativelysmall numberof variables, while the Fed is presumed to “look at\neverything” in formulating monetary policy. By assuming linearity, VARs rule out plausi-\nble asymmetries in the response of policy, such as those resulting from an “opportunistic”\ndisinflation policy. VARs’ coefficients are assumed to remain constant over time, despite\nwell-documentedchangesin theFed’s objectivesand operatingprocedures.\nThe goal of this paper is to assess VARs’ accuracy in predicting changes in mone-\ntary policy, and the shock measures derived from those predictions, using forecasts from\nthe Federal funds futures market as a basis for comparison. Section 2 reviews the VAR\nmethodology, and its putative deficiencies. Section 3 shows that the correlation between\ntheVAR and the futures market forecast errors can givea misleadingpictureofthe VAR’s\naccuracy,andsuggestslookinginsteadattherelationshipbetweentheforecaststhemselves.\nThe results in section 4 show that profligacy per se doesn’t hurt the VAR’s performance,\nbut reducing the number of lags and estimating the model over a more recent subsample\ncan improvethemodel’sforecast accuracy. Section 5 discussesthetimeaggregationprob-\nlems inherent in extracting policy surprises from Fed funds futures data. The conclusions,\nsummarized in section 6, are that VARs mimic the futures market’s forecasts reasonably\nwell, but that it would be misleading to use futures market forecasts as the only basis for\ncomparison.\n2 VARs: the technique and its critiques\nThe reduced form of a VAR simply involves the regression of some vector of variables, x,\non lagsofx:\nx\nt\n=\nA\n(\nL\n)\nx\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n+\nu\nt\n:\n(1)\n2\n\nA\n(\nL\n)\nis a polynomial in the lag operator, and u is a vector of disturbances, where\nt\nE\n(\nu u\nt 0 t\n) =\nW . In monetary applications, the x vector would include one (or more) indi-\nt\ncators of monetary policy, along with the other macroeconomic and financial variables.\nThe widely-used model of Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (CEE) (1996a), includes\nthe Federal funds rate, r , logarithmsof lagged payroll employment(N), thepersonal con-\nt\nsumption deflator (P), nonborrowed reserves (NBR), total reserves (TR), and M1, and the\nsmoothedgrowthrateofsensitivematerialsprices(PCOM).1 Thefundsrateequationfrom\ntheCEE modelis:\nr\nt\n=\nb\n0\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n1\n1 ;\nr\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n2\n1 ;\nlnN\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n3\n1 ;\nlnP\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n4\n1 ;\nPCOM\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n5\n1 ;\nlnNBR\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n6\n1 ;\nlnTR\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\n12\n(cid:229)\ni\n=\nb\n7\n1 ;\nlnM1\ni t\n(cid:0)\ni\n+\nu\nt\n;\naregressionoftheFedfundsrateonlaggedvaluesofallthevariablesincludedintheVAR.\nIn the“structural”VAR,\nx\nt\n=\nB x\n0 t\n+\nB\n(\nL\n)\nx\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n+\ne\nt\n;\n(2)\nthe shocks and feedbacks are given economic interpretations.

The equation involving the monetary policy instrument (the\n0\nFedfundsrate, forexample)isofteninterpretedasareactionfunctiondescribingtheFed’s\nresponse to economic conditions. By extension, the innovation to this equation is taken\nto represent “shocks” to monetary policy. A great deal of research and debate has cen-\ntered on the identifying assumptions embodied in the choice of B .

The typical focus of\nthis research is the impulseresponse functions of macroeconomic variables in response to\nmonetarypolicyshocks,andhowthespecificidentifyingassumptionsaffecttheresponses.\nThis paper does not deal with the identification issue, but focuses instead on a more\nbasic question: whether the reduced form of the VAR, and the monetary policy equation\nin particular,generate sensibleforecasts.

Several authors, notably Rudebusch (1997),\nPagan and Robertson (1995), and McNees (1992), have emphasized parameter instability\nas a possible explanation. Rudebusch cites the VARs’ profligate specification as another\ncandidate. NonlinearitiesintheFed’sreactionfunction,suchasthosearisingfrom“oppor-\ntunistic” disinflation a` la Orphanides and Wilcox (1996) are another possibility, and Mc-\nCarthy (1995) provides some evidence supporting this view. In addition, the VAR leaves\nout variables that might help forecast monetary policy.

First, the correlation between VAR and futures-market shocks is a poor gauge of\nthe VAR’s performance.

Perhaps because of the recent emphasis\n1 t\non policy shocks, however, assessments of VARs’ performance have often involved the\nforecast errors rather than the forecasts themselves; see, for example, Rudebusch (1997),\nBrunner(1997)and Christianoet al. (1997).\nAt first glance, the correlation between shocks would seem to be a sensible basis for\ncomparison; if the two procedures yielded the same forecasts, the shocks would be iden-\ntical, and the correlation would be 1.0. Closer scrutiny shows that this measure can give\na misleading picture, however; the covariance between the shocks has little to do with the\ncovariancebetween the forecasts. The correlation between shocks can therefore makebad\nforecasting modelslookgood,and goodmodelslookbad.\nA comparisonbetween theVARand anaive“no change”forecast forcefully illustrates\nthis point. Because the Fed funds rate is well described as an I(1) process, forecasts of\nthe rates themselves will tend to be very highly correlated; the correlation between the\nforecast changesin theFed funds rate, f\n1\n;\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n(cid:0)\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\nand rˆVAR\n1 t\n(cid:0)\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\n, willtherefore bemore\n1\ninformative. As reported in the first line of table 2, the correlation between the forecast\nchangeintheFedfundsrateis0.43,andtheshockcorrelationis0.35. Samplinguncertainty\nassociated with theestimated VARcoefficients (readily apparent as “noise”in the forecast\nplotted in figure 3) will increase the variance of the VAR forecasts, however, which will\nreduce the correlation between forecasts. One way to eliminate the effect of parameter\nuncertainty is to replace the variance of rˆVAR\nt\n(cid:0)\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\nin the denominator of the correlation\n1\ncoefficient withthevarianceof f\n1\n;\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n(cid:0)\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\n.

The implied change from this forecast is, of course, zero. Consequently, the\n“no change” model’s forecast of the change in the Fed funds rate is uncorrelated with\neverything,includingtheforecasts from theFed fundsfutures rate and thefundsrate itself\n(hence the zeros in the second line of table 2). On this criterion, obviously, the VAR\nprovidesthebetterdescriptionofmonetarypolicy. Bycontrast,thecorrelationbetweenthe\n“no change” forecast errors, r\nt\n(cid:0)\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\n, and the futures market surprises, r\n1 t\n(cid:0)\nf\n1\n;\nt\n(cid:0)\n, is 0.52\n1\n—muchhigherthantheCEEmodel’s. Judgedonthiscriterion,therefore, the“nochange”\nforecast describes monetarypolicythan theVAR.\nHow can the“no change” forecast errors be more highlycorrelated with theFed funds\nfutures surprises than the VAR’s, when the VAR’s forecasts are closer to the futures mar-\nket’s? Theanswer, it turnsout,isthat thecorrelation between shockssaysvery littleabout\nhow well the VAR describes monetary policy, and a lot more about small deviations from\nefficiency intheFed fundsfutures market.\n9\n\n3.1 Anatomy of a correlation\nThecorrelationbetweenFedfundsfuturessurprises,u\n(cid:3)\n,andforecasterrorsfromanecono-\nt\nmetricmodel(e.g., aVAR),uˆ , can bewrittenas\nt\nr\n(\nuˆ\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n) =\nCov\n(\nu\n(cid:3) t\n;\nuˆ\nt\np\n)\nVar\n(\nu (cid:3) t\n)\nVar\n(\nuˆ t\n)\n:\nSince the variance of the Fed funds futures surprise is the same for each uˆ we consider,\ndifferences in the correlation between shocks must be attributable either to differences in\nthe covariance between the shocks, or to the variance of the estimated errors. Substituting\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\nrˆ foruˆ , thecovariancetermin thenumeratorcan bewrittenas\nt t\nCov\n(\nu\n(cid:3) t\n;\nuˆ\nt\n) =\nCov\n(\nr\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\n(cid:0)\nCov\n(\nrˆ\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n) ;\norinterms ofthechangeinr,\nCov\n(\nu\n(cid:3) t\n;\nuˆ\nt\n) =\nCov\n(\nD r\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\n(cid:0)\nCov\n(\nc\nD r\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n) ;\nwhere\nc\nD r\nt\n=\nrˆ\nt\n(cid:0)\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\n. Writing the covariance term in this way reveals two important fea-\n1\ntures.\nFirst, the covariance between the realized change in the Fed funds rate and the futures\nmarket surprise, Cov\n(\nD r\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\n, mechanically builds in a positive correlation between the\ntwo shocks. Justas important,this contributionto thecovarianceis whollyindependentof\nthe model’s forecasts. In fact, it will be positiveeven if the model is of no use whatsoever\ninforecastingtheFed fundsrate, asinthecaseofthe“nochange”modeldiscussedabove.\nThe second key observationis that a positivecovariancebetween themodel’s forecast,\nc\nD r , and the futures market surprise, u\nt (cid:3)\nwill reduce the covariance between the shocks.\nt\nMarket efficiency implies a zero covariance between u (cid:3) and elements of the t t\n(cid:0)\n1 infor-\nmation set. In practice, however, it is highly unlikely that the sample covariance will be\nzero even if the market is efficient. Indeed, Krueger and Kuttner (1996) found that this\ncovariance,whilenonzero,was generally statisticallyinsignificant.\nTaken together, these two observations explain the “no change” forecast’s surprisingly\nhigh correlation with the futures market surprises. As reported in table 3, the covariance\nbetween D r and u\nt (cid:3)\nis 127.1, while the covariance between\nt\nc\nD r and u\nt (cid:3)\nis identically zero.\nt\nDividingbytherelevantstandarddeviationsyieldsthecorrelationof0.52—wellinexcess\noftheCEE model’s,despitethezero correlation betweentheforecasts themselves.\n10\n\nTable3: Componentsoftheshockcorrelation\nModel r\n(\nuˆ\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\nCov\n(\nc\nD r\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\nr\n(\nc\nD r\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n) p\nVar\n(\nuˆ\nt\n)\nNo change 0\n:\n52 0 0 18\n:\n7\nCEE 0\n:\n32 39\n:\n5 0\n:\n14 21\n:\n1\nT-bill 0\n:\n62\n(cid:0)\n34\n:\n9\n(cid:0)\n0\n:\n12 19\n:\n9\nModified CEE 0\n:\n37 24\n:\n7 0\n:\n09 21\n:\n3\nNotes: The standard deviation of the Fed funds futures shock,\np\nVar\n(\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\n, is 13.1, and the\ncovariance between the change in the Fed funds rate and the Fed funds futures surprise,\nCov\n(\nD r\nt\n;\nu\n(cid:3) t\n)\n, is 127.1. Units are basis points. Statistics are not adjusted for degrees of\nfreedom.\nAn analogous breakdown for the CEE model reported on the second line of table 3\nshowsthatapositivecovariancebetweentheVAR’spredictionsandthefuturesmarketsur-\nprises partially accounts for the model’s small shock correlation. The relevant covariance\nis 39.5; subtracting this number from 127.1 and dividing by the relevant standard devia-\ntions yields the correlation of 0.32 (without a degrees-of-freedom adjustment). Had the\nFed funds futures surprises been orthogonal to the VAR forecast, the correlation would\nhavebeen 0.46.\nOne interpretationofthisresult is thatthefutures market is not efficient. Theviolation\nimplied by this result is not quantitativelyor statistically significant, however. The regres-\nsion of the futures market surprise onto the VAR forecast has an R2 of only 0.019, and the\nt-statistic on the CEE forecast’s coefficient is only 1.41. But because standard deviations\noftheshocks,ratherthantheinterestrate(oritschange)appearsinthedenominator,avery\nsmallcovariancecan haveapronouncedeffect on theshockcorrelation.\nTheforecastsfromasimplemodelinvolvingtheT-billrateprovideanotherillustration\nof the perverse properties of the shock correlation.

Consequently, the correlation\nbetweenthefuturesmarketsurprisesandtheVARforecastsmaybeanartifactoftheVAR’s\ninformationadvantage.\nTo see what impact this might have on the correlations, we re-ran the CEE equation\nwithadditionallagsonpayrollemploymentandconsumerprices.

A model estimated over a sample that in-\ncluded the1979–82 M1 targetingregime, for example,will almostsurely be inappropriate\nfor later periods when the Fed’s weight on monetary aggregates is smaller — if not zero.\nThespuriousinclusionofM1couldthereforeintroducenoiseintotheforecastsforlaterpe-\nriods. Other research has turned up significant time variation along these lines. Friedman\nand Kuttner (1996) estimated a time-varying-parameter version of a funds rate equation,\nand found significant variation in the coefficient on the monetary aggregates correspond-\ning to the shifts in targeting regimes. Instability has also been documented by Pagan and\nRobertson(1995).\nTable 4 reports the results of shortening the lag lengths and estimating the CEE model\nover shorter sample periods.12 Comparing the twelve-lag to the six-lag results for the full\nsample shows that greater parsimony increases the shock correlation slightly, presumably\nby reducing the covariance between futures market surprises and the VAR forecasts. (Ob-\nviously,eliminatingallright-hand-sidevariablesdrivethiscovariancetozero.)

The VAR does even\nbetter at longer horizons. At three months, the estimated bˆ for the forecasts is 0.75, and\nforecast errors’ correlation is 0.60. The forecasts and shocks plotted in figure 4 confirm\nthat the VAR approximately mimicsthe systematicand unsystematicchanges in the funds\nrateimpliedbyFed funds futuresrates.\n5 Time aggregation\nThetimingofthesurprises extracted from monthlyorquarterly VARs is, ofcourse, some-\nwhat ambiguous. Atfirst glance, itwouldseemthat shocksderivedfrom theFed fundsfu-\nturesratewouldbefreeofsuchambiguity. Thatturnsoutnottobetrue,however. TheFed\nfunds futures contract’s settlement price is based on the monthlyaverage of the overnight\nFed funds rate, which creates a time aggregation problem. Consequently, the timing and\nmagnitudeofpolicyshocksbased onthefuturesrate arealso ambiguous.\nToillustratethisproblem,considerthefollowingscenario. TheFed fundsrateis5%in\nMarch,andthisrateisexpectedtoprevailthroughMay. NowsupposethatonApril16,the\nFed unexpectedly raises the target Fed funds rate to 6%, and that the new rate is expected\ntoremainineffectthroughMay. AssumetheFeddoes,infact,leavetherateat6%. April’s\naverage Fed funds rate is 5.5%, reflecting 15 days at 5% and 15 days at 6%. The path of\ntheFed fundsrate andthemonthlyaverages areshowninthetoprow offigure5.\nHow will the futures rates respond to the surprise? With no change in the Fed funds\nrateexpected,thefuturesratescorrespondingtotheAprilandMaycontractswillbe5%up\nthroughApril15. OnApril16,thedayofthesurprise,thefuturesratefortheMaycontract\nwillriseto6%,reflectingtheexpectationthatthe6%ratewillprevailthroughoutMay. But\nsince the April contract is settled against April’s average funds rate, the futures rate for\nthe April contract will rise to only 5.5%. The paths of the futures rates are depicted in the\nleft-hand columnofthesecondand thirdrowsoffigure 5.\nThe Fed’s action on April 16 represents an unexpected increase of 100 basis points\nrelative to expectations on April 15 and before. How should the Fed funds surprise be\nmeasuredusingmonthlyfuturesmarketdata? Conceptually,thisissimplytherealizedFed\nfunds rate minusits conditionalexpectation as measured by thefutures data. But thereare\ntwo complications. First, the futures contract is settled against the monthly average of the\ndaily Fed funds rate; consequently, the realized Fed funds rate is taken to be the monthly\naverage of the daily Fed funds rates. The second issue is whether to use point-in-time or\n16\n\nFigure5: Financial markets’responsetoaFed fundssurprise\nFed Funds Rate Average Fed Funds Rate\n6.5 6.5\n6 6\n5.5 5.5\n5 5\n4.5 4.5\n1 15 1 15 1 15 31\nMarch April May March April May\nFutures Rate on April Contract Average Futures Rate on April Contract\n6.5 6.5\n6 6\n5.5 5.5\n5 5\n4.5 4.5\n1 15 1 15 1 15 31\nMarch April May March April May\nFutures Rate on May Contract Average Futures Rate on May Contract\n6.5 6.5\n6 6\n5.5 5.5\n5 5\n4.5 4.5\n1 15 1 15 1 15 31\nMarch April May March April May\nTrading Day Month\n17\n\nTable5: Fundsratesurprisesusingalternativemeasuresofexpectations\nMonth\nMarch April May\nAverageFed fundsrate 5.0% 5.5% 6.0%\nFutures rateonlast dayofmonth 5.0% 6.0% 6.0%\nimpliedFed fundssurprise 0 +50 bp 0\nimpliedexpected change 0 +50 bp 0\nAveragefutures rateovermonth 5.0% 5.5% 6.0%\nimpliedFed fundssurprise 0 +50 bp +50 bp\nimpliedexpected change 0 0 0\naveragefutures ratedatainformingtheconditionalexpectation.\nSupposeweusetheone-month-aheadfuturesrateonthelastdayofthepreviousmonth\n(e.g., the rate for the April contract as of March 31) as the conditional expectation, and\nmeasure thesurpriserelativeto themonthlyaverage Fed funds rate. In this example, sum-\nmarized in the top panel of table 5, the April surprise can be computed as April’s average\nFed funds rate (5.5%) minus the March 31 Fed funds futures rate for the April contract\n(5%),yieldingonlya50basispointsurprise. Againusingthefuturesratefromthelastday\nof the previous month, the May surprise is calculated as the May average Fed funds rate\n(6.0%) minusthe April 30 Fed funds futures rate for the May contract (6.0%), yieldingno\nsurprise. Recalling that the average funds rate increases 50 basis points in both April and\nMay, the first 50 basis point increase is taken to be a surprise, while the second 50 basis\npoints is anticipated. And yet, the example states clearly that the 100 basis point increase\nis a complete surprise on April 16. Last-day-of-month futures data, therefore, will tend to\nunderstatethemagnitudeofthetrueshock.\nAn alternative way to measure the Fed funds surprise is to use the monthly average of\na contract’sfutures rate, depictedin theright-hand columnofthesecond and third rowsof\nfigure 5, for the conditional expectation. This measure of the Fed fund surprise preserves\nthe size of the shock’s cumulativeimpact, but spreads it out over two consecutivemonths.\nAs summarized in the bottom panel of table 5, the April surprise is computed as the April\naverage fed funds rate (5.5%) minus the March daily average of the April contract rates\n(5.0%), which is a 50 basis point surprise. The May surpriseis the May average fed funds\nrate (6%) minus the April daily average of the May contract rates (5.5%), yielding a 50\n18\n\nbasis point surprise. More generally, the surprise based on average futures rates will be a\nconvexcombinationofthetrueshocks,\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\nf¯\n1\n;\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n=\nq u\nt\n+ (\n1\n(cid:0)\nq\n)\nu\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n;\nwhichimpliesan MA(1)structurefortheaverage shocks,\nr\nt\n(cid:0)\nf¯\n1\n;\nt\n(cid:0)\n1\n= (\n1\n+\nf L\n)\ne\nt\n;\nwhere f\n= (\n1\n(cid:0)\nq\n) =\nq and e\nt\n=\nq u .14 Econometric methods, like those of Hansen and\nt\nHodrick (1980) and Hayashi and Sims (1983), exist to deal with the resulting moving-\naverage error structure in market efficiency tests, but recovering the original “true” shock\nfrom thetime-averaged datais generallynot possible.\nIn theexamplesdescribed so far, themonthlyvalueoftheFed fundsrate istaken to be\nthe monthly average of the daily rates. How would the calculation be affected if the Fed\nfunds rate from a single day were used in place of the monthly average? In this example,\ntheApril30FedFundsrate(6.0%)minustheMarch31FedfundsfuturesratefortheApril\ncontract(5.0%)givesthecorrect 100basispointsurprise. However,otherexampleswould\ngenerate problems with this calculation. Suppose that data were released in the first week\nofAprilthatindicatedtheFOMC’snormalresponsewouldbetoincreasetheFedfundsrate\nby50basispointsto5.5%;andthenonApril16theactualpolicymovewas100basispoints\nto6%. Inthiscase,50basispointsisanticipated,andtheother50basispointsisasurprise.\nBut the calculation above is unaffected by the first week’s data release, so the surprise is\noverstated by the amount of the mid-month’s revision to anticipated policy. Finally, since\nthe settlement price of the Fed funds futures contract is based upon the monthly average,\nthere’s little reason to believe the futures rates would satisfy conditions of unbiasedness\nand efficiency relativeto thelast-day-of-the-monthFed fundsrate.\nOne way to reconstruct the “true” April shock is to rescale the first measure of the\nsurprise. Specifically, compute the surprise as the April average Fed funds rate (5.5%)\nminus the March 31 Fed funds futures rate for the April contract (5%), and multiply the\nsurprisebythefactorm\n=\nt ,wheremisthenumberofdaysinthemonthandt isthenumber\nofdaysaffectedbythechange.

If there were an FOMC meeting two days before the\nend of the month, for example, and if the monthly average Fed funds rate turned out to be\n1 basis point above the target, the rescaling will result in a spurious 15 basis point shock.\nTo reduce the effect of this noise, the average target Fed funds rate can be used in place\nof the effective rate. This procedure will distort the size of the shocks only to the extent\nthat market participants expect the average effective rate to deviate from the target. Using\nthe target rate, the standard deviation of the rescaled policy shocks is 19.7 basis points,\ncompared withonly8.9fortheunscaledshocks.\nAn alternative way to gauge the effect of time aggregation on the magnitude of funds\n15Theonlyexceptiontothiswasthe25basispointincreaseinthetargetinApril1994.\n20\n\nratesurprisesistousethe“spotmonth”contract’sprice,whichisbasedontheaverageFed\nfunds rate prevailing in the current month. Again, suppose that changes in the target Fed\nfunds rate only occur immediately following an FOMC meeting, and, as in the example\nabove, suppose that the FOMC meeting occurs on April 16. The difference between the\nApril 16 and April 15 futures rates for the April contract would reflect the change in the\nexpected path of the Fed funds rate over the April 16 to April 30 period. In the scenario\ndescribedabove,thespotmonthfuturesrateonApril15wouldhavebeen5.0%,consistent\nwith the “no change” expectation. On April 16, after the increase to 6.0%, the spot month\nfutures rate would be 5.5%, since the contract’s settlement price is based on an average\nthat includes the first 15 days of the month, when the Fed funds rate was only 5.0%.

Theapproach isnotwithoutitspitfalls,however. Onehazard involvestheinterpre-\ntation of the correlation between Fed funds futures surprises and VAR shocks. This corre-\nlation contains little meaningful information relevant for assessing the VAR’s description\nof monetary policy. As shown above, small deviations from the orthogonality condition\nimpliedby marketefficiency can haveabigeffect on thecorrelation.\nThis is not to say that VARs’ description of monetary policy is perfect. Their fore-\ncasts are imprecise and noisy, and there is some evidence to suggest parameter instability.\nShorterlag lengthsand a morejudiciousselectionof startingdatecan mitigatetheseprob-\nlems, however, and the results presented here suggest more research along those lines is\nwarranted.\nOne importantcomplicationarising in comparisonsbetween VARs and futures-market\n21\n\nforecasts is time aggregation. This problem can distort the timing and magnitude of the\nestimated policy surprises: point-in-time futures rate data gets the timing right, but atten-\nuates the magnitude, while average data gets the magnitude right but distorts the timing.\nThis observationhas importantimplicationsfor attempts to draw inferences about the size\nofpolicyshocksfrom futures marketdata.\nWhile the distortion created by time aggregation may have significant effects on the\ncontemporaneous correlation between shocks, it is unlikely that it would affect the econ-\nomy’s estimated response to those shocks. Because an impulse response function can be\nthought of in terms of a regression of the relevant variable on a set of mutually uncorre-\nlated shocks, merely shifting the shocks’ dating a month — or even a quarter — in one\ndirection or another may alter the timing of the response but have little effect on its shape\nor size. Consequently, the timing ambiguities identified above are probably irrelevant for\nmeasuringthereal effects ofmonetarypolicy.\n22\n\nReferences\nBernanke, Ben S. 1986.

    "text": "Economic Outlook and Policy\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nEvanston Civic Leaders Breakfast\nEvanston, Ill.\nOctober 19, 2010\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nEconomic Outlook and Policy\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nI’m delighted to be here today to share with you my thoughts on the economy and offer\nmy perspective on monetary policy. Before I proceed further, let me stress that I will be\nsharing my personal views with you, and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System.\nWith four quarters of positive growth under our belt and employment beginning to rise,\nthe economic recovery from the recession that ended in June 2009 is certainly\nunderway. However, the pace of recovery in both output and employment has slowed\nrecently. Real GDP (gross domestic product) rose at an annual rate of just 1.7 percent\nin the second quarter, down markedly from 3.7 percent growth in the first quarter. I\nexpect slightly stronger growth going forward — in the range of 2.0 to 2½ percent in the\nsecond half of the year, and 3.0 to 3½ percent next year.\nThis is a quite moderate pace of growth given the severity of the recession we\nexperienced and in comparison with the economy’s potential growth rate. We need\nstronger growth for some time before we return to a more normal level of economic\nactivity.\nNotably, at 9.6 percent in September, the unemployment rate remains well above the\nlevel I consider to be consistent with the Fed’s mandate of maximum employment. To\nbring the unemployment rate down substantially, the economy needs to grow\nsubstantially above the potential rate. But given my outlook for only moderate growth\nover the next two years, I don’t see unemployment falling below 8 percent by the end of\n2012.\nPerhaps slower job growth is a new feature of recoveries. Following the two prior\nrecessions, many measures of economic activity showed improvement well before the\nunemployment rate started to decline. But, in the current environment, slow job growth\nis symptomatic of a generally weak recovery.\nTo offer some perspective, let me remind you of the aftermath of the deep 1981 to 1982\nrecession. In the eighteen months following that recession, growth averaged nearly 8\npercent and the unemployment rate declined by 3½ percentage points. In contrast, after\n15 months of recovery from the recent recession, growth has averaged only 3 percent\nand the unemployment rate is only marginally lower than at its peak of 10.1 percent in\nthe fall of 2009. Even after more solid growth materializes, unemployment will likely\nremain stubbornly high. Discouraged workers will resume searching for jobs, adding to\nthe large number of those already looking for work. Furthermore, the number of long-\nterm unemployed is extremely high, and such workers typically have a more difficult\ntime finding a job.\n2\n\nThe housing market will also be a factor constraining employment gains by reducing the\nmobility of homeowners who owe more on their home than it is worth. New construction\nand home sales remain well below their historical averages; and, supply and demand\nconditions could continue to weigh on real estate markets for some time. Low mortgage\nrates and more attractively priced homes suggest housing market conditions will get\nbetter as we move further into the expansion, but improvement is likely to be only\ngradual.\nRecently, many observers have questioned what more monetary policy can do to\naddress the very high unemployment rate. Some have suggested that the financial\ncrisis and the accompanying recession precipitated structural change in the demand for\nlabor, raising the economy’s natural rate of unemployment. They suggest that it has\nbecome significantly more difficult to match job seekers with job vacancies over the past\ntwo years. If this is true, then monetary policy is not the appropriate tool to address the\nramifications of such a change. If, however, structural factors can only explain a modest\npart of the rapid rise in unemployment, then monetary policy may be able to play a more\nconstructive role.\nThere are reasons to think that the natural rate of unemployment has indeed risen over\nthe last couple of years. The extension of unemployment insurance benefits during the\nrecession helped to cushion unemployed workers from the adverse effects of lost\nincome. But it also might have reduced the incentive for some workers to seek out new\nemployment, or kept others from leaving the labor force. It is also conceivable that the\nrecession affected different regions and sectors of the economy unevenly or severed an\nunusually large number of long-term employment relationships, factors making for an\nespecially difficult transition for affected workers.\nThe historical relationship between unemployment and job vacancy rates is a useful tool\nfor addressing this issue.1 When labor markets are functioning well, an increase in job\nopenings is accompanied by a decrease in unemployment. It has only been since the\nbeginning of this year that we have seen an improvement in job openings that was not\nmatched by a correspondingly large reduction in unemployment. Based on this, some\nhave suggested that most of the increase in the unemployment rate over the past two\nyears is due to a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and those needed by\nemployers.\nHowever, there are problems with this view, including the dearth of sectors reporting\nstrong demand for hard-to-find skilled workers and the continued presence of\ndisinflationary pressures that we would not expect to observe if the natural rate were\nhigher and resource slack were smaller. Even if we take the job vacancy data at face\nvalue, the size of the deviation from its historical relationship with unemployment is not\nlarge enough to suggest an increase in the natural rate to anything like the current rate\n1 This relationship is often referred to as the “Beveridge curve.”\n3\n\nof unemployment.2 Therefore, the 8 percent unemployment rate I expect to see by the\nend of 2012 still leaves us with a very large amount of resource slack.\nAt the same time, measures of consumer price inflation continue to under-run the 2\npercent level that I consider consistent with price stability. With inflation expectations\nstable, inflation is likely to remain below desirable levels for some time. It is not\nunreasonable to expect 1 percent inflation in 2012. Unless the actual conditions turn out\nto be very different from my forecast, inflation of less than 1½ percent in 2013 is a\nstrong possibility.\nThe magnitude of resource slack, combined with the fact that inflation has been running\nbelow the level I consider consistent with long-term price stability, suggests to me that it\nwould be desirable to increase monetary policy accommodation. Normally, this would\ninvolve lowering the target federal funds rate based on the economic outlook and the\nhistorical relationship between policy actions and their impact on the economy.3\nHowever, at roughly zero, the fed funds rate is as low as it can go. As a result, the\ncurrent economic environment poses unusual challenges for policymakers.\nA key aspect of the current situation that concerns me is the growing evidence that we\nare in what economists call a “liquidity trap.” In a liquidity trap, the supply of savings\ncontinually outstrips the demand for investment, but interest rates near zero can’t fall to\nequate supply and demand. Liquidity traps are exceedingly rare. The last time the U.S.\neconomy was in a liquidity trap was during the Great Depression, some 80 years ago.\nThere’s a lot of evidence that we’re in a liquidity trap. Despite the accommodative\nstance of monetary policy, the amount of credit flowing to households and businesses\nhas yet to expand. Undoubtedly, some of the decline in lending reflects tighter lending\nstandards. However, standards for most loan types are no longer tightening, and\nanecdotal evidence suggests that credit is more readily available.\nRather, it seems to me that part of the reason for sluggish credit flows is that\nbusinesses aren’t particularly interested in increasing spending. As I assess the\nincoming data and talk to my business contacts, the impression I get is that executives\nare very cautious in their outlook and spending plans. They appear to be content to post\nstrong profits generated by unprecedented cost-cutting, rather than grow their top-line\nrevenues by expanding capital investment and hiring. Even after substantial\nimprovement in financial conditions, firms are sitting on the cash generated by profits\nand the funds raised in capital markets. Some of our business contacts explain their\nreluctance to invest by pointing to uncertainties raised by regulatory actions and\ngovernment policies. Yet, most admit they would increase spending if demand were\nstronger.\n2 Making some plausible assumptions, my staff estimates that the level of unemployment consistent with\nrecent data on job openings taken from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Job Openings and Labor\nTurnover Survey is likely to be between 6 and 7 percent.\n3 A convenient summary of this relationship is given by the “Taylor rule,” first expressed in Taylor (1993)\nand later developed further in Taylor (1999).\n4\n\nTo be certain, some forms of business spending are already reviving. Inventory\nrebuilding contributed strongly to growth in previous quarters; but this process is nearing\nan end, as firms have made substantial progress aligning inventories with sales.\nBusiness fixed investment also increased at a solid pace earlier this year, with firms\nupgrading IT systems and replacing capital equipment in order to maintain\ncompetiveness and profitability. Recent data, however, suggest that the surge in\nreplacement demand is beginning to subside. Absent further improvement in consumer\ndemand, business spending is likely to be more moderate going forward.\nConsumers also remain reluctant to spend, adding to their savings nearly in proportion\nto increases in disposable income. The personal savings rate in August, at 5.8 percent,\nis well above the near 2 percent savings rate that we saw prior to the recession. In fact,\npersonal savings continue to rise even though there is very little interest income to be\nearned. This suggests that the high savings rate reflects elevated risk aversion caused\nby the millions of jobs lost during the recession, as well as the $13 trillion wealth loss\nthat accompanied it. Such an increase in households’ propensity to save is\naccompanied by a decrease in their rate of consumption.\nSo we have all the ingredients for a liquidity trap: Businesses are cautious about new\ninvestment and households are too worried to meaningfully increase consumption. And\ninterest rates can’t fall in the way needed to increase investment and consumption\nbecause short-term rates are already at zero: They’ve fallen as far as they can go. If this\nstate of affairs continues, it could very well stifle any reasonably robust recovery.\nUnemployment would remain unacceptably high, and disinflationary pressures would be\nreinforced — clearly an undesirable outcome.\nThese rare occasions of liquidity traps are very different from typical economic\nrecessions. Consequently, they require a unique monetary policy response. Economic\ntheory tells us that in such circumstances monetary policy should aim to lower the real,\nor inflation-adjusted, rate of interest by temporarily allowing inflation to rise above its\nlong-run path. My preferred way of doing so is to implement an approach called price-\nlevel targeting. Simply stated, under this approach, the central bank strives to hit a\nparticular price-level path within a reasonable period of time. For example, if the rate of\nchange of the price-path is 2 percent and inflation has been under-running the path for\nsome time, monetary policy would strive to “catch-up” so that inflation would be higher\nthan the inflation target for a time until the path was regained. This higher inflation rate\nwould decrease the real interest rate, raising the opportunity cost of holding money.\nThis would provide an incentive for banks and corporations to release funds for\ninvestment, and in the process spur job creation.\nIn my opinion, such a strategy is entirely appropriate. The Fed has a mandate from\nCongress to encourage conditions that foster both price stability and maximum\nemployment. Recently the Fed has missed on both dimensions of this dual mandate,\nwith inflation running below the 2 percent level I associate with price stability, and with\nunemployment staying well above any reasonable estimate of the natural rate.\n5\n\nPractically speaking, price-level targeting in the current environment would call for a\nseries of large-scale asset purchases to recover the shortfall in inflation. At the same\ntime, we would continue to carry a large balance sheet in order to maintain low interest\nrates for an extended period. Most important, we would clearly communicate the path\nfor prices that we expect to attain, in order to enhance the public’s understanding of the\nFed’s intentions.\nThere are operational aspects of a price-level target policy that require much more\nelaboration and study, including the precise price-level target and how to achieve it.\nThere are also potential challenges that we should be prepared to address. For\ninstance, given the initial uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the new policy\napproach, inflation may at first continue to be very low. Sustaining our commitment to\nachieving the price-level target would be critical if we are to achieve success in this\ncase. Conversely, we’d need careful advance planning to ensure that if inflation ran at a\nmore elevated level than expected, we could bring the price level back to the target\npath. The tools we developed over the last two years to drain reserves from the banking\nsystem will prove useful in this regard. It would also be of utmost importance to\nappropriately use the Federal Reserve’s authorities of macroprudential supervision and\nregulation during this period to avoid the emergence of financial market imbalances.\nFor many, my proposal will be a hard pill to swallow. Central bankers generally loathe\nthe idea that even a temporarily higher inflation rate could be beneficial for, or\nconsistent with, price stability over the longer term. We do not want to lose what the Fed\nunder Chairmen Volcker and Greenspan won for the American people by fighting\ninflation and achieving price stability. The current circumstances, however, require that\nwe fight a different battle — namely, the extraordinary instance of liquidity trap\nconditions not seen since the 1930s. With potentially beneficial policies that are well\ngrounded in rigorous economic analysis available to us, I cannot stare at our current\nprojections for high unemployment and low inflation and think that they are consistent\nwith the best policies to address the Fed’s dual mandate responsibilities. 4\nReferences\nAuerbach, Alan J., and Maurice Obstfeld, 2005, “The Case for Open-market\nPurchases in a Liquidity Trap,” American Economic Review, Vol. 95, No. 1, March, pp.\n110–137.\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, 2003, “The Zero Bound on Interest\nRates and Optimal Monetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 34,\nNo. 1, pp. 139–211.\nKrugman, Paul R., 1998, “It’s Baaack: Japan’s Slump and the Return of the Liquidity\nTrap,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 137–187.\n4 Academic studies of the benefits of price-level targeting given liquidity trap conditions include Krugman\n(1998), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), Svensson (2003) and Auerbach and Obstfeld (2005).\n6\n\nSvensson, Lars E.

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIntroductory Remarks\nI would like to thank Eric Rosengren, Jeff Fuhrer and the organizers for giving me the\nopportunity to speak on this panel today. I would like to use this opportunity to expand\nthe discussion about additional communications tools available to central banks in a\nlow-inflation environment. In a nutshell, I think there are special circumstances when\nprice-level targeting would be a helpful complement to our current and prospective\nstrategies in the U.S. Clearly communicating an expected path for prices would help\nguide the public’s understanding of the Fed’s intentions while we carry a large balance\nsheet and promise continued low interest rates for an extended period.\nThere are quite a number of academic studies of liquidity trap crises that find either\nprice-level targeting or temporary above-average inflation to be nearly optimal policies;1\nand yet, central bankers and the public generally loathe the idea that even a temporarily\nhigher inflation rate could be beneficial or be consistent with price stability over the\nlonger term.\nNevertheless, with potentially beneficial policies so well grounded in rigorous economic\nanalysis, I cannot stare at our current projections for high unemployment and low\ninflation and think that these projections are consistent with the best monetary policies\nto address the Fed’s dual mandate responsibilities. Today, I want to expand the\ndiscussion of these tools. After all, debate on the merits is healthy.\nOf course, these are my views only and not those of my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\nRationale: Much More Accommodation Is Appropriate\nLet me be very clear about the setting for this proposal. In my opinion, much more\npolicy accommodation is appropriate today. In a speech two weeks ago,2 I stated that I\nbelieve the U.S. economy is best described as being in a bona fide liquidity trap. This\nbelief is not a new development for me; instead, it is a dawning realization. Risk-free\nshort-term interest rates are essentially zero. Both households and businesses have an\nexcess of savings relative to the new investment demands for these funds. With\nnominal interest rates at zero, market clearing at lower real interest rates is stymied.\n1 An essential reference list would begin with Krugman (1998), Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), Svensson (2003),\nand Auerbach and Obstfeld (2005).\n2 Evans (2010). See also my interview with The Wall Street Journal in Hilsenrath (2010).\n2\n\nIn this setting, even a moderate expansion without a double dip will not lead to\nappropriate labor market improvement.3 Accordingly, highly plausible projections are 1\npercent for core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCE) inflation at the\nend of 2012 and 8 percent for the unemployment rate. For me, the Fed’s dual mandate\nmisses are too large to shrug off, and there is currently no policy conflict between\nimproving employment and inflation outcomes. The economic theories that central\nbankers rely on for evaluating appropriate monetary policy suggest to me that we need\nlower short-term real interest rates than the current real federal funds rate of –1 percent.\nIndeed, if the federal funds rate were positive, I would advocate substantial nominal\nreductions. But we are effectively at zero.\nA variety of typical linear Taylor rules suggests around –4 percent. In addition, some\ncalculations for optimal monetary policy simulations I have seen indicate that real rates\nof –3 or –4 percent between now and the end of 2012 would boost aggregate demand\nenough to deliver substantially lower unemployment by the end of 2012. If you reach the\nconclusion that we are in a liquidity trap, or even near a perilous liquidity trap, more\naccommodation is not data-dependent or a close call.\nHow Does Price-level Targeting Help with Policy Communications?\nIf the Federal Reserve decided to increase the degree of policy accommodation today,\ntwo avenues could be: 1) additional large-scale asset purchases, and 2) a\ncommunication that policy rates will remain at zero for longer than “an extended period.”\nA third and complementary policy tool would be to announce that, given the current\nliquidity trap conditions, monetary policy would seek to target a path for the price level.\nSimply stated, a price-level target is a path for the price level that the central bank\nshould strive to hit within a reasonable period of time. For example, if the slope of the\nprice path, which I will refer to as P*, is 2 percent and inflation has been underrunning\nthe path for some time, monetary policy would strive to catch up to the path: Inflation\nwould be higher than 2 percent for a time until the path was reattained. I refer to this as\na state-contingent policy because the price-level targeting regime is only intended for\nthe duration of the liquidity trap episode. I will be more concrete in just a moment, but\nfirst, where does such a policy come from?\nA policy that targets a price-level objective emerges from analyzing standard—modern\nmacroeconomic theory. The desirable properties of the price-level target (or temporarily\nabove-average inflation) become most apparent in analyses that consider liquidity traps.\nFigure 1 displays the simplest example of a price path P* and its essential attributes.\nThe reader must judge for herself whether this policy could be communicated\nstraightforwardly and transparently to the public; my personal viewpoint is that it is\nhorribly cynical to think that good communication is beyond our ability, especially if that\nis the best policy. Here are some key elements:\n3 In the speech cited earlier, I also discussed the relevant evidence on job mismatch and the Beveridge curve. I find\nunconvincing the argument that the natural rate of unemployment has risen enough to deter additional substantial\npolicy accommodation.\n3\n\n• The first policy component consists of announcing a state-contingent entry\ninto the P* policy. I think most of us imagine liquidity traps with double-digit\nunemployment rates to be relatively rare events, on the order of twice a\ncentury or less. Under such circumstances where the central bank is missing\nboth components of its dual mandate by a large margin, there is justification\nfor targeting a higher price-level path in an effective, disciplined, and limited\nfashion. A credible announcement of the policy is clearly crucial for\nstimulating the correct expectations by the public.\n• The second policy component is to select the parameters for the price-level\npath: the initial date when the index-path begins and the slope of the path.\nGiven the recognition delay in understanding the implications of the liquidity\ntrap, it seems reasonable that the path would begin at some date in the past.\nMy preference would be to select December 2007, in part because it is the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) peak of the business cycle.\nWith regard to the slope, for the sake of concreteness, I will illustratively\nsuggest 2 percent for the average inflation rate; this rate corresponds to the\nmode of FOMC participants’ forecast endpoints for PCE inflation.4 With this\ndefinition of the P* path, it is easy to see an emerging “inflation deficit” to\ndate.\n• The third policy component is to communicate regularly and often to the\npublic that the intention of the FOMC’s policy actions is to achieve this path\nwithin a reasonable period of time. At a minimal level, this could simply be a\ndisciplined guarantee regarding how long policy rates will be held at zero; it is\nan elaboration of what the current “extended period” language means. Other\naccommodative policies could be used to further build the public’s confidence\nthat the Fed is pursuing this price-level path. The task of communicating\nmany operational details would follow the announcement. Indeed, even\nbefore reaching the P* path, closing the gap would set the stage eventually\nfor adjustments in operational policy, such as altering the size of the Fed’s\nbalance sheet, taking reserve-draining actions along the way, and increasing\nthe rate of interest on excess reserves (IOER), among others.\n• The fourth policy component is to clearly state the terms for the final, state-\ncontingent exit from the P* policy. Determining that the price-level path has\nbeen achieved with confidence is a critical determination. Presumably,\nspending a few months at the price-level path would be more important than\nsimply the first achievement of the path. Once the price-level path is achieved\nwith confidence, the forward-looking monetary policy strategy would return to\nfocusing on 2 percent inflation over the medium term. Future policy misses on\neither side of 2 percent would be “bygones.” Policy would continue to strive\nfor price stability over the medium term, which would be 2 percent PCE\n4\nFor the remainder of my comments, I will take 2 percent to be the FOMC’s explicit inflation objective over the\nmedium term. This is not a decision that has been taken by the FOMC. I simply use 2 percent to facilitate the\ndevelopment of my comments.\n4\n\ninflation. The past inflation misses would be used to simply inform current\nanalyses of inflation pressures and improve future projections and policy\nresponses.\nWhat Might the Experience with P* Look Like? Some Favorable Cases\nLet me spend some time discussing alternative outcomes from this state-contingent\nprice-level targeting regime. Remember, the regime is one where policy actions like\nlarge scale assets purchases (LSAPs), communications actions, etc., strive to increase\nmonetary accommodation to hit the P* path within a reasonable period of time. Figure 2\nshows the implied inflation rates for a 2 percent P* path where the current price gap is\nclosed by the end of 2012. Given current forecasts for inflation, this would be a rapid\nturnaround in the inflation picture. Many questions regarding operational responses\nduring this adjustment would need to be addressed:\n• The inflation rates are relatively modest: 2.2 percent core inflation in 2011 and\n2.9 percent in 2012. For a policymaker with a symmetric loss function around 2\npercent, 2.9 percent is about the same loss as 1 percent. This is not a significant\nchange from current expectations of policy losses. Of course, ensuring\ncommitment to the policy exit is presumably crucial for achieving 2 percent in\n2013.\n• If short-term interest rates remain near zero during this adjustment, real interest\nrates would be between –2 and –3 percent. Perhaps that would be enough to\nimprove labor markets and aggregate demand sufficiently, but I personally put\nmore faith in analyses that suggest the liquidity trap is larger than this.\n• Consequently, in this scenario at the end of 2012, if resource slack remains\nsubstantial and inflationary pressures are returning toward 2 percent over the\nmedium term on account of credible policy commitment, then a standard Taylor-\nrule prescription may still call for a relatively low federal funds rate. And the size\nand composition of the Fed’s balance sheet might also be consistent with\naccommodation. How much? The ultimate decisions for monetary policy would\ncontinue to focus on our dual mandate responsibilities; but inflation would be\nnearer our goal of price stability and aggregate demand would be stronger.\nAs I mentioned, a 2 percent P* policy that achieves the target path by the end of 2012\nmight leave unemployment still relatively high given the implied real rates. Figure 3\ndisplays a more aggressive P* policy that is assumed to close by the end of 2013. This\npath rises at a 3 percent rate from December 2007 until December 2012, and then\nreverts to the 2 percent slope, taken as price stability. This path incorporates what\nSvensson (2003) refers to as an initial “price gap to undo:” It allows the eventual price\nadjustment to incorporate a lower real rate if that is what the economic analysis\nsuggests is most useful to increase aggregate demand. Over the course of this\nhypothetical adjustment, inflation is about 3, 4, and 3 percent from 2011 through 2013.\nThus, policy can generate –3 and –4 percent real rates: This achieves a substantially\n5\n\nhigher opportunity cost of holding on to cash-like assets rather than lending and\ninvesting excess reserves in productive activities and workforces.\nAgain, credible commitment to the price path P* is, of course, critical to achieving the\ninflation endpoint of 2 percent over the medium term. In this regard, a reduction in the\nsize of the Fed’s dual mandate shortfalls would reinforce the public’s perception that the\nFed’s incentives are appropriately aligned with exiting the P* policy with medium-term\nprice-stability in sight.\nWhat Might the Experience with P* Look Like? Some More Challenging Cases\nThere are many operational aspects of a P* policy that require much more elaboration\nand study. Nevertheless, let me mention three clear situations that require more\ncomplicated responses. It is a hallmark of the uncertain times that we face that these\nare at polar extremes.\nDelayed inflation\nThe first challenge is to imagine that inflation continues to remain very low even after an\nannouncement that monetary policy is following a price-level path. As inflation delay\ncontinues, the “inflation deficit” account builds. That is, the price gap gets larger, and\nimplied future inflation to attain the P* path grows. This would clearly be nerve-wracking\nfor policymakers, and the credibility of our commitment to ever growing inflation rates\nwould be crucial for the success of the policy. If our resolve is credible, well-functioning\nfinancial markets should get the message. After all, investors and lenders sitting on\ncash-like assets would be building up an exposure to adverse future real interest rates.\nAnd I would expect the financial press to help communicate these investment risks on a\nregular basis. (I know I’ve felt that sting already.)\nAs cash moves out of investment portfolios into the general economy, inflation will rise\nas required by the price-level targeting policy.\nSmaller resource slack and greater inflation pressures\nThe second challenge is to imagine that the degree of resource slack in the economy is\nmuch smaller than many presume. One example would be if the structural rate of\nunemployment was upward of 8 percent. In this case, more accommodation could lead\nto higher inflation and a rapid closing of the price gap.\nAs it turns out, this is not a challenge for the P* policy: A quicker closing of the price gap\nharkens the exit of the state-contingent price-level policy. The fact that unemployment\nwould remain high would be a signal that increasing aggregate demand alone is not\nenough to address this problem. But monetary policy would have succeeded in moving\ncloser to price stability with the attending benefits from achieving that policy goal.\nConfidently switching to the post-P* policy would enhance credibility for price stability\nover the medium term. And we would have done all that we could to address the\nemployment situation—which would also enhance Fed credibility, in my judgment.\n6\n\nAccelerating inflation once the price gap has been closed\nThe third challenge would be if inflation was surprisingly high at the point when the price\ngap was eliminated and policy reverted to targeting 2 percent inflation over the medium\nterm. I regard this case as extremely unlikely. Recall that we are embarking on this\nprice-level targeting policy in an environment of huge resource gaps, with minimal\ninflationary pressures. (I actually think that the greater difficulty will be getting inflation\ngoing in the first place.) But in the unlikely occurrence that inflation accelerates beyond\nthe levels we anticipate, we have the tools to deal with it. Specifically, relative to initial\nbaseline scenarios, the Fed could more aggressively increase the federal funds rate\nand interest on excess reserves (IOER), as well as drain liquidity from our balance\nsheet. Furthermore, any higher inflation would almost surely be associated with stronger\neconomic growth and job creation, so these stronger “exit strategy” actions would be\nentirely appropriate.\nConcluding Remarks\nMy objective today has been a simple one: to discuss a policy tool that has received\nalmost zero discussion, though it regularly comes out of careful analyses of mainstream\neconomic models that we use to assess monetary policy options. We should put this\npolicy tool on the table and debate its suitability to the current situation in the U.S.\nMost critiques I have heard of this type of policy tool involve the risk of runaway inflation\nexpectations or the loss of hard-earned credibility. My response is to continually fall\nback on the discipline of the state-contingent exit plan. A central bank exercising this\npolicy would have to credibly convey to the public that this policy will end when the price\ngap is closed. An important risk would be the temptation to keep policy easy if the labor\nmarket has not reached the vicinity of full employment. Depending on the parameters of\nthe P* path, inflation expectations and the size of resource slack, the price gap could\nclose before unemployment is reduced toward 6 percent or lower. Nevertheless,\ncredibility requires exiting the P* policy at this point. Doing so ensures that this is a\nconservative policy, with prudent risk-mitigants against outcomes that monetary policy is\nunable to improve upon.\nBut I am more hopeful for this policy’s potential to improve upon our current liquidity trap\neconomic conditions. I hope that my comments have helped expand the debate over\nthe past few weeks.\n7\n\n8\n\nReferences\nAuerbach, Alan J., and Maurice Obstfeld, 2005, “The Case for Open-market Purchases in a\nLiquidity Trap,” American Economic Review, Vol. 95, No. 1, March, pp. 110–137.\nEggertsson, Gauti B., and Michael Woodford, 2003, “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and\nOptimal Monetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 34, No. 1, pp. 139–211.\nEvans, Charles L., 2010, “A Perspective on the Future of U.S. Monetary Policy,” Speech at a\nconference sponsored by the Bank of France, The Future of Monetary Policy, Rome, Italy,\nOctober 1, available at\nhttp://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/speeches/2010/10_01_bank_of_france_spee\nch.cfm\nHilsenrath, Jon, 2010, “Q&A: Chicago Fed’s Evans Elaborates on His Call for Aggressive Fed\nAction,” Real Time Economics: Economic Insights and Analysis from The Wall Street Journal,\nblog, October 5, available at http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/10/05/qa-chicago-feds-\nevans-elaborates-on-his-call-for-aggressive-fed-action/\nKrugman, Paul R., 1998, “It’s Baaack: Japan’s Slump and the Return of the Liquidity Trap,”\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity, Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 137–187.\nSvensson, Lars E.

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK\nOF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\nPage 1 of 12\n\nIL Wesleyan University Associates Business Luncheon\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nThank you for that kind introduction. I'm delighted to be back in Bloomington Normal\nand at Illinois Wesleyan. Certainly, in a University town, this is the time of year when\ntalk of the economy seems most relevant. As we approach graduation day, students\ntend to focus intently on jobs and careers and perhaps for the first time, they seem\nespecially keen on finding a way to put what they've learned to good and productive\nuse.\nSo, I'm pleased to be here to have the opportunity to explain how I see the economy\nevolving and to express my views on some of the key issues we face today. At the end\nof these talks, when I open the floor for discussion, I find myself being asked the same\nsorts of questions over and over again. So I’d like to address some of those questions in\nmy remarks today and then give you an opportunity to follow up with questions of your\nown.\nPage 2 of 12\n\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s begin with the question I hear most often: What are the prospects for the\neconomy? In short, the economy is recovering from the recession, and I am optimistic\nthat it will continue to do so. My forecast is that real gross domestic product (GDP) will\ngrow about 3-1/2 percent this year. In fact, we have been hearing many more upbeat\nbusiness reports, and we recently nudged up our outlook accordingly. But the “for sale”\nsigns posted in yards, empty storefronts, and long waits for job seekers are powerful\nreminders of how serious the recession was and how far below our potential we still are.\nWe need to experience a good deal of growth before we return to the more normal pace\nof economic activity and levels of unemployment that we enjoyed in late 2007. And the\n3-1/2 percent pace of growth I anticipate is quite moderate given the depth of the\nrecession. To offer some perspective, in the first year and a half following the deep\n1981 to 1982 recession, growth averaged nearly 8 percent.\nLet me give you some of the details underlying this assessment of the economy. The\nrecent GDP numbers—the value of overall production of goods and services in the\neconomy—are the broadest indication that the economy is growing again. GDP fell\nsharply—3.7 percent all told—during 2008 and the first half of 2009. But GDP has\nincreased in each of the past three quarters, with growth averaging a 3.7 percent\nannual rate.\nPage 3 of 12\n\nWhere did this growth come from? Some of it reflected the federal government stimulus\npackage passed in 2009. This raised economic activity a good deal in the second half of\nlast year, and should be a continued solid boost to spending through much of 2010.\nBut government stimulus is hardly the whole story. Unmistakably, private spending has\nbeen reviving. One area is inventory investment by businesses. During the recession,\nfirms aggressively cut inventories to very lean levels. By avoiding an overhang of\nexcess stocks, they are now increasing orders for newly produced goods to meet\nincoming demand—and we’ve seen manufacturing production increase accordingly. We\nhave also seen an increase in business spending on capital equipment, most notably on\nhigh-tech items, as firms replace and upgrade their IT systems and other equipment in\norder to maintain competiveness and profitability.\nEven consumers have increased spending, although concerns remain about the\nsustainability of the recent strength. Job worries and losses in household wealth had\ncaused consumers to cut back on spending appreciably during the recession. But they\nhave now begun to reopen their pocketbooks. During the first quarter of 2010 total\npersonal consumption expenditures increased at a 3.6 percent annual rate.\nSignificantly, these increases were distributed across many different types of goods and\nservices. Even in the hard-hit automobile sector, sales have averaged 11.0 million units\nso far this year—up over 17 percent from a year ago, though still well below the 16.6\nmillion unit pace that prevailed before the recession.\nPage 4 of 12\n\nIn contrast, housing continues to struggle. During the second half of 2009, both sales\nand new construction lifted off from the recession low points seen around the turn of the\nyear. But sales fell back after the expiration last November of the first round of tax\ncredits for first-time home buyers, and starts have not shown much discernible\nimprovement over the past several months.\nWe currently are seeing a bit of a pickup in housing markets. But this is likely a\ntemporary boost as buyers rush to beat the end-of-April expiration date for the\nextension of the home buyer tax credits. More fundamentally, supply conditions\ncontinue to weigh on real estate markets, and they could for some time as foreclosures\nadd to the overhang of unsold homes. But with the improving economy, low mortgage\nrates, and more attractively priced homes, housing market conditions will get better as\nwe move further into the expansion.\nWhat about labor markets? In general, many measures of economic activity show\nimprovement early in a recovery well before the jobs picture starts to get better. This\nwas especially true following the two previous recessions. I am concerned that this may\nbe the case during this expansion as well. As the economy entered the most recent\nrecession, businesses quickly cut their work forces. And even as the economy grew\nduring the second half of 2009, job destruction outpaced the extremely low levels of\nhiring.\nPage 5 of 12\n\nMore recently, there has been a modest improvement in the jobs picture. Over the first\nfour months of the year, excluding temporary hiring for the U.S. Census, on average\nabout 109 thousand jobs per month were added to the economy.\nBusinesses are being cautious about adding permanent staffing. They continue to strive\nto produce more with fewer people. But they can increase output for only so long\nwithout adding to payrolls. As the recovery takes hold and businesses become more\nconfident in the future, employment will increase on a more consistently solid basis.\nIndeed, there are signals that we currently are near such a turning point. There is the\npickup in the jobs numbers I just noted. Underlying those recent employment numbers,\nlayoffs are down substantially. Some of those businesses that cut employment most\naggressively at the beginning of the recession have begun to rehire. And others who are\ntaking a more wait-and-see attitude are hiring temporary workers to fill their staffing\nneeds. In fact, temporary worker employment has increased solidly in each of the past\nseven months.\nNonetheless, even after more solid employment gains materialize, unemployment may\nremain stubbornly high. Discouraged workers will resume searching for jobs, adding to\nthe number of those already looking for work. In addition, the number of long-term\nunemployed is extremely high, and such workers typically have a more difficult time\nfinding a job. Consequently, the outlook for these workers is challenged. So I anticipate\nthat the rate and length of unemployment will improve relatively slowly.\nPage 6 of 12\n\nWith consumer spending accounting for roughly two-thirds of GDP, the economic forces\nat work here are key factors underlying the moderate projections for overall growth.\nSome historical context is helpful. Over the fifteen years or so before the most recent\nrecession, productivity growth had been quite robust. This growth supported solid\nexpansion in asset values and disposable income. Believing these factors would persist,\nconsumers borrowed heavily: Households entered this recession with high net worth but\nalso with low levels of savings and high levels of debt.\nWhen faced with a temporary loss of income, households can maintain spending only\nby drawing down assets, borrowing more, or reducing savings. But as the recession\ntook hold, households faced mounting job losses, stark reductions in the value of their\nhousing and equity assets, and little in the way of liquid savings. So it is little wonder\nthat consumers sharply retrenched on spending.\nThe need for households to repair their balance sheets will moderate growth in\nconsumer spending going forward. In addition, we are seeing reduced availability of\nhousehold credit. And, importantly, muted gains in employment will hold back growth in\nwages and salaries. All of these factors contribute to an outlook for relatively modest\ngrowth in consumer spending, which, in turn, restrains the forecast for overall GDP\ngrowth.\nIn addition to consumer lending, the availability of bank credit remains a significant\nheadwind for many small- and medium-sized companies. Both supply and demand\nPage 7 of 12\n\nconsiderations are at work here. Some of the decline in bank lending last year reflects\nweak demand for loans by businesses wary of taking on new debt burdens in an\nuncertain economic environment. But at least some of the reduced lending arises from\nbanks’ tighter lending standards. These tighter standards appear to reflect concerns of\nbanks about their own capital levels and also the credit quality of borrowers. More\ngenerally, credit flows are being reduced because both borrowers and lenders are still\ndealing with losses from the recession, especially the busts in residential and\ncommercial real estate. I expect banking conditions to improve and better support\ngrowth, but this is likely to take some time.\nWhile I’ve mentioned a number of factors that we think will dampen growth, we could be\nsurprised on the upside. Increases in confidence could turn into higher spending sooner\nthan we now think. And productivity growth has remained strong. Technology continues\nto advance, and firms continue to create new products and find new ways to produce\nmore efficiently. These factors will lead to higher incomes in the longer term. And even\nover the shorter term, the higher profits and incomes generated by productivity can help\nrestructure balance sheets and support spending.\nWell, that was a long answer to a short question. The second question I’m often asked\nis a two-parter concerning inflation. The first part is: Isn’t inflation about to explode? The\nsecond part is: Are you concerned about deflation? The answer is no in both cases: I\nthink inflation will remain relatively stable.\nPage 8 of 12\n\nBoth camps have clear arguments. The current low rates of resource utilization strongly\npoint to lower inflation. At 9.9 percent, the unemployment rate is quite high. Similarly,\nmanufacturing capacity utilization is quite low. Such resource slack reduces cost\npressures and makes firms less able to push through price increases. These factors\nhave significantly contributed to lower inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of core\ninflation—the deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, excluding food\nand energy—has fallen from 2.7 percent in August 2008 to 1.3 percent in March 2010.\nThat is a large decline for a relatively stable data series.\nThose who press me on higher inflation point to the Fed’s accommodative policy and\nexpanded balance sheet. We all know that too much money chasing too few goods will\ngenerate inflation. But, currently, most of the funds used to increase our balance sheet\nare sitting idly in bank reserves. And because banks are not lending those reserves,\nthey are not yet generating spending pressure. But, of course, leaving the current highly\naccommodative monetary policy in place for too long would eventually fuel such\ninflationary pressures.\nWith core inflation at 1-1/4 percent, I see the opposing forces of resource gaps and\naccommodative monetary policy as roughly balancing out over the medium term. As\nresource slack abates in a recovering economy, I expect inflation to move up to about 1-\n3/4 percent by 2012.\nPage 9 of 12\n\nWhat does all of this mean for monetary policy? Currently, policy is, appropriately, very\naccommodative. But, eventually, we will have to return to a more normal stance.\nJudging the appropriate timing and pace for reducing accommodation poses a\nsignificant challenge for policymakers over the next couple years. On the one hand,\nremoving too much accommodation prematurely could inhibit the recovery. On the other\nhand, as I noted, if the Fed leaves the current level of accommodation in place too long,\ninflationary pressures will eventually build. The Fed’s decisions will be based on careful\nmonitoring of business activity and an alert eye out for signs of changes in the inflation\noutlook. In addition, the FOMC is making sure that it has the technical tools it will need\nwhen it decides to reduce monetary accommodation. Overall, I am confident that\nmonetary policy will both support economic growth and bring and keep inflation near my\nguideline of 2 percent over the medium term.\nAs you can imagine, the crisis and recession have kept us busy. But we have also\ndevoted a good deal of energy reflecting on events of the past several years. This is, in\nlarge part, because of the importance of the last question I am regularly asked: What\nhave you at the Federal Reserve learned about how to guard against future financial\ncrises? There are, of course, a number of lessons. I’d like to touch on a couple of them\nnow.\nOne lesson is that responding effectively during times of crisis may require innovative\nand targeted policy tools. As the crisis unfolded, we lowered our traditional policy tool,\nthe federal funds rate, to zero—as low as it could go. But credit markets remained\nPage 10 of 12\n\nfrozen and macroeconomic conditions were deteriorating. We thus turned to\nnontraditional tools to clear up the choke points. These included providing liquidity\ndirectly to nonbank financial institutions and supporting a number of short-term credit\nmarkets. We also purchased longer-duration assets that further reduced long-term\ninterest rates. These nontraditional actions helped us avoid what easily could have been\nan even more severe economic contraction.\nOf course, in the future it would be best to reduce the chances of facing financial crises\nin the first place. Until recent events, our approach to preventing financial crises has\nrelied on the microprudential supervision and regulation of individual banks. Since the\nGreat Depression, this approach appeared to suffice, even as our financial system\nbecame more dependent on nonbank financial intermediaries, such as broker–dealers,\nhedge funds, and other institutions beyond the regulatory reach of the Fed and the other\nbanking regulators. Nevertheless, the scale and scope of the past few years’ events\nhave exposed the weaknesses of a bank-by-bank regulatory approach. I believe that an\nimportant safeguard will be the creation of a systemic risk regulator charged with\nmonitoring and addressing risk across the wide range of financial institutions.\nSetting up more pre-established systematic risk controls is important as well. As part of\nthese, we need to ensure that no financial institution, bank or nonbank, is “too big to\nfail.” Many of the unprecedented interventions undertaken by the Fed, the FDIC, and\nthe U.S. Treasury occurred because we lacked alternatives that would have allowed for\nthe orderly unwinding of these large, complex financial institutions. While mechanisms\nPage 11 of 12\n\nalready exist to address large banking failures, we also need an effective process to\nresolve failing nonbank institutions that limits market disruption and minimize moral\nhazard. These situations should not be dealt with on an ad hoc basis. The need for an\nadvance plan is imperative.\nI’d like to conclude at this point, but I hope you’ll recall that the answers to our three\nquestions about future growth, inflation, and the financial crisis were three-and-a-half,\nno, and we’ve learned a lot. Of course, the details behind these short answers are key\nto understanding how we put the pieces together to create a picture of the economy and\nthe workings of our financial system. I hope I have been able to convey some of that to\nyou today.\nI look forward to your questions.\nPage 12 of 12",

Evans*\nAbstract\nThis paper examines the ability of a simple stylized general equilibrium model that\nincorporates nominal wage rigidity to explain the magnitude and persistence of the Great\nDepression in the United States. The impulses to our analysis are money supply shocks. The\nTaylor contracts model is surprisingly successful in accounting for the behavior of major\nmacroaggregates and real wages during the downturn phase of the Depression, i.e., from\n1929:3 through mid-1933. Our analysis provides support for the hypothesis that a monetary\ncontraction operating through a sticky wage channel played a significant role in accounting\nfor the downturn, and also provides an interesting refinement to this explanation. In\nparticular, both the absolute severity of the Depression’s downturn and its relative severity\ncompared to the 1920-21 recession are likely attributable to the price decline having a much\nlarger unanticipated component during the Depression, as well as less flexible wage-setting\npractices during this latter period. Another finding casts doubt on explanations for the\n1933-36 recovery that rely heavily on the substantial remonetization that began in 1933.\nKeywords: Dynamic General Equilibrium Model, Sticky Wages\n* Bordo is a professor of economics at Rutgers University and NBER fellow\n(bordo@rci.rutgers.edu), Erceg is a staff economist in the Division of International Finance of\nthe Federal Reserve Board (ercegc@frb.gov), and Evans is an assistant vice president and\neconomist in the Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n(cevans@frbchi.org).

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nREO & Vacant Properties Summit\nDay One Closing Remarks\nWashington, D.C.\nSeptember 1, 2010\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nRemarks at the Summit\nREO and Vacant Properties:\nStrategies for Neighborhood Stabilization\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nGood afternoon. I am pleased to be here today to share a few comments as we close\nout the first day of this excellent conference on REO and Vacant Property Strategies for\nNeighborhood Stabilization. Most of you already have some appreciation for the work\nthat the Federal Reserve System has been doing to address financial and economic\ninstability. What is less well known is that the Federal Reserve also has been working\nhard to respond to the foreclosure crisis on “Main Street.” We have leveraged our\nresearch, community affairs and supervision and regulation functions to support\ninnovative foreclosure prevention and neighborhood stabilization strategies at the local\nlevel.\nI’d like to talk about that important work, especially a Fed program called MORE, or the\nMortgage Outreach and Research Effort; but before I do that, I’d like to discuss some of\nthe larger issues that relate to homeownership and foreclosure mitigation. As a nation\nwe have come to value homeownership because of the many benefits it brings, for both\nfamilies and communities. Perhaps foremost is its potential for building household\nwealth. In addition, however, communities with high levels of homeownership tend to\nhave greater involvement in school and civic organizations, higher graduation rates,\nlower housing turnover and higher home values. Simply stated, homeowners tend to put\ndown deeper roots, and that is good for communities, as well as for families.\nRecognition of these benefits has made encouraging homeownership a national priority.\nTax incentives, FHA mortgage insurance and sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac all contributed to a long rise in the U.S. homeownership rate—from 45 percent in\n1940 to a peak of 69 percent in 2004. Of course, homeownership is only good for\nfamilies and communities if it can be sustained. Home purchases that are very highly\nleveraged or unaffordable subject the borrower to a great deal of risk. There's no\nguarantee, as we've learned recently, that house prices will rise. Moreover, even in a\nstrong economy, unforeseen life events and risks in local real estate markets represent\nvulnerabilities for highly leveraged borrowers.\nThus, it was very destructive when, in the early part of this decade, dubious\nunderwriting practices and mortgage products inappropriate for mass consumption\nbecame more common. It is difficult to understand how loose underwriting, high degrees\nof leverage and the broad marketing of exotic and often very high-cost mortgage\nproducts could promote sustainable homeownership. In fact, these practices took us in\nthe other direction, and homeownership began to decline even while mortgage\nunderwriting standards continued to loosen. Moreover, partly as a result of these\n2\n\npractices, we've seen an unprecedented housing market collapse that contributed to a\nvery deep recession marked by many lost jobs. And homeownership has now declined\nfor six straight years.\nAlthough there are some signs of general economic recovery and some evidence of\nhome price stabilization, we are certainly not out of the woods. Projections suggest\nforeclosed housing units in the U.S. could reach as high as 3 million in 2010.\nThe public policy response to the housing market collapse has become increasingly\naggressive as the severity and extent of the collapse have become clearer. One might\nexpect lenders to modify mortgages, making them more affordable for borrowers, rather\nthan accepting large losses on foreclosed properties. However, for various reasons, the\nnumber of modifications has been lower than we might have hoped. Thus federal\ngovernment efforts such as the Home Affordable Mortgage Program, or HAMP,\ncontinue to evolve, and the search for solutions goes on. The Federal Reserve has had\na longstanding interest in these issues, but our work has taken on added significance\nsince the advent of the housing meltdown and recent financial crisis.\nMy direct involvement in mortgage and foreclosure issues began fairly recently when I\nbecame President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and sponsor of a Federal\nReserve Initiative called MORE, or the Mortgage Outreach and Research Effort. Prior to\nthat, I had worked with our Community Affairs staff as they partnered with community\norganizations across our District to address foreclosures issues.\nIn Chicago, one of our most successful partnerships has been with Neighborhood\nHousing Services of Chicago (NHS). Much of this work started in the late 1990s,\nculminating in a program called HOPI, the Homeownership Preservation Initiative, in\n2003. The NHS, with our support, has pioneered many techniques to combat the ill\neffects of foreclosures. The HOPI has been instrumental in saving hundreds of families\nfrom foreclosure, hosting loan modification and counseling events, completing HAMP\nmodifications for borrowers and creating strategies for reclaiming vacant properties.\nAs part of the MORE initiative, the Chicago Fed, together with Federal Reserve Banks\naround the country and the Board of Governors in Washington, is also addressing\nforeclosure mitigation and neighborhood stabilization efforts—through outreach,\nresearch and meetings with industry experts.\nPerhaps most important so far has been our work to bring resources to the hardest hit\ncities and regions of the country. Home buyer counseling, for example, is a critical need\nin certain areas. Under the MORE program, we’ve helped many of our community\ndevelopment partners organize day-long “mega events” that have served thousands of\ntroubled borrowers. Moreover, we’ve partnered with and brought together housing\nadvocates, lenders, academics, and key government officials to discuss foreclosure\nissues and develop solutions. In some cases, alliances have been formed right on the\nspot to create and implement programs to keep people in their homes.\n3\n\nThe MORE program also has included a partnership with the U.S Departments of Labor\nand the Treasury and the HOPE NOW Unemployment Taskforce to assist unemployed\nhome owners at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure. This collaboration led to the\ncreation of an online tool that allows homeowners and servicers to document\nunemployment insurance benefits as income to qualify for federally sponsored\nmortgage modification programs. In 2008, each Reserve Bank within the Federal\nReserve System created an online Foreclosure Resource Center. These websites\nprovide local constituents and consumers with easy access to information on\nforeclosure-related resources. Features of our Foreclosure Resource Center include an\nenhanced Foreclosure Mitigation Toolkit, which provides detailed steps and information\nfor localities seeking to develop foreclosure prevention activities of their own, and a new\nForeclosure Recovery Resource Guide, which seeks to assist consumers who have\ngone through the foreclosure process.\nA number of Federal Reserve research projects have been initiated as part of the\nMORE program. They include several studies focusing on foreclosure prevention,\nfinancial education and adverse neighborhood effects resulting from foreclosures.\nIn this latter category, Community Affairs researchers across the Federal Reserve\nSystem launched a study in 2009 of the planning and early implementation stages of\nthe federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program. The research team conducted a series\nof interviews with more than 90 recipients of HUD's NSP funds in the fall of 2009, they\nwill release a report based on these interviews and other data in late 2010. This report\nwill provide the first nationwide examination of the impact of the NSP.\nIn order to leverage the work of MORE and to make information available to\npractitioners in the field, we have been active in sponsoring several conferences. In\naddition to the conference held here today, the FRS and the FDIC are co-hosting a two-\nday conference this fall that will highlight policy-oriented research focused on the U.S.\nhousing and mortgage markets. The first day of the conference will be dedicated to\nmortgage foreclosures, including research on the current situation and outlook,\nneighborhood spillover effects, and evaluations of efforts to mitigate foreclosures. The\nsecond day of the conference will present research on the future of housing finance.\nAll of the initiatives I have described as part of our MORE program serve to help\nsupplement work being done on foreclosure prevention and neighborhood stabilization,\nboth locally and nationally. My hope is that all of you here today will draw upon this\ninformation and the success of the MORE program to explore new and creative ways to\naddress these important challenges. At the Fed, we will continue to do our part to\nencourage further research, participate in the dialogue, and coordinate concerned\ngroups that want to work toward sustainable housing markets.\nThank you.\n4",

    "text": "Wecloming Remarks\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nThirteenth Annual International Banking Conference\nChicago, Ill.\nSeptember 23, 2010\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nWelcoming Remarks\nThirteenth Annual International Banking Conference\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nGood morning. I'm Charlie Evans, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nChicago. It’s my pleasure to welcome you to the 13th Annual International Banking\nConference.\nOver the years, this conference has served as an important forum for the discussion of\ncurrent issues affecting global financial markets. Past conferences have emphasized\nsystemic risk, the globalization of financial markets, international regulatory structures,\nthe problems involved with the resolution of globally active banks and financial crises\nmanagement.\nWe have been fortunate to have leading scholars, regulators and industry executives\nparticipate over the years and provide their valuable perspectives on topical policy\nissues. Our co-sponsor this year is the International Monetary Fund (IMF). I want to take\nthis opportunity to offer a special note of thanks to our IMF colleagues for helping to\norganize what I believe is an impressive program addressing an important policy issue\nhere in the United States and around the world.\nThis year we examine the role of macroprudential regulation of financial markets.\nHistorically, financial supervision and regulation has taken a microprudential approach.\nThe typical assumption had been that the financial system as a whole could be made\nsafe by ensuring that individual firms were made safe. While there was widespread\nknowledge that markets and firms were interconnected—in fact, that was the root of\n“too-big-to-fail” concerns—that interconnectedness was not a driving force behind\nfinancial supervision and regulation. And though we have learned many things from the\nrecent financial crisis, nothing has been more important than understanding that the\nactions of individual firms can generate significant externalities that can adversely affect\ngeneral market conditions, other institutions and, ultimately, the overall economy.\nIndeed, this reality helped make clear the critical need to change the way we supervise\nand regulate financial firms and markets.\nWe have recently seen a number of changes within the regulatory environment to\naddress the shortcomings of the past supervisory model. Under the Supervisory Capital\nAssessment Program (SCAP), U.S. regulators tested the ability of the largest\ninstitutions to withstand adverse macroeconomic shocks and continue to maintain\naggregate system lending. The regulators’ stress tests had characteristics of both\nmicroprudential and macroprudential supervision, with a goal of enhancing system\nstability. The stress tests yielded many benefits—perhaps none more important than\nrestoring public confidence in the largest institutions’ ability to withstand future worse-\nthan-expected economic scenarios.\n2\n\nTogether with other regulators, the Federal Reserve has also been heavily involved in\nthe Basel III process, which includes major revisions to global capital standards and the\nintroduction of new quantitative liquidity standards. The Federal Reserve System is also\ndeveloping processes to better enable it to identify and address emerging risks,\nparticularly risks with systemic implications. This “quantitative surveillance mechanism”\n(QSM) will incorporate data from markets, individual firms, and supervisors, and it will\naccommodate the results of stress testing in the future.\nIn the United States, the role of macroprudential regulation has been elevated\nsignificantly with the recent passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act. The act represents a paradigm shift in the American financial\nregulatory environment: We are moving toward a new regulatory landscape with an\nemphasis on financial system stability.\nThe act introduces a Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of representation\nfrom the various financial regulatory agencies, with an explicit financial stability\nmandate. The council will be responsible for monitoring the financial system to identify\nsystemic risks and regulatory gaps. It will identify systemically important firms (both\nbank and nonbank institutions), and these will be subject to more stringent prudential\nstandards. The heightened standards will involve new liquidity and capital requirements,\nstress testing, prompt corrective action, and reporting requirements. If necessary, the\nselected firms may also be subject to contingent capital requirements, enhanced public\ndisclosures, short-term debt limits, and other prudential standards.\nFurthermore, the act requires additional regulation of certain payments, clearing, or\nsettlement systems deemed to be systemically important. All of these reforms are aimed\nat protecting the financial system as a whole instead of just the individual financial\ninstitutions.\nWhile the Dodd–Frank Act stresses the important role of macroprudential regulation, it\nleaves many of the implementation details to the regulatory agencies. The following\nquestions are left for them to answer:\n• What are the determinants and appropriate levels of capital required of\nsystemically important firms?\n• How should they vary over the business cycle?\n• Should contingent capital be required?\n• What instruments will qualify as contingent capital?\n• And what data is needed to allow adequate monitoring of the activities of\nsystemically important institutions?\nThese are just a few of the important questions that must be addressed within the new\nregulatory landscape. As we have seen during the recent global crisis, the\ninterconnectedness of financial markets goes beyond our domestic borders. It is\nobvious that we need to do a better job of identifying cross-border linkages and their\n3\n\nassociated risks. Greater coordination across regulatory frameworks could be\ntremendously helpful in this effort. We hope that forums like this one will aid in that\nprocess.\nAgain, I’m pleased to welcome you to Chicago. I look forward to the next two days of\nstimulating discussion about how we as a global financial community should proceed\nwith macroprudential regulation. I think you will find this conference both informative and\nuseful.\n4",

Evans*\nAbstract\nThis paper examines the ability of a simple stylized general equilibrium model that\nincorporates nominal wage rigidity to explain the magnitude and persistence of the Great\nDepression in the United States. The impulses to our analysis are money supply shocks. The\nTaylor contracts model is surprisingly successful in accounting for the behavior of major\nmacroaggregates and real wages during the downturn phase of the Depression, i.e., from\n1929:3 through mid-1933. Our analysis provides support for the hypothesis that a monetary\ncontraction operating through a sticky wage channel played a significant role in accounting\nfor the downturn, and also provides an interesting refinement to this explanation. In\nparticular, both the absolute severity of the Depression’s downturn and its relative severity\ncompared to the 1920-21 recession are likely attributable to the price decline having a much\nlarger unanticipated component during the Depression, as well as less flexible wage-setting\npractices during this latter period. Another finding casts doubt on explanations for the\n1933-36 recovery that rely heavily on the substantial remonetization that began in 1933.\nKeywords: Dynamic General Equilibrium Model, Sticky Wages\n* Bordo is a professor of economics at Rutgers University and NBER fellow\n(bordo@rci.rutgers.edu), Erceg is a staff economist in the Division of International Finance of\nthe Federal Reserve Board (ercegc@frb.gov), and Evans is an assistant vice president and\neconomist in the Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\n(cevans@frbchi.org).

    "text": "Opening Remarks\nPublic Policy Symposium on OTC Derivatives Clearing\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nPublic Policy Symposium on OTC Derivatives Clearing\nChicago, Ill.\nSeptember 3, 2010\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nOpening Remarks\nPublic Policy Symposium on OTC Derivatives Clearing\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nThank you, Ed. Good morning. On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, I\nwould like to thank you for joining us today at this Public Policy Symposium on OTC\nDerivatives Clearing. I’m delighted to be here to welcome you and provide some brief\ncomments that, I hope, will help frame the discussion of the important issues related to\nthe central clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.\nThe Chicago Fed has had a long-standing interest in clearing and settlement issues. In\nparticular, we have an obvious interest, since Chicago is home to the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange and its clearinghouse, The Options Clearing Corporation and ICE\nClear U.S. We are proud of our role in producing cutting edge research relating to\nclearing and settlement and facilitating dialogue among academics, policymakers and\nfinancial industry participants.\nIn 1996, we co-sponsored a conference on derivatives and public policy at which the\nNobel laureate Merton Miller explored the competitive boundary between exchange-\ntraded and over-the-counter derivatives and the impact of new technologies that were\nthen changing the financial landscape. Miller recognized even then how clearing and\nsettlement functions were central to the operation of financial markets.\nMany of you will no doubt recall that we co-sponsored a conference on central\ncounterparty clearing with the European Central Bank in 2006. That event, like today’s,\nbrought together industry leaders, policymakers and academics in a multidisciplinary\ndiscussion of key legal, risk-management and public policy issues relating to central\ncounterparty clearing. In addition, the Chicago Fed has actively participated in the\nongoing work of the OTC Derivatives Regulators’ Forum since its formation in 2009.\nWe recently experienced the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. As we emerge\nslowly from that crisis, we have become engaged in a vigorous debate on how best to\naddress the major weaknesses in our financial regulatory framework—and the issue of\ncentralized clearing of derivatives has taken a prominent role. As you all know, the\nDodd-Frank bill seeks to address these weaknesses and put forward a structure that will\nhelp prevent another crisis of this magnitude.\nNotwithstanding the amount of work that has already been completed, making financial\nreform work will not be easy. We face complex problems that will require a\ncomprehensive, multipronged approach. But make no mistake; reform is critical for\nensuring our long-term economic and financial stability. And much of that reform will\naddress the implications of the increasing interconnectedness of the global payment,\n2\n\nclearing and settlement infrastructure that supports financial market operations today. In\na 2008 report titled The Interdependencies of Payment and Settlement Systems, the\nCommittee on Payment and Settlement Systems said:\nThe development of tighter interdependencies has helped to strengthen\nthe global payment and settlement infrastructure by reducing several\nsources of cost and risk. Yet, tightening interdependencies have also\nincreased the potential for disruptions to spread quickly and widely across\nmultiple systems and markets.i\nThe clearing of derivatives through central counterparties, or CCPs, is one important\nmanifestation of the interdependencies in the financial system. CCPs interpose\nthemselves between the counterparties to financial contracts by becoming the common\nbuyer to each seller and the seller to each buyer. The centralization of clearing functions\nat the clearinghouse has obvious benefits, including multilateral netting and the\ncentralization of the information needed to manage risk exposures in a robust manner.\nHowever, policymakers also recognize that central clearing concentrates risk and\nresponsibility for risk management in the CCP.\nThis means the clearinghouse itself becomes a potential single point of failure.\nAccordingly, adequate capital, good risk management and prudential oversight are\nessential for such clearing facilities. The events of the recent financial crisis have\ncertainly reinforced our recognition of the importance of these post-trade institutions.\nAs you know, the central clearing of over-the-counter derivatives is a core feature of the\nlegislation recently enacted to reform financial market regulation—a development that\nhas important implications for market structure. Interest in this topic isn’t merely local or\neven national—in fact, it’s global, as is evident from the attendance at this event.\nToday’s symposium has brought together leaders from industry, the policy and\nregulatory communities and academia from around the world to have an open and frank\ndiscussion on issues related to central counterparty clearing. Four questions will\ndominate the discussion:\n• Who should own and control a central counterparty?\n• Who should participate in central clearing?\n• What is the appropriate capital structure for a central counterparty?\n• What should the market structure look like?\nThese are all difficult questions. I doubt that a consensus will be reached quickly on all\nof the relevant issues. But it is important for us to understand each parties’ perspective\nand to consider the costs and benefits of the policies that are being implemented for the\nregulation of these markets. Good policymaking depends upon this interaction.\nThis symposium has been organized to take full advantage of the collective wisdom and\nbody of expertise that exists in this room. The panelists’ remarks are designed to initiate\nthe discussion of each set of topics and then open the discussion to all. Thank you all\n3\n\nfor coming. I look forward to a good discussion and further debate on the importance of\nOTC derivatives clearing and settlement.\ni Bank for International Settlements, Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, 2008, The Interdependencies\nof Payment and Settlement Systems, Basel, Switzerland, June, p. 1.\n4",

    "text": "A Perspective on the Future of U.S. Monetary Policy\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nThe Future of Monetary Policy\nBank of France Conference\nRome, Italy\nOctober 1, 2010\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nA Perspective on the Future of U.S. Monetary Policy\nBank of France Conference\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nThank you for that kind introduction. It’s a great pleasure to be here. Over the past three\nyears, we have been dealing with a crisis that has reverberated around the world,\ninflicting severe damage to financial markets and economies. The response of\npolicymakers in the U.S. and elsewhere was swift and unprecedented in its scope and\nmagnitude. It was also well coordinated across the community of central banks. We set\nup swap lines to ease liquidity strains throughout the world and lowered target rates\njointly at the height of the crisis. Such coordinated action was very helpful in stabilizing\nthe global financial system.\nToday, as we progress with economic recovery, policymakers in all countries are faced\nwith a new set of challenges and issues. Recognizing that they face a distinct set of\nchallenges, I look forward to hearing my co-panelists discuss the issues facing\nEuropean policymakers as they deliberate the future of monetary policy. For my part, I\nwould like to give you my perspective on some of the issues we face in the U.S. Before I\nproceed further, let me stress that I will be sharing my personal views with you, and not\nnecessarily offering the views of my colleagues on the FOMC, or the Federal Reserve\nSystem.\nThe U.S. was the epicenter of the financial crisis and the deep recession that followed.\nThe decline in our economic activity and the damage to financial markets in the past\nthree years are a reflection of the magnitude of the shock. Over the course of the\nrecession, U.S. real GDP declined by more than 4 percent, over 8 million jobs were lost,\nthe unemployment rate doubled within two years and the household sector – which\naccounts for the lion’s share of the U.S. economy – lost more than $13 trillion in wealth.\nOver the past year, however, we’ve seen significant improvements. Financial markets\nhave stabilized and have progressed toward full repair. Aided by accommodative\nmonetary policy, fiscal stimulus and improvements in financial markets, real GDP has\nrecorded four quarters of positive growth and employment has begun to rise. However,\ngiven the depth of the recession, we still have a long road ahead before we catch up to\nthe level of activity we would have achieved in the absence of the crisis, or any other\nshock. Moreover, we appear to have lost some of our forward momentum in recent\nmonths. Real GDP growth slowed markedly from an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the\nfirst quarter to 1.6 percent in the second quarter. More recent data suggest that growth\nin the second half of the year will be similarly weak – and softer than what I had\nexpected just a few months ago. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation\n2\n\nhave fallen to very low levels -- levels that are below the 2 percent level that I, and most\nFed policymakers, consider to be consistent with effective price stability.\nLooking ahead, I expect output growth will strengthen in 2011 and 2012. Nonetheless,\nthe pace of growth I currently anticipate is quite moderate given the severity of the\nrecession we experienced and the potential growth rate of output. As a result, I expect\nthe unemployment rate to remain well above its pre-crisis level over the next two to\nthree years. Given the current and the anticipated future level of resource slack and\nsubdued long-term inflation expectations, I also expect inflation to remain below\ndesirable levels over any reasonable forecast horizon.\nWith such an outlook for the economy, as a macroeconomist and policymaker, I think\nwe face two key issues in the near and medium term. First, to what extent do structural\nfactors explain the very high unemployment rate we currently have? Some have\nsuggested that the financial crisis and the accompanying recession precipitated a\nseismic shift in the structure of labor markets, raising the natural rate of unemployment\nsignificantly above its pre-crisis level. If, as they suggest, labor market frictions rose\ndramatically over the past two years, then monetary policy is not the appropriate tool to\naddress the ramifications of such a change. If, on the other hand, structural factors can\nonly explain a modest part of the rapid rise in the unemployment rate, and aggregate\ndemand deficiencies account for remainder, then monetary policy may be able to play a\nconstructive role.\nThis brings me to the second key issue facing policymakers. If further monetary policy\naccommodation is desirable, what is the appropriate policy action when short-term\ninterest rates are already at zero? Has extreme risk aversion by businesses and\nconsumers put us in what can be described as a liquidity trap? And if so, what can we\ndo about it?\nLet me first elaborate on the unsatisfactory progress in employment gains, and what it\nimplies for monetary policy. There are several reasons to think that the natural rate of\nunemployment has risen over the last couple of years. It is possible that the extension\nof unemployment insurance benefits during the recession, while cushioning unemployed\nworkers from the adverse effects of lost income, might have reduced some workers’ job\nsearch intensity, or kept others from leaving the labor force. To the extent that such\nincentives are present, the natural rate of unemployment would increase while the\nextended benefits are in effect. However, reasonable estimates of the effect of the\nextension of unemployment benefits range one-half to one percentage points – far from\nsufficient to explain the nearly 5 percentage point increase over the past two years.\nMoreover, given the current schedule for the expiration of these benefits, the resulting\nincrease in the natural unemployment rate will fade away over the next two years –\nleaving us still with an unsatisfactorily high rate of unemployment at the end of my\nforecast horizon.\nIt is also possible that the shocks that reverberated through the economy created a\nmismatch between the skills sought by employers and the skills the unemployed\n3\n\nworkers have. For instance, it is conceivable that the recession affected the different\nregions and sectors of the economy unevenly. Moreover, the recession may have\nsevered an unusually large number of long-term employment relationships, making for\nan especially difficult transition for affected workers. The unusually long spells of\nunemployment experienced during the recent recession and potential erosion of skills\nduring that time are additional factors that might have magnified labor market frictions.\nThe sharp decline in home values and tight credit conditions might have reduced the\nability of unemployed workers to sell their homes and move to regions where jobs are\navailable. Taken together, these developments might have eroded the efficiency of\nmatching between workers and jobs, and raised the natural rate of unemployment.1\nThe key question is: Are these possible structural changes in the labor market sufficient\nto explain the current unemployment rate? The Beveridge curve that describes the\nrelationship between the unemployment rate and the job vacancy rate is a useful tool for\naddressing this question. The unemployment-vacancy relationship through the end of\n2009 is captured very well by a simple, stable Beveridge curve and a constant-returns\nCobb-Douglas matching function. So, the relationship between job openings and\nunemployment through the end of 2009 has been relatively stable, and does not\nsuggest a dramatic increase in labor market frictions. It is only recently that we have\nseen an improvement in job openings that was not matched by a correspondingly large\nreduction in unemployment. Based on these data, some have suggested that most of\nthe increase in the unemployment rate over the past two years is due to skills mismatch.\nHowever, it seems likely that much of the apparent conflict between unemployment and\nvacancy data may be purely an issue of timing. At this stage of an economic recovery, it\nis not unusual for the vacancy rate to increase ahead of reductions in the\nunemployment rate – we have often seen such loops in the Beveridge curve at the end\nof past recessions.\nBut even if we take the job openings data at face value, it doesn’t suggest an increase\nin the natural rate to anything like the current rate of unemployment, which stands at 9.6\npercent. Making some plausible assumptions, my staff estimates that the typical level of\nunemployment associated with a stable Beveridge curve passing through the recent\ndata is likely to be about 7 percent. This includes the effects of increased\nunemployment insurance benefits that I already discussed.2\nI am not suggesting that 7 percent is a good estimate of the current natural rate. As I\nsaid, there are reasons to discount some of the recent improvement in the vacancy\ndata. Rather, I want to point to out that, even if one takes the vacancy data at face value\nand accepts that the natural rate has risen to 7 percent, we are still left with a very large\n1 See Petrongolo and Pissarides (2001) for a review of aggregate matching functions in labor markets and\nthe related literature.\n2 As I noted before, unless unemployment insurance benefits and the Emergency Unemployment\nCompensation program are extended further, they are scheduled to expire in 2011, at which point any\nimpact they had on the natural rate of unemployment will begin to fade away.\n4\n\namount of slack relative to the current rate of unemployment and the rate most analysts\nexpect to see at the end of 2012.3\nThe size of the unemployment gap, combined with the fact that inflation has been\nrunning below the level I consider consistent with long-term price stability, suggests that\nit would be desirable to increase monetary policy accommodation to boost aggregate\ndemand and achieve our dual mandate .\nShould the FOMC judge that further monetary policy accommodation is appropriate\nbased on our economic outlook, what is the optimal level of additional accommodation\nand what policy tools should be employed to deliver the additional stimulus?\nDuring a typical period of policy accommodation, the answers to these questions would\nbe straightforward. The FOMC would lower the target federal funds rate based on our\neconomic outlook and the historical relationship between policy actions and their impact\non the economy. For instance, were the current fed funds rate at 3 percent, my forecast\nwould call for a substantial decline in the target rate. Such a reduction in the nominal fed\nfunds rate would be consistent with several versions of the Taylor rule, which would call\nfor negative interest rates.4 However, at roughly zero, the fed funds rate is as low as it\ncan go.\nAs a result, the current economic environment poses unusual challenges to\npolicymakers. In assessing the current state of the economy and considering the\noptimal policy response, a key issue that concerns me is the possibility that we might be\nin a liquidity trap.\nAs I assess the incoming data and talk to my business contacts, I see that executives\nare very cautious in their outlook and spending plans. They appear to be content to post\nstrong profits generated by unprecedented cost-cutting, rather than growing their top-\nline revenues by expanding capital investments and hiring. Very conservative attitudes\nreign and cash is still king – even after the improvements in financial markets and\nstrong bond issuance by businesses. Firms are sitting on the cash generated by profits\nand funds raised in capital markets. Very few are planning to grow their workforce.\nAlthough some contacts point to uncertainties raised by regulatory actions and\ngovernment policies to explain their reluctance to invest, most admit that they would\nincrease spending if stronger demand conditions prevailed.\n3 There are other challenges for the view that the increase in the unemployment rate over the past two\nyears reflects primarily structural factors: the dearth of sectors reporting strong demand for hard-to-find\nskilled workers; the lack of inflation pressures that we would expect to observe if the natural rate were\nhigher and resource slack were smaller; and the unusually low quit rates and job-to-job transitions during\nthe recession that are indicative of weak labor markets (De Wolfe and Klemmer, 2010; unpublished\nupdates of the employment-to-employment transitions in Fallick and Fleischman, 2004).\n4 For instance, the guideline suggested by Taylor (1999) would call for the federal funds rate to be\nnegative 3.5 percent given the current CBO output gap of negative 6 percent and core CPI inflation rate\nof 1 percent, assuming that the FOMC considers 2 percent inflation to be consistent with price stability.\nThe guideline outlined in Taylor (1993), which puts a smaller weight on the current output gap, would\nsuggest that the federal funds rate target should be negative 0.5 percent.\n5\n\nHouseholds are similarly cautious and gun-shy in their spending. Given the millions of\njobs lost during the recession, the job insecurity faced by those employed, trillions of\ndollars in lost wealth and the balance-sheet repair that households have undertaken,\nconsumers are displaying significant risk aversion. They have raised their savings rate,\neven though those savings earn very little interest income.\nThese are the classic symptoms associated with a liquidity trap: the supply of savings\nthat outstrip the demand for investment even when short-term nominal rates are at zero.\nThe modern economic theory of liquidity traps indicates that the optimal policy response\nat zero-bound is to lower the real interest rate, almost surely by employing\nunconventional policy tools. Theory also indicates that, in the absence of such policy\nstimulus, the factors that generate high risk aversion could very well stifle a meaningful\nrecovery, keep unemployment high and reinforce disinflationary pressures – clearly an\nundesirable equilibrium.\nSo, in the coming weeks and months, as I assess the incoming data, update my\nforecast and deliberate on the best monetary policy approach, I will be pondering two\nkey issues: How much more should monetary policy do to reduce the shortfalls in\nmeeting our dual mandate responsibilities for employment and price stability; and what\ntools should we use?

    "text": "Panel Comments for the\nBank of Korea International Conference 2010\nRemarks for the\nBank of Korea International Conference 2010\nJune 1, 2010\nSeoul, Korea\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK\nOF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nPanel Comments for the\nBank of Korea International Conference 2010\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve is charged with promoting financial\nconditions that provide for maximum employment and price stability. During normal\ntimes, when small to moderate adjustments in policy are appropriate, our primary policy\ntool has been a market interest rate, the federal funds rate. Indeed, to address just\nabout all of the deviations of employment and inflation from their goal values, a policy of\nadjusting the short-term market rate—though sometimes by hundreds of basis points—\nhas been sufficient. Of course, in the nearly three years that I have been Chicago Fed\npresident, economic and financial fluctuations have been far from typical. Today, I\nwould like to comment on monetary policy strategies for responding to unusually large\nrisk-events.\nCentral banks must always be on guard against risks that are relatively rare, but have\npotentially large and disruptive effects. Or, to put it another way: Central banks must\nalways monitor economic conditions for potentially large disruptions in the economic\ninfrastructure. Such disruptions might lead to structural impediments to previously\n2\n\nsustainable growth rates, long periods of disinflation, or stagflationary conditions, to\nname just a few possible negative outcomes. In my discussion, I will take it for granted\nthat inflation scares and loss of central bank credibility must be included on this list of\ninfrastructure disruptions.1\nOne major disruption occurred in the 1970s when the Federal Reserve arguably did not\nappreciate the persistence of the productivity slowdown and monetary policy\nunintentionally generated destructive inflationary pressures.2\nOther disruptions have been associated with financial crises. I think of the problem\nposed by these in the following way. At some point in time, circumstances arise that\ncreate large real losses for investors, businesses, and households. These losses are\nreal in the sense that now the current and future production possibility set is smaller or\nconsumption possibilities are more limited. Just to be completely clear, production\npossibilities may be smaller if everyone’s previous assessments are shown to be\nexaggerated. And lower expected consumption follows naturally from any decline in\npermanent income and wealth. For a central bank, with no ability to eliminate these\nunderlying real losses, the challenges in assessing the situation are threefold:\n1. Will these real losses increase further? How much of the losses are\nalready in train and when will they end?\n1 See Marvin Goodfriend, 1993, “Interest rate policy and the inflation scare problem: 1979–1992,” Economic\nQuarterly, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Vol. 79, No. 1, Winter, pp. 1–23.\n2 See Athanasios Orphanides, 2002, “Monetary policy rules and the Great Inflation,” American Economic Review,\nVol. 92, No. 2, May, pp. 115–120.\n3\n\n2. Will leverage and zero-sum hedging activities result in concentrations of\ndistress that disrupt systemically important financial intermediation?\n3. Will these losses and collateral financial consequences negatively impair\nthe economy’s infrastructure, capital stock, and labor force in ways that\namplify the effects?\nI think it is safe to say that we have yet to develop realistic macroeconomic models\nincorporating a rich enough array of financial markets and frictions to provide definitive\npolicy analysis.3 But the history of central banking and most monetary analyses suggest\nto me the following policy directions to address these three challenges. First, when an\neconomy has accumulated real losses that limit production and consumption\npossibilities, a central bank cannot eliminate those primary losses with its access to the\nprinting press, even if it is a twenty-first-century printing press.4 Second, however, well-\ndesigned lending facilities may be able to mitigate amplification and knock-on effects\nassociated with wholesale increases in the risk aversion of private liquidity-providers. In\nthis way, these programs may limit the effects of these losses on unaware agents and\ncollateral economic sectors. Third, limiting the effects of increased perceptions of\nliquidity risks may avoid additional destruction of economic infrastructure. However, an\n3 See Charles L. Evans, 2008, “Challenges that the recent financial market turmoil places on our macroeconomic\ntoolkit,” speech by Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President and Chief Executive Officer at the Swiss National\nBank Research Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 19.\n4 Here I have in mind innovative approaches that channel liquidity to markets for newer financial products. The\nTerm Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) is one example, which directed liquidity to the market for asset-\nbacked securities. That being said, in another way there is little “new” about this avenue for money creation—\nliquidity injected through programs like the TALF will still show up on the liability side of the central bank’s balance\nsheet as an increase in high-powered money.\n4\n\nimportant caveat is that central bank actions must strike a balance between reasonable\nrepair and unreasonable liquidity expansions that misdirect activities into unproductive\nareas, create larger incentive problems, or ultimately fuel inflation scares.\nIt is easy to describe this balancing act, but difficult to draw bright lines. Nevertheless, in\nmy judgment, there can be substantial scope for central bank action in the face of a\nfinancial crisis. Here are a few examples.\nIn the U.S. in the early 1930s, there was a string of bank failures that the Fed failed to\ncontain. These hobbled the real economy in a period when firms were heavily\ndependent on bank lending. Moreover, the effective destruction of bank expertise in\nunderwriting loans and originating credit increased the real cost of credit intermediation,\nadding to the length and severity of the depression.5 During the recent episode, we also\nsaw something akin to a series of runs—liquidity runs—that multiplied the impact of the\ninitial losses. This time the liquidity runs were not on standard commercial banks.\nInstead they were on institutions in the “shadow” banking system, especially those that\nsupport securitization. This was of great concern because in the U.S., securitization\nplays a critical role in the ultimate provision of credit to households and nonfinancial\nbusinesses.\nThis time, the Fed responded aggressively. We eased access to our ordinary discount\nwindow. In a departure from normal practice, the Fed made loans available to financial\n5 See Ben S. Bernanke, 1983, “Nonmonetary effects of the financial crisis in the propagation of the Great\nDepression,” American Economic Review, Vol. 73, No. 3, June, pp. 257–276.\n5\n\ninstitutions other than commercial banks. Our programs also supported money market\nfunds and the commercial paper market. And in an effort to revive lending that had been\ndependent on securitization, we cooperated with the Treasury to lend to purchasers of\nasset-backed securities.\nIn 2008, the Federal Reserve also cooperated with many foreign central banks to help\naddress liquidity strains. Institutions in other countries also had financed asset\npurchases—many of them U.S. based—with short-term dollar-denominated borrowing.\nSome of the same spillovers that had affected U.S. credit markets also pressured these\nforeign financial firms and put further demands on dollar liquidity in U.S. markets, with\npossible negative consequences for our economy. Accordingly, the Fed set up dollar-\nswap facilities with foreign central banks.\nThe Federal Reserve recently reopened these swap lines. This step seems prudent as\nthe dramatic repricing of the sovereign credit risk of some peripheral European\ncountries has the potential to create dollar funding pressures in world markets. As we\ndid earlier, the Federal Reserve today offers dollars in exchange for foreign currency\ncollateral—at a fixed exchange rate and a penalty rate. In this way foreign central banks\ncan extend dollar liquidity support to creditworthy financial institutions facing temporary\nliquidity strains in foreign credit markets.\n6\n\nWith respect to many of our lending programs, some have described our actions as\ntaking the place of the private sector while the private sector was incapacitated. In fact,\nit was a partial and incomplete step in that direction. The central bank’s difficult job is to\nprovide liquidity, without taking on undue credit risk. So, we never went as far as\noffering funding on the same terms that private institutions previously did in credit\nmarkets. Believe me, I heard that often and repeatedly from some of my financial sector\ncontacts! We lent only against higher-quality assets and priced our loans and haircut\ncollateral at what in normal circumstances would have been hefty penalty rates. The\nexceptions to this were the special assistance offered to specific institutions during the\nBear Sterns demise and AIG assistance. In these cases, taking on some credit risk was\na necessary cost of preventing further intensification of the financial crisis.\nMy time is running short, but I would like to make just some quick comments on\nquantitative easing. While the liquidity support we provided the economy was very\nhelpful, it was clearly not enough. Given the huge resource gaps, and low and declining\ninflation, more monetary accommodation was appropriate. Under any version of the\nTaylor Rule, the funds rate should have been quite negative during the darkest period of\nthe recession. But policy was constrained by the zero-bound on interest rates. So we\nincreased accommodation by turning to large-scale purchases of long-term assets. We\nultimately purchased $1.7 trillion of GSE debt, MBS, and long-term Treasuries. The idea\nwas that significant purchases of these assets would lower term risk premia through a\nportfolio balance effect. In addition, in the case of MBS, our purchases likely lowered\nliquidity premia.\n7\n\nI think the jury is still out on exactly how much additional monetary accommodation\nthese purchases have provided. By some empirical estimates, these purchases\ndecreased term premia on long-term assets somewhere in the 30 to 100 basis point\nrange.6 Although even the smallest effect would be helpful to the economy, I suspect\nthe larger beneficial effects were nonlinear. Back in March 2009, every business contact\nI spoke with was extremely concerned that the downward spiral might turn into a\ncomplete financial meltdown. It may be easy to dismiss that concern today—ex post,\nsort of like surviving a cancer scare or a sharp pain in your chest—but it was a very real\nrisk at that time. And I think that by announcing unprecedented monetary policy actions\nduring this time, in conjunction with substantial fiscal stimulus, that everyone understood\ntoday’s twenty-first-century public policymakers were committed to doing everything in\ntheir power to avoid the worst-case events that befell the U.S. economy in the 1930s.\nMy time has undoubtedly expired. So I’ll save any further commentary on exit strategies\nto the general panel discussion.\n6 See Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack, 2010, “Large-scale asset purchases by the\nFederal Reserve: Did they work?,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, staff report, No. 441, March. Gagnon et al.\n(2010) conclude, “The overall size of the reduction in 10-year term premium appears to be between 30 and 100\nbasis points, with most estimates in the lower and middle third of this range.”\n8",

    "text": "Some Thoughts on the Current Economic Situation\nRemarks for the\nUniversity Club of Chicago\nJune 8, 2010\nChicago, IL\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK\nOF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nThose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nUniversity Club of Chicago\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nThank you, Madlyn, for that kind introduction and very warm welcome. I'd also like to\nextend a special thank you to Greg O'Leary for helping to arrange my visit to the\nUniversity Club and the Civic Affairs Society Breakfast Forum. I'm especially pleased to\nbe here this morning to explain what I see happening in the economy and express my\nviews on some of the key issues we face today. Over the past couple of years I have\nbeen asked many times to speak about the Federal Reserve’s role in addressing the\nfinancial crisis. Usually, at the end of the talk, when I open the floor for discussion, I find\nmyself being asked the same sorts of questions over and over again. So I’d like to\naddress some of those questions in my remarks today and then give you an opportunity\nto follow up with questions of your own.\nLet me emphasize that the views that I am presenting today are my own and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or my other\ncolleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\nLet’s begin with the question I hear most often: What are the prospects for the\neconomy?\n2\n\nIn short, the economy is recovering from the recession, and I am optimistic that it will\ncontinue to do so. My forecast is that real gross domestic product (GDP) will grow about\n3-1/2 percent this year. In fact, we have been hearing many more upbeat business\nreports over the past several months, and have nudged up our outlook accordingly.\nThat said, we still need to experience a good deal of growth before we return to the\nmore normal pace of economic activity and levels of unemployment that we enjoyed in\nlate 2007. And the 3-1/2 percent pace of growth I anticipate is quite moderate given the\nseverity of the recession. To offer some perspective, in the first year and a half following\nthe deep 1981 to 1982 recession, growth averaged nearly 8 percent.\nLet me give you some of the details underlying this assessment of the economy.\nFirst, consider the recent GDP numbers, which measure the value of all of the goods\nand services produced in the economy. GDP fell sharply—3.7 percent all told—during\n2008 and the first half of 2009. But GDP has increased in each of the past three\nquarters, with growth averaging a 3.6 percent annual rate.\nWhere did this growth come from? Some of it reflected the federal government stimulus\npackage passed in 2009. This raised economic activity a good deal in the second half of\nlast year, and should be a continued solid boost to spending through much of 2010.\n3\n\nBut government stimulus is hardly the whole story. Unmistakably, private spending has\nbeen reviving. One area is inventory investment by businesses. During the recession,\nfirms aggressively cut inventories to very lean levels. By avoiding an overhang of\nexcess stocks, they are now increasing orders for newly produced goods to meet\nincoming demand—and we’ve seen manufacturing production increase accordingly. We\nhave also seen an increase in business spending on capital equipment, most notably on\nhigh-tech items, as firms replace and upgrade their IT systems and other equipment in\norder to maintain competiveness and profitability.\nConsumers also have increased spending. Job worries and losses in household wealth\nhad caused consumers to cut back on spending appreciably during the recession. But\nthey have now begun to reopen their pocketbooks. During the first quarter of 2010 total\npersonal consumption expenditures increased at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate.\nSignificantly, these increases were distributed across many different types of goods and\nservices. Even in the hard-hit automobile sector, sales have averaged over 11 million\nunits annual rate so far this year—up over 17 percent from a year ago, though still well\nbelow the pace of 16.6 million units that prevailed before the recession.\nIn contrast, housing continues to struggle. During the second half of 2009, both sales\nand new construction lifted off from the recession low points seen around the turn of last\nyear. But sales fell back after the expiration last November of the first round of tax\ncredits for first-time home buyers, before receiving another boost this spring, as buyers\nrushed to beat the end-of-April expiration date for the extension of the home buyer tax\n4\n\ncredits. The increase in housing starts also stalled later in 2009 before showing some\nmodest renewal during the past several months. Still, the rates of sales and starts are\nfar below historical norms. Fundamentally, supply conditions continue to weigh on real\nestate markets, and they could for some time as foreclosures add to the overhang of\nunsold homes. But with the improving economy, low mortgage rates, and more\nattractively priced homes, housing market conditions will get better as we move further\ninto the expansion.\nWhat about labor markets? In general, many measures of economic activity show\nimprovement early in a recovery well before the jobs picture starts to get better. This\nwas especially true following the two previous recessions. I am concerned that this may\nbe the case during this expansion as well. As the economy entered the most recent\nrecession, businesses quickly cut their work forces. And even as the economy grew\nduring the second half of 2009, job destruction outpaced the extremely low levels of\nhiring.\nMore recently, there has been a modest improvement in the jobs picture. Over the first\nfive months of the year, excluding temporary hiring for the U.S. Census, on average\nabout 86,000 jobs per month were added to the economy. Last Friday's data were\ndisappointing, but they are only one month's numbers.\nBusinesses are being cautious about adding permanent staffing. They continue to strive\nto produce more with fewer people. But they can increase output for only so long\n5\n\nwithout adding to payrolls. As the recovery progresses and businesses become more\nconfident in the future, employment will increase on a more consistently solid basis.\nIndeed, there are signals that we currently are near such a turning point. There is the\nmodest pickup in the jobs numbers I just noted. Underlying those recent employment\nnumbers, layoffs are down substantially. Some of those businesses that cut\nemployment most aggressively at the beginning of the recession have begun to rehire.\nAnd others that are taking a more wait-and-see attitude are hiring temporary workers to\nfill their staffing needs. In fact, temporary worker employment has increased solidly in\neach of the past eight months.\nNonetheless, even after more solid employment gains materialize, unemployment may\nremain stubbornly high. Discouraged workers will resume searching for jobs, adding to\nthe number of those already looking for work. In addition, the number of long-term\nunemployed is extremely high, and such workers typically have a more difficult time\nfinding a job. Consequently, the outlook for these workers is challenged. So I anticipate\nthat the rate and length of unemployment will improve relatively slowly.\nWith consumer spending accounting for roughly two-thirds of GDP, the economic forces\nat work here are key factors underlying the moderate projections for overall growth.\nHouseholds entered this recession with high net worth but also with low levels of\nsavings and high levels of debt. When faced with a temporary loss of income,\nhouseholds can maintain spending only by drawing down assets, borrowing more, or\n6\n\nreducing savings. But as the recession took hold, households faced mounting job\nlosses, stark reductions in the value of their housing and equity assets, and little in the\nway of liquid savings. So it is little wonder that consumers sharply retrenched on\nspending.\nThe need for households to repair their balance sheets will moderate growth in\nconsumer spending going forward. In addition, we are seeing reduced availability of\nhousehold credit. And, importantly, muted gains in employment will hold back growth in\nwages and salaries. All of these factors contribute to an outlook for relatively modest\ngrowth in consumer spending, which, in turn, restrains the forecast for overall GDP\ngrowth.\nIn addition to consumer lending, the availability of bank credit remains a significant\nheadwind for many small- and medium-sized companies. Both supply and demand\nconsiderations are at work here. Some of the decline in bank lending last year reflects\nweak demand for loans by businesses wary of taking on new debt burdens in an\nuncertain economic environment. But at least some of the reduced lending arises from\nbanks’ tighter lending standards. These tighter standards appear to reflect concerns of\nbanks about their own capital levels and also the credit quality of borrowers. More\ngenerally, credit flows are being reduced because both borrowers and lenders are still\ndealing with losses from the recession, especially the busts in residential and\ncommercial real estate. I expect banking conditions to improve and better support\ngrowth, but this is likely to take some time.\n7\n\nWhile I’ve mentioned a number of factors that we think will dampen growth, we could be\nsurprised on the upside. Increases in confidence could turn into higher spending sooner\nthan we now think. And productivity growth has remained strong. Technology continues\nto advance, and firms continue to create new products and find new ways to produce\nmore efficiently. These factors will lead to higher incomes in the longer term. And even\nover the shorter term, the higher profits and incomes generated by productivity can help\nrestructure balance sheets and support spending.\nWell, that was a long answer to a short question. The second question I’m often asked\nis a two-parter concerning inflation. The first part is: Isn’t inflation about to explode? The\nsecond part is: Are you concerned about deflation? The answer is no in both cases: I\nthink inflation will remain relatively stable.\nBoth camps have clear arguments. The current low rates of resource utilization strongly\npoint to lower inflation. At 9.7 percent, the unemployment rate is quite high. Similarly,\nmanufacturing capacity utilization is quite low. Such resource slack reduces cost\npressures and makes firms less able to push through price increases. These factors\nhave contributed significantly to lower inflation. The Fed’s preferred measure of core\ninflation—the deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, excluding food\nand energy—has fallen from 2.7 percent in August 2008 to 1.2 percent in April 2010.\nThat is a large decline for a relatively stable data series.\n8\n\nThose who press me on higher inflation point to the Fed’s accommodative policy and\nexpanded balance sheet. We all know that too much money chasing too few goods\neventually will generate inflation. But, currently, most of the funds used to increase our\nbalance sheet are sitting idly in bank reserves. And because banks are not lending\nthose reserves, they are not yet generating spending pressure. But, of course, leaving\nthe current highly accommodative monetary policy in place for too long would eventually\nfuel such inflationary pressures.\nWith core inflation at 1-1/4 percent, I see the opposing forces of resource gaps and\naccommodative monetary policy as roughly balancing out over the medium term. As\nresource slack abates in a recovering economy, I expect inflation to move up to about 1-\n3/4 percent by 2012.\nWhat does all of this mean for monetary policy? Currently, policy is, appropriately, very\naccommodative. But, eventually, we will have to return to a more normal stance.\nJudging the appropriate timing and pace for reducing accommodation poses a\nsignificant challenge for policymakers over the next couple years. On the one hand,\nremoving too much accommodation prematurely could inhibit the recovery. On the other\nhand, as I noted, if the Fed leaves the current level of accommodation in place too long,\ninflationary pressures will eventually build. The Fed’s decisions will be based on careful\nmonitoring of business activity and keeping an alert eye out for signs of changes in the\ninflation outlook. In addition, the FOMC is making sure that it has the technical tools it\nwill need when it decides to reduce monetary accommodation. Overall, I am confident\n9\n\nthat monetary policy will both support economic growth and bring and keep inflation\nnear my guideline of 2 percent over the medium term.\nAs you can imagine, the crisis and recession have kept us busy. And we are constantly\nalert to issues that may cause us to reassess our outlook. With this in mind, I’d like to\naddress a question that I have been asked a lot lately: How will recent events in Europe\naffect the U.S. economy?\nThere are a few channels through which the European sovereign debt problems could\ninfluence us here. European efforts to lower debt will likely weigh on their economic\ngrowth over the medium term. This will translate into less demand by Europeans for\nU.S. products. In addition, the dollar already has appreciated relative to the euro. This\nmeans that European consumers find our products to be relatively more expensive than\nbefore. At the same time, prices for European goods in terms of the dollar have fallen,\nboosting our demand for European imports. All of these channels work in the direction\nof lowering U.S. net exports, which, all else being equal, would tend to reduce the\noutlook for U.S. GDP growth.\nHowever, a couple of factors suggest that these trade effects of the European fiscal\nsituation on the U.S. economy are likely to be limited. Although the euro-11 economy is\nlarge, it represents only about 15 percent of U.S. exports. In comparison, our single\nlargest trading partner, Canada, accounted for over 19 percent of domestic exports last\nyear. And while the dollar has appreciated almost 18 percent relative to the euro since\n10\n\nlate November, the broad dollar exchange rate that is a trade-weighted average across\nall currencies has appreciated only 5.1 percent over the same period.\nNonetheless, if events in Europe evolve so that they have a more severe and broad\nimpact on financial markets, then the scope of the problems for the U.S. could be\nmagnified. Fortunately, our direct exposure to European debt is limited. But an\nintensification of liquidity or solvency problems in Europe and some related spillover\nlosses in U.S. markets could cause a marked increase in investor risk aversion. More\nlenders could pull back on intermediation, restricting the flow of credit to fund worthy\nspending projects of U.S. firms and households.\nTo date, though, this doesn’t seem to have occurred. Notably, the spreads between\nriskier and safer assets have risen some, but they are still nothing at all like the spreads\nwe observed during the height of the financial panic. But this is a risk to monitor\ncarefully.\nIndeed, recognizing the importance of providing liquidity to stressed financial markets,\nthe Fed recently re-opened currency swaps with the European Central Bank (ECB) and\nother major central banks. This step seems prudent as the events in Europe have the\npotential to create dollar funding pressures in world markets. As we did earlier, the\nFederal Reserve today offers dollars in exchange for foreign currency collateral—at a\nfixed exchange rate and a penalty rate. In this way foreign central banks can extend\n11\n\ndollar liquidity support to creditworthy financial institutions facing temporary liquidity\nstrains in foreign credit markets. To date, these lines have not been tapped much.\nI’d like to conclude at this point, but I hope you’ll recall that the answers to our three\nquestions about future growth, inflation, and the European debt crisis were three-and-a-\nhalf, no, and probably not much, but we are being vigilant. Of course, the details behind\nthese short answers are key to understanding how we put the pieces together to create\na picture of the economy. I hope I have been able to convey some of that to you today.\nI look forward to your questions.\n12",

Introduction\nEmpirical research with vector autoregressions (VARs) typically ignores issues associated\nwith data revisions and economic agents(cid:146) access to only real-time data releases. An example\nof this is the literature on monetary policy shocks in VARs (for example, Bernanke and\nBlinder (1992), Sims (1992), Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1996, 1999), Sims and Zha\n(1996)andBernankeandMihov(1998)). Eachofthesestudiesisbaseduponsomedataseries\nthat were not known to anyone during the period of the empirical analysis. Speci(cid:222)cally, the\ndata used in these studies, and other macroeconomic time series research, have been revised\nrelative to the data known at that time. Since government agencies and private sources do\nnot provide these data conveniently, these shortcuts are rarely even questioned.1 The real-\ntime data collected by Croushore and Stark (2001), however, allowresearchers to explore the\nempirical robustness of many existing macroeconomic results to this issue. Armed with the\noriginaldatareleasesthatwereknownatthattimetobusinessanalysts, marketparticipants,\npolicymakers, and the rest of the interested universe, the econometrician can answer the\nquestion, how much of a difference does this make to empirical analyses of monetary policy\nshocks?\nAddressingthisquestioniscomplicatedbythefactthatsomedataarealwaysrevised,and\nhence the true underlying economic concept is never observed fully. For example, aggregate\neconomic activity in the United States is not directly observable, but data on real GDP\nare reported and revised by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The monetary policy shock\nliterature has focused on how real GDP (for example) is affected by an exogenous shock to\nmonetary policy. This is an interesting question when real GDP is taken to be an accurate\nmeasure of aggregate economic activity, but the focus should instead be on the impact\nof monetary policy shocks on economic activity. Consequently, when data revisions are\naccounted for in empirical VAR analyses, the unobserved true variable must be modeled.2\nIn standard OLS estimates of autoregressions, this will induce errors-in-variables biases.\nErrors-in-variables issues raise another econometric problem for identi(cid:222)ed VAR analyses,\nnot simply the literature on monetary policy. Structural shocks are identi(cid:222)ed based upon\nthe covariance structure of the VAR innovations. The standard method of estimating VAR\ninnovations from the residuals, however, will include data revisions (or measurement noises).\nIn general, the revision components will be correlated across the equations in the system.\n1DieboldandRudebusch(1991)investigatethisissuefortheindexofleadingindicators. Rudebusch(1998)\ncriticizes VAR-based estimates of monetary policy reaction functions for ignoring this issue. Orphanides\n(1998) empirically assesses the importance of this issue for Taylor rule estimates.\n2Sargent and Sims (1977) provide an early example of this environment. Sargent (1989) and Stock and\nWatson (1989) discuss how Kalman (cid:222)lter methods can be used tractably to estimate these models.\n1\n\nIdentifying the economic shocks fromthe measurement noises requires more structure on the\nmeasurement process. In our empirical example, conditional on having the complete data\nset, the identi(cid:222)cation and estimation of the monetary policy equation is simpler than for\nother equations because the policy instrument is set based on observable data.\nThis paper considers two approaches to addressing the fact that econometricians(cid:146) macro-\neconomic data sets are changing over time because of data revisions. The (cid:222)rst approach is\nto assess the sensitivity of VAR estimates across different data vintages. For example, how\ndo monetary policy reaction function estimates change when the sample period is (cid:222)xed at\n1960-1983, but the data vintages are updated every year? This analysis does not explicitly\nconsider how the data revision process takes place. The second approach considers a statis-\ntical model of data revisions and implements an alternative, real-time estimation strategy\nto overcome the errors-in-variables biases. Our method assumes that output, the price level,\nand monetary aggregates are latent variables that the data collection agency never measures\nprecisely. Given a standard set of restrictions to identify policy and nonpolicy shocks in the\nabsence of measurement noises, our analysis with these noises is able to identify the shocks\nand compute impulse responses.\nOur empirical analysis of the Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1996) system suggests\nthat many results from the VAR literature on monetary policy are robust to these issues\nof real-time data availability. Speci(cid:222)cally, our analysis of the 1960-83 estimation period\nusing alternative data vintages (Section 3) uncovers only minor differences in monetary\npolicy shock measures and impulse responses. Our real-time analysis of the 1968-93 period\n(Section 5) also (cid:222)nds only small differences in the estimated policy shocks between the real-\ntime estimates and 1998-vintage estimates. The estimated effects of monetary policy shocks\non variables in the system are somewhat smaller in the real-time system, but qualitatitvely\nare remarkably similar. The estimated effects of other orthogonalized shocks are also similar\nin the real-time system for the (cid:222)rst three to (cid:222)ve years of responses. After this length of\ntime, however, the price variables in the real-time system exhibit trending behavior, while\nthe 1998-vintage responses seem to revert to zero. So, estimated impulse responses may be\nsensitive to data revisions.\nOur analysis of Gal(cid:237)(cid:146)s (1992) identi(cid:222)cation strategy indicates that real-time data issues\npresent more difficulties in fully-simultaneous VAR systems. When monetary policy and\n(cid:222)nancial market data respond to data revisions, the Gal(cid:237) IS, monetary policy, and money\ndemand shocks are not identi(cid:222)ed separately from the data revisions without additional re-\nstrictions. Gal(cid:237)(cid:146)sSupply shockisidenti(cid:222)edbylong-runrestrictions,andthesearenotaffected\nby the data revisions. Our estimated impulse response functions following a Supply shock\nare qualitatively similar across both the real-time and a 1998-vintage system.\n2\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the relationship between the VAR\nliterature on monetary policy and real-time information sets. Section 3 investigates the\nrobustness of two VAR studies to using alternative data vintages in the estimation over the\nperiod 1960-83. Section 4 discusses difficulties raised by real-time data issues in an example,\ntwo-variableautoregression; andproposesanestimationstrategy. Section5reportsempirical\nresults for this method applied to the Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1996) system.\nSection6examinesthedifficultiesofidenti(cid:222)cationinthenon-recursivesystemofGal(cid:237)(1992).\nSection 7 concludes.\n2. The literature and real-time data issues\nThe empirical literature that quanti(cid:222)es the effects of exogenous monetary policy shocks\non the economy proceeds along the following lines. The monetary authority has a policy\ninstrument S that is set as a function of the state of the economy. A general speci(cid:222)cation\nt\nof the Fed reaction function is\nS = f (Ω )+ε (2.1)\nt t t\nwhereΩ istheFed(cid:146)sinformationsetattimetandε isanexogenousshock. Thisspeci(cid:222)cation\nt t\nis embedded in the approaches of Gal(cid:237) (1992); Bernanke and Blinder (1992); Christiano,\nEichenbaum, and Evans (1996, 1999); Sims and Zha (1996); Leeper, Sims and Zha (1997);\nand Bernanke and Mihov (1998). The points of departure in these studies are the choices\nof the policy instrument S , the variables included in the information set Ω , as well as the\nt t\ndifferent functions f( ), and the correlation structure between the exogenous shock ε and\nt\n•\nthe information set Ω .\nt\nA common approach in these studies, however, is the use of a macroeconomic data set\nthat was not consistently available during the entire period of the analysis. Each study uses\na data set whose variables have been revised over time, following the original data release.\nFor example, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1996) use a data set that was collected\nin mid-1993 and included real GDP data through the fourth quarter of 1992. Although\nthe real GDP data for 1992:Q4 had only been revised twice (no benchmark revision), the\nhistorical data going back through 1960 had been revised many times. As we noted in the\nintroduction, the empirical VAR literature has neglected the effects of data revisions.3 This\nomission is apparent in the monetary policy rule (2.1) since it does not re(cid:223)ect the vintage\n3Rudebusch(1998)criticizesthemonetarypolicyshockliteratureforignoringthis. However,inprinciple,\ntheproblemispervasiveinmacroeconomictimeseriesstudiesgenerally. SeeCroushoreandStark(2002)for\nexamples.\n3\n\nof the data in the information set. Let T re(cid:223)ect the date of the data set(cid:146)s construction by\nthe econometrician. Period T will often be the (cid:222)nal observation in the data set, although\nthis does not need to be the case. In this setting, the empirical policy rule in the existing\nliterature should be restated as\nST = f ΩT +εT (2.2)\nt t t\n¡ ¢\nOne reaction to this criticismis to estimate f ( ) using Ω\nTj\nfor various data vintages T to see\nt j\n•\nif the estimates differ, while holding the full-sample period (cid:222)xed. Using this approach, we\nprovideevidenceontherobustnessoftwoVARstudiesinsection3(Christiano, Eichenbaum,\nand Evans (1996) and Gal(cid:237) (1992)).\nA further criticism of most macroeconomic, time-series studies is that the data contained\nin ΩT for t < T were not known at time t. In most cases, the data have been revised;4\nt\nthis critique also holds for the approach using Ω\nTj.\nConsequently, even with certain knowl-\nt\nedge of f ( ), εT will differ from the true policy shock (see Rudebusch 1998 and Christiano,\n• t\nEichenbaum, and Evans 1999). Assuming that the monetary authority uses a time-invariant\nfunction f ( ) to set the policy instrument, the reaction function is\n•\nSt = f Ωt +ε (2.3)\nt t t\n¡ ¢\nThe notation with superscript t here indicates that the monetary authority sets the policy\ninstrument S on the basis of information that is actually available to it during period t.\nt\nAre data revisions large enough that the distinction between these different informa-\ntion sets (ΩT versus Ωt) matters for the determination of monetary policy? Research by\nt t\nCroushore and Stark (2001, 2002) shows that both long-run views of the data and short-run\nviews can change sharply because of datarevisions. Average annual real output growth over\n(cid:222)ve-year periods sometimes changes by as much as 0.5 percentage point; for example, real\nGDP growth from 1984:Q4 to 1989:Q4 averaged 3.0 percent according to the NIPA data set\nin November 1995, but was 3.5 percent according to the NIPA data set in November 2001.\nOver the same period, in(cid:223)ation (measured using the percent change in the GDP de(cid:223)ator)\naveraged 3.6 percent in the November 1995 data set but 3.1 percent in the November 2001\ndata set. So, one(cid:146)s view of trend growth in output and in(cid:223)ation may be changed dramat-\nically by data revisions. In the short run, even larger revisions occur. For example, the\ngrowth rate of real output for 1977:Q1 was initially released as 5.2 percent; in today(cid:146)s data\n4Almost all seasonally adjusted, macroeconomic time series data are revised for a substantial period of\ntime.\n4\n\nset it is 5.0 percent. But in between it changed from 5.2% to 7.5% (July 1977 NIPA data\nrelease) to 7.3% (July 1978) to 8.9% (July 1979) to 9.6% (December 1980) to 8.9% (July\n1982) to 5.6% (December 1985) to 6.0% (December 1991) to 5.3% (January 1996) to 4.9%\n(July 1997) to 5.0%(March 2000). Because our measures of monetary shocks depend on the\nestimated relationship between the policy instrument and output growth as measured in a\nparticular data vintage, it is clear that those measures may change considerably across data\nvintages when the underlying data on output are revised this dramatically. Thus research\ninvestigating monetary policy shocks using (cid:222)nal revised data is potentially problematic.\nThecon(cid:223)ictbetweentheempiricalinvestigationofmonetarypolicyandtheactualsetting\nof policy is troubling in principle. Rudebusch (1998) stresses this con(cid:223)ict, but provides\nonly indirect evidence on the economic importance of the issue. To assess the economic\nconsequencesofusingreviseddata,threequestionsemerge. First,howdotheempiricalpolicy\nshockmeasuresandpolicyinstrumentsettingsdifferinequations(2.2)and(2.3)?

Should we really expect that true output will\nbe affected directly by the government(cid:146)s announcement that last month(cid:146)s announced (cid:222)gure\nfor real GDP was half a percentage point too high? Further assumptions about the non-\npolicy equations are required: assumptions about the data revision process over time and\nthe information available to economic agents at any point in time. As the discussion in\nsection 4 indicates, the problems posed by data revisions range beyond the monetary policy\nshock literature. Third, how is the identi(cid:222)cation of non-monetary policy shocks affected by\ndata revision issues? Simple examples below suggest that VAR innovations estimated using\nrevised data will include revision errors. Since identi(cid:222)cation of exogenous shocks is achieved\nby factoring particular covariance matrices of VAR innovations, the presence of additional\ncovariation due to revision errors cannot be ignored, in principle.\n5An exception is the two-step strategy described in Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1999) for a\nparticular recursively identi(cid:222)ed policy rule. Although the two-step strategy is asymptotically justi(cid:222)able\nfor any impulse response function, it does require a time series on the exogenous shock. If the exogenous\nshock can only be identi(cid:222)ed with the aid of another variable(cid:146)s innovation, then the other equation must\nbe estimated. The identi(cid:222)cation strategies of Sims and Zha (1996), Gal(cid:237) (1992), and Bernanke and Mihov\n(1998) require these additional restrictions.\n5\n\n3. Monetary policy estimates with different data vintages\nIs there a simple way to see if data revisions really matter for the identi(cid:222)cation of monetary\npolicy shocks? One way to answer this question is simply to investigate how changes in the\nvintage of the data affect the size of monetary policy shocks or impulse response functions.\nPotentially, this issue could be important. In examining the robustness of empirical\nmacroeconomic studies, Croushore and Stark (2002) found that some empirical results were\nstronglyaffectedby datarevisions. Forexample, someof theempirical resultsofHall (1978)\nandBlanchardandQuah(1989)changeddramaticallywhenalternativevintagesofdatawere\nused. In both cases, the sample period used in the empirical work was not changed, only\nthe date on which the data were measured.\nTo investigate the robustness of VAR results for measuring monetary policy shocks, we\nuse the real-time data set of Croushore and Stark (2001), and rerun the empirical work of\nChristiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1996) and Gal(cid:237) (1992), using four alternative vintages\nofthedata. Wethenexaminethedegreetowhichthesealternativedatasetsleadtodiffering\nmagnitudes for monetary shocks and the impulse responses to monetary shocks. We look at\ndatasetsthatspan15years. Thedata, especiallyNIPAdata, havebeenrevisedsigni(cid:222)cantly\nacross that span, and thus could potentially have a large impact on the empirical results.\n3.1. Christiano-Eichenbaum-Evans (CEE)\nThebenchmarkCEEquarterlymodelconsistsofarecursivelyidenti(cid:222)edVARinsixvariables:\nreal output (Y), de(cid:223)ator (P), nonborrowed reserves (NBR), federal funds rate (FF), total\nreserves (TR), and commodity prices (PCOM), where all variables except FF are in logs.\nUsing the Choleski decomposition, the causal ordering of the variables is important, and we\nuse the CEE benchmark ordering Y, P, PCOM, FF, NBR, TR in everything that follows.\nOur real-time data set includes the values of all six variables as they existed in macroeco-\nnomic data sets in the fourth quarter of each of the following years: 1983, 1988, 1993, and\n1998. The federal funds rate and commodity price variables are not revised, but the other\nfour variables were revised substantially over this period, including such major revisions as\nswitching from GNP to GDP and changing from (cid:222)xed-weight real output and de(cid:223)ator to\nchain weighting. We maintain a common sample period for all four vintages of data, using\njust data from the sample that is common to all four data sets, 1960Q1 to 1983Q3.\nTheVARis estimatedandthe monetary policy shocks are takentobethe orthogonalized\ninnovations from the federal funds rate equation.

Each VAR was estimated over the sample period 1960-1983.\n8\n\n3.2. Gal(cid:237)\nThe CEE model imposes no economic structure on the VAR beyond the monetary policy\nreaction function. But much recent empirical work has used economic theory to impose\nstructure on the VAR, using short-run and long-run restrictions to provide identi(cid:222)cation.\nOne such model is that of Gal(cid:237) (1992). The Gal(cid:237) model is a VAR in four variables, with\nthe growth rate of real output (Y), the quarterly change in the interest rate (∆FF), the\nreal interest rate, which equals the interest rate minus the quarterly in(cid:223)ation rate in the\nconsumer price index (P), and the growth rate of the real money supply (MONEY), which\nequals the log of the nominal money supply (M1) minus the log of the price level. The\nonly difference between our data and Gal(cid:237)(cid:146)s is that we use the federal funds rate, while he\nused the interest rate on three-month T-bills, but that difference should matter little for the\nempirical results.\nImposingidentifyingrestrictionsontheVARallowsonetocalculatestructuralshocksand\ntogenerateimpulseresponsefunctions. Gal(cid:237)imposesthreelong-runrestrictionsontheVAR:\nmoney supply shocks do not affect output, money demand shocks do not affect output, and\nspending shocks do not affect output. He also imposes three short-run restrictions: money\nsupply shocks do not affect output contemporaneously, money demand shocks do not affect\noutput contemporaneously, and the price level does not enter the money supply equation\ncontemporaneously.\nTheshockstomonetarypolicy,showninFigure3.3,areagainquitesimilaracrossvintages\nof the data. The only surprise is that the 1988 vintage of the data shows somewhat larger\nshocks than the other three vintages. But the timing of all the shocks is identical; they\ndiffer only in magnitude.\nThe impulse responses in the Gal(cid:237) model, shown in Figure 3.4, differ a bit across vintages\nas well. Again, though, they are qualitatively the same in terms of their general paths. The\nrevisions seem to affect the impulse response to real money balances the most.\n9\n\n7.5\n5.0\n2.5\n0.0\n-2.5\n-5.0\n1961 1963 1965 1967 1969 1971 1973 1975 1977 1979 1981 1983\n1983 1993\n1988 1998\nFigure 3.3: Gal(cid:237) Monetary Policy Shocks\nThe(cid:222)guredisplaysestimatedmonetarypolicyshocksfromfourVARsusingdifferentdatavintages:\n1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998.

Each VAR was estimated over the sample period 1960-1983.\n11\n\n4. Estimating a recursively identi(cid:222)ed VAR with real-time data\nTo investigate the in(cid:223)uence of real-time data issues for estimating VARs, we specify a two-\nvariable, recursively identi(cid:222)ed example and impose structure on the data revision process.\nThe methods adopted here for estimating and analyzing the two-variable system extend\neasily to higher order systems. The VAR includes two distinct types of variables. The (cid:222)rst\ntype is (cid:222)nancial data, like the federal funds rate (FF), that are set on the basis of real-time\ndata and do not get revised. The second data type is revised over time, like real GDP (Y):\nits time-series law of motion is speci(cid:222)ed in terms of an underlying, latent variable that is\nmeasured imperfectly. In one respect, the real-time policy and (cid:222)nancial variable equations\nare the simplest to estimate: given the actual real-time data and recursiveness assumptions,\ntheseequationscanbeestimatedbyordinaryleastsquares. Byplacingsufficientstructureon\nthe historical data revision process, we deduce an instrumental variables estimation strategy\nfor the nonpolicy/(cid:222)nancial equations.\n4.1. A recursively identi(cid:222)ed VAR\nIn this example, we take the true data-generating process to be a two-equation identi(cid:222)ed\nVAR. The monetary authority sets the federal funds rate FF on the basis of its own past\nt\nhistory, and the data reported for Y at time t. We will refer to Y as output, but it can just\nas easily be a vector of data. The law of motion for the true, unobserved output series Y is\nt∗\ndistinct from the data reporting process. The system of equations is:\nFF = A (L)FF +A (L)Yt +a Yt +ε (4.1a)\nt FF t 1 Y t 1 Y t 1t\n− −\nY = B (L)FF +B (L)Y +ε (4.1b)\nt∗ FF t 1 Y t∗1 2t\n− −\nSpecifying the policy reaction function in real time requires explicit assumptions about the\nway data revisions in(cid:223)uence policy. Equation (4.1a) is based upon data known at time t,\nnamely, Yt;FF ,Yt ;FF ,Yt ,; etc.6 Equation (4.1a) makes a strong assumption: FF\nt t 1 t 1 t 2 t 2\n− − − −\nwill respond systematically to changes in the reported data even when the underlying Y\n∗\ndoes not change. The assumption may be reasonable because Y is not directly observed.\n∗\nEquation (4.1b) is the law of motion for Y and has two features worth noting. First,\nt∗\nthe data revisions in(cid:223)uence Y indirectly through their effects on FF and monetary policy.\n∗\n6Superscripts refer to the reporting vintage of the data, while subscripts refer to the observation period.\nNotice that the lag operator L operates on the observation date only, and not the data(cid:146)s vintage date.\n12\n\nSecondbutmorecritical,thelatentvariableY dependsuponitsownhistoryandnotdirectly\n∗\nonthehistoryofreal-timedatareleases. Thisrelationshipmightemergeinaneconomywhere\nagents seethe true economic allocations, while the monetaryauthority sees only error-ridden\nmeasures. Although this may be a questionable assumption, the alternatives may be worse.\nThe assumption could be questionable because central banks expend many resources to\nmeasure and understand the state of their economies each period. Considering the fact that\ntheFederalReservealreadypurchasescertaintypesof(cid:222)nancialdatafromprivatecompanies,\nthey would clearly pay to observe Y if private agents actually knew that information. An\nt∗\nalternative line of reasoning might assume that no one in the economy observes Y . This\n∗\ncould be accommodated by also including Yt ,s 0 in equation (4.1b), or simply its\nt s\n− ≥\nrevisions. In this case, however, it is difficult to think about state-contingent allocations,\n© ª\nmarket-clearing, or prices. This approach is worth investigation, but has not been pursued\nhere.\nThis system of equations is written as a recursively identi(cid:222)ed VAR, with the ε and ε\n1t 2t\nshocks assumed to be exogenous, and uncorrelated with the other right-hand-side variables.\n0\nThe vector of exogenous shocks ε t = ε 1t ε 2t has a diagonal covariance structure.\nµ ¶\nEach period the output data are revised. The data revision process has the following\nform:7\nYt = Y g (4.2a)\nt t∗ − t∗\nYt+s = Yt+s 1 +ht+s, s > 0, t (4.2b)\nt t − t ∀ ∀\nY = YT +hT , T = latest release date.

Each period t+s, the previously released data are revised\nt∗ t∗\nby ht+s according to (4.2b). Equation (4.2c) speci(cid:222)es how the latest data release YT is also\nt t\nan imperfect measure of the unobserved, true output variable Y . This speci(cid:222)cation readily\nt∗\nadmits furtheranalysis with alaterdatarelease YT+1, and thuscaptures the notionthat hT\nt ∗\nrepresents a permanent wedge between measuring and observing true output Y .

Consequently, we\nneed to assume that these revisions take place with respect to the log of the series.\n13\n\n4.2. Estimation difficulties with period T-vintage data\nSuppose an econometrician uses the most recent data releases to estimate equations (4.1a)\nand (4.1b) by OLS. Often these data are referred to as (cid:147)(cid:222)nal, revised data(cid:148); but since the\ndata continue to be revised, we refer to these data as period T-vintage data on YT. Using\nt\nthe revised data YT in place of Yt and Y , the system of equations becomes\nt t t∗\nFF = A (L)FF +A (L)YT +a YT +wT (4.3a)\nt FF t 1 Y t 1 Y t 1t\n− −\nYT = B (L)FF +B (L)YT +wT (4.3b)\nt FF t 1 Y t 1 2t\n− −\nThe critical questions revolve around the correlation structure of the error terms wT and\n1t\nwT and their relationship to ε and ε .8 Given the revision process and the true laws of\n2t 1t 2t\nmotion, it can be shown that\nT t T t\n− −\nwT = ε a ht+s A (L) ht+s\n1t 1t − Y t − Y t 1\n−\ns=1 s=1\nX X\nwT = ε hT +B (L)hT\n2t 2t t ∗ Y t ∗1\n− −\nWhen the econometrician estimates equations (4.3a) and (4.3b) with OLS, the estimated\nregression coefficients are likely to be biased. In general, the error terms wT and wT are\n1t 2t\ncorrelated with the regressors in both equations. Note that wT contains revisions to date\n1t\nt variables, date t 1 variables, and so on, which are correlated with the right-hand-side\n−\nvariables in equation (4.3a), YT and YT , j = 1,2, ..., except under special assumptions.\nt t j\n−\nSimilarly, wT contains measurement wedges (cid:150) differences between the latest measure of\n2t\nthe variable and its latent value (cid:150) which will in general be correlated with the right-hand\nvariables in equation (4.3b).\nBecause OLS estimators are biased, we look for alternative estimation methods, the use\nof which depends on the manner in which the data are constructed. Polar cases of data\nconstruction include: (1) methods by which revisions to data incorporate news, which is the\ncase when the data agency uses all available data (not just its own sample measuring the\ndata in question) to construct an optimal estimate of the data series in question; and (2)\nclassical measurement error, in which revisions to the data reduce noise, which is the case\nwhen the data agency draws an unbiased sample, uses only that sample in constructing its\n8See Rudebusch (1998) for a discussion of these issues with respect to the monetary policy equation.\n14\n\ndata series, but fails to account for correlations between its data series and other data (not\nincluded in its sample) that are available at the time. Of course, data reporting agencies do\nnot directly state which category their reporting method belongs to. Key tests of the extent\nto which data represent noise or news were undertaken by Mankiw, Runkle, and Shapiro\n(1984), Mankiwand Shapiro (1986), and Croushore and Stark (2002). The Croushore-Stark\nresults suggest that for most macroeconomic variables, revisions between the initial release\nand one year later are best characterized as containing news, while revisions after one year\ncannot be easily characterized(cid:151)they are a mix of news and noise.\nBased on the outcome of the tests for news and noise, we develop consistent estimators\nfor the parameters in equations (4.3a) and (4.3b). Clearly, the consistency of these estimates\nwill also depend on the validity of the auxiliary assumptions about the data revision process.\n4.3. Using real-time data to estimate the real-time policy equation\nSuppose that the econometrician has the original data for each period, as it was initially\nreleased and subsequently revised. For the monetary policy reaction (4.1a),\nFF = A (L)FF +A (L)Yt +a Yt +ε\nt FF t 1 Y t 1 Y t 1t\n− −\nthe econometrician can estimate this equation precisely with the vintage data Yt ,s 0 .\nt s ≥\n−\nOwing to the recursiveness assumption, OLS is consistent. That is, since Yt = Y g\n©t t∗\n−\nªt∗\nand E[Y ε ] = E[g ε ] = 0, all of the right-hand-side variables are orthogonal to ε .\nt∗ 1t t∗ 1t 1t\nConsequently, the exogenous monetary policy shock ε can be recovered without being\n1t\npolluted by data revisions.\n4.4. Using different data vintages as instruments\nA major stumbling block in estimating equation (4.3b) is that true output Y is never fully\nt∗\nrevealed in the period T-vintage revisions. The error term wT includes the wedge terms\n2t\nhT . If instead YT were to reveal Y for some T sufficiently large relative to t, then the\nt ∗ t t∗\nmeasurement errors hT would disappear from wT completely. In that case, OLS estimation\nt ∗ 2t\non the output autoregression would recover the true parameters asymptotically as well as\nthe exogenous shocks.\nOf course, data revisions never come to a (cid:222)nal conclusion. For example, even though no\nnew source data is being collected for 1959 real GDP, those data do get revised periodically.\n15\n\nSpeci(cid:222)cally, when the base year is changed, or the concept is altered (usually slightly), there\naredatarevisions. But it seems plausible toassume that there is some date beyondwhich all\nthe data revisions are insubstantial. That is, real GDP continues to be revised substantially\nas new income tax information comes in over the years. Also, seasonal adjustment proce-\ndures continue to alter the stochastic seasonals for many years. But beyond some threshold,\nit seems reasonable to assume that the adjustments are completely random with respect to\npreviousyearsofbenchmarkrevisions(whichisconsistentwiththeCroushore-Starkresults).\nWithin a benchmark revision, however, the measurement errors may be serially correlated\nbecause of interpolation and spreading of annual source data information to quarterly mea-\nsures.\nThis discussion is intended to motivate the following statistical model of benchmark data\nrevisions:\nYt+s = Y ηt+s, s J. (4.4)\nt t∗ − t ≥\nAfter the threshold J periods have elapsed, the reported data Yt+s measure the true Y up\nt t∗\nto a measurement error ηt+s which is independent of Y and ηt+s 0 (where s = s). This\n−\nt t∗ t 0\n6\nmodel of benchmark revisions allows us to construct an instrumental variables estimator for\nthe output equation (4.3b). In the period T-vintage data, let(cid:146)s restrict the sample period to\nthe YT observations with ηT measurement errors, so that the error term wT is\n2t\nwT = ε hT +B (L)hT\n2t 2t − t ∗ Y t ∗1\n−\n= ε ηT +B (L)ηT , t T J\n2t − t Y t 1 ≤ −\n−\nIn this part of the sample, ηT revisions are correlated with YT and the standard mea-\nt s t s\n− −\nsurement error bias result obtains. However, the ηT are orthogonal to Y , and hence the\nt s t∗s\n− −\nearlier vintage errors embedded in FF from the policy reaction function.\nt j\n−\nSince FF is a valid regressor, an instrumental variables approach needs to deal with\nt 1\n−\nonly the Y data. To this end, notice that the revision errors hT are orthogonal to many\nt ∗\nother revision errors, once enough time has elapsed from the initial release of the data to\nensure that all remaining revisions are orthogonal noise (across benchmark revisions). Given\nthe data vintage denoted by YT, select another data vintage YT 0. The (cid:222)nal time period\nT 0 < T, by assumption (just a normalization). In practical terms, YT and YT 0 may be from\nthe July 1998 and July 1996 releases of the National Income and Product Account data,\nrespectively. Let the estimation period range from observations 1 to T J; this means that\n0\n−\nall of the data have entered the stage of independent benchmark errors. Consequently, YT 0\nt s\n−\n16\n\nis a valid instrument for YT .

However,\nthe errors are independent of each other. The variance of ε can be estimated by the\n2t\nsample covariance of these two residuals, and instrumental variables methods can be used\nto construct impulse response functions.\nThis model of benchmark revisions does have testable restrictions. An implication of\nequation(4.4)isthatthecross-covariancesofthegrowthratesshouldbeequal,∆YT∆YT 0 and\nt t j\n−\n∆YT ∆YT 0.10 Table 1 reports generalized method of moments estimates of the (cid:222)rst four au-\nt j t\n−\ntocorrelations of ∆Y using eight moment conditions implied by\nt∗\nρ = E ∆YT∆YT 0 = E ∆YT ∆YT 0 ,\nj t t j t j t\n− −\nh i h i\nas well as four restrictions to estimate the just-identi(cid:222)ed means and variances of ∆YT and\nt\n∆YT 0. The data vintages are July 1996 and July 1998 releases (recorded as the August 1996\nt\nand August 1998 vintages in the Philadelphia Fed(cid:146)s real-time data set, as the NIPA releases\ncome out at the end of the month and the real-time data set records vintages mid-month).\nThe autocorrelation patterns are not surprising for the latent variables. Output growth and\nin(cid:223)ation are positively auto-correlated. The strong persistence in in(cid:223)ation suggests wide\ncon(cid:222)dence bounds on any valid inference regarding I(0) or I(1) behavior. The autocorre-\nlation properties in nonborrowed and total reserves are similar. More interestingly, there\nis little evidence against the overidentifying restrictions as reported by the J statistic.\n−\nConsequently, the empirical evidence provides support for implementing the IV estimation\nstrategy using 1996 and 1998 vintage data.\n9It should be apparent that YT and YT0 are not weak instruments for each other in this estimation\nt t\nstrategy.

Empirical results for recursive identi(cid:222)cation in a real-time VAR\nTo investigate the implications of using real-time data in a VAR, we estimate the 6-variable\nCEE system described in Section 3. We use the Croushore-Stark real-time data set. The\nvariables are real GDP (Y), the implicit GDP de(cid:223)ator (P), an index of commodity prices\n(PCOM), the federal funds rate (FF), nonborrowed reserves (NBR), and total reserves\n(TR). The data are in logs, except for FF. The two data vintages to be used as instruments\nfor the latent variables are T = 1996:3 and T = 1998:3. We take the benchmark threshold\n0\nJ = 12 quarters, so our estimation period runs from 1968:1 through 1993:3; the starting\ndate is determined by the availability of real-time data and the ending date by the size of\nJ and the (cid:222)rst vintage used as an instrument. As described in Section 4, the federal funds\nrate equation is estimated with real-time data (equation 4.1a), while the other equations are\nspeci(cid:222)ed as latent variables (similar to equation 4.1b speci(cid:222)ed for a vector of data). The\norder of orthogonalization for studying nonpolicy shocks is Y,P,PCOM,FF,NBR,TR.12\nFigure (5.1) displays the estimated FF policy shock using real-time data and an FF\npolicyshockestimatedfromthe(cid:222)xed1998:3-vintagedataset(asatypicalVARisestimated).\nOverall, theseriesareremarkablysimilar.

The standard deviations of the two shocks\nare 75 and 87 basis points for the real-time and 1998:3-vintage data measures, respectively.\nNevertheless, there are some notable differences. First, in the third and fourth quarters of\n1974, the 1998:3-vintage data overstates the volatility of exogenous monetary policy, relative\nto the VAR based on data available to policymakers. Romer and Romer (1989) selected\n11In a previous draft, we allowed the revisions to depend on the identi(cid:222)ed shocks ε and ε , perhaps\n1 2\nbecause of optimal statistical (cid:222)ltering rules studied by Sargent (1989). The qualitative results from that\nanalysis were similar to the ones reported here.\n12Thecontemporaneoustermsinthemultivariatecounterpartsto4.1aand4.1baretreatedinthestandard\nway with a recursive structure. We have alsoestimated the PCOM equations using real-time data by OLS\n(that is, treating PCOM as a function of measured output rather than latent output). Those results are\nsimilar to the ones reported below.\n19\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n1970 1976 1982 1988\nReal-time 1998 vintage\nFigure 5.1: CEE Federal Funds Shocks\nThe (cid:222)gure displays estimated monetary policy shocks from two VARs estimated over the sample\nperiod 1968-1993. The solid line displays policy shocks estimated using real-time data, while the\ndashed line displays policy shocks from the 1998 vintage data set.\nApril 1974 as a date when the Federal Reserve explicitly chose to sacri(cid:222)ce output in order\nto bring an exogenous burst of in(cid:223)ation down. The real-time VAR residuals indicate that\nthis was a period when the FOMC was responding in a rather typical fashion to the data\nthey were given. Second, the three large contractionary shocks in 1980:4, 1981:2, and 1982:1\nare overstated in the 1998:3 vintage data by 120, 60, and 70 basis points, respectively, when\ncompared with the VAR based on data the FOMC had access to. Third, the two series\nappear to become less contemporaneously aligned since the stock market decline in 1987.\nThe real-time exogenous tighteningin 1988 leads the 1998:3vintage by a quarterthroughout\nthe year, and the subsequent exogenous easing through 1989 is similarly misaligned. In spite\nof this, the general assessment of exogenous monetary policy as being tight or loose over the\ncourse of a four quarter period will not differ appreciably across these two measures.13\n13Rudebusch (1999) (cid:222)nds that FF residuals from a monthly VAR are quite different from forecast errors\n20\n\nFF --> Y* FF --> FF\n0.2 0.96\n0.1 0.80\n0.64\n-0.0\n0.48\n-0.1\n0.32\n-0.2\n0.16\n-0.3\n0.00\n-0.4 -0.16\n-0.5 -0.32\n2 6 10 14 18 2 6 10 14 18\nReal-time PLUSLIST(1) Real-time PLUSLIST(4)\n1998 vintage MINLIST(1) 1998 vintage MINLIST(4)\nFF --> P* FF --> NBR*\n0.16 1.00\n0.75\n0.00\n0.50\n-0.16\n0.25\n-0.32 0.00\n-0.48 -0.25\n-0.50\n-0.64\n-0.75\n-0.80\n-1.00\n-0.96 -1.25\n2 6 10 14 18 2 6 10 14 18\nReal-time PLUSLIST(2) Real-time PLUSLIST(5)\n1998 vintage MINLIST(2) 1998 vintage MINLIST(5)\nFF --> PCOM* FF --> TR*\n1.0 0.9\n0.5\n0.6\n0.0\n-0.5 0.3\n-1.0\n-1.5 0.0\n-2.0\n-0.3\n-2.5\n-3.0 -0.6\n2 6 10 14 18 2 6 10 14 18\nReal-time PLUSLIST(3) Real-time PLUSLIST(6)\n1998 vintage MINLIST(3) 1998 vintage MINLIST(6)\nFigure 5.2: Recursively-identi(cid:222)ed FF Shock\nThe solid lines are the point estimate and 95 percentile bands for the impulse responses estimated\nusing real-time data.

The similarity across the two VAR systems is striking. Relative to the 1998:3\nvintage estimates, the real-time FF response displays slightly less persistence. The real-\ntime output price and commodity price responses are a bit shallower than the revised data\nestimates. To informally assess the uncertainty surrounding these point estimates, there are\ntwo obvious metrics. First, the reported bootstrap con(cid:222)dence bands around the real-time\nimpulse responses typically cover the response paths around the 1998 vintage estimates.\nExceptions to this are the second year responses of Y and PCOM , and the (cid:222)rst year\n∗ ∗\nresponses of FF. The percentile bands are somewhat wider than Christiano, Eichenbaum,\nand Evans (1999, Figure 2) report in a similar system for quarterly data. Nevertheless,\ninferenceabout theeffects of amonetarypolicy shockis largelyunaffected. Acontractionary\npolicy shock reduces Y and PCOM signi(cid:222)cantly in the (cid:222)rst two years, while P most\n∗ ∗ ∗\nlikely falls (but with very little precision in the estimates). The liquidity effect on impact\nis signi(cid:222)cantly different from zero, but its persistence is a bit less than CEE (cid:222)nd in their\nanalysis, which ignores data revisions. A second metric for assessing uncertainty focuses on\nthe 1998 vintage estimates. Unreported 95 percentile bands around the 1998 estimates cover\nthe real-time impulse responses. Taking account of this joint uncertainty, the real-time and\n1998 vintage analyses appear to be similar.\nFigure (5.3) displays the system(cid:146)s response from an exogenous shock to true output\nY . Except for the commodity price and de(cid:223)ator paths after 3 years, the responses are\nt∗\nquite similar across estimation methods. The 95 percentile bands cover the 1998 vintage\nresponses in most cases. The largest discrepancies involve the responses of P and PCOM\n∗ ∗\nin Figure (5.3). The real-time estimates seem to be estimating a trending response from Y\n∗\nshocks to prices, while the 1998 vintage estimates revert to a stationary path. This could\nbe the case if the real-time data estimation is more closely estimating a unit root for the\nprice variables, than for the revised vintage data. Not surprisingly, the error bands offer no\npersuasive evidence on the signi(cid:222)cance of these long-horizon responses. Similar observations\ninferred from the Federal funds futures market over the period 1989-1996. In addition to the difference\nin information sets across the two analyses, futures market participants do not necessarily presume that\nmonetary policy follows a linear, time-invariant feedback rule. Consequently, evidence from futures market\ndata do not directly shed light on the effect of real-time data for VAR policy shock measures.\n14Bootstrapcon(cid:222)dencebandsareconstructedinastraightforwardmanner.

For the CEE\n∗ ∗\nrecursive identi(cid:222)cation of monetary policy shocks and other orthogonalized shocks, there is\nlittle evidence that using real-time data in the estimation alters the literature(cid:146)s conclusions\nabout the effects of monetary policy shocks on the U.S. economy during this period.\n6. Gal(cid:237) empirical results\nReal-time data issues can pose daunting identi(cid:222)cation issues for nonrecursive systems of\nsimultaneous equations. Although Gal(cid:237)(cid:146)s (1992) assumptions are sufficient to identify four\neconomic shocks when real-time data issues are ignored, vintage measurement issues defeat\nGal(cid:237)(cid:146)s identi(cid:222)cation of all but the long-run supply shock. Simultaneity from (cid:222)nancial market\ndata generally creates identi(cid:222)cation difficulties unless further restrictive assumptions are\nmade about the time series properties of measurements.\n6.1. Simultaneity creates identi(cid:222)cation problems\nThe essence of the real-time data problem comes from the contemporaneous correlation\nbetween real allocations and (cid:222)nancial market data that respond to measurement errors.\nAlthough the four-variable Gal(cid:237) (1992) system shares these problems, the previous example\nis simpler and can be augmented to reveal the problem:\nFF = A (L)FF +A (L)Yt +a Yt +ε (6.6a)\nt FF t 1 Y t 1 Y t 1t\n− −\nY = B (L)FF +B (L)Y +a FF +ε (6.6b)\nt∗ FF t 1 Y t∗1 FF t 2t\n− −\nYt = Y +h (6.6c)\nt t∗ ∗t\nNonzero values for a and a imply a nonrecursive system (cid:150) that is, a fully simultaneous\nY FF\nsystem.

Identi(cid:222)cation of the Gal(cid:237) Supply Shock\nInterestingly, the problems of simultaneity with real-time data do not defeat identi(cid:222)cation\nthrough the long-run restrictions in the Gal(cid:237) system. Recall that the structural equation for\noutput growth can be written as\nM\n∆Y = A (L)∆Y +A (L)∆FF +A (L)∆ t∗ +A (L)(FF ∆P )+εsupply (6.7)\nt∗ 11 t∗ − 1 12 t 13 P t∗ 14 t − t∗ t\nSimultaneity and the contemporaneous values of ∆FF , ∆M t∗, and (FF ∆P ) defeat the\nt P t∗ t − t∗\nconsistency of OLS estimation. But the long-run restriction that only the supply shock can\npermanently affect Y implies a root on the unit circle in the polynomials A (z), A (z),\nt∗ 12 13\nand A (z), where z is a complex variable. This leads to an instrumental variables estimator\n14\nM\nusing the differences of ∆FF , ∆ t∗, and (FF ∆P ). Although the latent variables are\nt P t∗ t − t∗\nnot observable, the 1998 and 1996 vintage estimation can be used to identify εsupply.\nt\nFigure(6.1) displays theimpulse responsesfromtheestimatedreal-timesystemfollowing\na supply shock, as well as a 1998 vintage impulse response.

Thesystematic\n∗\nresponse of monetary policy modestly constrains real activity following a technology shock:\nthe real interest rate is primarily positive after two quarters.

Most importantly, apart from adding a good deal of\nadditional uncertainty from the wider error bands, the real-time system is not very different\nfrom a 1998 vintage estimate.\nInspiteofthesimilaritybetweentheseresponses, thelackofidenti(cid:222)cationforamonetary\npolicy shock, IS shock or money demand shock in a real-time data system stands in sharp\ncontrast to the typical identi(cid:222)cation which ignores real-time data issues. To assess whether\nthose identi(cid:222)cations are robust to real-time data revisions requires placing more structure\non the measurements. That is a subject for further research.\n7. Conclusions\nEmpirical VAR and time series research often ignores issues associated with data revisions\nand economic agents(cid:146) access to only real-time data releases. Since government agencies and\nprivate sources donot provide these dataconveniently, these shortcuts are rarely questioned.\nThe real-time datacollected by Croushore and Stark (2001) allows researchers to explore the\nempirical robustness of many existing macroeconomic results to this issue, but additional\nstructure must be placed on the data revision process and assumptions regarding the infor-\nmationthat economicagentshaveaccessto. Ourempiricalanalysesindicatethataccounting\nfor data revisions has only a modest effect quantitatively on the recursively-identi(cid:222)ed mon-\netary policy shock measures and impulse responses we consider. Similarly robust (cid:222)ndings\nwere obtained for a particular long-run identi(cid:222)cation. All of these results are conditional\non our assumptions about data revisions and the latent structure of the economy. A neg-\native (cid:222)nding of this analysis revealed that many fully-simultaneous VAR systems that are\nidenti(cid:222)ed when real-time data issues are ignored are actually not completely identi(cid:222)ed when\nvintage measurement issues are considered. More research that allows for alternative mea-\nsurement noise and data revision processes is needed to shed more light on the role of data\nrevisions.\n27\n\nReferences\n[1] Bernanke, Ben, 1986, Alternative Explanations of the Money-Income Correlation,(cid:148)\nCarnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy 25: pp. 49-100.\n[2] Bernanke, Ben and Alan Blinder, 1992, (cid:147)The federal funds rate and the channels of\nmonetary transmission,(cid:148) American Economic Review 82: pp.\n901-21.\n[3] Bernanke, Ben and Ilian Mihov, 1998, (cid:147)MeasuringMonetary Policy,(cid:148) Quarterly Journal\nof Economics 113 (August): pp. 869-902.\n[4] Blanchard, OlivierJean, andDannyQuah.(cid:147)TheDynamicEffectsofAggregateDemand\nand Supply Disturbances.(cid:148) American Economic Review 79 (September 1989), pp. 655-\n73.\n[5] Blanchard, Olivier Jean, and Mark Watson, 1986, (cid:148)Are Business Cycles All Alike?(cid:148) in\nRobert J.

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIntroduction\nThank you. It is truly a pleasure to be here today and have the opportunity to speak to\nthe Detroit Economic Club. And it is a particular pleasure to be introduced by Carl\n(Camden, president and chief executive officer of Kelly Services). This past December,\nCarl completed his service as the chair of the Detroit Branch of the Chicago Fed after\npreviously serving as a member of our board and on our advisory council. Carl has\nalways been exceedingly generous in sharing his time and perspective on a wide range\nof issues. We are very grateful for his contributions, and it’s terrific to be able to\ncontinue that association through events like this. There are also a number of our\ncurrent and former Detroit directors in the audience today, and it is great to see you all\nas well.\nWe have made much progress since the financial crisis began and the economy\ndropped into a deep recession. Since 2008, short-term interest rates have been near\nzero and are likely to remain at that level for some time. Over that period, the Federal\nReserve’s balance sheet has expanded more than fourfold to over $4 trillion. Yet, in\nrecent months, we’ve seen growth in economic activity gain some additional traction,\nand the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has begun to taper its asset\npurchases. This afternoon, I would like to discuss our recent policy actions and some of\nthe issues we face. As always, I will be giving my personal perspective, which is not\nnecessarily shared by my colleagues on the FOMC or in the Federal Reserve System.\nIn a refreshing departure from the past several years, growth in economic activity in\n2013 actually did not fall short of our forecasts made at the beginning of the year. Labor\nmarkets improved substantially, and the economy is entering 2014 with much better\nmomentum. In light of this improved performance, the Federal Reserve began in\nDecember to adjust the mix of its monetary policy tools modestly. We started to taper\nour asset purchases, but we indicated that the fed funds rate would be near zero for\nquite some time — quite likely well into 2015. Barring any changes to our outlook, this\nwould translate into seven years in which short-term interest rates would be at their zero\nlower bound. But policy likely will need to remain highly accommodative for such a time\nto ensure we make adequate progress toward maximum employment and price stability\n— the two congressionally mandated goals for U.S. monetary policy.1\n1 Four times a year, participants in the FOMC submit their economic projections, including projections for\nthe future path of the federal funds rate under their assessments of appropriate monetary policy. In the\nlatest projections, published on December 18, 2013, 15 of the 17 participants anticipated that the first\nincrease in the target federal funds rate would not be warranted until 2015 or later.\n2\n\nThe deep recession, financial distress and prolonged slow recovery clearly called for\nsuch unusually accommodative monetary policy. Nonetheless, we need to be wary of\nany potential risks that might accompany the prolonged period of low interest rates.\nMost critical analysts often highlight two risks: unacceptably high inflation and financial\nexuberance that leads to instability. These are legitimate risks to consider. By my\nassessment, the risk of high inflation is fairly remote. In fact, today inflation in the U.S.\nand other advanced countries is too low, and I am concerned that inflation will run too\nlow for too long. Regarding potential financial instability risks, I think the scenarios are\nmore nuanced. But by my reading, these risks currently do not warrant altering the\nstance of monetary policy.2 In fact, altering the current trajectory of monetary policy in\norder to mitigate these risks would likely degrade progress toward achieving maximum\nemployment and price stability. If broad risks to financial stability were to become more\nprominent, the Federal Reserve has more effective tools to contain them than adjusting\ninterest rates.\nRecent Monetary Policy Actions\nIn my remarks this afternoon, I will discuss recent monetary policy actions and financial\nstability risks. Let me begin with recent economic developments and monetary policy.\nAs you all know, in response to the unusual economic circumstances generated by the\nfinancial crisis and the Great Recession, the FOMC brought down the target federal\nfunds rate, its traditional policy tool, to near-zero levels — as low as it can go — and\nhas kept it there since 2008. With the fed funds rate constrained at this lower bound and\neconomic conditions requiring additional policy accommodation, the Committee also\ndeployed nontraditional policy tools to stimulate activity: namely, large-scale purchases\nof long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, as well as\nforward guidance about how long short-term interest rates would essentially remain at\ntheir lower bound of zero.\nWhile large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance are unconventional tools, their\neffect on interest rates and real economic activity is quite conventional. Both tools are\naimed at stimulating economic activity through lower long-term rates. Through arbitrage\nand portfolio rebalancing, lower rates in one market — whether it’s the fed funds market\nor the Treasury and mortgage-backed securities markets — are transmitted to other\nrates faced by investors, nonfinancial firms and consumers, as well as across the asset\nand maturity spectrum. There is significant evidence that the FOMC’s policies have\nbeen helpful in lowering rates paid by firms and consumers and, more generally, in\nsupporting aggregate demand in the face of the substantial headwinds the economy\nhas faced over the past six years.\nMost recently, economic activity picked up momentum in the second half of 2013.\nOverall, real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at over a 3-1/2 percent rate in the\nsecond half, up from an average pace of growth of about 2 percent over the previous\n2 Recently, the FOMC conducted a survey of the participants regarding the marginal costs and marginal\nefficacy of asset purchases. Most participants judged the marginal benefits of the program to outweigh\nthe costs. The survey results are summarized in Federal Open Market Committee (2013)..\n3\n\nthree years. Moreover, we’ve seen a marked pickup in consumer spending, which\nshould provide further impetus to overall growth this year. In the labor market, job\ngrowth has been solid and the unemployment rate is down to 6.7 percent — well below\nthe 8.1 percent rate that prevailed when we instituted the latest round of large-scale\nasset purchases in September 2012.\nHowever, we aren’t out of the woods yet. Balance sheet scars from the financial crisis\nare still weighing on the economy. Fiscal policy is a restraint on economic growth. And\neconomic activity abroad is not robust. The good news is that all of these headwinds\nappear to be dissipating. But risks remain. And we still have large resource gaps — for\nexample, the unemployment rate is still well above the 5-1/4 percent rate I think it\nshould be in the long run. At the same time, inflation is only 1 percent — well below the\nFOMC’s longer-run target of 2 percent. Accordingly, monetary policy is highly\naccommodative, and needs to remain so for some time.\nGiven these developments, the FOMC adjusted the mix of its tools in December and\nlast week, but maintained the overall highly accommodative stance of policy. The\nCommittee modestly reduced the pace of its monthly asset purchases from $85 billion\nto $65 billion in two separate $10 billion steps. In addition, the FOMC strengthened its\nforward guidance on the future path of short-term interest rates by emphasizing that\nrates are likely to remain at very low levels well past the time the unemployment rate\ndeclines below the 6-1/2 percent threshold that was established in December 2012 —\nespecially if inflation is expected to run below the 2 percent target.\nNotwithstanding these modest changes to the mix of tools, monetary policy will remain\nhighly accommodative for some time. Asset purchases have expanded our balance\nsheet more than fourfold to over $4 trillion dollars. Moreover, by the time rates increase,\nthey will have been near zero for about seven years, according to the FOMC’s\nprojections and the latest market expectations. These are startling facts and certainly\nget your attention. As prudent policymakers, we would be AWOL if we failed to carefully\nassess potential risks that might arise from these unusual and extraordinary policies.\nAs the FOMC’s communications indicate, the Committee has fully reviewed the\npotential costs of its policies and assesses them regularly. I think that the benefits of our\npolicy choices continue to far outweigh the potential risks. However, we must repeatedly\nthink long and hard about two risks that are mentioned often — namely, that our\nexpanded balance sheet and prolonged period of low rates raise the risk of financial\ninstability and also the risk of producing higher inflation. What can go wrong? Do we\nhave the appropriate infrastructure and tools to adequately assess and manage the\nrisks? To address these questions, we must evaluate these risks within the context of\nthe goals of monetary policy and the current state of the economy and financial\nmarkets.\n4\n\nInflation Risks\nLet me start with the risk of high inflation. As far back as mid-2009, Fed critics warned\nthat our zero policy rate and trillions of dollars in asset purchases risk generating very\nhigh inflation. On several occasions to underscore this risk, I have been presented with\n$100 trillion Zimbabwe notes (which I can assure you are worth less than the $20 gift\nlimit we have as Federal Reserve employees). The monetary policy mandates of the\nFederal Reserve are clear: to foster monetary and financial conditions that support\nmaximum employment and price stability. Since January 2012, the Fed has set an\nexplicit goal for inflation of 2 percent, as measured by the price index for total personal\nconsumption expenditures, or PCE. So, how are we doing with respect to this 2 percent\ntarget and the risk for high inflation?\nDespite many earlier predictions of unacceptably high inflation, total PCE inflation has\nbeen hovering around just 1 percent. Other inflation measures, like the well-known\nConsumer Price Index (CPI), are also well below their related benchmarks.3\nForecasters often look at core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices,\nbecause it is a better predictor of where overall prices are headed than total inflation.\nOur progress toward the 2 percent target is not noticeably faster by this metric either.\nCore PCE inflation was just 1.2 percent over the past year and has stayed at this rate\nsince last spring. Most private sector forecasts and survey measures of inflation\nexpectations have remained well anchored and do not ring any alarms of high inflation.\nExpectations embedded in asset prices tell a similar story. Sophisticated models that\nextract inflation expectations from the yield curve4 show that investors’ inflation\nexpectations at the three-year horizon are below 2 percent and have been below 2\npercent for several years.\nAll told, the potential risk of high inflation seems very low. In fact, I am concerned that\ninflation will not pick up quickly enough. As I noted, we have been stuck at 1 percent\ninflation since early 2013, and there is little indication of a pickup in the recent data. Low\ninflation is just as economically costly as high inflation. When we set an inflation target\nof 2 percent, we need to hit our target without too much delay. Simply put, we need to\naverage 2 percent inflation over the medium term. Accordingly, the current 1 percent\ninflation situation calls for extended policy accommodation. More restrictive monetary\npolicy conditions would work to reduce inflation to further unacceptably low levels.5\nFinancial Stability and Monetary Policy\nIt is easy and most natural for a Fed policymaker to talk about inflation. Price stability is\none of the explicit goals of monetary policy as mandated by Congress. Financial stability\nrisks are more complicated. How does financial stability dovetail with the Fed’s dual\n3 Because of some differences in product coverage and statistical methodologies, total CPI inflation tends\nto average one-quarter to one-half percentage points higher than total PCE inflation. Hence, the FOMC’s\n2 percent target on total PCE inflation would translate to a 2.3 percent to 2.5 percent target for total CPI\ninflation.\n4 The yield curve is the line plotting the interest rates of assets of the same credit quality but with differing\nmaturity dates at a certain point in time.\n5 I recently discussed the costs of too-low inflation and the implications of having a 2 percent inflation\ntarget in a January 15 speech; see Evans (2014).\n5\n\nmandate? There is clearly an interdependent relationship between them. A strong and\nrobust economy with low inflation provides a key stabilizing force for beneficial credit\nintermediation and robust financial markets. At the same time, stable and well-\nfunctioning financial markets are essential for achieving maximum employment and\nprice stability. Our global experience since 2008 reinforces this critical interplay between\nmonetary and financial conditions.\nHowever, beyond these basic principles, what is the appropriate monetary policy stance\nfor achieving both financial stability and the dual mandate?\nWith inflation running well below our 2 percent long-run target and the unemployment\nrate still well above its long-term normal level, appropriate monetary policy dictates that\nlow real interest rates should prevail until the economy is further along a sustainable\npath to its potential level. This assertion is made from a mainstream macroeconomic\nperspective. Nonetheless, it is common to hear the argument that these highly\naccommodative monetary policies might sow the seeds of financial instability.\nThe fear is that excessive and persistently low interest rates would lead to excessive\nrisk-taking by some investors. For instance, some firms, such as life insurance\ncompanies and pension funds, are under pressure to meet a stream of fixed liabilities\nincurred when interest rates were higher.6 (And perhaps these liabilities were offered at\nsomewhat generous terms to begin with.) To meet commitments like these in the\ncurrent low interest rate environment, the incentive exists to reach for yield by investing\nin excessively risky assets. Furthermore, with the costs of borrowing at historically low\nlevels, other investors might simply decide that this is a good time to cheaply amplify the\nrisk and return in their portfolios by taking on more leverage.\nSo, one could reach the conclusion that historically low and stable interest rates pose a\nthreat to financial stability. This creates a seeming paradox for policymakers. The\nexisting large shortfalls in aggregate demand call for highly accommodative monetary\npolicies and historically low interest rates. Yet, such policies have the potential to raise\nthe likelihood of financial instability in the future.\nSo, the questions that I’m often asked regarding these matters are as follows: Do the\nregulators and the Fed have adequate safeguards in place to mitigate this potential\nfinancial risk? If not, should the FOMC step away from what we thought was the best\nmonetary policy with respect to our dual mandate? Should we discard our\nnonconventional tools and raise the fed funds rate in order to reduce the possibility of\nundesirable financial imbalances in the future?\nI don’t believe that such monetary policy adjustment is the right approach. I think the\ninference that persistently low interest rates pose a danger to financial stability is based\non a narrow view of the economy and is unlikely to survive a broader analysis that takes\n6 I should note that increases in interest rates since last spring have increased discount factors and thus\nlowered the present value of pension fund and other fixed nominal liabilities. For instance, see Fitch\nRatings (2013).\n6\n\ninto account all the interactions between financial markets and real economic activity. If\nmore restrictive monetary policies were pursued to generate higher interest rates, they\nwould likely result in higher unemployment and a sharp decline in asset prices, choking\nthe moderate recovery. Such an adverse economic outcome is unlikely to set a\nfavorable foundation for financial stability. Moreover, our short-term interest rate tools\nare too blunt to have a significant effect on those pockets of the financial system prone\nto inappropriate risk-taking without, at the same time, significantly damaging other\nmarkets, as well as the growth prospects for the economy as a whole. Therefore,\nstepping away from otherwise appropriate monetary policy to address potential financial\nstability risks would degrade progress toward maximum employment and price stability.\nThis approach would be a particularly poor choice when other tools are available, at\nlower social costs, to address financial stability risks.\nLet me be clear. I am not saying that financial stability concerns are not relevant for the\neconomy or that policymakers should not take decisive action against developments\nthat threaten financial stability. Rather, I am saying that the macroprudential tools\navailable to policymakers are better-suited safeguards to addressing financial risks\ndirectly. These macroprudential actions can be dialed up or down given the appropriate\nsetting of monetary policy tools, so undesirable macroeconomic outcomes are less\nlikely than if we were to resort to premature monetary tightening. After all, any decision\nto rely on more-restrictive interest rate policies to achieve financial stability at the\nexpense of poorer macroeconomic outcomes must pass a cost–benefit test. Such a test\nshould clearly illustrate that the economic outcomes from more-restrictive interest rate\npolicies — which could include much higher unemployment and even lower inflation\nthan at present — would be better and more acceptable to society than the outcomes\nthat can be achieved by using enhanced supervisory tools alone to address financial\nstability risks.\nMacroprudential Tools\nLet’s discuss some of these macroprudential tools.\nOne simple but important tool is enhanced monitoring. Even before the recent financial\ncrisis, central bankers were well aware of the key role played by stable financial markets\nin economic activity. Since the crisis, however, the analysis of financial stability issues\nhas been greatly expanded and given a more prominent role in the FOMC’s\ndeliberations. We comb through reams of data looking for evidence of incipient risks to\nfinancial stability.\nThe Federal Reserve also has revamped its approach to bank supervision substantially\nto expand the focus on macrofinancial risk. Traditional bank supervisory tools are being\nused more intensively, and new tools have been developed. Bank capital stress tests\nare one well-known addition to our supervisory toolkit. Another is the augmentation of\ntraditional microprudential supervisory efforts that analyze individual institutions with a\nwide-angle view of the banking industry. Supervisors look to identify common trends\nacross institutions and emerging concentrations of risks that might pose systemic\nthreats to the financial system. This broad view also allows supervisors to better identify\n7\n\nsound practices among firms and incorporate them into supervisory reviews and the\nfeedback provided in them.\nThe Federal Reserve has greatly expanded its surveillance efforts to financial markets\noutside of the traditional banking sector, such as the insurance industry and the\nfinancial market utilities. These more intense monitoring efforts are not confined to\nfinancial institutions per se, and reach a range of activities that might pose a potential\nthreat to financial stability. For instance, staff members from the Chicago Fed are\nactively engaged in assessing the role of high-frequency computerized trading in\nsecurities and derivatives markets and issues that arise associated with it.\nThese are just a few examples of regulatory tools available to monitor and promote\nfinancial stability. And there are a host of other instruments in our toolkit, such as\nresolution plans, liquidity requirements and single counterparty credit limits. All are\nexamples of improvements in supervisory practices aimed at reducing the likelihood of\nsystemic disruptions and containing the impact should such disruptions occur.\nConclusion\nLet me reiterate that I currently expect that low inflation and still-high unemployment will\nmean that the short-term policy rate will remain near zero well into 2015. In this\nenvironment, some have questioned the ability of these supervisory and regulatory tools\nto adequately address potential financial stability risks, arguing that a broad interest-rate\npolicy might be more effective in catching incipient risks that might fall through the\ncracks. It is certainly true that higher interest rates would permeate the entire financial\nsystem. But this is just another way of saying that raising interest rates is a blunt tool.\nHigher interest rates would reduce risk-taking where it is excessive; but they also would\nresult in a pullback in economic activity in sectors where risk-taking might already be\noverly restrained. That’s how a blunt tool works.\nIf you believe that financial stability can only be achieved through higher interest rates\n— interest rates that would do immediate damage to meeting our dual mandate goals at\na time when unemployment is still unacceptably high — then we ought to at least ask\nourselves if the financial system has become too big and too complex. This conclusion\nis particularly vexing if supervisory, macroprudential and market-discipline tools are\ninadequate. If the only way we can achieve financial stability is to raise interest rates\nabove where the forces of demand and supply in the real economy put them, then the\ncost–benefit calculus of our policy choices becomes much more complex. The possible\nbenefit of such a restrictive rate move would be to reduce risks that might potentially be\nforming in the nooks and crannies of a highly complex financial system. But the cost\nwould be higher unemployment; a risk of choking off the economic recovery; even lower\ninflation below our objective; and, somewhat paradoxically, the introduction of new\nfinancial risks by reducing asset values and credit quality. When weighing the costs and\nbenefits of alternative policy actions under these circumstances, I would have to\nquestion whether the financial system has become too complex — perhaps complex\nenough to generate negative marginal social value. Rather than degrading our\nmacroeconomic performance through suboptimal monetary policies, I also would have\n8\n\nto consider whether we should contemplate big changes to the financial system — a lot\nmore rules, substantially higher capital requirements for all institutions and maybe even\nfewer financial products.\nHowever, I have a more favorable view of the social value of our financial system and\nthe efficacy of supervision and regulation. Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve\nhas expanded its macroprudential toolkit and enhanced its microprudential tools. We\nhave also reoriented our approach to supervision to take full advantage of the Federal\nReserve System staff’s wide-ranging expertise on macroeconomic and financial\ndevelopments and risks. I believe that these regulatory efforts can effectively minimize\nthe risks of another crisis and increase the resiliency of the financial system. We can\nachieve these objectives without having to resort to wholesale changes to the financial\nsystem and without degrading our monetary policy goals. Maintaining the effectiveness\nof the financial system for generating stronger and more robust economic growth\ncontinues to be a crucial objective for public policy. Thank you for your time, and I would\nbe happy to take your questions.\nReferences\nEvans, Charles, 2014, “Recurring themes for the new year,” speech at the Corridor\nEconomic Forecast Luncheon, Coralville, IA, January 15, available at\nhttp://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/speeches/2014/01_15_14_themes_n\new_year.cfm.\nFederal Open Market Committee, 2013, meeting minutes, December 17–18, available\nat http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20131218.htm.\nFitch Ratings, 2013, “Fitch: U.S. corporate pension plans underfunded status improves,”\npress release, New York, August 15, available at\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/detail.cfm?pr_id=799535.\n9",

Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nFEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\nInforming the Future of Housing Finance: Lessons from the Recent Past\nCharles L. Evans\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago\nIt’s a pleasure to be here this morning. Since the start of the financial crisis, the Federal\nReserve System has undertaken a series of unprecedented actions to help stabilize the\nfinancial markets and promote economic recovery. What is less well known is that the\nFederal Reserve has also been working to respond to the foreclosure crisis on Main\nStreet, leveraging its research, community affairs and supervision and regulation\nfunctions to support innovative foreclosure prevention and neighborhood stabilization\nstrategies at the local level. Today, I want to focus my remarks on some of those efforts\nas well as on other public policies that have been used to address the foreclosure crisis.\nFinally, I’d like to offer a few thoughts on policy alternatives that may prevent similar\nproblems from occurring in the future.\nAs a nation we value homeownership because of the many benefits it brings, for both\nfamilies and communities.1 Perhaps foremost is its potential for building household\nwealth. In addition, communities with high levels of homeownership tend to have greater\ninvolvement in school and civic organizations, higher graduation rates, lower housing\nturnover and higher home values. Simply stated, homeowners tend to put down deeper\nroots, and that is good for communities as well as families.\nRecognition of these benefits has made encouraging homeownership a national priority.\nTax incentives, FHA mortgage insurance and sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie\nMac all contributed to a long rise in U.S. homeownership—from 45 percent in 1940 to a\npeak of 69 percent in 2004.\nOf course, homeownership is only good for families and communities if it can be\nsustained. Home purchases that are very highly leveraged or unaffordable subject the\nborrower to a great deal of risk. There’s no guarantee, as we’ve learned recently, that\nprices have to rise. Moreover, even in a strong economy, unforeseen life events and\nrisks in local real estate markets represent vulnerabilities for highly leveraged\nborrowers.\nThus it was very destructive when, in the early part of this decade, dubious underwriting\npractices and mortgage products inappropriate for mass consumption became more\ncommon. It is difficult to understand how loose underwriting, high degrees of leverage\nand the broad marketing of exotic and often very high-cost mortgage products can\npromote homeownership. In fact, these practices actually took us in the other direction,\nas homeownership began to decline even while mortgage underwriting standards\ncontinued to loosen. Moreover, partly as a result of these practices, we’ve seen an\n2\n\nunprecedented housing market collapse that contributed to a very deep recession\nmarked by many lost jobs. And now homeownership has declined for six straight years.\nAlthough there are some encouraging signs of general economic recovery and some\nevidence of home price stabilization, we are certainly not out of the woods. Projections\nsuggest foreclosed housing units could reach as high as 3 million in 2010 with over a\nmillion lender repossessions. Mortgage distress is not limited to those with subprime\nloans. For example, in the state of Indiana, the inventory of subprime foreclosures\nactually decreased by about 4 percent from 2008 to 2009, while the inventory of prime\nforeclosures rose by over 36 percent. This is because job loss and unemployment are\nnow causing more defaults than imprudent lending.\nPublic policy response to the housing market collapse has become increasingly\naggressive as its seriousness and difficulty has been more fully recognized.\nForeclosures are very costly for borrowers, lenders and communities. Prices of\nforeclosed homes often drop dramatically, implying big losses for lenders. Values of\nnearby homes are also affected, so large clusters of foreclosures can be devastating to\ncommunities.\nOne might expect lenders to modify mortgages, making them more affordable for\nborrowers, rather than accept large losses on foreclosed properties. However, the\nsecuritization process appears to have created conflicts between the interests of\nservicers and lenders. These and other impediments have kept the number of\nmodifications lower than we might have hoped. The desire to see more modifications\nand fewer foreclosures has led to federal efforts, such as the Home Affordable\nMortgage Program, or HAMP. To date, the number of successful modifications remains\nrelatively small compared with the scale of the problem. Thus the search for solutions\ngoes on. Some recent additions to HAMP include assistance for unemployed\nhomeowners, more principal write-downs and plans to launch the FHA Refinance\nOption later this year. While the number of loan modifications are small compared with\nthe number of foreclosures, one success the industry cites is that the programs have\nbrought some standardization and consistency to the market.\nIn addition to federal interventions, many local and state agencies, as well as local\npractitioners have worked to lessen the effects of the crisis. They have pursued\nstrategies ranging from land banking to court prescribed mediation between borrowers\nand lenders. The Chicago Fed has been very happy to partner with other organizations\nin many of these efforts, lending its resources to assist throughout the Seventh Federal\nReserve District.\nWe’ve convened meetings of the key groups working toward mitigating the effects of the\ncrisis. We have participated in research efforts to identify gaps in resources needed for\nforeclosure mitigation. And we’ve formed work groups to bring resources to the hardest\nhit areas. Home buyer counseling is a critical need in hard-hit areas, and we’ve helped\nmany of our community development partners to organize daylong “mega-events” that\nhave served thousands of troubled borrowers. Moreover, we’ve partnered with and\n3\n\nbrought together housing advocates, lenders, academics and key government officials\nto discuss foreclosure issues and develop solutions. In some cases, alliances have\nbeen formed right on the spot to create and implement programs to keep people in their\nhomes.\nHere in Indiana, the Chicago Fed has had a long-standing working relationship with the\nIndianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership (INHP) on affordable housing and\nhomeownership preservation issues. We’ve also worked with others throughout Indiana,\nsuch as the Mortgage Fraud and Foreclosure Task Force, the Indiana Mortgage\nBankers Association and the Indiana Foreclosure Prevention Network. We regularly\nparticipate in homeownership preservation seminars, which provide delinquent\nborrowers with access to their mortgage lenders for the purpose of finding options for\nstaying in their homes. And, as job loss has become a leading cause of foreclosures,\nwe’ve been working with a number of organizations in Indiana to help promote\nemployment in local communities.\nIt’s easy to be discouraged about the outcomes of efforts to deal with the mortgage\ncrisis. While we can point to efforts that have saved thousands of homeowners from\nforeclosures, millions are still losing their homes. But, while we could always hope for\nmore, I think the groups like INHP that have worked on this very difficult problem have a\nlot to be proud of.\nI’d now like to talk briefly about the question of what can be done to prevent problems\nlike this from recurring in the future—a topic that I think is informed by some recent\nresearch done at the Chicago Fed, including on a paper on a program run by INHP. The\nmortgage crisis was caused in part by the use of inappropriate mortgage products.\nWhile economists usually give great respect to individual choice, in this case it seems\nthat many borrowers made poor choices and that at least some lenders abetted those\npoor choices. People who had no business getting exotic mortgages, such as those\nwithout amortization, not only got them, but got them without having their income and\nability to pay verified.\nHow might public policy respond to evidence of people being put into inappropriate\nnonstandard mortgage products?2 One possibility would be to impose very stringent\nregulatory oversight that eliminates such products all together. Such a policy would\ncertainly prevent unqualified borrowers from obtaining high-risk mortgage products.\nHowever, such specialized products may actually be appropriate for certain people, so\nsuch a policy would have some real costs.\nAn alternative approach would be to place few restrictions on the choices available to\nborrowers and rely instead on better educating them about homeownership and\nmortgages. That would make borrowers better prepared to make informed financial\ndecisions. Such an approach might keep those who shouldn’t be in exotic mortgages\nfrom getting them while leaving such mortgages available to the small group of people\nfor whom they are appropriate. A big question, however, is whether financial education\ncan work.\n4\n\nStaff members at the Chicago Fed have recently undertaken a thorough review of\nstudies evaluating the effects of financial education.3 What they find is that the evidence\non the effectiveness of education and counseling is rather mixed. Some financial\neducation programs improve financial outcomes, and some portion of this effect is due\nto increased financial literacy. However, other programs are less successful. More\nrigorous evaluation of specific programs is necessary to understand what can be done.\nMy take is that financial education can work, but the programs must be very well\ndesigned and rigorous for financial education to be truly effective. Whether such\nprograms can be implemented on a wide scale at reasonable costs is an open question.\nOne of the programs our staff evaluated was that of the INHP.4 As many of you know,\nthe INHP program serves low- and moderate-income households, on a strictly voluntary\nbasis. The goal is to prepare borrowers for homeownership by shoring up their finances.\nClasses and one-on-one counseling sessions cover money management, budgeting,\ncredit score maintenance and home buying mechanics.\nThe program can take up to two years, and clients are considered successful if they are\nable to satisfy underwriting guidelines of external lending partners or the INHP lending\ncommittee. The program has strict requirements, and clients that cannot keep up may\nbe asked to leave. Importantly, INHP continues to work with the client after the home\npurchase and is actively involved with the client if problems occur.\nPrevious research showed that INHP clients improved their credit scores during\ncounseling, better preparing them for the mortgage application process.5 Our\nresearchers evaluated whether this translated into better loan performance. The answer\nappears to be that it did. Compared with other borrowers, INHP clients on average\nstarted with significantly lower FICO scores and incomes. They also typically had lower\ndown payments. Yet, despite entering the mortgage process in worse financial shape\nrelative to other borrowers, INHP clients had a lower default rate over a 12-month\nperiod—they had a rate of 3.8 percent versus 6.3 percent for other borrowers.\nImportantly, after controlling for an array of additional influences, the difference between\nthe default rates of the two groups appears even stronger—the 12-month default rate\nwas typically 8–9 percentage points lower for INHP clients than for comparable\nborrowers not participating in the program. This is impressive and I want to recognize\nthe INHP for its efforts.\nThat said, the success of counseling is certainly not guaranteed. Our researchers also\nevaluated the effects of a mandatory counseling program introduced in Chicago as a\nresult of a controversial piece of legislation called Illinois House Bill 4050.6 This law\ngrew out of concerns that predatory lenders were taking advantage of naïve, less\nsophisticated borrowers in certain markets. It required low FICO score applicants or\nthose taking out nontraditional, high-risk mortgages in certain zip codes to go through a\nbrief counseling session with a HUD-accredited counselor prior to the contract closing.\nThe purpose was to discuss the contract terms and whether the loan product was a\ngood fit for the mortgage applicant. This session typically occurred a few days prior to\n5\n\nthe closing. Our researchers found that such counseling had little effect. This is perhaps\nunsurprising given its extent and when it took place. Increasing participants’ financial\nsophistication is not easy.\nThe ineffectiveness of the program’s counseling did not, however, mean this program\nhad no impact. In fact, our researchers found that the introduction of the mandatory\ncounseling program significantly changed the behavior and performance of borrowers.\nSpecifically, fewer high-risk loans were originated because some lenders, concerned\nabout having their mortgage terms scrutinized by counselors and being accused of\npredatory lending, chose to exit the market. Additionally, borrowers were able to avoid\nthe counseling sessions by taking alternative mortgage products that did not require\nfinancial counseling. While one can argue that this decrease in the supply of mortgages\nhad a downside in terms of decreasing borrowers’ choices, the analysis found that the\nborrowers who were able to obtain mortgages performed significantly better than similar\napplicants in zip codes without the counseling requirement.\nThese two programs each affected the performance of loans, but they did so in quite\ndifferent ways. In the case of INHP, the counseling apparently affected the behavior of\npotential borrowers and helped applicants better perform on their mortgage\narrangements. In the Chicago program, a positive impact resulted from some lenders\navoiding the new environment and borrowers choosing products that did not require\ncounseling.\nThese findings fit quite well with the principles of a relatively new school of thought\nknown as behavioral economics, which recognizes that people frequently make\nsubstantial mistakes in their economic decisions. In fact, these mistakes are so\nsystematic that it is possible to alleviate many of their worst consequences by\nmarginally adjusting the context in which the decisions are made. The costs resulting\nfrom the adjustment may be relatively minor and less costly, for example, than the\nconsequences of prohibiting certain products altogether. In mortgage markets,\nprohibitions of products intended to “protect” borrowers could result in significant\nreductions in the availability of credit. This could prove costly as it would preclude some\nqualified customers from obtaining higher-risk mortgage products that they readily\nunderstand and can repay.\nAdditionally, behaviorists would argue that mass-scale counseling to promote informed\nfinancial decision-making may be very difficult and costly. A behaviorist’s approach\nwould be to give consumers choices, but to incent them to make what policymakers\nwould consider most likely the proper choice more frequently. For example, in the\naffected Chicago markets, the borrowers were free to choose among alternative product\nofferings, but had to participate in the counseling program if they took out a high-risk\nmortgage product. Thus this relatively low-cost incentive to avoid the high-risk product\nwas quite effective at “nudging” borrowers toward the low-risk product option—usually\nthe “proper choice” from a public policy perspective. We may look to behavioral\neconomics more often as we evaluate new policy options aimed at avoiding the\nmortgage market problems we have seen in the recent past.\n6\n\nIn summary, I’ve discussed the public policy response, including the role of the Federal\nReserve Bank of Chicago, as the housing market crisis has evolved. I have also\ndiscussed the means to protect against future foreclosure problems by better preparing\nloan applicants for the homeownership process. While financial education and\ncounseling can be effective in generating more knowledgeable homeowners, they must\nbe administered in a way that is timely and appropriate for both the borrower and the\nlender. Obviously, effective programs require significant time and effort if they are to\nresult in significant changes in behavior and financial performance. Alternative\napproaches that attach small costs to choices that are likely to be risky are, I think, also\nwell worth considering. At the Fed, we will continue to do our part to encourage further\nresearch, participate in the dialogue and coordinate concerned groups that want to work\ntoward sustainable housing markets, whatever form they may take.\nThank you.\n1 See, for example, Daniel Aaronson, 2000, “A note on the benefits of homeownership,” Journal of Urban\nEconomics, Vol. 47, No. 3, May, pp. 356–369; Robert D.
